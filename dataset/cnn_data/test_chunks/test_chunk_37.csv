"A man has appeared in court charged with murdering Irish student Karen Buckley. Alexander Pacteau, 21, allegedly killed the nursing student, whose disappearance sparked a huge police search earlier this week. He is also charged with attempting to defeat the ends of justice, it emerged at a private court appearance today at Glasgow Sheriff Court. A man has been charged with murder after the body of nursing student Karen Buckley was found this week . A security van arrives at Glasgow Sheriff Court ahead of a court appearance by Alexander Pacteau, the 21-year-old charged with Miss Buckley's murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice . Pacteau, from the city's west end, made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody by sheriff Charles McFarlane QC. He will appear again next week for a full committal hearing. Miss Buckley, a qualified nurse, went missing following a night out at the Sanctuary nightclub in Glasgow on Saturday night. Her body was later found by police at a farm six miles north of the city. A spokesman for Scotland's Crown Office said: 'Alexander Pacteau, 21, from Glasgow, appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court today charged with the murder of Karen Buckley, and with attempting to defeat the ends of justice. 'He made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody. It is anticipated he will appear again next week for a further hearing. 'It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage in proceedings.' Pacteau made no plea at the court (pictured) today and was remanded in custody until next week . Miss Buckley's body was found on a farm six miles north of her home in the city earlier this week . A huge police search was launched after her disappearance, which ended at High Craigton farm . Friends of Miss Buckley raised the alarm on Sunday morning when she failed to return from a night out at the nightclub. The search led police to Dawsholm Park, where Miss Buckley's handbag was found on Tuesday, and a nearby property, before the farm where the discovery was made. Ms Buckley moved to Scotland in February and was a first-year occupational therapy student at Glasgow Caledonian University. Her family, who travelled to Scotland on Tuesday, have said they are 'absolutely heartbroken'. Her father, John Buckley, 62, said she was an outgoing girl who 'thoroughly enjoyed life'. He released a statement through Police Scotland yesterday which read: 'Marian and I, together with our sons Brendan, Kieran, and Damian, are absolutely heartbroken. 'Karen was our only daughter, cherished by her family and loved by her friends. 'She was an outgoing girl who travelled the world, where she met lots of people and thoroughly enjoyed her life. We will miss her terribly.' Miss Buckley, pictured with her brothers Brendan, Damien and Kieran, has been described as an 'outgoing girl' who was always 'smiling' Miss Buckley (pictured left on the night of her disappearance) only moved to Glasgow two months ago . Her parents, John and Marian, say they are 'absolutely heartbroken' at the death of their 'cherished' daughter . Flowers, cards and pictures have been left at the entrance to the farm and at Glasgow Caledonian University in tribute to Miss Buckley. A vigil will be held in George Square in Glasgow city centre this evening to show support for the family and friends of the student, who was from Cork in the Irish Republic. People are being encouraged to bring flowers and candles to the event. The outpouring of support for the family has also raised £50,000 in an online drive organised by her former classmates at Limerick University. The Go Fund Me page was set up to cover the family's travel and expenses while in Scotland and to support the upkeep of their farm in Cork. It raised more than 10 times the original target amount.

"Online blogging sensation Zoella has come under fire from Jamie Oliver's company over adverts for unhealthy foods that appear next to her vlogs on YouTube. Internet star Zoella, real name Zoe Elizabeth Sugg, has enjoyed meteoric success after her blog and video posts amassed a huge teen following on social media. Jamie Oliver's company, an enduring advocate for promoting healthy eating, has warned that young stars such as Zoella, 25, and fellow vlogger and boyfriend Alfie Deyes, 21, should be more aware of the adverts that appear alongside their posts. Wise words: Jamie Oliver's company has said that influential vloggers such as Zoella (right) should try and ensure adverts for unhealthy foods don't appear next to their posts . It comes after an investigation found that video blogs - known as vlogs – popular with children aged 11 to 17 are being hijacked by 30-second adverts for junk food and online gambling sites. Although some of these are for harmless products such as Dolmio pasta sauce or hair dye, others are for Haribo, Coca-Cola and for an online gambling website, according to the Independent newspaper. Oliver's own company says it has a deal with YouTube that ensures that the chef's channel on the video sharing website actively stops sugary food and drinks from being promoted next to his videos. On Sunday, Brighton-based Zoella posted a video entitled 'Stuff Your Mouth' with ThatcherJoe (My Brother). The video showed the star and her sibling trying to guess what each other was saying while filling their mouth with marshmallows. The post has already attracted over 1.5million views. The video blogger describes herself on her Twitter profile as 'YouTuber, Blogger, Friend & Pizza Addict'. Last year, she published her book Girl Online, which recorded record sales for a first-time author. On the back of her social media success, Zoella has also created her own beauty line. Her boyfriend has achieved similar success with more than three million subscribers signing up to his YouTube channel. The couple share a £1million Brighton home. Although the Advertising Standard Authority (ASA) currently prevents food that is high in fat, salt or sugar from being advertised on television shows that appeal to children under 16, there are no guidelines about video bloggers, despite their growing influence. Matt Wilson, spokesman for the ASA told FEMAIL that while 'television-like content' posted on YouTube was not yet subject to the same guidelines, the ASA was 'keeping an eye on the situation'. He said: 'A recently commissioned Independent Review into the impact of online advertising of food and soft drink products on children showed that the available evidence on advertising’s impact on children’s dietary choices is limited, and does not merit a change to the existing rules.' 'Where the TV and online rules differ is on scheduling. As the available evidence shows, media differ; with TV having the most persuasive, albeit a moderate, impact on children’s food preferences. 'This is why there are currently scheduling restrictions on TV (for foods that are classed as ‘high in fat salt or sugar’) that don’t apply online and to other non-broadcast media.' Star couple: The young web-savvy entrepreneurs can count a beauty line and several books between them but should they be more conscious of what they're promoting to their young audience . Zoella's boyfriend, Alfie Deyes, a hugely successful blogger in his own right featured Jamie Oliver on a vlogging post last year. Ads for McDonalds and Coca Cola ran alongside the footage . A virtual career has brought bricks and mortar: Zoella splashed out £1million for her first house last year. The luxury property is in the seaside town of Brighton . The vloggers are unlikely to have control over which adverts appear next to their posts although Oliver's company is suggesting that such influential stars should be proactive in requesting that certain brands, such as Haribo and Coca Cola, do not appear. When Jamie Oliver appeared alongside Alfie Deyes, who is dating Zoella, ads for McDonald's and Coca-Cola appeared. A representative from the chef's company told the ipaper that while they couldn't control what appeared on others' channels, they did have a 'firm agreement' with YouTube about what could appear on Oliver's own Food Tube channel. FEMAIL has contacted Zoella for a comment. Professor Jason Halford, a health behaviour expert at the University of Liverpool, said: ‘Advertising does affect children in terms of what they purchase and reinforcing the brand. ‘But even beyond brand, our research has found it makes them grab the nearest sugary thing around, irrespective of their appetite.’ The couple aren't the only ones to feel the wrath of the Naked Chef in recent weeks. While at his Ministry of Food cookery school in Sydney, Australia, Oliver was drawn on his ongoing feud with Gordon Ramsay and couldn't resist stoking the embers. Oliver said of his one-time friend: 'He's just a ranter, he's paid to rant. He's paid to shower negativity and all his proteges don't talk to him because he's like that and it's a shame.' He added: 'To be honest, I'm annoyed that I said anything because I did bite for a few years and it felt quite good but I don't think it's very responsible of me to take the p*** again because I don't want his kids to get upset because I'm slagging off their dad.'","The chef and healthy food campaigner's company said influential stars should be careful about adverts appearing next to their video posts .
Jamie Oliver's Food Tube channel has a 'firm agreement' with YouTube to stop ads for unhealthy foods running next to his own posts .
The Advertising Standards Authority currently doesn't safeguard against unhealthy ads appearing on online videos, just television programmes ."
"Muslim Engagement and Development have reportedly claimed they can influence up to 30 seats at the General election. Pictured Sufyan Ismail . A Muslim group with links to extremists has claimed it can influence up to 30 seats at the election, it has been reported. Muslim Engagement and Development (Mend) was said to have boasted that they can act as 'kingmakers' when the country goes to the polls. The group, which wants to let British Muslims fight in Syria without fear of prosecution, has bragged that it is in talks with both the Conservatives and Labour, according to the Daily Telegraph. At least one election candidate is said to have been approached by a high-profile Muslim and offered campaign money in return for back the group's 'Muslim Manifesto,' the newspaper reported. Sufyan Ismail, Mend's chief executive, was said to have claimed to be able to influence up to 30 seats during a talk at the Zakariyya Central Mosque in Bolton. 'Right now, we are negotiating with the Labour leadership, we are negotiating with the Tory leadership and insh'allah [God willing] will start with the Lib Dem leadership as well, where we have a list of manifesto pledges,' he reportedly said, according to the Telegraph. 'The Muslim vote is worth ten ordinary votes because… we are heavily concentrated in a few areas,' he said. 'Anybody who can give any one party 10, 20, 30 seats, like we can, they have to listen to you.' The group's 48 page manifesto does not make mention of wanting to let British Muslims fight in Syria. Azad Ali, who has supported the killing of British soldiers, is Mend's director of engagement. It is also reportedly linked to extremist Abu Eesa Niamatullah and promotes hate preacher Haitham al-Haddad. The Labour Party reportedly denied the claims that it was negotiating with Mend, according to the Telegraph. The Conservatives have been contacted by the MailOnline for comment.

"Georgia high school basketball coach Greg Scott hadn't been feeling well lately, so on Monday he went to his doctor where he was shocked to discover he had leukemia. Less than 24 hours after the devastating diagnosis, the 51-year-old married father of two and grandfather unexpectedly succumbed to the deadly disease. For the past eight years, Scott had taught special education and social studies at Cass High School and was the school's head basketball coach. Sudden death: Less than 24 hours after Georgia high school basketball coach Greg Scott (left) was diagnosed with leukemia, he succumbed to the illness . Mentor: For the past eight years, Scott (pictured right with his son) had taught special education and social studies at Cass High School and was the school's head basketball coach . Towering figure: The teacher and sports coach was universally remembered as a deeply caring, wise man who was committed to his students and players . But those who knew him, including his colleagues and players, say there was much more to Scott than his love of sports. False hope: Initially, Scott (pictured with daughter Cieanna) and his family were told that his leukemia was treatable . Greg Scott, 51, a basketball coach at Cass High School in Georgia, likely had contracted a fast-moving type of leukemia, known as acute myeloid leukemia, months before his death but was diagnosed only a day before he lost his brief battle with the illness. Leukemia is a type of cancer that starts in cells that form new blood cells. These cells are found in the soft, inner part of the bones called the bone marrow. In patients who suffers from AML, the cancer grows quickly, and if not treated, could be fatal in a matter of months. With acute types of leukemia such as AML, bone marrow cells do not mature the way they're supposed to. These immature cells, called blast cells, just keep building up. Because it is ‘acute,’ this type of leukemia can spread quickly to the blood and to other parts of the body such as lymph nodes; liver; spleen; brain and spinal cord, as well as testicles in men. This type of cancer is considered rare and has a five-year survival rate of only 24 per cent. AML can be treated with radiation, chemotherapy stem cell transplant, but like with other types of cancer, early detection is key. ‘He was more about teaching kids how to be good people,’ Principal Mike Nelson told Atlanta Journal Constitution. ‘He wasn’t worried about winning or losses.’ A spokeswoman for the Bartow County Schools said Scott had fallen ill a few weeks ago and was diagnosed with pneumonia. After a week off for Spring Break, the coach returned to work Monday but still was not feeling well. The 51-year-old school staffer took a sick day and sought medical treatment. Tests showed that the father of two had leukemia - a potentially terminal cancer of the blood. He was taken to Northside Hospital that day, where he suddenly passed away Wednesday morning. Coach Scott was described in glowing terms as an active member of the Cass High School community who was always willing to lend his colleagues a helping hand. Bobby Hughes, Cass' head football coach and longtime friend of Scott’s, said his unexpected passing devastated the entire school. Scott’s former player and assistant coach Drew McKaig told The Daily Tribune News the 51-year-old had made an enormous impact on the lives of students and colleagues alike. ‘He would talk to them. He would encourage people and pick them up,’ McKaig said. ‘Just him being a mentor to me and always talking to me, the one thing he always emphasized was not only wins and basketball games.’ The young assistant coach said that when Scott was transferred to the hospital Tuesday, he went to visit him. He remembered that the cancer-stricken man seemed determined to beat the disease. ‘He kept saying, “All I can do is fight it,”’ McKaig recalled. Initially, Scott and his family were told that his leukemia was treatable, but the reality turned out to be much bleaker. ‘He fought, but you can’t win every game,’ McKaig said. ‘You can’t win every battle.’ Following his passing Wednesday morning, Scott’s heartbroken players and students took to social media to mourn their loss. Junior Mike Sims wrote: ‘Coach Scott was like a father figure to me ... you will be missed I promise.’ Loving father: The 51-year-old leaves behind his wife, daughter Cieanna (left) and son Trey (right) Family man: The married father of two got to enjoy a few years with his young grandson, Luke Sisk (far right)","Cass High School head basketball coach Greg Scott, 51, lost his short battle with leukemia Wednesday .

"At two kilometres in circumference and protected by an imposing 12-metre wall, the Ming Dynasty's 'Martial City' had a reputation that struck fear into opposing armies. So much so that battle plans would be drawn up to specifically give the castle at Zhangjiakou, in China's northern Hebei province, a wide berth. Now archaeologists have begun a daunting project to restore the once-mighty site to something approaching it previous glory, in particular the dilapidated outer wall that repelled every attack which invading Mongolian armies could throw at it. Among the works being carried out at Wanquan Castle is the restoration of the fortress' dilapidated outer wall . Workers restore the southern barbican entrance to Wanquan Castle, which was known as the Ming Dynasty's 'Martial City' The fortress was built in 1393 and managed to repel all attacks by the invading Mongolian armies . The fortress measures some two kilometres in circumference and was protected by an imposing 12-metre wall . The restoration of the fortress - which was given the coveted title of 'Wucheng' or 'Martial City' after its construction in 1393 - will see building work completed in the original Ming Dynasty style of architecture, reports People's Daily Online. The project will see the restoration of the Ming and Qing era commercial districts, the Great Wall Martial Museum, the Golden Harvest Academy and performance theatres as well as the opening of the Red Tourist Route, with all work planned to be complete in 2016. The restoration work will also include the ongoing protection of surviving structures. The castle in Wanquan county - known in China as a 'living fossil of the Ming military system' - was built in 1393 but is relatively well-preserved, especially the interior city area which includes the residences of generals and wealthy merchants. The fortress has huge historical, cultural and military significance and has key cultural relic status in China. While much of the interior city is in good condition, the outer wall is somewhat dilapidated and will be the focus of much of the work . The restoration work, which is due to be completed next year, will where possible be carried out in the style of Ming Dynasty architecture . The Ming Dynasty ruled China for 276 years, between the years 1368 and 1644, and is often described as the last of the great Chinese dynasties. During the era large scale architectural and civil engineering projects were created or expanded, including the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canal and the Forbidden City, located in Beijing. It took 15 years to build, using more than one million workers, and has almost 1,000 buildings. Art flourished during the Ming Dynasty, which saw an explosion of literature, painting, poetry, music and porcelain - with Ming vases and plates valuable collector items to this day. Following popular uprising and rebellions across China, the Chinese army was defeated and the Ming Dynasty collapsed when its last emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City, in 1644.

"He's known as living in one of the most exclusive postcodes in London, and enjoying the best bars and restaurants with his wealthy co-stars, but Chelsea boy Andy Jordan's heart lies outside the capital. From getting stopped and searched for drugs in Mexico, to hijacking tuk tuks in India, the fun-loving broker has had many adventures beyond London's exclusive SW3 postcode. While you may expect him to enjoy the best luxury hotels around the world, the carefree traveller says he often packs the bare minimum and even enjoys staying in the odd Travelodge. Jetsetter: Andy Jordan from Made In Chelsea has enjoyed the best hotels around the world, but also enjoys a stay at Travelodge . Sat in Andy's London flat at the start of the bank holiday a travel edition of 'Would You Rather' kicks off proceedings. 'I don't think I've played this sober before,' he says, before revealing how he prefers action holidays to lying on a beach. 'I once took a girl on holiday to Morocco for her birthday,' he said when asked about the most romantic place he has taken a female companion. 'It was a bit awkward as we were together but broke up just before, but both still wanted to go. 'What she didn't realise is I had booked it based on the best surfing spots in the area and turned up at the airport with my surfboard. 'She was livid!' Action man! The singer loves to keep active on holiday and aims to surf in the Arctic one day . The singer released his album, Geography, last year and in the title song he sings about falling in love at first sight on London's Underground. The ladies of London will be delighted to know he is completely open to finding love on trains. 'I had my first 'train encounter' when I was 14 and I chatted to this girl for five hours, all the way from Oxford to Bodmin Parkway,' he explains. 'It was so incredible we even kissed when I got off and met up that evening on the beach. 'I am a big believer in that kind of thing.' Sun loving! The latest holiday the Chelsea boy went on involved the cast from the TV series. Their trip to Barbados was shown on the season opening episode this week . Most of the singer's future holiday plans involve ticking surfing spots off his bucket list. 'I want to surf in the Arctic, it's becoming a big thing and you can surf between glaciers with Patagonia wetsuits that let you go in four degree water.' Of course the Chelsea boy had a gap year, funded by doing a telesales job in his bedroom in pajamas, before surfing every day for six months around the world. When asked if he would rather join the Mile High Club and be caught or never join at all, his response is instant. 'Join it! Hands down! Just to clarify I am not currently a member of it.' Andy's favourite hotel is the Tryall Club in Jamaica. He stayed at the Round House and brought the whole of his family . His favourite place to stay is in the Tryall Club in Jamaica's Montego Bay. The country club retreat is where he has previously shared the sumptuous Round House property with his family. 'It's very cool as it has a huge turret and a dining room table that seats 18 people and the staff are amazing. 'I got blamed for drinking all the rum but it was actually the butler.' Andy also loves to check into London hotels such as the Corinthia, just for fun (as you do) and the Londoner believes the hotel service in the capital is among the best in the world. More rivalry! Andy Jordan and Jamie Laing set their sights on Made In Chelsea newcomer Jess Woodley . But it's not all sumptuous surroundings and butler service, Andy reveals he is also a fan of Travelodge. 'When I was on tour I took our whole team there and they do a great bed,' he said. 'Even Mark Francis would stay there, he is actually an extremely chilled traveller.' If the singer could pick anywhere in the world to busk for a day, it would be Union Square in New York in summer. 'I probably wouldn't get to play for very long as I would get chatting to someone, go for a coffee and end up exploring the city. 'Actually, an hour outside Wall Street and you would have about $400 and could leave it there anyway!' If Andy could take one of the Made In Chelsea stars on a desert island with him it would be Jamie. 'He would freak the most for sure, but he's such a positive person he would just think screw it and have a fun time. 'He's not a fan of organised fun so this would be the perfect place for him, but he would definitely start freaking out with then sun went down.' The TV series is on its ninth season, and can be seen on E4 on Mondays at 9pm . Hijacking tuk tuks! Just one of Andy's many holiday adventures when he has been outside of his London SW postcode . The Chelsea star enjoys going abroad as he is less recognised and does not have to act in such a refined way. 'In India I said to one of the tuk tuk drivers that I would pay extra if I could drive. 'It was a really great way of getting back from the temple to our hotel. 'But it was night and I nearly hit a cow, which are sacred there, and I had to swerve to miss it and a couple of people fell out!' His latest holiday was with the Made in Chelsea gang, and they flew with British Airways  from London Gatwick to Barbados. The gorgeous stars' holiday was shown on the season opening on Monday this week and Andy was clearly a fan of the company. 'The girls looked great in bikinis,' he grins, 'that's all I'll say.'","MIC's Andy Jordan spoke to MailOnline  about how Chelsea boys holiday .

"New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez is facing the possibility of 15 years in prison for using his position to help a wealthy donor in exchange for nearly $1million in gifts and campaign contributions. The 61-year-old Democrat has pleaded not guilty to eight bribery counts related to his close personal friendship with eye surgeon Dr Salomon Melgen, 60, according to a 68-page federal indictment unsealed this month and detailed in the New York Post. Perhaps the most embarrassing of the accusations is that Menendez used his influence to get visas for married Melgen's multiple young lovers abroad - including a Brazilian model who posed on the cover of 'Sexy' magazine and a Ukrainian actress who moved to Florida to live in one of Melgen's homes. Scroll down for videos . Corrupt? U.S. Senator Robert Menendez faces the possibility of 15 years in prison if convicted of eight counts of bribery for using his political influence to help a wealthy donor in exchange for nearly $1million in campaign contributions and gifts . Melgen's ladies: According to an indictment unsealed this month, Menendez helped donor Dr Salomon Melgen bring at least three mistresses to the U.S. on visas - including Brazilian actress Juliana Lopes Leite (left) and Ukrainian model Svitlana Buchyk (right) Menendez and Melgen met at a fundraiser in 1993, shortly after Menendez was voted into the Senate. The two quickly became close, with Menendez being invited to fly on Melgen's private jet and visit his villa in the Dominican Republic on several occasions. According to the details in the indictment, Menendez began helping out his rich friend in 1998, when Melgen wanted to fly a 22-year-old girlfriend - identified as 'girlfriend 2 in court documents - and her 18-year-old sister from the Dominican Republic to spend Christmas with him in the States. Claiming innocence: Melgen has also been charged in the indictment, in addition to other Medicaid fraud charges, pleading not guilty to both. He is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami . Despite Melgen writing a letter to the embassy in Santo Domingo, the sisters' applications were initially denied due to the fact that they were unemployed and therefore more likely to overstay their visas. When Melgen found got the bad news, he reached out to his friend Menendez for help. Menendez then told his senior policy adviser Mark Lopes that he planned to personally call the ambassador and, if that didn't work, a contact at the State Department. An unidentified high-ranking member in the State Department allegedly responded by telling Menendez that he agreed with the visa decision. Nevertheless, a few weeks later the sisters were re-interviewed and this time their visas were approved. Lopes emailed a colleague after and wrote that it was 'ONLY DUE to the fact that RM intervened.' Menendez next helped Melgen in 2007, when the doctor was trying to get another young woman to visit him in the U.S. The woman identified as 'girlfriend 3' in court documents is described as a Ukrainian actress and model who was 20 years old and living in Spain around the time at Menendez intervened in her immigration process. According to the indictment, a Menendez staffer reached out to the U.S. consul general in Madrid on behalf of a 'famous person in Spain' who was a 'good friend' of Melgen and needed a visa to 'undergo medical evaluation for plastic surgery in the U.S'. 'Dr Melgen is a person of the highest caliber,' Menendez wrote . 'He is a fine citizen and held in high esteem by his peers.' It's believed that 'girlfriend 3' is model Svitlana Buchyk, now 28, a woman who has been tied to Melgen and who lived in Spain before moving to Florida. Svitlana made headlines in Florida in 2010 when she crashed a car that was registered in Melgen's wife's name. At the time, Buchyk gave police Melgen's address in North Palm Beach as her own. When contacted the the Miami Herald at the time, she told the paper that she worked for Melgen in the past but would not describe what that work involved. 'He treated me well,' she said. 'He had money. He was very generous.' She now allegedly goes by the name Lana Moyzuk and lives in Los Angeles. Employee? Melgen's alleged mistress Svitlana Buchyk (pictured) made headlines in Florida in 2010 when she crashed a car belonging to Melgen's wife. She told the Miami Herald at the time that she used to work for Melgen, but would not saw in what capacity . It appears Melgen may have been juggling women in 2007, when he brought Buchyk to the U.S., since he also reportedly started dating a famous Brazilian actress that same year. Menendez is also accused of intervening to help this woman to the U.S. a few years later, when she wanted to study law at the University of Miami. The Post has identified  'girlfriend 1' as 34-year-old Juliana Lopes Leite, who once appeared on Brazil's version of Big Brother and posed nude in several magazines before her move to the U.S. to become a lawyer. The indictment says Menendez knew Leite was one of Melgen's paramours when he agreed to help with her visa application, ordering his adviser Lopes to write a letter in the woman's favor to the State Department. In the letter, lopes wrote that Leite '(no relation to me)  has her visa application appointment in Brasilia, Brazil, tomorrow . . . Sen. Menendez would like to advocate unconditionally for Dr. Melgen and encourage careful consideration of [Girlfriend 1]’s visa application.' The State Department got back to Menendez's office in just a few hours later and the following day Leite's visa was approved. She graduated from the University of Miami in 2011, and still resides in the city as a lawyer. Melgen is also facing charges in the indictment unsealed this month, in addition to separate 76-count indictment for Medicaid fraud. He remains behind bars at the Federal Detention Center in Miami after being deemed a flight risk. Meanwhile, Menendez continues his role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has raised $1.3million for his legal defense fund.","New Jersey senator, 61, is accused of using his influence to help wealthy donor in exchange for nearly $1million in campaign contributions and gifts .

Na Chu had just returned from a trip to the zoo when her grandmother accidentally locked her in the house by herself in the Xiangtan, south China. The five-year-old panicked and ran to the window but fell between the protective metal slats of the residential property, the People's Daily Online reports. Scroll down for video . Long drop: The child dangles from the residential block in the Xiangtan District, south China . Propped up: A neighbour stops the five-year-old from suffocating by giving her a poll to sit on . Neighbours rushed to help after they spotted the little girl hanging in the air with her head trapped between the bars. Some used a piece of pipe to prop her up and prevent her from suffocating, while others supported her feet before firemen eventually arrived - half an hour later. One neighbour told local TV: 'Her terrified screams alerted us and we saw that the upper half of her body was lodged between the security bars and she was slowly slipping down. Rescue: A fireman helps the little girl who has fallen between the metal bars and become trapped by her neck . 'So a bunch of us leapt to action to try save her. We grabbed a drainpipe section and used that to prop her up. And we were talking to her, telling her not to panic.' Another woman took a handful of blankets from her home and laid them on the road below in case the girl fell. People have taken to Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, to praise the tireless efforts of the neighbour below, who supported her feet the entire time. They coined the term 'lifting man' in reference to him, which has now become internet slang for anyone who does a good deed. Help: The good Samaritan supports the child's legs while a worried crowd gathers below the apartment block . Slow response: People took to Weibo to praise neighbours and criticise the emergency services for taking 30 minutes to reach the girl, whose rescue was covered by local TV . ‘Nice people are still around,’ commented online user ‘Baby Lexuan’. Others criticised the emergency services for not getting there fast enough.","Five-year-old had accidentally been locked in by grandma .

"A contestant on the South African version of Big Brother has been expelled from the show after being accused of raping a fellow housemate. Siyanda Ngwenya, known as Adams, allegedly attacked the female contestant while she was asleep after a drunken night of partying in the house in Johannesburg. The pair were last seen on TV kissing and cuddling in bed before the cameras moved away. Ngwenya reportedly boasted to housemates the next day that he had sex with the woman, whom MailOnline has chosen not to name. However, the alleged victim is said to have been shocked by the claims and reportedly told female contestants that she did not consent to having sex. Expelled: Siyanda Ngwenya (pictured), a contestant on the South African version of Big Brother, has been accused of 'sexual misconduct' with a female housemate after drunken night of partying on the show . In a statement last night, Mzansi Magic, the channel which airs Big Brother, said: 'At this stage, it is not exactly clear what transpired between (the woman) and Adams. 'Having suspected that there may have been an incident of sexual misconduct, Mzansi Magic acted by removing both individuals from the house.' The company said the alleged victim had been 'removed for her own well-being' and that both contestants were receiving counselling, it was reported by IOL News. It is not yet known whether police have been called into investigate the alleged incident, which took place on Saturday night when alcohol is made freely available to the housemates. Intimate: The pair were last seen on TV kissing and cuddling before going to bed together where the alleged rape took place. Ngwenya reportedly boasted to housemates the next day that he had sex with the woman . All current contestants have been barred from speaking to the media. Some fans of the show have questioned the woman's claims. Fan @LoazG tweeted: 'Okay, where are these rape allegations coming from now peeps, the misconduct by Adams was not revealed, so where is ths coming from?' Another, @RefilweMaingo, wrote: 'There was no rape. (the woman) n Adams had sex drunk. (The woman) woke up n said she forgot.' Rumours on social media suggest the alleged victim has made a claim of rape at a police station, but this has not been confirmed.","Siyanda Ngwenya accused of attacking the woman while she was asleep .

"An online fitness and diet star is facing court action over an unpaid $300,000 tax debt. Ashy Bines, who is the face of the popular fitness program Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge, is being chased by the tax office over debts due almost 12 months ago, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. The debts, which were due last May, include income and tax, a fine and $295,955 worth of interest. Scroll down for video . Ashy Bines, who is the face of the popular fitness program Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge, is being chased by the tax office over debts due almost 12 months ago . Court documents show the tax office launched action in November and has since lodged an application to liquidate ABBBC Pty Ltd - the company behind Ms Bines' bikini body challenge program. The case will be heard in a Brisbane court next Friday with Pilot Partners already consenting to be liquidators if the tax office wins. Ms Bines and her husband Steven Evans have reportedly sold their shares in ABBBC to Platinum Investment Group - a second company they are members and shareholders of. The fitness queen gave up her title as director of ABBBC just six months after they first started in April 2012. Her husband remained as the sole director of the company. But Mr Evans handed directorship of ABBBC to business associate Levi Walz in January. Mr Evans is currently locked in a court battle with rival fitness guru Emily Anderson. The Gold Coast model and body builder is suing Mr Evans for $500,000 for allegedly using her money for his other businesses and failing to promote hers effectively. Court documents show the tax office launched action in November and has since lodged an application to close down ABBBC Pty Ltd - the company behind Ms Bines' bikini body challenge program . Ms Bines and her husband Steven Evans reportedly sold their shares in ABBBC to Platinum Investment Group - a second company they are members and shareholders of . Ms Anderson launched her company 'Emily Skye 30 Day 2 Shred' in February 2013 with Steven Evans as a joint director. He allegedly made contact with Ms Anderson via Facebook in 2013 to propose a business partnership, promising to 'make something' of her like he did with his wife Ashy. Ms Anderson's company is seeking damages against Mr Evans for up to $501,619 for allegedly spending the business' money on personal items and expenses relating to other businesses. One of the payments listed in the court claim includes $2,500 paid to the Ashy Bines Bikini Body Challenge, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported at the time. It comes after Sydney personal trainer Allie Dodds said last week that Ms Bines had used her recipes in a $100 e-book without crediting her or asking if she could publish them in a book. The fitness queen gave up her title as director of ABBBC just six months after they first started in April 2012 . It comes after Ms Bines admitted in a video statement that 10 recipes contained within her Clean Eating Diet Plan had been stolen . Ms Dodds regularly published recipes for her friends and family on her Mealspiration blog before she started her business, The Sweet Sweat, in September 2013. She said Ms Bines contacted her asking if she could share her recipes online with her Facebook fan base and she agreed. 'I thought, that was OK she's going to share a couple of my recipes, give me some credit and that was it,' she told Daily Mail Australia. But she said she was stunned when a colleague noticed her Salmon and Cauliflower Sushi recipe in a 2012 edition of Ms Bines' Clean Eating Recipe Book. Ms Bines admitted in a video statement that 10 recipes contained within her Clean Eating Diet Plan had been stolen. She said it happened because she 'outsourced' the recipe component to an unnamed nutritionist.

"Standing in a public shower cubicle with my screaming 15-month-old son, I was starting to wonder whether I truly was a Keycamp type of person. My hazy memories of similar family holidays as a child were of slow days spent on pine-scented campsites, punctuated by trips to sun-soaked beaches. But here I was, a fully-fledged father, some quarter of a century later wondering what had gone wrong. Our journey to Argeles-sur-Mer on France’s Mediterranean coast went without a hitch, despite being in the minority of travellers flying, then hiring a car, rather than driving all the way. But the fatal decision was to try and wash the children, toddler Joe and five-year-old Anna, after arriving in a tired and tetchy state at Camping La Chapelle. Chris Greenwood stayed at Camping La Chappelle with his wife, Catherine, and children, Joe and Anna . Families congregated around the pools every afternoon for relief from the August heat . It was at this point I discovered that we didn’t have any hot water and the baby bath had a big hole in the bottom and no plug. With stubborn determination I slung the youngest over my shoulder, grabbed some towels and trudged off to the shower block. Minutes later he had showed me the error of my ways in the way that only toddlers can. And this was something I was left to chew over, as we quickly realised neither stubbornness nor determination have a place in this land of dappled sunlight, flip-flops and fresh baguettes. The children spent plenty of time in the pool, playing with the many new friends they made . Joe wears oversized sunglasses while relaxing by the pool at Camping La Chappelle in Argeles-sur-Mer . Instead over the next 10 days we threw ourselves at the mercy of campsite life, simply taking the path of least resistance. With hindsight, we should, of course, on that first night have just thrown the children into bed – dirt and all – and gone swimming first thing. Eurocamp (which has since absorbed Keycamp under its banner), and its stable of mobile home accommodation, provide everything you need to make a great success of simple pleasures like these. Things have come on a long way since I was a foot shorter and my family holidayed every year in tents across the south-west of France. The Greenwood family made several trips to the pleasant Argeles beach with its mountain backdrop . Multiple swimming pools, a kids club, swings and a bakery kept the Greenwoods busy during their stay . Lugging jerry cans of water back to our tent with its zip-up compartments and constant procession of ants had its charm, but so does double-glazing, a fully-fitted kitchen and air conditioning. We stayed in a Vista three-bedroom mobile home. It’s not huge, the bedrooms have the feel of a ship cabin, but it’s all there. The shower is decent with plenty of hot water – once the boiler has been sparked into life by a handy courier – and you’ve got your own loo and a decent size fridge. Two sets of doors lead out on to a deck, equipped with a gas-fired barbecue and, in our case, a permanent al fresco bath for Joe. Camping La Chapelle's biggest selling point is a fantastic swimming pool complex, including two water slides . Eurocamp offer sites for all types and tastes, and Camping La Chapelle is probably quite typical of a modern French campsite. This is certainly not your isolated enclave where you spend the evening listening only to the cicadas and warm wind rustling through the trees. Instead, you are likely to be able to hear the distant sounds of a German murdering a 1980s pop classic at karaoke night at the bar. But it’s a trade-off if you want somewhere lively and family orientated, which this campsite certainly is. In La Chapelle’s case, the biggest selling point is the fantastic swimming pool complex, including two water slides. There is even a heated pool with a retractable roof, under which we spent a memorable afternoon sheltering from a thunderstorm that rolled in from the Pyrenees. Joe and Anne, pictured with dad Chris, enjoyed the kids club, run by a team of dedicated workers . Families congregated around the pools every afternoon for relief from the August heat and Anna became an almost permanent fixture in the water, playing with the many new friends she’d made on the site. So the pool became a mainstay of our pleasant daily routine, which began with picking up freshly baked bread from the campsite bakery and ended with drinks and snacks on the deck. We quickly made use of the kids club, run by a small team of dedicated and enthusiastic couriers. Four hours of varied entertainment is on offer for children aged five to 12, six days of the week, and during our stay those in charge worked hard to build a rapport with their young charges from Britain, Ireland, Germany and Holland. Chris and Catherine get into the spirit at Camping La Chappelle's campsite 'Olympics' for children . Anna enjoyed games, crafts and an X-Factor-style talent show as the club proved a hub for families staying with Keycamp and its sister company Eurocamp. The two tribes were ultimately set against each other with an evening campsite ‘Olympics’, at which I am sad to report Eurocamp cleaned up. But not before our children had soaked their couriers to the skin in a bizarre game involving body paint, shouting and many, many bottles of water. As the days went on we settled into a pleasant routine, padding about the site between the bakery, kids club, swings and swimming pools. We did venture off site most mornings, making the 10-minute walk to the pleasant Argeles beach with its mountain backdrop and host of accessible cafes, bars and a mini-supermarket. When the Greenwoods weren't in the pool they spent time on the beach in the stunning port of Collioure . A little further afield was the stunning port of Collioure, once a magnet for artists including Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. It really is a picture postcard place, with a little bay and beach perfect for swimming, surrounded by traditional French cafes, restaurants and arts and crafts boutiques. We went back twice to make sure we hadn’t missed anything in its winding maze of pretty streets. Once my wife and I found a new rhythm we pretty much all agreed that we could be Keycamp kind of people. We vowed never to force Joe to take a shower ever again though – at least not until he is big enough to take himself. Chris and his family stayed at Camping La Chapelle, Argeles-Sur-Mer, for 10 nights with Keycamp (www.eurocamp.co.uk or 0844 406 0319), which now operates under the Eurocamp banner. Eurocamp offer self-catering holidays at more than 160 sites across Europe, including popular regions like the Dordogne, Holland and central Italy. From May 25, 2015, a seven-night stay in a two-bedroom Esprit mobile home at Camping La Chapelle starts at £427. Peak season flights with easyJet to Montpellier from Gatwick start at £65 each way, plus baggage. Chris hired a car with Europcar, which cost around £250 for 10 days, including two child seats and unlimited mileage.","Chris Greenwood travelled with his family to Argeles-sur-Mer, France .

"Indigenous Australian models have yet to make a significant impact on the runway but an exclusively Aboriginal modelling agency is in the swing of changing that cultural fashion landscape. The first name that comes to mind when thinking of Aboriginal models for even the most die-hard of fashionistas is Samantha Harris who was one of the most prominent faces during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia in Sydney this week. The only other indigenous face to join the 24-year-old stunner at the biggest week on the country's fashion calendar over the past two years is Lauren Feenstra. On the rise: Adina-lee Vincent is one of the many emerging models signed with Aboriginal Model Management Australia . Gaining ground: The agency started off with just five models and now has 40 including Noreen Carr (pictured) However, next year's annual global event will mark a significant shift if Aboriginal Model Management Australia founder Kira-Lea Dargin gets her way. 'I expect at least five or 10 to be appearing in next year's fashion week,' she said. 'Realistically I would like to see up to 10 of our girls go through to next year's fashion week - we do have quite a few of them that have the potential,' she said. What started out as helping out a few modelling mates break into the industry two and half years ago quickly turned into a niche market that Aboriginal models have long been crying out for by the start of last year for the Russian-Aboriginal. Hot right now: Agency founder Kira-Lea Dargin hopes 10 of her girls will join Samantha Harris at next year's fashion week . In demand: Harris walked in a number of major shows at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia . Dargin began representing females who had the runway standards in terms of height and size. 'We focused on high fashion calibre models,' she said. 'We started out with five then it became 25 and now we have 40 models.' Now the agency is about to take on a whole new approach when casting begin for both female and male models aged anywhere up to 60 years old across five capital cities. The Facebook post for the casting call in Brisbane tomorrow has already attracted more than 350 shares and Dargin has received at least 400 emails with expressions of interest. 'I'm expecting the numbers to go ridiculous especially when we go onto Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth,' she said. Dargin says the high fashion market is slowly changing its perspective when it comes to indigenous models but she hoped it would move along more quickly (Cheyanne Fuller pictured) The 26-year-old is finding the mid-market range of big family chain stores such as Bonds, Target and Big W are particularly interested in hiring Aboriginal models for their catalogue campaigns. 'They are a lot more receptive opposed to the high fashion market because it has had a particular look for quite some time,' she said. 'It's a slow process but the perspective is changing - a lot of opportunities are opening but I personally would like to see it happen quicker but there is a lot of caution and a lot of stereotypes linked so you have to face that.' Dargin, whose father is Aboriginal and mother is Russian, faced discrimination when she started modelling in her teens. Big family chain stores such as Bonds, Target and Big W are particularly interested in hiring Aboriginal models for their catalogue campaigns (pictured Nyima Mcnamara) 'It was difficult to overcome both personally and professionally,' she said. 'I thought ""that's who I am - what's the problem with it?"".' She believes that the reason for casting agents hesitance to hire Aboriginal models was because the concern is the fashion platform could be used for political purposes. 'I think anytime you get involved with anything indigenous there is always that political aspect of what's happening in the community and what's happening across the nation and people assume that will come with it,' she said. 'But it's really important to separate individual events and be able to take it professionally and realise that not everyone slots into specific categories.' Dargin believes that high-end brands are hesitant to sign Aboriginal models because the concern is the fashion platform could be used for political purposes (pictured Zoe Byrne) Dargin says with Harris being the most famous Aboriginal face on the catwalk - she would like to see her act as a voice for young aspiring indigenous models. 'She's a very shy girl but I just think that she could come out of her shell a little bit more and be a spokesperson and promote Aboriginality for models in particular and just build a little bit more brand awareness,' she said. 'I think if she spoke up a bit more being in the position that she's in that it would help the next crop of young girls coming through.' Dargin encourages the models that she represents to embrace who their origins. 'I encourage our girls to be proud of who they are as a person and be proud of who they are in their cultural aspect but not to allow anybody else to target you based on other people's actions.' Kira-Lea Dargin hopes to have as many as 10 of her girls in next year's Australian Fashion Week .","Aboriginal Model Management Australia has 40 female clients so far .

"Anyone who has seen The Lion King will surely agree that it contains one of the most tear-jerking scenes in all of Disney history. And for one little girl, whose crestfallen reaction as she witnessed it for the first time was captured on camera by her father, it proved almost too much to bear. Shot by adoring dad, called Barles Charkley on the site, who is based in Baltimore, Maryland, the video stars his toddler daughter Viktoria, as she comes to terms with the tragedy that is the death of Simba the lion's father, Mufasa. Tear-jerker: Viktoria's crestfallen reaction (pictured) as she witnessed a sad scene from Disney's The Lion King for the first time was captured on camera by her father Barles Charkley . Mr Charkley posted the brief video, which has so far garnered more than four million views, to his Facebook page on Saturday. It's captioned: 'Viktoria watching Lion King for the first time, and Scar just killed Mufasa!' He then urges viewers to 'check out' her reaction. The little girl is seated hunched up on the sofa gazing at the screen, and as the mournful music rolls in - a score composed by Hollywood heavyweight Hans Zimmer - her bottom lip trembles. The tot then appears to brush away a tear as the emotional scene progresses, before gathering her blanket up around her shoulders in speechless despair. 'Are you sad? Mufasa died?' Mr Charkley can be heard inquiring. The fragile toddler shakes her head repeatedly as her eyes fill with tears. 'You want a hug?' he persists, to which his Viktoria nods her head and makes her way dejectedly over to where he is sitting as the footage ends. Waterworks: Viktoria is seated hunched up on the sofa gazing at the screen, and as the mournful music rolls in - a score composed by Hollywood heavyweight Hans Zimmer - her bottom lip trembles . The Lion King was released in 1994 to rave reviews, and won two Oscars. It later became the highest-grossing hand-drawn animated film in history. The scene in question, which sees Mufasa murdered by his evil brother Scar leaving Simba fatherless, is generally considered to be one of Disney's most haunting spectacles. Other top contenders include the scene in 1942 hit Bambi where the deer loses his parents, and one in 1941's Dumbo, where the baby elephant visits his mother in jail.

"A pair of three-month-old baby gorillas have made their debut at the Bronx Zoo after being delivered just 48 hours apart back in January. The Western Lowland Gorillas have been spotted roaming around the zoo's Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit with their mothers Layla and Kumi, who are both 16 years old. Pictured riding around on their mother's backs, or cuddling up in their arms, the duo have been welcomed by the other 17 gorillas in the enclosure, including Ernie, 32, who is father to them both. Scroll down for video . Helping hand: The babies were born to mothers Layla and Kumi on January 17 and 19, but keepers don't know either of their genders yet, and so they haven't been named . Baby steps: Two three-month-old Western Lowland Gorillas have been pictured for the first time at the Bronx Zoo since they were born less than 48 hours apart back in January . Despite being born back in January, keepers at Bronx Zoo have yet to learn either of the babies' genders, and so neither of them have been named yet. But that has not stopped them from winning over crowds at the zoo as they explore their new home. Because of their young age, they are not always on display for visitors, with appearances depending on conditions such as temperature and weather. The eldest of the pair was delivered on January 17 this year, while the younger arrived just 48 hours later, much to the excitement of animal keepers. While they weighed just 4lb at birth, they will eventually grow to weigh more than 400lb as adults. The new babies are joined by two other youngsters who were born earlier in 2014. Fitting in: The two new youngsters join another pair of gorillas that were born earlier in 2014, along with 13 adults in the zoo's Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit . Having a cuddle: While the babies have different mothers, they share a father, 32-year-old Ernie who was nowhere to be seen in these pictures . The Western lowland gorilla is an endangered species in the wild, but while exact numbers are not known because of their remote habitats, they are believed to be more common than mountain gorillas. Lowland gorillas can be distinguished by their slightly brown coat and long arms, and usually live in communities of around 30. The group will be lead by one dominant male, the alpha, sometimes called the silverback because of the shock of silver hair which usually covers his shoulders. Thanks largely to disease and destruction of habitat, the numbers of Western Lowland gorillas living in the wild have dropped by 60 per cent in the last 20 to 25 years, making zoo conservation efforts all the more vital. Surviving: While the Western Lowlands Gorilla is thought to be among the most common gorillas in the wild, they are still an endangered species, making programs like this important to ensure their survival .","Three-month-old Western Lowland Gorillas pictured for first time in exhibit .

"Murder: Pennie Davis, left, was killed by a homeless petty crook who was hired by her ex-lover's son . A career criminal hired a hitman to murder his stepmother for just £1,500 after she threatened to accuse him of being a paedophile. Benjamin Carr, 22, harboured a burning hatred of mother-of-five Pennie Davis, 47, during her six-year relationship with his father. He ordered fellow drug dealer Justin Robertson, 36, to kill her after she threatened to tell police he sexually assaulted young girls eight years earlier. Mrs Davis was discovered in a pool of blood by her new husband after she was stabbed while tending her horses in the New Forest. But Carr was caught after the killer accidentally left his car keys beside her body and was forced to call a friend to pick him up from the isolated spot. Detectives discovered cocaine addict Robertson accepted just £1,500 to commit the murder and was paid in counterfeit notes. Yesterday, the two men were jailed for life after a jury convicted them of murder and conspiracy to murder. Robertson will serve a minimum of 32 years and Carr a minimum of 30 years. They were branded ‘evil’ by a senior police officer as the victim’s family said justice has not been achieved because they will one day walk free. Mrs Davis’ grieving husband Pete, 50, described the former show jumper as an ‘angel’ who loved nothing more than to ride her horses. ‘We had our lives just waiting to be taken with both hands together as a married couple and that was taken away from me. It’s been a nightmare ever since,’ he said. Mrs Davis was stabbed 13 times as she tended her four horses in a farm paddock near Beaulieu, Hampshire, last September. The supermarket worker suffered horrific injuries and was discovered by her husband who thought she was sunbathing. Police were quickly on the trail of those responsible and discovered Robertson, of no fixed abode, agreed to murder the victim at the request of Carr. Winchester Crown Court heard he harboured a ‘lasting hate’ towards Mrs Davis which left Carr estranged from his father after their relationship ended. She had told police Carr sexually assaulted two young girls in 2006, when he was aged just 14, but no further action was taken. Hitman: Justin Robertson, left, was paid £1,500 in counterfeit banknotes by Benjamin Carr, right . A fortnight before the murder Carr discovered she had repeated the allegations in Facebook messages to his father’s new fiancée and claimed she had ‘new evidence’ and would go to police again. Prosecutor Richard Smith QC said: ‘Ben Carr was worried Pennie Davis was going to go to the police and allege that he had previously indecently assaulted girls. ‘It was for that reason it seems that Ben Carr wanted Pennie Davis silenced and so he recruited others to help him do that.’ Carr, of Southampton, contacted Robertson, a fellow drug dealer and petty crook, who agreed to carry out the killing and even showed off a knife similar to the murder weapon to a friend. He handed himself in to police but said he had nothing to do with the killing and his keys had been at the scene because he’d dropped them while looking for wealthy homes to burgle in the area. During the trial Robertson, who has been jailed for more than 70 thefts, told the jury he ‘didn’t care’ if they convicted him and threatened to track down and kill Carr. Standing in the witness box, he said: ‘Ben, I’m going to chase you down in every prison – I’m going to find you.’ He even spoke towards Mrs Davis’ relatives in the public gallery and invited them to visit him in prison and look him in the eye. Sentencing Robertson, Mr Justice Popplewell said he was responsible for a carefully planned, brutal and ferocious murder against a ‘helpless woman’. He said he showed ‘no remorse’ and branded his behaviour in the witness box as ‘deplorable’ as well as ‘arrogant and offensive’. Speaking outside court, one of Mrs Davis’ daughters, Georga Pead, 19, said the jail sentences have not given them justice. Family: Mrs Davis with her five children Daniel, Sophie, Georga, Alex and Joe, pictured left to right . Victim: Pennie Davis was found dead by her husband in a New Forest field in September last year . She said: ‘Carr has still got his mum and they will both still have people waiting for them outside. We have got to live here without her every single day. I don’t think that is justice at all.’ Mr Davis, 50, added: ‘Even if they get 30 years in prison they will still get the chance to come out and have families. ‘Now I just hate everything. Going down to the horses, seeing people holding hands, enjoying the sun, it hurts because that’s what me and Pennie used to do.’ Det Supt Paul Barton, who led the inquiry, said: ‘Robertson is an evil and cold killer who was motivated by a relatively small amount of money,’ he said. ‘Carr had a long-term hatred for Pennie. He tried to silence her once and for all and knew Robertson would do anything for money.’ Evidence: Robertson was convicted after police discovered that he had dropped a car key in the field . Mrs Davis's family said in a statement this afternoon: 'The people responsible for our mum's brutal murder have been convicted but we cannot celebrate. 'It is not them, but us, Pennie's family, who have been given the real life sentence. The life of someone precious to us as a mother, daughter, wife and sister has gone and can't be replaced. 'We have attended court every day and have had to listen to many lies about Pennie, who has been robbed of her voice to defend herself. 'The Pennie presented in court by those who were desperate to try to justify their actions is not the Pennie we remember. For us she will always be our warm, loving, protective, determined, funny mum who loved her children more than anything. Wedding: Mrs Davis on the day she married her husband Peter in May last year, with her daughter Georga and Sophie . Couple: Peter Davis today spoke of his grief at the murder of his wife just four months after they married . Heart-broken: Mrs Davis's family (pictured) said in a statement outside Winchester Crown Court today: 'The people responsible for our mum's brutal murder have been convicted but we cannot celebrate . Grief: Pennie Davis' daughters Sophie (left) and Georgia (right) read a statement outside Winchester Crown Court . Deceased: Detective Superintendent Paul Barton (pictured) said outside court: 'Pennie was a loving mother who doted on all her children and was just starting a new chapter in her life with husband Pete' 'We appreciate the thorough police investigation, the dedication of the jury and all those involved in this lengthy court case and especially the people who bravely came to court to give evidence. 'We also want to thank the many people who have sent us love and good wishes throughout this ordeal. The outpouring of grief at her death is the best and most faithful tribute to her memory and will not be erased.' Giving evidence, Carr said he only wanted to 'scare' Mrs Davis and did not intend for any physical violence to be used against her. He told jurors: 'Physical words, no actual physical violence, to warn her to back away from me and my family and the wedding.' Bereaved: Mr Davis called his wife an 'angel', adding: 'She was so caring and would do anything for anybody' Grief: Mr Davis with his wife's older children Sophie, Alex and Georga on the lawn in the New Forest where she used to play with them . Describing the payment to Robertson, Carr said: 'We talked about £1,500 of false money and that was how it was going to be at first because they have some value on the street. 'That changed later on through the week because he didn't want the fake currency - he wanted real money and £400 cash and a quarter of cocaine.' Robertson said he agreed to help because he had been told by Carr that he was sexually abused by Mrs Davis as a child. Carr denied this, claiming that he had only told Robertson: 'She's ruined my life, she brought up these allegations, made them up, yeah, ruined my life.' Mrs Davis was followed from her work at a Sainsbury's supermarket in her home town of Blackfield to the field near Beaulieu where she kept her horses. Robertson later confessed to a friend and 'justified' his actions by saying that he believed his victim was a 'nonce' - triggering a deep-seated hatred of paedophiles which dated back to when he was abused as a child. Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, of Hampshire Police, said outside court: 'Pennie was a loving mother who doted on all her children and was just starting a new chapter in her life with husband Pete. Pete, added that she loved showjumping when she was younger, adding: 'To me she was an angel, she was just so caring and she would do anything for anybody. 'When we met we just seemed to click and we saved each other and I knew everything was going to be fine. 'We had our lives just waiting to be taken with both hands together as a married couple and that was taken away from me. It's been a nightmare ever since. 'Well they say it gets easier as time goes on but at the moment I can't see that.' Search: Forensic police at the site in the New Forest where Mrs Davis was killed in September last year .

"Mystery surrounds the sensational CCTV footage showing the gem thieves in the middle of their audacious £60million heist after it was suggested that the police had missed this crucial evidence. The Daily Mirror published sensational pictures of the Hatton Garden raiders 21 hours before Scotland Yard released them in a bid to appeal for information about identities of the thieves. The tabloid claims it handed the images to police, who were 'delighted', according to a report today in its sister title The Sunday Mirror, with an apparent source saying it 'blows the case wide open'. But yesterday afternoon detectives insisted they already had the CCTV footage, which they claim was recovered 'at the earliest opportunity'. Pictured: The Met has released images of three of the gang which broke into Hatton Garden over the Easter weekend - but has only done so after the shots were revealed by the Daily Mirror . Audacious: Exactly why the police did not release the images beforehand is unclear - especially as the tabloid's sister paper The Sunday Mirror claims they are the key to 'cracking the case wide open' This is in stark contrast with the response given to MailOnline hours before, when police refused to say whether they had the footage. The Met finally released the pictures late on Saturday afternoon, while The Mirror could sell the images to a number of other national titles, including this website. Up until that point, no other newspaper was able to help the police trace the culprits of what could be the biggest ever robbery in Britain. It raises questions about why the police chose to keep them to themselves - or whether they even had the footage. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme this morning, former Flying Squad chief John O'Connor said: 'I've never heard of anything like this. 'I'm not blaming The Mirror, but I am pointing some quite accusing fingers at the police for not finding it themselves.' Questions: Former Flying Squad chief John O'Connor said he had 'never heard of anything like' a newspaper getting such crucial footage before the police got their hands on it - although police now say they had it . It is likely to put further pressure on an investigation which has already been accused of a number of failings. Owners of the security deposit boxes are continuing to demand answers on why police failed to respond to the alarm when it first went off over the long weekend. And now the MailOnline has revealed some have resorted to bribing security guards, as they desperately try to find out information about what has been lost. The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The CCTV will have gone some way to answering questions for those who lost thousands of pounds in the theft. It reveals how the raiders entered the building by a side door on Thursday evening, minutes after staff left the premises. They then entered the basement through the lift shaft, and broke through the shutters before spending hours in the vault - emerging the next morning carrying the gems out the building in a wheelie bin. They then returned on Saturday night, apparently repeating the process throughout the night, leaving early on the morning of Easter Sunday. The burglary was discovered on Tuesday morning. Police have now said 72 out of the vaults 999 boxes were opened.","Daily Mirror published the first pictures of the six thieves on Saturday .

"Two months after it announced it was launching its own mobile network, Google is now looking at ways to get rid of roaming fees. The tech giant is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of the Three network, to let its users make calls and send texts in any country at no extra cost. Industry sources said the firms are discussing a 'wholesale access agreement' that would help Google create a global network. Scroll down for video . Google is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of the Three network, to let its users make calls and send texts in any country at no extra cost. Industry sources said the firms are discussing a 'wholesale access agreement' that would help Google create a global network . Customers would then be able to use this global network to make calls, send texts and use data as part of their plan, regardless of where in the world they are. In particular, a deal with Hutchison would extend the service to the UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain., but the plans would only affect the small base of customers on Google's plan. Last week Three extending its Feel at Home scheme to Spain and New Zealand. Feel at Home lets Three customers use their phones, and their plans, in the same way they can at home even when they're in a foreign country. Spain and New Zealand take the total number of Feel at Home countries to 18. The other nations include France, Switzerland, Israel, Norway, Sri Lanka, Australia, Finland, Indonesia, Macau, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden, Denmark, the Republic of Ireland and the USA. Three already offers a similar scheme called Feel at Home that lets customers use their phones and their plans in 18  countries. Google's vice president Sundar Pichai confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. It will be initially offered to cities that have Google Fiber, such as Kansas, Texas and Utah and Google is working with network operators on developing the cellular plan. ‘You will see us announce it in the coming months, I think we are at a stage where it is important to think about hardware, software and connectability together,’ said the 43-year-old. The rumours of a Google mobile network plan first emerged in April last year. Instead of building masts, Google will buy access to existing 3G and 4G networks at wholesale prices and sell the connectivity back to customers at a cheaper rate. Three already offers a similar scheme called Feel at Home (pictured) that lets customers use their phones and their plans for free, in 18 countries. Spain and New Zealand were the latest countries to join this scheme . A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) is a company that offers mobile service plans using existing networks. MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices. The company can then use this access to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate. Lycamobile in the U.S, for example, is an MVNO because it runs on T-Mobile’s network. In the UK, Tesco Mobile shares O2’s, and ultimately Telefonica’s, networks. An MVNO is typically run as an independent company, with its own staff and customer service . This would make Google a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) similar to Lycamobile in the US that runs on T-Mobile’s network, and Tesco Mobile in the UK which shares O2’s networks. MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices. The company can then use these network to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate. Mr Pinchai said: ‘We want to be able to experiment along those lines, [but] we don't intend to be a network operator at scale.’ He described the plans as a ‘project’ and will do it on a small enough scale to not threaten existing networks. In particular, Mr Pichai said the setup should provide at seamless connection between Wi-Fi and mobile networks. Sources said at the time of the original rumours that any Google-branded mobile network would initially launch in cities that have Google Fiber. Google launched its 1000mps Fiber broadband service in 2011, starting with Kansas City. Google's vice president Sundar Pichai (pictured) confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. Instead of building masts, Google will buy access to existing networks and sell connectivity back to customers at a cheaper rate . Travelex has launched a 'Supercard' that makes fees charged by banks for using your card abroad a thing of the past. Based on an average 10-day holiday, Travelex told MailOnline a family of four could save almost £110. The Supercard looks and works like a standard debit card, but it connects to an app and lets users consolidate multiple cards onto one account. The banking fees are paid for by Travelex and savings are shown in real-time. And if a card is lost or stolen it can be blocked using the app. In 2013, the firm announced it was expanding the service to Austin in Texas, Provo in Utah and a number of other towns in Missouri and California. More locations are due to be added later this year, but the roll-out is slow because Google has to install the relevant infrastructure needed. Google Fiber starts at $70 (£42) a month and has been praised for offering high speeds at relatively low prices. Google’s wireless plans would remove some of the costs, and time spent, in setting up its own network and it would equally benefit from using already established and well-connected networks. This could help Google cement itself as an internet service provider. Google could additionally use the network to sell its Nexus range of phones, for example, with contract or service plans.","Google is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, which owns Three .

"Star Wars: Rogue One, starring Felicity Jones, which is slated for release in December 2016 . The Jedis are all but extinct, the Old Republic is in turmoil and the threat of the Death Star is looming in 'Rogue One,' fans learned at Star Wars Celebration on Sunday. Gareth Edwards who directed Godzilla debuted a tantalizing trailer to preview the mysterious film, which is part of a series of films exploring other stories outside of the core 'Star Wars' saga. 'For more than 1,000 generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times. Before the Empire,' says Alec Guinness as Obi Wan Kenobi in a voiceover reprised from 1977's Star Wars: A New Hope. While the ominous words so familiar to millions fans are delivered the camera tracks to show a ghostly Death Star hovering in the clouds. At the screening, audience members were heard to gasp when Guinness spoke and then whoop when the Death Star came into view. Set chronologically between the third and the fourth movies in the 'Star Wars' saga, the film will follow a band of resistance fighters who unite to steal the Death Star plans and 'bring a new hope,' referring to the subtitle of the original 'Star Wars.' At the same time, the iconic franchise's Twitter account posted a capsule of the storyline, saying: 'A band of resistance fighters unite for a daring mission to steal the Death Star plans in Star Wars anthology film, Rogue One #RogueOne. Preview: Fans at the Star Wars Celebration convention in Anaheim, California were able to view a preview of the first Star Wars spin-of entitled Rogue One . More to come: The Star Wars website released this Twitter describing the storyline for the film, which is described as an anthology movie adding to the Star Wars universe . December 2016: The film is set after Episode III and before Episode IV, added director Gareth Edwards added that his film won't have clear-cut villains and heroes . Felicity Jones, who recently garnered an Oscar nomination for her role in 'The Theory of Everything' is the only confirmed cast member for the film, which will shoot in London this summer for a December 2016 release. Jones will play a rebel soldier, the director said. Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy appears on the Cantina set at Star Wars Celebration: The Ultimate Fan Experience held in Anaheim last week . Edwards said that her character will not just be a stoic soldier, but a complex, fully rounded human. 'We wanted to see fear, warmth, all of those aspects that everybody has,' he said, excited that Jones embodies 'the complete package.' In the world of 'Rogue One,' Edwards said the 'absence of Jedi is omnipresent.' The characters in the film realize that the 'gods are not coming to save us,' he said. 'It comes down to a group of people who don't have magical powers who band together to bring hope to the galaxy.' 'Cinderella' scribe Chis Weitz wrote the screenplay based on an idea from visual effects supervisor John Knoll. Josh Trank, who is set to direct the next, still untitled 'Star Wars' anthology film, did not attend the event although he was originally scheduled to appear. The idea for the film came from award-winning visual effects artist John Knoll, who pitched the idea internally before bringing it to Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm's Kiri Hart. Hart, vice president of development for Lucasfilm, said that the anthology films will vary in 'scale and genre.' She added that they are describing them as 'anthology films' that expand the Star Wars universe without necessarily using the main characters. 'We wanted freedom to do some films that would be able to stand on their own and tell unique stories,' she said. 'They can still feel like `Star Wars' and be `Star Wars.'

"Settling down to a glass of wine and a naughty snack is the ultimate after work treat for many of us. But which tipple is the best to bring out the flavour in fiery wasabi peas or salty sausage rolls? Wine experts have created a guide to matching wine with snacks that recommends pairing Pinot Grigio with nachos and Shiraz Rose with salt and vinegar crisps. A Riesling is the perfect companion to a sausage roll, Chardonnay goes great with wasabi peas or pittas and hummus, and Merlot is the best glass to compliment a box of chocolates. Tasters at Jacob's Creek sampled different types of wine with 10 of the nation's most popular snacks and light bites. They even found that different wines match different pizza toppings - with Shiraz best for a margherita but a meaty Cabernet Sauvignon with a pepperoni. Meanwhile, Sauvignon Blanc was found to be the perfect pairing for salted popcorn and a Scotch Egg goes down a treat with a drop of Fiano. TV cook and author, Jo Pratt, who took part in the tasting session with Jacob's Creek wine maker Rebekah Richardson, said: 'There are plenty of guidelines out there about the best wines to drink with main meals but there isn't really any inspiration for which wines to enjoy with smaller plates or snacks. 'So it's brilliant to know you can now enjoy a delicious wine that perfectly complements the flavours of whatever you're eating. 'Whether that's a Sunday roast with all the family, or a well-deserved treat just for you, and wasabi peas and Chardonnay was a real eye opener.' In order to decide on the perfect pairings, 11 types of wine were tried with each of the different foods, with Jo and Rebekah smelling and tasting the food and the drink before pairing them up from a total of 110 possible combinations. The next time you order a cheese and tomato pizza, opt for a spicy Shiraz as its spicy fruit flavours can stand up to the strong aromatic herbs, tangy tomato sauce and salty cheese . They found sausage rolls are paired perfectly with the Riesling due to the 'buttery pastry and rich pork balancing the lime and green apple flavours of the wine'. For pizza, the toppings make a difference to the choice of wine, with a Margherita matched with Shiraz, thanks to its 'spicy fruit flavours standing up well' to the herbs, tomato sauce and cheese topping. But if you opt for a pepperoni pizza, you should serve it with a Cabernet Sauvignon thanks to the 'meaty wine going great with the aniseed kick of the pepperoni'. Chardonnay works with wasabi peas due to the 'creaminess of the wine taking the heat out of the horseradish' with toasted pittas and hummus going nicely with the same wine because of the 'peach and melon notes complimenting the nutty flavours of the chickpeas'. For Scotch eggs, a Fiano complimented the flavours well and for salt and vinegar crisps, a Shiraz Rose was found to be the best match. Experts at the Australian winery put together the new wine matching guide after a survey of 2,000 adults revealed 57 per cent are regularly replacing evening weekday meals with snacks, such as pizza, nachos and pittas and dips. And more than half said they would like to know more about the wines that go with the foods they regularly eat. Seventy-one per cent also admitted they felt there is too much snobbery associated with wine selection. Jacob's Creeks' Rebekah Richardson added: 'Whatever the dish you're cooking, wherever you are in the world, it's not hard to find a recommendation for the best wine to pair it with. 'We're passionate about making quality wines that are great for sharing with good friends and family, and we wanted to celebrate those authentic moments when people are together enjoying a glass of wine with a snack as well. 'This guide helps people make the most of that time, with a glass of wine that tastes amazing with their favourite treat. 'Britons told us they wanted to know about the best wines to go with snacks like wasabi peas, popcorn and chocolate as well as old favourites like pizza. 'And, this new take on wine pairings is the perfect solution.' Margherita Pizza . Wine match: Shiraz . Why it works: Spicy fruit flavours with plum and pepper can stand up to the strong aromatic herbs, tangy tomato sauce and salty cheese that makes a perfect Margherita pizza . Pepperoni Pizza . Wine match: Cabernet Sauvignon . Why it works: The cabernet sauvignon, rich in blackcurrent and plum, is a meaty wine great with the aniseed spice kick of the pepperoni. The hint of oak provides a dryness that helps balance out the richness of the cheese and oil from the sausage. Sausage Roll . Wine match: Riesling . Why it works: The butteriness in the pastry and the richness of the pork is great with the slight acid from lime and green apple in the Riseling. Nachos with guacamole, sour cream and salsa . Wine match: Pinot Grigio . Why it works: From the tangy kick from the salsa to the creaminess of sour cream there's a lot going on in a plate of nachos so Pinot Grigio is a subtle wine which can get along with a mix of flavours. Toasted pitta and hummus . Wine match: Chardonnay . Why it works: Fruit flavours of peach and melon, coupled with a subtle touch of oak flavours complements the nutty nature of the chickpeas. Sea salt and balsamic vinegar crisps . Wine match: Shiraz Rose . Why it works: The fresh raspberry and cherry flavours and the hints of spice in the wine work well with the sharpness of the vinegar . Wasabi peas . Wine match: Chardonnay . Why it works: The creaminess of the wine takes the heat out of the horseradish in the peas. Chocolate . Wine match: Merlot . Why it works: The softness of the tannins and slight sweet fruit in the back matches really nicely with rich chocolate . Salted Popcorn . Wine match: Sauvignon Blanc . Why it works: The slightly herbaceous, grassy flavours of the sauv blanc match the salty flavours of the pork scratchings . Gourmet Scotch egg . Wine match: Fiano .

"Police are hunting two schoolboys who doused a fellow 12-year-old pupil in highly flammable WD40 in an underpass before threatening to set him alight . The victim, who has not been named, was walking in the subway underneath a major road in Newbury, Berkshire, when two boys - aged about 12 to 13 - approached him. They sprayed the highly flammable WD40, usually used on cars or locks, over him before producing a lighter and threatening to burn him. The 12-year-old victim, who is yet to be named, was walking in a subway (pictured) underneath a road in Newbury, Berkshire, when two boys approached him, doused him in WD40 and vowed to set him alight . Officers from Thames Valley Police are now hunting the pair following their threats in broad daylight on Easter Monday afternoon. The victim sustained minor injuries but did not require hospital treatment. Police said the first offender is described as short and slim with brown hair. He was wearing a grey zip-up hooded top and blue chinos. The second is described as being stocky, about 5ft 4ins, with dark brown hair which was brushed flat. He was wearing a grey jacket, brown T-shirt and grey tracksuit bottoms. Colin Fearn, the investigating officer in the case, described the attack as 'unprovoked' and urged witnesses to come forward.

Luke Brett Moore, 27, managed to live a life of excess despite being on social security because of a bank fault . He dipped into the account 48 times and spent the money on a number of expensive items. Moore's luxury haul included a Maserati, an Alfa Romeo, a power boat, a Michael Jackson autograph, a signed photograph of the Top Gear hosts and numerous paintings. To avoid being caught, the 27-year-old moved the funds to PayPal and National Australia Bank accounts. While Moore was spending up big, he was also receiving Centrelink payments between March and July in 2010, according to Fairfax Media. Police seized a red Alfa Romeo. Moore was receiving Centrelink payments while he was overdrawing his account . To conceal his exploits, Moore moved the money into his PayPal account as well as into his National Australia Bank account . A framed Michael Jackson autograph with the late singer's photo and music CD was found in Moore's West Goulburn home . This is signed photograph of Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond . It has been more than two years since New South Wales police raided his West Goulburn home on December 12, 2012. There officers seized hundreds-of-thousands of dollars that the prosecutors said were funded by his exploits. Moore was soon charged but it took more than 26 months for him to be finally found guilty of the two offences. When the jury delivered their verdict, a family member who had come to support the 27-year-old broke down and had to be escorted from the court room. Sports memorabilia, including this Chicago Bulls jersey signed by former basketballer Michael Jordan, was also found in Moore's home . A power boat was also found among his luxury haul. Moore will be sentenced on Friday in a Sydney court . Moore was taken into custody on February 19 this year after he had been allowed out on bail . He was found guilty of knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime and dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception . Moore was taken into custody after he had been allowed out on bail. He is set to be sentenced in Sydney's Downing Centre District Court on Friday. Daily Mail Australia has contacted St George Bank for a comment on the matter. A bank spokeswoman told News Corp that incidents like Moore's were rare and happened due to a 'human error'. She said the bank was taking steps to recover the money.

"Johnny Manziel was spotted for the first time since being released from rehab. The footballer checked into a facility on January 28 after stating that he wanted to 'be a better family member, friend and teammate,' and Tuesday night the Cleveland Browns quarterback was seen enjoying a Texas Rangers game with girlfriend Colleen Crowley. He also stayed away from the booze, sipping water throughout the game. This as offseason workouts with the team will begin next Monday, April 20. Scroll down for videos . Johnny Manziel was spotted at a Texas Rangers game Tuesday night days after leaving rehab . He was joined by his girlfriend Colleen Crowley and sipped water throughout the night . Manziel (above) has been released from rehab after entering a facility on January 28 . This after Manziel's partying had been a topic of conversation since his rookie season began last July, with some worried his drinking was a priority . According to ESPN, Manziel was 'doing great' in rehab, and had the full support of his team. Now comes the real test however, as he will be forced to compete with Josh McCown for the starting quarterback position, who just signed a $14 million contract with the team that covers the next three seasons. This after a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts, Manziel was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the end of the Cleveland Browns season last December, but talk soon turned to whether or not the accomplished footballer might have a problem. Especially after one incident last year when, after partying until well past midnight, Manziel, who is suffering from an injured hamstring, skipped out on a Saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept, and in turn was fined by the Browns. Manziel was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior, saying; 'It’s about being accountable . . . instead of looking like a jackass.' And while his season may have been over at that time, many believed Manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy, which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at FDR Lounge at the Delano in Miami on over the New Year holiday, alongside the likes of LeBron James and Ryan Phillippe, and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend Colleen Crowley and some buddies poolside at the Delano. At this point, some in the sports world, chief among them columnist Skip Bayless, began to suggest that the Heisman Trophy winner needed to get help for his drinking. The aqthlete was in treatment for roughly six weeks before being released . Appearing on ESPN’s First Take, Bayless, a noted supporter of Manziel, did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking. 'My concern, I repeatedly said, was if Johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol, and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails, then I’m going to be out,' said Bayless. 'In talking to people in and around the Cleveland Browns, I believe Johnny Manziel continues to have a problem with alcohol. And I believe ... that it is time for Johnny to get some help. He continues to lie to his executives, to his coaches, to his teammates, to the media, and most of all, he continues to lie to himself.' He then said he would label Manziel an 'alcoholic.' Manziel was known for his partying while at Texas A&M, but said he was a changed man during the 2014 NFL Draft, noting that he had 'grown up,' before being selected 22nd overall by Cleveland. Just days into his training with the Browns however, the local press began calling him out on his partying, which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field. A source told Cleveland.com at the time; 'Team officials had bought into Manziel's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat-boy lifestyle back in College Station, Texas, and they've been stunned by his non-stop antics.' A photo snapped of Manziel before the start of the season and later posted to Instagram showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter . Manziel while the 2013 Heisman Trophy as the quarterback of the Texas A&M University Aggies . Also causing some alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of Manziel and later posted to Instagram that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter, leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine. Browns head coach Mike Pettine spoke to Manziel soon after the problematic photo was posted, a photo that could have led to an inquiry or a drug test from the NFL, and said he felt that things were back on track and that Manziel was focused on football once again. There was also an odd incident during the regular season when he got into a fight with a fan in the lobby of his apartment building, and while alcohol seems to have played a role in the incident, it was the fan who was inebriated, not Manziel. It should be noted that a very thorough and detailed story published by ESPN in 2013 said that after his arrest for disorderly conduct back in 2012 and while still at college, Manziel did seek help for an alcohol problem, seeing an counselor for six or seven weeks. Manziel would later claim this report was false, and that he had never seen a counselor for anger management or for alcohol abuse while in college. Manziel is now set to begin offseason workouts with the Cleveland Browns on April 20 . As for his future with the Browns, that is a little unclear. Some, including ESPN's Pat McManamon, have called on the Browns to fire Manziel after he overslept for his treatment last year, saying he and fellow player Josh Gordon have a 'complete lack of professionalism.' Gordon was also out with Manziel and showed up late for the team walk-through, an offense that carried a far stiffer punishment for the starter as he was forced to sit out the final game of the season. Currently, Manziel has a four year contract with the Browns worth about $8.25 million. The 22-year-old also has some of the most coveted, and lucrative, endorsement deals in the sports world with, among others, Nike, McDonald's, MusclePharm, and Snickers. For now though, Manziel seems to be committed to laying low and focusing on the football. 'When [Manziel] is back, it will be full speed ahead for him, said Pettine. 'I think he's very anxious at this point. We'll be prepared as we will with every other player. When they get back to town, we're going to coach the heck out of them.'","Johnny Manziel was spotted at a Texas Rangers game Tuesday night just days after leaving rehab and was drinking water all night .

His body was wrapped in an industrial-size bin bag with duct tape round it when it appeared on a beach in nearby Orihuela Costa. Civil Guard officers in Alicante confirmed today they believe Monk, from Essex, may be implicated in the violent death and named him as an associate of Paul Scott. Scott, 32, was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine after being caught trying to sneak into Britain in a light aircraft last December. He was also wanted for questioning over Mr Brennan's murder when he was detained. Guardia Civil described him last night as the suspected mastermind of the crime. Monk was detained at a four-bedroom property in Javea near Alicante as he directed workers laying a marble patio around his swimming pool. An imitation firearm with a silencer and nearly £100,000 in cash were also found. He is being held in jail and is expected to be charged and face trial in Spain over Mr Brennan's murder before being extradited to the UK to face questioning over alleged drugs offences. He has been linked to the handover of one kilo of cocaine in Cockfosters, London, in May 2013 and the seizure of 24 kilos of cannabis in Colchester in October 2013. A Civil Guard spokesman said: 'He never left his house as a security measure to avoid being arrested. 'He got other people to bring him food and other things in the villa where he hid out, leading the life of an authentic fugitive.'

He travelled to the Costa del Sol with his girlfriend towards the end of 2013 after ignoring the advice of his parents to stay in Britain. Police swooped on Scott last year after he flew from Holland to a remote airstrip in Norfolk. He had fake Belgian identity documents on him and more than £1,500 in cash. He was jailed in January for plotting to import 40 tonnes of cocaine into Britain. Police described him as the 'last man outstanding in a criminal gang that plotted to smuggle vast quantities of cocaine into the UK' after he was sentenced to 14 years in prison at Liverpool Crown Court.

Obama loosened the trade embargo early this year with a series of executive actions that allow easier U.S. travel to Cuba, more remittances to the island and, at least on paper, U.S. exports to support the island's relatively new private business sector. Obama also moved to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terror, removing a barrier to access to the global financial system. Cuban officials have been pushing Obama to go further with measures that could include more specific federal licenses for U.S. businesses to trade with Cuba in ways currently prohibited. 'The president of the United States has the ability to grant licenses to businesses so that businesses can actually start developing right now in select areas and those are areas that we want to pursue,' Cuomo said. Ten previous U.S. governors have visited Cuba since 1999 but none since 2010, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.","Cuomo first US governor to visit Cuba since ease on trade and travel .

"You might have seen fantastic images of the sun before, or even clips showing its activity - but you’ve never seen anything like this. An incredible video has stitched together footage from a Nasa spacecraft, revealed the beauty of the solar surface as it bursts with energy. Taken over five years, the footage includes plasma raining down on the sun, an extreme solar eruption and even a comet breezing through the sun’s atmosphere. Scroll down for video . Filmmaker Michael König from Cologne, Germany has created an amazing video showing solar activity (shown). It was made by stitching together footage from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory over five years . The movie, called Sun, was created by filmmaker Michael König from Cologne, Germany. It uses footage recorded by Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft between 2011 and 2015. ‘This montage features excerpts of 4K full-disk pictures in extreme ultraviolet channels,’ explained Mr König, and it ‘offers a glance at spicules, solar flares, filaments and an overview of the sun’s atmosphere.’ Highlights of the video include large, bright tendrils extending outward from the sun’s surface and occasionally crashing down again - known as solar prominences. Other fantastic sections show bright, active regions on the sun’s surface as magnetic fields send it into turmoil. Transits of the moon, Venus and Earth across the sun, as observed from the SDO, are also seen, while towards the end of the video Comet Lovejoy can be seen passing the sun in December 2011. Another incredible part of the video shows ‘coronal rain’ streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun’s surface. Coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun’s atmosphere - cools and condenses in strong magnetic fields. The plasma is attracted to the magnetic fields and condenses, slowly falling back to the solar surface over several hours. Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), illustrated below, was launched on 11 February 2010 and has observed the sun ever since. It's goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around Earth. By watching the sun in different wavelengths - and therefore different temperatures - scientists can watch how material courses through the corona, which holds clues to what causes eruptions on the sun, what heats the sun's atmosphere up to 1,000 times hotter than its surface, and why the sun's magnetic fields are constantly on the move. SDO also measures fluctuations in the sun's extreme ultraviolet output, which provides the majority of energy for heating Earth's upper atmosphere. Five years into its mission, SDO continues to send back tantalizing imagery to incite scientists' curiosity. For example, in late 2014, SDO captured imagery of the largest sun spots seen since 1995 as well as a torrent of intense solar flares. Another incredible part of the video shows ‘coronal rain’ (pictured) streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun’s surface. Coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun’s atmosphere - condenses and falls back to the surface . Elsewhere, solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are seen erupting on the sun’s surface, sending out huge amounts of energy. CMEs are the huge waves of material that are seen in images of the sun, and they can pose a threat to satellites in Earth orbit. Solar flares are flashes of energy on the surface of the sun, which are sometimes associated with CMEs - although their connection is not well understood. The video, though, is a reminder of just how beautiful, powerful and active our solar system’s only star can be.

"Nigel Farage is touring the country hoping to show how Britain can cope without Europe. But the Ukip leader's campaign came to an embarrassing halt when on a tour of a hinge factory he met an Hungarian worker who spoke no English. After an awkward exchange with Ivan Loncsarevity at the plant in Essex, Mr Farage was quick to insist he did not want to send EU migrants home to stop them taking the jobs of young Britons. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage had an awkward exchange with Hungarian Ivan Loncsarevity at a hinge factory in Essex . Mr Farage's immigration policy has been shrouded in confusion for weeks, as the party flip-flops between setting a target for net migration and insisting targets do not work. He wants an Australian-style system to set targets for the level of skills needed for someone to come to Britain in search of work. At present no limits can be put on workers from elsewhere in the European Union under freedom of information rules. Mr Farage today visited hinge manufacturer NICO in Clacton, Essex to promote his party's election policies. He was campaigning with Ukip MP Douglas Carswell (left) who hopes to hold the seat he won after defecting from the Tories last year . After meeting several workers, he struggled to make small talk when he met 62-year-old Hungarian Mr Loncsarevity. He has lived in Colchester for five years after travelling to the UK for work, but could not answer any of Mr Farage's questions as he does not speak any English. His colleagues described him as 'relatively low-skilled'. Mr Farage has previously railed against the number of people from elsewhere in Europe working in the UK. Last year he said: 'When you boil it down to Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, over a million of their workers are in Britain and only 42,000 British citizens are working in those countries.' Mr Farage was campaigning with Ukip MP Douglas Carswell (left) who hopes to hold the seat he won after defecting from the Tories last year . But today he insisted he would not want to send Mr Loncsarevity back to Hungary. 'Ukip has never said anyone should leave the country, so the question is entirely baseless,' he told reporters. 'One of the big problems that we've got in engineering is a real shortage of young people studying engineering to go into trades such as this, which is regrettable. 'We've got rid of technical colleges and encouraged more and more young people to go to university and study degrees which are not directly linked to industry such as this. 'If there's no British person trained to do that job, then that says more about us than them.' NICO's manufacturing manager, Steve Dalton, said that the firm needed to look to Eastern Europe to fill a skills gap and on occasion had flown potential employees from Poland. Mr Dalton said he was not a Ukip supporter but did not oppose the party's proposal of an Australian-style points system designed to limit the number of immigrants. He said: 'There needs to be some controls but presumably, if we needed to fill a skills gap, we would still be able to do that under such a system.' The company employs 130 people, six of whom are migrants from Eastern Europe. Finance director Gillian Hagger said: 'A lot of industries in the UK do need migrant workers. 'The area we're in means we've got a large pool to recruit from but sometimes we find their skills are limited. On those occasions we have had to look further afield, including flying interviewees in from Poland.' Mr Farage was quick to insist he did not want to send EU migrants home to stop them taking the jobs of young Britons . Later Mr Farage visited the town's Copping Community Centre with Douglas Carswell - the first person to be elected as a Ukip MP after defecting from the Conservatives. He met supporters and again spoke of the lack of young British people pursuing careers in manufacturing and leaving engineering firms with a 'genuine shortage' of skilled workers. He said: 'We will say that anyone doing engineering at degree level should not be paying any tuition fees.' In November, Ukip's Mark Reckless suggested that European migrants would only be allowed to stay for a 'fixed period' if Britain chose to leave the EU. Mr Farage later insisted there had been 'confusion' and insisted Ukip respected the 'rule of law and British justice'.","Ukip leader lost for words as he met Ivan Loncsarevity at the plant in Essex .

"Ten former Atlanta public school educators, convicted earlier this month of racketeering in one of the largest U.S. test-cheating scandals, were told to consider plea deals or face significantly more time behind bars. Fulton County Judge Jerry Baxter urged the defendants during the  sentencing hearing on Monday to accept deals with the prosecution in the trial over a widespread conspiracy to cheat on state tests. He also threatened prison sentences for them if they fail to reach those deals. 'I've got a fair sentence in my mind and it involves going to jail for everybody,' said Baxter. He also said, 'I don't think you want to go my way. Either it's my way or a negotiated plea.' The sentencing will resume on Tuesday. Scroll down for video .

Reverend Bernice King (left), daughter of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr and Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young were both present in court on Monday . If the convicted educators accept deals, they would be required to apologize and waive their right to appeal, and former administrators would be given punishments from one year of weekend jail time and a $10,000 fine, according to the AJC. Former teachers and testing coordinators would be given one year of home confinement and a $1,000 fine. During a trial lasting nearly six months, prosecutors accused the defendants of erasing incorrect answers or instructing students to change their answers so the educators could secure promotions and cash bonuses in the 50,000-student Atlanta school system in 2009. The educators fed answers to students or erased and changed the answers on tests after they were turned in to secure promotions or up to $5,000 each in bonuses. However, the person accused of benefiting the most from the conspiracy, Superintendent Beverly Hall - who is thought to have received up to $500,000 in bonus payouts - died of breast cancer over the course of the trial. A total of 35 Atlanta educators were indicted in March 2013 on charges including racketeering, making false statements and theft. Many pleaded guilty before the trial, and some of them testified at the months-long trial. The jury acquitted one of the 12 former educators who had been on trial and convicted the other 11 on a racketeering charge, and were facing up to 20 years in prison. They were all found guilty under the the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, which is typically reserved for major mobsters and organized crime bosses. On Monday during the sentencing, Baxter said any children who were promoted based on false test scores were the real victims, adding that can lead to students later dropping out of school because they cannot do the work, having been cheated out of the earlier education. Such children often end up in trouble with the law, he said. 'They are the most vulnerable children in our city, and they were short-changed,' Baxter said. 'They were passed on and now they're in the prison system.' Baxter heard from character witnesses for 10 of the 11 defendants convicted this month of racketeering for their roles in a scheme to inflate students' scores on standardized exams. The witnesses — mostly friends and relatives of the defendants — pleaded for mercy and described the former educators' passion for teaching and dedication to their students, which often extended to devoting their personal time and money to help.

The 11th former educator who was convicted was pregnant when the jury reached its verdict and gave birth over the weekend. She is set to be sentenced later. Baxter listened carefully, often asking questions, and said repeatedly that while he didn't doubt the former educators' commitment and teaching ability, he believed they had made bad decisions. Whenever a witness or defense attorney questioned the jury's verdict, the judge quickly made it clear that he had heard the evidence and agreed with the verdict. Baxter said he arrived at work Monday with what he believed to be a fair sentence in mind. However, District Attorney Paul Howard told him he had been speaking with defense attorneys over the weekend and that he believed the case could be resolved with negotiated pleas, eliminating the possibility of appeals that could stretch on for years. 'I just see all the pain in this room,' Baxter said. 'It's a tragedy for all of you — the defendants, your families, your friends.' The only reason he would send them to jail, he said, would be for retribution. Fulton County Senior Asst. DA Clint Rucker talks with another member of the prosecution team during witness statements for the defendants . Former U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young testifies during witness statements at the sentencing asking the judge for leniency arguing that the former educators have much to offer the community if they are spared prison . 'I just think the best thing for our community in this whole sordid mess is for Paul Howard to talk to each of you and enter pleas,' Baxter said before calling a late lunch break around 2pm. When the hearing resumed an hour later, Baxter said the court would recess until Tuesday morning to give defense attorneys time to discuss with the district attorney about possible deals. Howard said he wants to see the defendants accept responsibility. Bernice King, daughter of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, last week urged the judge to spare the 11 educators from prison. Former elementary school principal Dana Evans was one of only two former educators who addressed the judge herself on Monday. She apologized and appealed to his sense of compassion, and Baxter made it clear he had sympathy for her, saying, 'you were under so much pressure, so my heart goes out to you.' In 2008, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published a series of articles that questioned the veracity of test scores across the Atlanta school school system, which has 50,000 students . The newspaper contended the scores were statistically improbable . Gov. Sonny Perdue subsequently launched an investigation, which concluded in June 2011 . Superintendent Beverly L. Hall was the alleged ringleader of the cheating scandal, but denied any involvement. She died of breast cancer last month . It found at least 44 schools were guilty of cheating, dating back to 2005 . Educators fed answers to students or erased and changed answers on tests after they were turned in . One principal wore gloves as she erased and changed the answers . Nearly 180 employees, including 38 principals, were accused of wrongdoing . The report said Superintendent Beverly L. Hall (right) had 'created a culture of fear, intimidation and retaliation' that had permitted 'cheating — at all levels — to go unchecked for years' The cheating allowed educators to collect bonuses and improve the ailing reputation of the Atlanta school system, the investigation found . It allowed them to accept bonuses of up to $5,000 each, however Dr Hall is believed to have accepted up to $500,000 . In March 2013, Dr Hall and 34 educators were indicted by a grand jury on charges including racketeering, making false statements and theft . 21 of the educators plead guilty to reach plea agreements . They received between 250 and 1,000 hours of community service and must repay their bonuses . 12 educators chose to stand trial . The trail started in August 2014 . Dr Hall did not stand trial or accept a plea, claiming she was too sick . She died of breast cancer in March 2015 . Prosecutors said the 12 were looking out for themselves rather than their students . On Wednesday, only one of the 12 educators were acquitted . The 11 educators - teachers, a principal and other administrators - were found guilty . The racketeering charges carry up to 20 years in prison . Source: AP, The New York Times . 'I know you want to hear an admission of guilt, but I can't do that because it's not true,' Evans told the judge, but added that she could say she is sorry. One defense attorney called former Atlanta mayor and United Nations ambassador Andrew Young to testify. Young said he had no connection to any of the defendants, but that his family includes many teachers. 'We have messed up education so much. Tests and grades do not make you educated,' he said on Monday, later adding, 'I think these teachers got caught in a trap.' Young asked Baxter for leniency, saying educators are 'the backbone of this society' and arguing that the former educators have much to offer the community if they are spared prison. Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools, with nearly 180 educators involved, and investigators found teachers who tried to report it faced retaliation. The cheating is believed to date back to 2001, when scores on statewide skills tests began to turn around in the 50,000-student school district. Between 2005 and 2009, test answers were altered and falsely certified, according to the 2013 indictment. On Monday, Larry Pratt (above holding a memorial program for former superintendent Beverly Hall) protesters stood outside of the Fulton County courthouse with others during a protest to free the 11 educators . Protesters chant outside the Fulton County courthouse on Monday during the sentencing hearing of the convicted former educators . According to Governing.com, most educators' bonuses didn't exceed a total of $5,000 between 2005 and 2009. The months-long trial began in August with more than six weeks of jury selection, and testimony concluded in late February. The criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney's office lasted nearly two years. It only came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2008 that some test scores were statistically improbable. Howard the case was the biggest and most complex his office had ever handled lasting nearly two years and involved hundreds of interviews with school administrators, staff, parents and students.","Fulton County Judge Jerry Baxter urged defendants to accept sentencing deals on Monday or face significantly more time behind bars .
11 former teachers, testing coordinators and other administrators were convicted earlier this month of racketeering after a five-year investigation .
If former administrators accept deals, they would get punishments from one year of weekend jail time and a $10,000 fine .
If former teachers and testing coordinators accept deals, they would be given one year of home confinement and a $1,000 fine .
Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools across the Atlanta school system, with nearly 180 educators involved .

"This is the embarrassing moment a Buckingham Palace guard slipped and fell on a manhole cover in front of hundreds of shocked tourists as he took up position in his sentry box. The Queen's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera. He lost his footing and slid sideways, knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle. The Queen's Guard (pictured) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week. Unfortunately for him, the entire incident was caught on a tourist's camera . The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened. But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment. Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon. Mr Meadwell, 50, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: 'I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards. Tourist David Meadwell shot this footage of the Changing of the Guard last week when the incident unfolded . The moment it all started to go wrong: The guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip . The unidentified young guard's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away . The guard, wearing full regalia, falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up . 'The first group changed successfully, without any problems, and so I decided to video the next group doing it. 'I didn't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying. There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down. 'I think he just slipped on a manhole cover, he looked so embarrassed.' The unnamed solider is thought to have slipped because of the metal protectors nailed to the soles of his boots. Tourists gather in their thousands to watch the changing of the guard outside Buckingham Palace at 11.30am every day in the summer and every other day in the winter. The Guard comprises two detachments, one each for Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace, under the command of the Captain of The Queen's Guard. Contrary to popular belief they are not purely ceremonial and are fully operational soldiers. The Ministry of Defence said they would not comment on 'a young man falling over while doing his job'. The embarrassed guard hastily scrambled to his feet following the unfortunate tumble at the palace .

"Kevin Carr is set to complete his epic 16,300 round-the-world trip tomorrow in Devon after 19 months . A British barman is set to enter the record books after running 16,300 miles around the globe over 621 days while wearing out 16 pairs of shoes. Kevin Carr set off from Haytor on Dartmoor in July 2013 and every day since then he has completed on average one and a quarter marathons a day. Now, after covering an estimated 36,000,000 steps over the past 19 months he is just 24 hours from returning to his starting point. And in the process, he will become the fastest man to ever run around the world. The 35-year-old from Woolacombe in Devon is currently in his home county and is due to complete his 16,300-mile epic journey on Thursday. If he is successful, Mr Carr will beat the current record held by Australian ultramarathon runner Tom Denniss, by 24 hours. Mr Denniss completed his run in 2013. Mr Carr's effort is the first unsupported trip around the world, having relied on the generosity of people he has met on his journey. At the start of March, Mr Carr was seven days behind schedule, but he managed to increase his daily run to 44 miles and is now a day ahead of schedule. During his run, Mr Carr has travelled though 26 countries, across Europe, Australia, New Zealand and North and South America. For most of his journey, Mr Carr pushed his tent in front of him in a giant buggy although he was able to ditch that back in Ireland. Mr Carr embarked on his epic journey to raise money for the mental health charity Sane because he has suffered from depression. His goal, as well as raising cash, is to prove that because someone my be sometimes ill, they do not have 'a weak mind'. He told The Independent: 'I have always wanted to see how far I can go. What's the limit to our endurance? I simply want to hold the record as the fastest man around the world. It's the purest test of endurance, the natural limit of planet Earth. 'You simply cannot go further on our world, unless you begin running laps.' Mr Carr ran through Europe, before flying to India and then onto Australia and New Zealand. He then went to Canada and the United States, before crossing Chile and Argentina. Finally he flew into the west coast of Ireland before arriving back in Devon. Mr Carr, pictured, has crossed five continents epic journey, starting in Haytor, on Dartmoor in Devon . During his journey, Mr Carr pushed a cart containing all his belongings including his tent . Mr Carr, pictured, is just hours away from completing his trip in a record time beating the previous holder . He said: 'I've pushed my tired legs through most of Europe, India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US. ""I'have encountered some pretty scary things along the way, from packs of wild dogs in Romania to the most extreme weather conditions imaginable. 'Most frightening of all, however, was coming face-to-face with bears in Canada. 'One of the bears stalked and then actively came for me. 'I used the bear bangers that someone had given me and, after three misfires, thankfully my fourth attempt sent the bear packing. 'I've had to endure a lot of suffering too. I had severe heatstroke in India and have twice been hit by cars.' During his trip, Mr Carr, pictured, has been chased by wild dogs and come face-to-face with bears . Mr Carr, pictured, is expected to complete his journey tomorrow - beating the previous record by 24 hours .","Kevin Carr set off on his epic journey from Haytor, Dartmoor in July 2013 .

"The British Army fired 46 million bullets at the Taliban during the eight-year Afghanistan conflict at a cost of £200 million in ammunition alone. The large amount of ammunition expended during the conflict shows the intense nature of the fighting between British troops and their Taliban opponents. According to data released by the Ministry of Defence, some 27 million 5.56 rounds were fired from either the standard SA-80 assault rifle or minimi machine gun. The British Army fired approximately 10,000 rounds from their SA-80 assault rifles during Afghan conflict . Each of the 5.56mm rounds, pictured, used in the SA-80 assault rifle costs approximately 50p . Each round cost approximately 50p. A further two million 9mm rounds were fired from handguns. According to a Freedom of Information request by the Daily Mirror, at least 80,000, 105mm artillery shells - at a cost of £1,250 each - were fired at Taliban positions. Soldiers went through an estimated £5,000 worth of ammunition for the their assault rifles every day during the eight-year conflict. A further 55,000, 30mm rounds were fired from Apache gunships. Each of these rounds costs about £65, but are able to go through solid concrete and can destroy a Taliban vehicle in seconds. The helicopters are able to provide vital close air support for ground troops pinned down by the opposition. SAS veteran Robert Henry Craft told the Mirror: 'The amount of ammo expended shows how British troops in Afghanistan were fighting for their lives every day. 'That so many 9mm rounds were used shows how close the fighting was at times'. The conflict claimed 453 UK lives. One former SAS solider, not pictured, said British troops were fighting for their lives on a daily basis .","Some 27 million rounds were fired from the Army's SA-80 assault rifles .

The video cuts to jihadists speaking directly to the camera with one declaring they destroyed the site because it is 'worshipped instead of God'. Elsewhere in the clip, ISIS thugs balanced precariously on ladders use a hammer to bang repeatedly on the back of carved faces on the side of the ancient walls until they topple with a crash to the ground. They are also filmed blasting Kalashnikov rifles at artefacts in the city that was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. The footage was posted to a militant website frequently used by the terrorist organisation. ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. The fanatics claim ancient relics are 'false idols' which promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. Authorities also believe they have been sold on the black market to fund their atrocities.

In between the shocking acts of destruction, the video pans to two militants speaking and brandishing their fingers directly into the camera . The slickly produced seven minute clip begins with an aerial shot over the ancient site where relics have been destroyed by ISIS . Hatra, 68 miles southwest of ISIS-held city of Mosul, is 2,000 years old and is a UNESCO World Heritage site . ISIS have destroyed ancient relics such as this in Hatra, as they violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law . Last month, ISIS terrorists were pictured toppling crosses, smashing Christian relics with hammers and erecting the black flag of ISIS on churches in Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian empire. Pictured in civilian clothing, the ISIS thugs were seen overturning statues, destroying religious icons and replacing Christian crosses with the chilling ISIS banner. Elsewhere, ISIS went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. The jihadists also bulldozed ruins in Hatra in March. ISIS have also set off bombs around Mosul Central Library, destroying as many as 10,000 priceless and irreplaceable books and manuscripts. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon called the Nimrud attack 'a war crime.' Hatra, 68 miles southwest of the ISIS-held city of Mosul, was a large fortified city during the Parthian Empire and capital of the first Arab kingdom. It is home to numerous temples and sculptures dedicated to gods including Apollo and Poseidon. The video comes in the wake of a major blow for ISIS, with Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit falling into the hands of the Iraqi government. Tikrit is 80 miles north of Baghdad on the main highway to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. Meanwhile Isis has taken control of 90 per cent of a Palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of Damascus - only a few kilometres from Bashar al-Assad's stronghold. A human rights monitoring group claimed that the terror organisation almost has full control of the camp which has a population of 18,000 civilians. The United Nations said it was very concerned about the safety of the population. Chris Gunness of the UN Relief and Works agency said: 'The situation in Yarmouk is an affront to the humanity of all of us, a source of universal shame. 'Yarmouk is a test, a challenge for the international community. We must not fail. The credibility of the international system itself is at stake.' The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights warned that the population of the camp are under threat of death from Isis, hunger and disease. Hatra is 68 miles southwest of the city of Mosul. It dates back 2,000 years to the Seleucid empire which controlled a large part of the ancient world conquered by Alexander the Great. It is famous for its striking pillared temple at the centre of a sprawling archaeological site. The ancient city, a UNESCO world heritage site, is said to have withstood invasions by the Romans thanks to its high, thick walls reinforced by towers. A temple to the Shamash sun god still stands more than 1,750 years after the Sassanian empire razed the Mesopotamian city. The ancient trading centre in Hatra spanned 4 miles in circumference and was supported by more than 160 towers. At its heart are a series of temples with a grand temple at the center — a structure supported by columns that once rose to 100 feet.","Jihadists shown smashing shrines and statues in 2,000-year old city that was declared a World Heritage site in 1987 .

"Sugar consumption: Researchers in the US examined the effects of sweetened drinks on 19 women aged between 18 and 40 (file picture) If you’re feeling stressed in the office, a sweet tea or coffee can seem like the perfect pick-me-up. According to scientists, sugar consumption can suppress the hormone cortisol, which is released into the body when we are experiencing stress. Researchers in the US examined the effects of sweetened drinks on 19 women aged between 18 and 40. Half the group were given sugary drinks at breakfast, lunch and dinner over 12 days, while the other half had drinks made with the artificial sweetener aspartame. The volunteers were instructed not to consume other sugary drinks, including fruit juice, outside these times. Before and after the study period, the women were given a difficult maths test and then underwent MRI scans to measure the response of their brains to stress. Saliva samples were also used to measure levels of cortisol, which is made by the adrenal glands. The women who had been drinking sugary beverages released less cortisol during the maths test than those given the artificially sweetened drinks. Dr Kevin Laugero, one of the researchers at the University of California, Davis, said: ‘This is the first evidence that high sugar consumption – but not aspartame – may relieve stress in humans.’ Finding: Scientists at the University of California, Davis (above) said the women who had been drinking sugary beverages released less cortisol during the maths test than those given the artificially sweetened drinks . However, while research shows sugary drinks can help to dull feelings of anxiety, experts warn that too many of them could be habit-forming – and may explain the desire to comfort eat under pressure. Dr Laugero, whose findings were published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, warned that chronic stress could prompt people to make a habit of consuming too much sugar, which is not recommended due to its links to health problems. He said: ‘The concern is that psychological or emotional stress could trigger the habitual overconsumption of sugar and amplify sugar’s detrimental health effects, including obesity.’ In the US, more than a third of adults and about a sixth of children are obese, with sugar-laden fizzy drinks and fruit juice partly to blame. Around half of the American population consume sugary drinks on any given day. Dr Laugero added: ‘The results suggest differences in dietary habits may explain why some people under-react to stressful situations and others over-react. ‘Although it may be tempting to suppress feelings of stress, a normal reaction to stress is important to good health.’","Researchers in US examine effects of sweetened drinks on 19 women .

"A filthy pub where 24 customers were struck down with food poisoning was found with mouse droppings on the floor and rotting meat in the kitchen. Environmental health were called to The Sutton Arms, in Elton, Stockton last year after two dozen people suffered gastroenteritis after eating at the pub on Easter Sunday. Inspectors discovered evidence of a rodent infestation in the food storage area which was littered with droppings and food past its sell-by date. A box of meat with a broken lid is kept at the pub where 24 customers were struck down with gastroenteritis . The Sutton Arms where two dozen people suffered gastroenteritis and six of them had Clostridium perfringens - a common cause of food poisoning . Owner Michael Alan Flegg, 68, pleaded guilty to nine food hygiene offences when he appeared at Teesside Magistrates' Court yesterday. The court heard that Stockton Council's environmental health department investigated the pub after receiving a complaint from a member of the public saying they had food poisoning. Six specimen samples from people who visited the pub on April 20 last year were taken - all from six different households. Michelle Stowe, representing Stockton Council, said 24 people suffered gastroenteritis and six of them had Clostridium perfringens - a common cause of food poisoning. Gastroenteritis is a condition where the stomach and intestines become inflamed, and symptoms include diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and cramping. Ms Stowe told the court that the common source between the people sampled was the Sutton Arms. Filthy: Evidence of a rodent infestation were found at the pub in Stockton-on-Tees with mouse droppings discovered on the floor . A dirty bucket at The Sutton Arms, in  Elton, which has admitted a string of food hygiene offences . The owner of the pub where inspectors found food past its sell-by-date and rotting meat, Michael Alan Flegg, 68, has admitted nine food hygiene offences . A visit was made and it was found to have unsatisfactory food hygiene standards, including food that was past its sell-by date and  food storage containers not kept in good order and condition. There was also evidence of rodent activity in an external food storage shed, where officers found mouse droppings. Following the initial complaint, 14 visits by environmental health officers were made to the pub and 13 of those were non-compliant with food hygiene regulations. Ms Stowe said that food including chicken, milk and beef were found out of date. On one occasion, three pieces of braising steak were found sticky, smelling and decomposing. Flegg has since sacked the two managers who were working at the time of the breach. After the hearing he said: 'I have taken a back seat for some years due to my age and I put trust in my management team. 'I was devastated to find out what had happened. I was on holiday at the time when the investigation started. We had two managers in place at the time, who were sacked and have now been replaced. We have also replaced the kitchen staff. 'It has been very distressing and upsetting, I have more than 30 years of experience in this trade.

'I do understand that as the licence holder it is my responsibility, and we have worked hard to turn the place around.' A date for sentencing has not yet been set. Despite the changes in staff, there have still been complaints about the restaurant on TripAdvisor. One reviewer, who visited the restaurant earlier this month, had said: 'A disaster from start to finish! 'Let me tell you if you want to pay top prices for frozen c**p then this is the place for you.' Another poster, called Neil J, complained about the cleanliness of the restaurant and the 'dirty' food. He said: 'The food arrived hot but poorly presented. Chips in a side bowl and remnants of oil on the plate, very dirty oil at that. 'Once emptied out of the bowl there was probably enough to cook some more, chips were very dark brown and tasted of the fryer they came from. The only taste came from the dirty oil. 'The tables had candle holders on with chips out of then that were quite sharp to the touch and cobwebs on the clutter that is above your head and quite dusty too.'","Environmental health found mice droppings and rotting meat in the pub .

"John Travolta claims Scientology has helped him 'save lives', including his own. The actor believes the controversial church is targeted 'because it's not understood'. And despite allegations that he has been blackmailed by the elders to remain in the congregation, he insists: 'I've loved every minute of it.' His words came in an interview with Good Morning America to promote his new thriller The Forger about the world's most infamous art plagiarist. But amid questions about the 61-year-old's penchant for oil painting, interviewer Amy Robach brought up Going Clear, the explosive new documentary that alleges church elders have a 'blackmail file' of 'damaging material' from Travolta's sessions with auditors. 'I've loved every minute': John Travolta smiled as he spoke out in defense of his controversial religion . 'It's helped me save lives': The 61-year-old actor insists the church is not as evil as it has been depicted . He fielded the questions about Scientology during a press stop on his promotion tour of his movie The Forger . Dismissing the claims, Travolta said it has been a support system for his family for four decades, particularly as he mourned the death of his 16-year-old disabled son Jett in 2009. 'My family has done so well with it,' he said. 'It's been a beautiful thing for me. I've saved lives with it and saved my own life several times. 'Through my loss of my son, it helped me every step of the way for two years solid, and here I am.' He urged critics to 'take time and read a book.' 'You could read A New Slant on Life, you could read Dianetics,' he said. 'And I think if you really read it, you'll understanding it. But unless you do, you'll speculate and I think that's a mistake.' The film features a number of allegations about how members are threatened and tortured in prison-style camps and cut off from their family if they decide to leave Scientology. Others belonging to the most senior order of the faith have been forced to play musical chairs to the sound of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody in a fight to secure a chair to stay in the church, it was claimed. The claims have been disputed by the Church of Scientology who have branded those who featured in the show - many former senior members - as 'admitted' liars and perjurers and 'professional anti-Scientologists.' Directed by Alex Gibney, Going Clear aimed to expose the secrets behind the mysterious faith followed by thousands of people including Travolta and Tom Cruise. Controversy: The documentary Going Clear alleges that church elders have a 'blackmail file' from Travolta's sessions with auditors that will stop him (pictured right with his wife Kelly Preston) and his family from leaving the church . Dismissing the claims, Travolta said it has been a support system for his family for four decades, particularly as he mourned the death of his 16-year-old disabled son Jett in 2009 . It included interviews with former senior members and officials who made explosive claims about punishments endured by members and how followers have been manipulated. These included descriptions of a 'prison camp', revealed by former member Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor. People put into this camp are forced to do around 30 hours of hard labour, broken up by three hour rest breaks. Spanky was once the point of contact between the Church and Travolta and said she was sent to this 'prison camp', known as the Rehabilitation Project Force which, she claims, is where members are 'reindoctrinated.' The documentary also claimed Scientology chiefs hold a 'black PR package' on Travolta, with all the disclosures he made during auditing sessions. During these sessions a trained auditor asked pointed questions such as 'What are you willing for me to talk to others about?' Travolta is said to have requested that his sessions were not filmed, but secret cameras were allegedly installed anyway. As well as the claims about Travolta, former senior members of the faith told documentary makers about the various forms of punishment meted out by leaders. Big names: John Travolta and Tom Cruise are pictured together at a Scientology session in the front row . Another form of punishment involved members of the highest ranking order within the Scientology church, Sea Org, whose members are said to be punished by being thrown in 'The Hole'. As well as beatings in 'The Hole', they are allegedly also subjected to demeaning tasks including mopping up the floor with their tongue to force them to confess their crimes against the Church. Others are apparently ordered to play musical chairs to the sound of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody - fighting each other for chairs which allow them to remain in the church, with losers being expelled. Being expelled from the Church of Scientology comes at a high price, because all friends and family that are still with the religion are forced to cut any ties with departing members. Scientology is believed to be one of the reasons behind the breakdown of Tom Cruise's marriage to Katie Holmes because he was understood to have wanted to send their daughter Suri to Sea Org, according to reports at the time. In an interview with the New Yorker in 2012, Scientology spokesmen denied the claims. The Church of Scientology, which is believed to have around 50,000 members, denied the allegations featured in Going Clear and said the statements included were 'entirely false.' People interviewed in the HBO documentary included Lisa-Marie Presley, who has dissented from the church . In a statement it said: 'The Church has documented evidence that those featured in Gibney's film regurgitating their stale, discredited allegations are admitted perjurers, admitted liars and professional anti-Scientologists whose living depends on the filing of false claims. All have been gone so long from the Church they know nothing of it today. 'Yet Gibney and HBO stonewalled more than a dozen requests by the Church to offer relevant information about them, with more than 25 individuals with first-hand information eager to speak. To this day, neither HBO nor Gibney can deny that they have yet to present the Church with a single allegation from the film so the Church may have an opportunity to respond. The Church never sought special treatment, only fair treatment.' Since Going Clear premiered at the Sundance Festival in January, the church has created a website dedicated to criticising the film and released its own version, called 'Get the truth.' Representatives also branded the documentary a 'bigoted propaganda piece.' Other famous members have also criticised the show. Danny Masterton, a second generation Scientologist and former star of 'That 70s show', said he thought the book the documentary was based on was full of lies. He told eonline: 'I wonder if Sundance would allow a documentary of, like, eight people who hate Judaism. But you know, my religion's fair game, I guess, ""cause it's new"".' At the end of the documentary Gibney lists the people who refused to be interviewed, which included Miscavige, Travolta, Cruise and Kidman.","The actor, 61, appeared on Good Morning America to promote The Forger .

"When Ellia Beasley was a teenager, she enjoyed singing along to the lyrics of one of her favourite tunes - Rooftops by Lost Prophets. She loved the song so much, she decided to have a tattoo on her belly in 2012 featuring the lyrics 'scream your heart out'. But the aspiring model from New Milton, Hampshire, lived to regret her decision after the band's lead singer was later exposed as a serial paedophile and child abuser. Scroll down for video . Ellia Beasley has more than 20 tattoos but lived to regret featuring Lost Prophet lyrics in one of her inkings . Ellia had the line 'scream your heart out' written across her belly from the song Rooftops . Ian Watkins, 37, was sent to prison for 35 years in 2013 after being convicted of a string of child sex offences - including the attempted rape of a fan's baby. Ellia said she was shocked when she heard about Watkin's depraved crimes - and hated the fact she was associated with him thanks to her tattoo. 'When I found out about Ian Watkins I was disgusted,' she said on the new series of Channel 5 show Tattoo Disasters. 'It's wrong and he completely abused his power. I was ashamed I had something of his on my body and it's stuck there.' In an interview with FEMAIL, Ellia, now 22, said she was never a huge fan of the band but she had the tattoo because the lyrics resonated with her when she was younger. Singer Ian Watkins was sent to prison for 35 years for a string of child sex offences . 'Scream your heart out didn't have any personal meaning but it was a line that stuck in my head and I liked singing it aloud,' she said. 'I wanted to have a tattoo across the bottom of my stomach and I thought lyrics would look good there so I chose that line because I liked the song.' The tattoo - which cost £60 - was not Ellia's first. She already had eight and now has more than 20 (she's lost count of the exact number) on her arms, legs and body. But she no longer wanted to have the Lost Prophet's lyrics following Watkin's imprisonment and struggled to cover it up when she wore crop tops and vests when regularly working out at the gym. 'Everyone kept asking me what I was going to do about it,' she said. She admitted that laser removal surgery was 'not an option' as she had heard it was extremely painful and expensive. So instead, she contacted a number of tattoo artists to see if they could cover the lyrics by working them into a new tattoo design. But none of the artists she spoke to could think of a way to do it. They told her the tattoo was too bold to be obscured. However, Ellia was then put in contact with tattooist to the stars Kevin Paul who is based in Derbyshire. He has inked the bodies of many famous people including Ed Sheeran and Harry Styles. Ellia with tattooist to the stars Kevin Paul who had an idea of a design to cover the lyrics . Before: Ellia had been told she would never be rid of the line because the tattoo was too big and bold . After: Kevin was able to hide the lyrics with this owl design that Ellia loves . After meeting Ellia, he came up with the idea to paint a giant owl on her stomach. After agreeing to the design, Ellia spent a total of ten and a half hours at Kevin's studio having the tattoo drawn and coloured in. She said getting the tattoo was 'horrifically painful' but she has no regrets. She said: 'I really like the new design. It's pretty and you can't see the lyrics at all now, you would never know they had been there.' The experience hasn't put Ellia off having more tattoos in the future - in fact she's already planning to have a giant picture of Ganesh painted across her whole back. But she added she would think twice about having lyrics tattooed on her body again - unless they had a personal significance.","Ellia Beasley loved singing along to Lost Prophets song as a teen .

"Troubling questions: Lord Janner controversially escaped prosecution for a string of child abuse allegations because the Crown Prosecution Service said Alzheimer’s has left him unfit to face trial . A former Director of Public Prosecutions has said lawyers involved in the decision not to charge Lord Janner with child abuse in 2007 failed to pass new evidence to him. Lord Macdonald QC, who was DPP between 2003 and 2008, said that instead of consulting with headquarters in London, CPS lawyers in Leicestershire decided fresh evidence against Janner was not worth pursuing through the courts. That decision meant Janner, now 86, was able to escape prosecution for eight years until the CPS controversially announced earlier this week that he is now unfit to stand trial due to Alzheimer's. Speaking to The Guardian, Lord Macdonald said: 'It is a matter of great regret that I was never informed of the existence of this case in 2007. ‘If it had been referred to me, I would certainly have given it my close and robust personal attention. ‘The grave failure on the part of the local CPS lawyers to refer this case to headquarters is no doubt one of the matters that (High Court judge) Sir Richard Henriques will be looking at in his review of these cases.’ Alison Millar, head of the abuse team at law firm Leigh Day, who represented an alleged victim of Lord Janner, said: 'The main option now for those who allege they were abused by Lord Janner, to ensure their claims are investigated and for their voice to be heard, is through a civil legal claim. 'We are currently investigating the feasibility of such a legal challenge.' The news comes after it was revealed last night that Westminster attendance records show Janner attended the House of Lords almost daily and claimed more than £100,000 in expenses in the four years after he was diagnosed with the disease. He only stopped attending Parliament – and claiming up to £300 a day for doing so – when child abuse police raided his house on December 2013. Even in that month he attended the Lords 12 times. Lord Janner is said by his alleged victims to have preyed on young boys at care homes near his Leicester West constituency. On Thursday Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said the peer would not be prosecuted because his condition means there could be no criminal conviction. She said there was evidence to charge Janner with 22 sexual offences against children carried out between 1969 and 1988, and that he should have been prosecuted in 1991, when Janner’s name was raised in a major paedophile trial, and again in 2007. Lord Macdonald QC, Director of Public Prosecutions from 2003 to 2008, said the decision not to prosecute Janner in 2007 was made by local CPS lawyers, and new evidence was not passed to him . Probes: Greville Janner, left in 1974, served as an MP for decades and was investigated in 1991, 2002 and 2007 . She went on to say that ‘mistakes were made’, and commissioned retired High Court judge, Sir Richard Henriques, to launch an inquiry. But her ruling means nine alleged victims will never have the chance to have their claims tested in court. And analysis of records shows Janner continued speaking fluently for years after his diagnosis and was also alert enough to claim expenses among the highest in the Lords. In the 12 months up to April 2009, the year of his diagnosis, he attended the Lords 143 times – only just shy of the 147 maximum possible. And he managed to fill in forms procuring himself £12,075 in subsistence payments and £13,468 in ‘office costs’ – with another £691 in mileage claims for his car. In the following year, up to April 2010, he attended 136 days at the Lords out of a maximum 142 and claimed £10,986 subsistence, £11,625 office costs and £589 mileage. In the year to April 2011 he turned up 126 days out of 137, and claimed expenses totalling £34,014. In the year to April 2012, Janner attended 143 days out of a maximum of 156. He also managed to claim a hefty £28,800 in expenses. In the following year, up to April 2013, he turned up 136 days out of 144, and claimed expenses totalling £24,600. In April, May and June 2013 he attended every one of the 30 days the Lords sat, claiming a total of £6,450 in expenses. In July he was absent just one out of 20 days, claiming £2,850 for the remaining 19. Pointing: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, in what was is the most recent moving image of the Labour peer . And in August, September, October and November, he did not miss a single sitting out of 32 days, and claimed £4,800 in expenses. Yesterday David Cameron said: ‘I have enormous sympathy for anyone who has been the victim of crime or sexual abuse. ‘But it is a very important principle that decisions about prosecutions are taken by independent authorities and we have to be very careful not to step over the line, however frustrating it may sometimes feel that people aren’t getting the justice that they deserve.’ Claims that Janner was not fit to stand trial have been undermined by another case where a sex offender with dementia was brought to court. David Massingham, 77, was deemed not fit to stand trial on historic child abuse allegations because of his mental health but he was charged with 12 offences. He denied molesting two boys more than 30 years ago. A finding of fact hearing was held before a jury at Teesside Crown Court in February last year. The jury decided Massingham, of Middlesbrough, had committed the acts. He was not found to be guilty, or not guilty, but a judge ordered he be detained indefinitely in hospital. Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said the case proved what the authorities could have done over Janner. He said: ‘At the very least for the sake of victim survivors they should get that opportunity, to tell their truth before that kind of trial.’ A procedure exists to deal with criminal suspects thought to have mental illness. In serious cases where a judge rules a suspect is not fit to stand trial a jury can hear the evidence in the suspect’s absence and decide if the individual committed the crimes.","Labour grandee escaped prosecution for string of child abuse allegations .

"Would you like a side of pot with your main course? Food pairing menus are all the rage these days, with beers, wines and even coffees all getting the matching makeover from experts. But one US restaurant has taken things a step further by matching their mains to marijuana. Bright spark: The Amsterdam Falafel Shop in Washington DC, US, is the first restaurant in the country with a menu that matches cannabis to food . Canny move: The restaurant's menu pairs five falafels to five strains of marijuana . Amsterdam Falafel Shop in Washington DC, US, has launched its pot-pairing menu which matches five falafels to different strains of weed. This is strictly a take-away operation though, as those who like to indulge won't be able to smoke on the premises. Owners Arianne and Scott Bennett devised the rather sophisticated  falafel toppings best eaten when smoking different strains of marijuana. For those who like to imbibe in some OG Kush, the restaurant recommends a falafel sandwich of baba ganoush, beetroot, pickled turnips, coleslaw, garlic parsley and tahini. If it's an Afghani strain that's got you excited, then opt for sliced cucumber, onion and dill salad, fried aubergines, and thinly layered garlic cream. According to the menu, this is the best combo for that particular strain as the 'pot/sandwich pairing has been known to induce intense relaxation.' The falafel topping counter at the restaurant includes julienne vegetables, salads and various dips . If you're looking for more of an energetic experience, the menu advises to pair a baba ganoush and chickpea, pickle, tomato, cucumber, tahini and red pepper sauce salad with a Cactus joint. 'This pairing has been known to induce an uplifting, energizing and euphoric effect,' the menu states. Sparking up Lemon Haze? Go for a hummus, yoghurt sauce, garlic parsley, crunchy onion, pickled cauliflower and Turkish salad combo; a pairing which will give you 'energy and creativity.' It's pairing different weed with different types of food,' Mr Bennett said to Fox News . 'You're tasting different things. I mean, different weed taste differently.' A law was passed in February this year which made it legal for Washington DC residents over the age of 21 to possess, grow and smoke recreational marijuana. There is a limit to the quantity users can possess and usage in public as well as sales within the DC limits is prohibited.","Amsterdam Falafel Shop, Washington DC, US, launched .

"A New York-based writer who has grown tired of the battle between fat and skinny, is blaming plus-size retailer Lane Bryant for continuing to perpetuate the weight war — and has published candid photos of herself wearing the brand's lingerie to illustrate the problem. In an essay published on xoJane, Amanda Richards hit out at Lane Bryant’s recent I’m No Angel lingerie campaign, which was widely perceived to have been a rather blatant critique of popular lingerie giant Victoria’s Secret. The clothing store, which carries US sizes 14 to 28, has been applauded for the new campaign, which shows plus-size models looking sexy in the brand's lingerie. But while many people responded that it was encouraging to see women of different sizes being portrayed as sexy, offering a counterpoint to stick-thin models like Victoria's Secret Angels Candice Swanepoel, Behati Prinsloo, and Lily Aldridge, Amanda takes issue with its message. Regular girl: Writer Amanda Dobbins says Lane Bryant's new I'm No Angel ad campaign doesn't show plus-size women of different proportions . 'I don't think it's particularly healthy or progressive to pit fat bodies against thin bodies,' she says. Amanda explains that part of the problem is that Lane Bryant's ads don't actually show women of all sizes, but rather a subset of overweight women who still have 'correct' proportions, with flatter stomachs and larger busts. 'I have never once seen a Lane Bryant customer with a body that is represented, even a little bit, in any of Lane Bryant's advertising campaigns, myself included,' she said. So the self-described 'body-positive' blogger has taken to social media, posting photos of herself in Lane Bryant underwear to her Instagram account in a 'small offering of solidarity' with other women of varying sizes who feel unrepresented in fashion ads. At size 18, Amanda admits, 'I'm no model' — but adds that her body type is also not so unusual. Body positive: Amanda hopes to promote positive body image and wants more retailers to advertise toward women of varying sizes . No retouching: The New York-based blogger posted photos of herself that showed off her figure and stretch marks . She continues to say that she hopes brands like Lane Bryant will learn from women like her, as well as other plus-size women on social media, that customers want to see diverse models in their ads campaigns. Lane Bryant, however, insists its I'm No Angel campaign is diverse and represents 'the woman who unapologetically celebrates herself'. 'This campaign is intended to celebrate all women coming together to redefine the ideals of beauty,' Lane Bryant representative Toyin Graham told Bustle. 'This campaign message is all inclusive. Our issue is not with certain sizes of women, it’s with media’s definition of ideal beauty' But Amanda believes it is not enough, saying: 'We don't derive self-worth from seeing diverse images, but we do find power and solidarity and learn to appreciate our own individuality in relationship to others.' Taking charge: Amanda says she's tired of being told to settle for plus-size fashion taking 'baby steps' 'I can't imagine what the legions of other women, the ones who are strikingly different from these models, must feel,' she adds. Since publishing the photos of herself in lingerie, Amanda has started sharing images of other plus-size women stripped down on her Instagram as well in the hopes that an influx of images of diverse body types will help to spark change. 'I'm so tired of being told that I should be happy with #plussize fashion and representation taking ""baby steps"",' she wrote on Twitter. 'We are women. We are big women. We should not be taking baby steps. We should be taking BIG LOUD RUMBLING GROWN A** WOMAN STEPS.

"Parents of a U.S. Army Sergeant were left stunned with excitement after their son, who had just returned from being stationed in Afghanistan, decided to surprise them on ice before a hockey game. Sergeant Dan Urman's father Eitan Urman was so happy that as he embraced his son and lifted him off the ground, he slipped on the ice, causing both to tumble over while still hugging. As part of the planned surprise, Eitan and his wife Ronit, of Scottsdale, Arizona, had been invited to drop the puck before the Arizona Coyotes game against the Anaheim Ducks on Saturday. Scroll down for video . U.S. Army Sergeant Dan Urman embraces his father Eitan Urman after surprising him at the Arizona Coyotes game on Saturday . Eitan Urman sits in disbelief in seeing his son Dan, who has been stationed in Afghanistan since November of 2014 . The National Hockey League organization said they had won the puck drop because they have been season ticket holders for nearly 20 years. But when it was announced there'd be a special guest bringing them a ceremonial puck, the couple turned around to see their son Dan walking down the red carpet on the ice. Eitan immediately starts running toward his son, who had been in Afghanistan since November, as Dan jogs toward his father. When they embrace, Eitan lifts Dan off the ground and the pair fall to the ice and the carpet slides on the slippery surface. Once Dan stands up, his father sits on the ground for another moment with his hand on his head, still in disbelief. Eitan (left) and his wife Ronit Urman (right) were told they would drop a ceremonious first puck at the game on Saturday because they have been season ticket holders for nearly 20 years . And when they were told a special guest would bring out the puck for them, their son Dan ran out on to the ice . Eitan was so excited to see his son that he ran to meet him halfway down the red carpet as Ronit stood in shock with her hands to her face . Dan then hugs and kisses his mother and Eitan watches, smiling and embracing his wife and son. The trio make their way to the end of the carpet, pose for a photo then do the ceremonious puck drop for team captains, Ducks center Ryan Getzlaf and Coyotes forward Shane Doan. Dan told Daily Mail Online that he has been planning to surprise his family since he left in November. He was supposed to return to the states in mid-May or June, but contacted a rep from the Coyotes when he found out he’d be returning early, before the hockey season was over. ‘About two or three weeks ago they came up with the idea to tell my parents they won a random thing on fan appreciation night,’ Dan said. Eitan embraced his son and lifted him off the ground as they reunited for the first time since Dan left for Afghanistan . The father-and-son pair had a long embrace as a crowd of Arizona Coyotes and Anaheim Ducks fans cheered throughout the stadium . Eventually the pair lost their footing as the carpet moved on the slippery ice, and the fell to the ground, still hugging . He said he had help from the entire staff and team of the Coyotes, his sister, his girlfriend and other close friends who were all able to keep his surprise a secret from his parents. He said the whole event was ‘really cool’ and ‘surreal’, and it helped that his dad is an animated guy. ‘As he walked out, my father figured out there was no puck and he turned around,’ Dan said. ‘He recognized me immediately and so he dropped to a knee and I just sort of started jogging out to meet him.’ The crowd can be heard cheering as the family is reunited in front of thousands of people. Dan said his family had a chance to meet the Coyotes’ general manager after the reunion. Once Dan and Eitan stood up the son went to greet his mother, who he gave a hug and kiss to as his father hugged him fro behind . Eitan still looked shocked with excitement as they walked to center ice for the puck drop after the touching reunion . Though the Coyotes lost the game 2-1, it was still a celebratory night for the Urman family. This was Dan’s second tour of Afghanistan. He was there from March 2013 to November 2013. With no surprise planned, his parents planned to meet him on the east coast upon his arrival back to the states. His return was delayed, however, and he was stuck in Germany for a few days on his way back. ‘They had a nice vacation in Carolina,’ Dan said. ‘I thought it would be cool to surprise them this time.’ This was the Coyote's final game of the season. They finished seventh in the Pacific Division and will not be playing in the playoffs. The crowd cheered as Dan and his parents made their way to center ice. He waved at the crowd as Ronit and Eitan showed their sheer happiness of their son's return .

"Clorox has apologized for a social media misstep after the household products company sparked outrage by tweeting 'where's the bleach' in reference to last week's introduction of new 'emoji' cartoons for iPhones that include several faces of people with black and brown skin. The maker of Clorox bleach and other products says it was attempting a humorous reference to other emoji symbols for objects like toilets and bathtubs that people use bleach to clean. But the corporate Twitter post hit a nerve when news reports and online discussions were focusing on the new collection of racially diverse faces that have been added to the symbols people can use in emails and text messages.

WPIX producer Ashley Alese Edwards, under the handle @AshleyAlese, tweeted 'Not sure how the Clorox tweet was racist? People need to stop reaching.' 'If you're offended by Clorox's tweet, just get off of social media and look for actual racism elsewhere. #IHatePeopleSometimes,' @PeytonsHead tweeted. @KyleBalan tweeted '@Clorox this wasn't racist.

This is someone being thoughtless, and really not focused on what was trending that day,' said Jazzmen Knoderer, a 29-year-old program coordinator at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. She joined other Twitter users in posting her dismay about the Clorox tweet after it spread online last week. Clorox, based in Oakland, California, tried to make amends with another post that said, 'Wish we could bleach away our last tweet. Didn't mean to offend.' The company also apologized in a statement Saturday that added, 'We did not mean for this to be taken as a specific reference to the diversity emojis - but we should have been more aware of the news around this. The tweet was meant to be light-hearted - about having an emoji shaped like a bleach bottle to represent doing laundry or cleaning - but it fell flat.' The gaffe is only the latest example of companies like AT&T and Kenneth Cole that have sparked controversy or offense on social media.

"A mother says she has been left 'devastated' after her daughter failed to get a place at the same primary school her three brothers attend. Joanne Whitehouse, 44, had applied for her four-year-old daughter Alice to go to St John Fisher's RC Primary School in Middleton near Rochdale as her only preference. Her sons Joel, nine, Harri, seven, and Ollie, six, already attend the school and she believed there would be 'no issue' with her daughter gaining a place. Joanne Whitehouse (centre) was left 'devastated' after finding out her daughter Alice (right) and granddaughter Olivia (left) won't be able to go to the same school as her three sons . Alice pictured with her brothers, Joel, nine, (second left) Harri, seven,  (right) and Ollie, six (far left) But when the school allocations were revealed this morning she found out her youngest would have to go to a different school, which is a 20 minute walk from her other children's. Ms Whitehouse's granddaughter Olivia, who is also four, also missed out on a place at the school and will have to attend Middleton Parish C of E Primary School with Alice. The mother-of-eight, from Middleton, Greater Manchester, was told there were 82 applications for just 30 places at the school this year. She is planning to appeal Rochdale Council's decision and says: 'I can't split myself in half and be at both schools at the same time. 'Alice's brothers go to the school. So it just makes sense for Alice and Oliva to go there as well. I just don't know what I'm going to do.' Ms Whitehouse added she is concerned there will be a delay in arranging a care plan for Alice, who has Type 1 diabetes and needs four daily insulin injections, while she awaits the appeal outcome. One in ten children across Greater Manchester missed out on their first choice of school when the allocations were announced this morning. Alice's brothers all attend St John Fisher's RC Primary School in Middleton (pictured) where she was expecting to attend . Ms Whitehouse found out today that her daughter will attend Middleton Parish CofE Primary School instead . Rochdale Council, which had 2,851 applications this year compared with 2,749 in 2014, said 88.9 per cent of children in the  borough were offered their first school preference. It said 110 children - 3.8 per cent - were not offered any of their first three preferences, compared with 1.8 per cent last year. A council spokesman said: 'Places at St John Fisher are allocated in strict accordance with the published admission criteria for the school. There were a total of 82 preferences for 30 places. 'The school's governing body ranked all 82 applications according to the published criteria, but the children concerned did not fall into the highest priorities, and so were not offered a place. 'Only one preference was listed on the application form, and so because that preference could not be met, a place was offered at the school nearest to the home address with places. 'The parents have the right of appeal to an independent appeal panel.'","Joanne Whitehouse applied for daughter to go to St John Fisher's School .

"A Massachusetts man was arrested after police found two homes full of bomb-making materials. Joseph T. Brennan Jr. of Norwell tried to hide from the cameras as he was arraigned from his hospital bed on Monday, pleading not guilty to possession of an infernal device. This after authorities searched the residences following an incident on Saturday night in which Brennan accidentally blew up his car while smoking a cigarette and police discovered 'various bomb-making components.' Scroll down for video . Joseph T. Brennan Jr. (above) of Norwell, Massachusetts was found with a home full of bomb-making materials . Police searched the home after an incident Saturday night where Brennan blew up his car (above) while smoking a cigarette near gun powder . 'I’m an idiot. I lit a cigarette with the gunpowder in the front seat,' Brennan said in the police report according to the Boston Herald. The blast left the man with minor injuries and he was admitted to Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Brennan, with singed eyebrows and bandaged hands, said he did not want to be on ""TV"" as he was being arraigned Monday afternoon, trying to hide his face and singed eyebrows with a towel. In addition to Brennan's home in Norwell, the condo of Benjamin Young in Hingham was also found to be full of bomb-making devices. Police have not revealed at this time the relationship between the two men. Hazardous materials team responded to both locations and were able to remove and safely detonate some of the materials. Authorities do not believe the two men had any ties to terrorism. Brennan, who called himself an 'idiot' after blowing up his car, was arraigned from his hospital bed on Monday . Police searched the car Saturday night and seized 14 different substances . Just last month, Brennan posted a video to his Facebook page that showed what he claimed was rocket propellant being used to melt snow. He wrote; 'When people say it's not rocket science I get disappointed here's a variation of solid rocket propellant used in the retired space shuttles solid rocket boosters I think I'm in the wrong profession.' A witness to Saturday's car accident told police they heard a loud explosion and saw Brennan laying on the road as his car rolled towards a guardrail. Brennan then got up and gathered some materials and put them in his trunk according to the witness. Police searched the vehicle after noticing how burned Brennan was, and according to the police report he told officers on the scene when they found the materials; 'I got them from a friend to fu*k around with. I wasn’t going to do anything malicious.' ABC 5 reports that among the substances found in the car were potassium permanganate, hydrogen peroxide and acetone and containers full of sodium chlorate, picric acid and sulfur. Brennan, 36, will be charged with possession of a destructive device, and one part possession of components capable of making a component device, while Young, 27, is facing charges for being in possession of illegal possession of bomb-making materials. No members of the public were ever in danger according to police and it does not appear that these materials were intended to be used to hurt any individuals.","Joseph T.

"In February, when Lady Gaga went on stage at the Oscars, millions of viewers in more than 200 countries saw her perform a tribute to The Sound of Music to mark its 50th anniversary. In Los Angeles there was a standing ovation when the original star, Julie Andrews, came on stage. However, one country was left baffled: Austria, where the movie was set and filmed. ‘We didn’t really know what was going on,’ said one Austrian I know. Each year, 300,000 people come to Salzburg to soak up the magic and visit the locations of the film – it’s the reason three-quarters of all tourists head to the city. The beautiful flower beds of at Mirabell Gardens in Salzburg that Sound of Music fans will recognise . Julie Andrews from the beloved film The Sound of Music, fans of which continue to flock to Salzburg . The first tours started shortly after the film opened, but now buses emblazoned with The Sound of Music circle the city, day in, day out. And the Austrians still don’t get it. You’ll be looking a long time in the Salzburg tourist shops before you find a Julie Andrews postcard for sale, let alone lederhosen fashioned from curtain fabric. There are some real advantages in this if you’re a fan of The Sound of Music. And I am. It means there’s nothing to stop me from splashing about in fountains while humming that I have confidence or juggling fruit in the markets (perhaps not a good idea). The Old Town, where much of the movie was shot, is too narrow for tour buses, and that fact – combined with the lack of tourist tat – means there’s nothing to break the spell as you slide into The Sound of Music mindset. Also happily for fans of the film, Salzburg is a pretty conservative sort of place, and doesn’t rush about embracing change. Half a century after shooting the movie, Julie Andrews could return to the city and wander round without too many shocks to the system (providing she overlooked the McDonald’s on Getreidegasse, sitting uncomfortably amid shops selling Austrian national dress). For me, Salzburg is the most hummable city ever – although the tunes you find yourself humming are probably not those that would be chosen by the city fathers. Lady Gaga paid tribute to the film, in the presence of its original star, for its 50 anniversary at the Oscars . Built into the mountains, in medieval times the church harnessed much of the local wealth that came from salt mining – in fact, it still owns a lot of the surrounding land, and built the magnificent monasteries and convents that dominate the city. The real Maria von Trapp – played by Andrews in the film – actually did become a novice at Nonnberg, which was founded in the 8th Century. Head past here around 7pm and you’re still likely to hear the real-life nuns singing Gregorian chants. Bells peel at every opportunity and the mountains – well, it’s safe to say they haven’t changed much. On my first trip, more than 20 years ago, I stayed at an independent hostel, the Yoho (www.yoho.at) in Paracelsusstrasse, which I’m pleased to say is still going strong and still showing The Sound Of Music for free each night. Then it was a solitary outpost of Rodgers and Hammerstein-based enthusiasm, but now there are encouraging signs that the rest of Austria may just be starting to catch on. Sound of Music tourism began almost immediately after the film's release and is still going strong . My hotel for this trip, the rather more luxurious Castellani Parkhotel, shows the film on a continual loop on one of its TV channels. I could wake up to Climb Ev’ry Mountain and nod off to Sixteen Going On Seventeen. And I did. It was an ideal base for a Sound of Music weekend. The hotel even has its own wedding chapel – a gorgeous baroque concoction created during its days as an aristocratic mansion. It has to be said that breakfast doesn’t really feature in the film, which is the perfect excuse to start the day with apple strudel. And the best place to do so? Cafe Tomaselli, Salzburg’s oldest, dating from the 18th Century, right in the centre of the city in Alter Markt. The coffee is strong, served in multiple ways, while its strudel has spiced apple and crisp pastry, and is drenched in enough sugar to start an avalanche. Then it’s time to tick off a few of the key sights. First up, the Residenzplatz, just outside the cafe. In the movie it’s draped with Nazi flags. Cafe Tomaselli , Salzburg’s oldest, dates back to the 18th Century and is in the centre of the city in Alter Markt . Rumour has it that as the Second World War had ended just 20 years earlier, the city authorities weren’t keen on the flags, but the producers won them round by saying that the alternative was to use original footage of the German annexation of Austria in the film. Then there’s St Peter’s Cemetery – a series of catacombs that the movie’s set designers used as inspiration for the flight scenes – and the Felsenreitschule, the open-air theatre that was used for the concert scenes. Now it shows operas and concerts. As for the Salzach, the river that the city straddles, you cross it via the Mozart bridge, used by Maria and the children as they sang Do-Re-Mi. The Mirabell Gardens on the other side of the river allow an even fuller expression of appreciation for the film. Pat the head of the stone dwarf; jump up and down the steps; run about a lot! Many people do it and – even more hearteningly – post the results on YouTube. And all the time, Austrians are just enjoying walking in the gardens, completely oblivious, next to a palace built by an archbishop for his 15 children (particularly noteworthy in a Catholic country). Residenzplatz, just outside Cafe Tomaselli, was draped in Nazi flags in the 50-year-old film . But to really immerse yourself in the full experience, and to see the more outlying locations, you have to take a tour. I’ve taken a few in my time – I tend to feel them calling me each time I head to Salzburg, just as Maria felt the mountains calling her. Over the years I’ve been accompanied on them by groups ranging from unthrilled Austrians to up-for-it Australians in dirndls who had us singing the different parts of The Lonely Goatherd as we headed into the mountains. This time, however, I was accompanied by Gerry, an Austrian who’d actually seen the film, as well as Brits (loads), Americans, and a family from Malaysia. We headed to Hellbrunn, where the gazebo from Sixteen Going On Seventeen is now housed (and now locked after too many fans tried to leap from bench to bench and injured themselves). We also passed the house that served as the main location for the von Trapp family home. It’s now part of the Mozarteum Music Academy, and the easiest way to stay there is to become a top-flight musician. Sarah Turner found herself singing along to The Lonely Goatherd with up-for-it Australians in dirndls . We then started climbing our way into the mountains that feature in the opening shots – now augmented with nice chalets, as this area is a popular escape for posh Austrians and Germans – and gazed down at the town of Fuschl and its lake, one of Austria’s most famous views. British Airways offers return flights from Gatwick to Salzburg from £102. Rooms at the Castellani Parkhotel Salzburg start at £95. Tours with Panorama start at £29 per person. Finally, we arrived at Mondsee. This lakeside town provided the church used for the wedding. About 70 per cent of the people on the trip (there is an over-representation of women) took the chance to walk down the aisle. Needless to say, I was among them. I emerged, blinking, into the sunlight to enjoy cake shops and, amazingly, a shop selling film memorabilia. I felt thrilled. It seemed the whole world was now united in its love for this movie – even Austrians themselves. What’s more, the state theatre in Salzburg – the Landestheater – now even has a production of The Sound Of Music. It’s only taken 50 years. There’s just one thing to remember. Edelweiss is not the Austrian national anthem, whatever Ronald Reagan thought. He once arranged to have it played when the Austrian ambassador arrived at the White House.","Each year 300,000 people visit Salzburg to visit magical filming locations .

"A Canadian firm has given new meaning to the phrase 'beauty sleep' by creating a pillowcase which is being touted as the latest way to keep wrinkles at bay. The $40 (£26) cloth cover - which comes with a lifetime guarantee - is said to hydrate the face and prevent lines while you sleep. And unlike a normal cotton pillowcase, which apparently sucks moisture from the skin, the  Wrinkle Preventing Pillowcase's special blend of 'hydrophobic fibres' keeps the complexion hydrated all night. The Wrinkle Preventing Pillowcase has 'a blend of hydrophobic fibres that help skin retain moisture' The infused special fibres are said to fight wrinkles like a face cream, redirecting moisture back into the skin . The pillowcase, made by  Hammacher Schlemmer, in Canada, was developed by a dermatologist and contains no creams or chemicals. According to its description online, a traditional cotton case has a 'rough surface' that 'siphons moisture' away, leaving the face dry and dull. But the wrinkle preventing version is 'therapeutic and extra-smooth', redirecting moisture back into the skin for a more vibrant, healthier-looking appearance in the morning. They say the machine washable silky pillowcase also helps skin stay smooth, thanks to its 22,000 densely woven micro-filaments that prevent friction and remain taut. They thwart the bunching and pressure that cause standard cases to inscribe sleep lines, 'which can develop into permanent wrinkles'. Another creation from Hammacher Schlemmer, which also comes with a lifetime guarantee, is the Anti-Wrinkle Beauty Pillow. The £40 Anti-Wrinkle Beauty Pillow is said to banish face and chest wrinkles for sleepers who lie on their side . It is said to banish facial and chest sleep wrinkles for sleepers who lie on their side. Contoured like a butterfly with strategically placed cut-outs on either side and a supportive front wing, the soft, lightweight pillow’s polyurethane foam gently elevates the face and chest, preventing contact with the bed or pillow below. This apparently helps remove pressure on facial muscles which, as The American Academy of Dermatology cautions, can result in pillow wrinkles, creases, and puffiness. The lower wings elevate and support the head, shoulders and arms allowing for a comfortable back sleeping position in a way that can’t be achieved on a conventional pillow. Use alone or as a pillow topper with an existing pillow.

"BREAKTHROUGH . BREAKTHROUGH by Jack Andraka with Matthew Lysiak . by Jack Andraka with Matthew Lysiak . (Scribe Books, £12.99) Jack Andraka is just 18, yet his newly-published memoir carries a blurb from Barack Obama. 'Spectacular stuff...' enthuses the President. Jack's short life has been packed with incident, but there was little in his background to suggest that he would become a teenage celebrity. He was born in 1997 and grew up in suburban Maryland with his elder brother, Luke, and parents, Jane, a nurse, and Steve, a civil engineer. The Andrakas encouraged their boys to think about how the world worked: school runs were fiercely competitive as Jack and Luke tried to solve science questions fired at them by their mother. At home, the basement became a laboratory, from where Luke's attempt to turn a microwave into a ray gun plunged the entire neighbourhood into darkness. At school, Jack won prizes for science projects, but was ostracised as a geek and viciously bullied when he came out as gay, aged 13. Then a close family friend, Uncle Ted, died of pancreatic cancer. Deeply depressed, Jack made an unsuccessful suicide attempt. That awful moment proved to be a turning-point. At summer camp, Jack met a sympathetic counsellor, and began to channel his grief into the science that would make him a star. Initially, he thought of trying to find a cure for pancreatic cancer - an ambitious task, given that he didn't know what a pancreas was. An online search revealed that survival rates are low, partly because the cancer is hard to detect. He had his project - but he needed access to a proper laboratory. He wrote 200 emails to university science departments - and 199 rejections later Dr Anirban Maitra, an expert in pancreatic cancer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, offered Jack a corner of his lab to work in, under supervision. The supervision proved necessary as Jack contaminated samples by sneezing on them, and smashed a tray of test tubes by tripping over his shoelaces. But at last there came the moment that every research scientist longs for: his experiment worked. When his test for detecting pancreatic cancer won the top award at a prestigious international science competition in 2012, his wild celebrations at the awards ceremony went viral. He was interviewed by CNN and the BBC, and had to fit school assignments around invitations to meet world leaders and give TED talks. He was photographed with Bill and Hillary Clinton (who told him that politics was just like the film, Mean Girls). There was an audience with the Pope, he was hugged by Michelle Obama ('She was incredibly strong') and met the President who was, Jack notes, 'surprisingly well versed in science'. Of course, it wasn't all praise and presidential parties. There was anti-gay abuse, and scepticism from the scientific community. 'One major publication even dedicated a thousand words to why they were NOT going to celebrate my achievements,' Jack writes. Funny, brave and super-enthusiastic, with a healthy dose of adolescent egotism and some comic glimpses of the trials of being Jack's parent, Breakthrough is an inspiring story for would-be scientists - just don't complain when they turn your microwave into a ray gun.

Painful deterrent: The disastrous burglary attempt took place in the Cerro Norte neighbourhood of Cordoba, in central Argentina - and all of the men are currently in intensive care . Mr Costa, 49, and his wife Christina, 48, were asleep  when the men, who were armed with two pistols, broke in at around 3.30am. Police commissioner Mariano Zarate said: 'In a moment when the attackers were not paying attention, the house owner took a samurai sword and defended himself, injuring the attackers and making them run away.' In the panic, the thieves only managed to steal the equivalent of £278 and fled in a Peugeot 206 car which was parked outside. Bleeding heavily, the driver lost control of the vehicle and hit a stationary car forcing all four to go to hospital for emergency treatment. Police initially arrested two men and one woman, but another man who hid was forced to come back to hospital the next day due to serious sword injuries. The Costa family have moved in with relatives as they fear they might be targeted in revenge attacks.

"Viewers have slammed Saturday Night Live for a controversial sketch that made light of a teacher raping her 16-year-old student. During the clip he refers to the attack by his teacher as 'the best day of my life' - immediately sparking outrage on Twitter, with some calling it 'gross' while another said it was a 'new low'. An attorney, portrayed by host Taraji P. Henson, asks the boy how long the illicit relationship lasted, to which Daly replies: 'Five glorious weeks m'amm. Controversial: The scene portrayed a teenager testifying called Gavin Daly, played by Pete Davidson (left), in court during the trial of Janet Johnson-Luna, 32, played by Cecily Strong (right). The youngster tells the court the affair lasted five 'glorious weeks' and he instigated it to gain extra credit . The attorney then asks him to point her out. The teen points to her and says: 'She is right over there, looking all fine.' He adds that he didn't feel pressured into the relationship, insisting he was the one who instigated it. 'After school, I went in and asked what I could do for some extra credit, and it was on,' he added. The judge smiles and turns to the witness before saying: 'Look at you.' His response was that he asked for Tylenol because he had been 'fist-bumping' all the way home so his 'muscles were a little sore'. 'New low': An attorney, portrayed by host Taraji P. Henson, asks the boy to pick out the teacher. He points to Johnson-Luna, adding she is looking 'fine' Reaction: The actor told the court that when his classmates found out about the affair, he gave 'thousands of high fives' At the end of the scene, the witness even fist bumps the judge before he steps down from the stand . Daly goes on to say the affair felt like 'Disneyland' and admitted he gave 'thousands of high fives' when classmates found out about the relationship. When asks if he was called names, he lists of a number of terms he was referred to, including 'the man', 'my hero' and 'luckiest guy ever'.

There for Tiger: Ski champ Lindsey Vonn looked a little teed off at the first day of the Masters in Augusta, Georgia, on Thursday as her beau Tiger made some high profile mistakes . Not happy: Tiger tossed his driver after hitting off the ninth tee and sending the ball onto the first fairway during first round play of the Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Course in Augusta, Georgia Thursday . The 30-year-old's right knee has been rebuilt not once but twice. And Tiger is no doubt hoping he can pull off a feat like Vonn's breathtaking return to alpine skiing, in which she most recently won her 67th World Cup downhill skiiing championship, according to the New York Times. Still, Vonn appeared worried as she watched Woods flash his notorious temper on a couple of errant shots as he struggled to prove he's still No. 1 worldwide--and not No. 111, where his rank plummeted following back surgery last year. Vonn appeared to sweat it out along with Tiger after he yanked his tee shot into the adjacent first fairway and let the club fall from his hands in disgust while he stood frozen, staring incredulously at the flight of his ball. Woods bent his third shot around a tree and onto the green before two-putting for bogey to stand seven shots behind the early pacesetter. Been there: Vonn has struggled with her own injuries. The Olympic gold medalist has had two major knee surgeries in the last few years . Take a cue from his girlfriend: Woods can only hope to have the comeback that Vonn had. She won her 67th World Cup win and 18th season title after coming back from her second knee surgery . Holding strong: Vonn appeared tense as she watched Tiger struggle to get back into form following some early flubs on the first day of the Masters . Gathering himself, Woods pulled off a skillful shot from the pine straw, hooking the ball to the back of the green . Low scores were readily available thanks to soft greens at Augusta National Golf Club and 29 players were under par as Woods began the back nine on a warm, gentle day at Augusta. The 39-year-old American, who missed last year's Masters after surgery, three-putted the first hole for a bogey but balanced that with a birdie at the par-five second after a great approach shot to five feet. He then failed to cash in at the short par-four third after a booming tee shot left him just short of the green at the 340-yard hole. Choosing to chip rather than putt, Woods hit it strong and rolled some 15 feet by and two-putted for a disappointing par. Not playing stepmom: On Wednesday, Vonn showed up in Augusta alongside Tiger's two children with ex-wife Elin Nordegren. On Thursday, the kids were nowhere to be seen . Standing out: Vonn watches play on at the 6th hole during Round 1 of the 79th Masters Golf Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club . Woods then bogeyed the long par-three fourth after finding the front bunker. The 14-times major winner blasted out strong and took two to get down for another bogey. A birdie at the par-five eighth got him back to level par. But the American gave the stroke back at the ninth before making his way to the back nine and Amen Corner. The world's best golfers gathered on the eve of the Masters on Wednesday to take on a nine-hole course, often with their wives, girlfriends or kids as caddies, as part of the Par 3 Contest. And it seemed that golf WAG and U.S. skier Lindsey Vonn appeared to be the only caddie to have opted out of the bland, white jumpsuit uniform. Tiger Woods showed up to the event at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, with his two children, Sam, 8, and Charlie, 6, and his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn, who was dressed in a floor-length, spaghetti strap gown, accessorized with diamonds and Louis Vuitton. Playing stepmom: Seen here Thursday, Vonn holds up her dress from the grass as she talks to Woods's children, Charlie (center) and Sam (right) Vonn's dress appeared to pool on the grass as she spoke to Tiger, standing next to U.S. golfer Steve Stricker.

"Huw Thomas (pictured) suggested on an online forum in 2006 that England flags were for a 'simpleton' or a 'casual racist' A Labour parliamentary candidate has apologised 'wholeheartedly' for telling people to throw 'Tippex' over cars displaying England flags. Huw Thomas, the Labour candidate in Ceredigion, West Wales, suggested on an online forum in 2006 that the flags were for a 'simpleton' or a 'casual racist'. He posted his views on a Welsh language website called Mais E writing during the 2006 World Cup: 'I agree it is totally sickening the number of English flags to be seen around Wales. 'It really shows the level our society has been infiltrated by immigrants who aren't ready to integrate.' He also stated: 'I got the opportunity when I was offered an English flag for half price in WHSmiths Oxford to answer with the sentence: ""Since I am neither a simpleton nor a casual racist I must decline your offer"".' Mr Thomas then had a suggestion for anyone annoyed by flags on cars. '... TIPPEX - throw a bottle of the stuff over the car, it will look ridiculous - especially if it's a shiny boy racer-ish car. 'It will take hours to clean it - or money in the car-wash and, without looking closely, it will look like bird poo!' Mr Thomas said he made the comments as 'a young student' and he no longer held those views. In a statement he said: 'I apologise wholeheartedly for these comments, made while I was a young student. These are not my views now and I deeply regret writing this post online. 'Every candidate at this election will have gone through a political journey. Most will have said or thought things when they were young and at university, college or school that they now regret. This is certainly the case for me.' The Labour parliamentary candidate apologised 'wholeheartedly' for telling people to throw 'Tippex' over cars displaying England flags (file picture) He added that people in Ceredigion 'deserve an MP that will admit when they are wrong'. It comes after senior Labour MP Emily Thornberry stood down in November after publishing a picture of a house in Rochester draped in England flags. The MP for Islington South and Finsbury, in North London, took the snap while canvassing in the by-election in Rochester and Strood and was accused of being 'snobby' and 'sneering down her nose' at working class voters.

"When Hillary Clinton steps off her road-trip van on Tuesday at a rural Iowa community college, she might not be greeted by cheering throngs. Daily Mail Online spoke to students at Kirkwood Community College's regional center in Jones County, where the former secretary of state will hold her first low-key campaign event. The outlook isn't sunny for the kickoff of her 'listening tour': Of the ten students interviewed in the school's public lounge, only two would speak kindly of Mrs. Clinton. 'She's going to push some emotional thing on us,' predicted student Hallie Corum in between classes. 'What else is she supposed to do?' 'She's going to be, like, talking s**t.' 'TALKING S**T': Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign on Sunday and hit the road in a van, en route to a skeptical bunch of community college students in Monticello, Iowa . Corey Jones said he suspects that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want immigration reform because it would result in a new generation of grateful Democratic voters – and he plans to ask her about it on Tuesday . Kirkwood Community College's outpost in rural Monticello serves hundreds of students, including some who are still high school juniors and seniors . Corum declined to be photographed, flashing an impish grin. Corey Jones, a graphic design student, is among those chosen to question Mrs. Clinton in a roundtable setting on Tuesday. He said his teachers chose him to join a group of 'from 6 to 8' students whowill participate because 'I pay attention to politics,' something his friends around a table agreed with. 'I didn't know Hillary Clinton was running,' one young woman said. 'Is she running? Go ask Corey. He's up on all that stuff.' Jones said he plans to ask Hillary about illegal immigration. 'It's – well, Immigration reform,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'You know, Obama's plan was to make the illegal immigrants legal.' 'She's part of all that. And some people think – well, I think maybe – it's just a tactic to have more Democratic votes' from millions of grateful new citizens. Jones, like Corum, will vote in his first presidential election next year. He said Clinton is holding her first campaign event at a community college 'because she's trying to appeal to youth, to young voters.' 'She announced it on YouTube. That's targeted at people my age, right?' Clinton set off on a 1,000-mile road trip Sunday in her home town of Chappaqua, New York, and headed to Iowa – where the nation's first primary caucuses will start the machinery that chooses major parties' presidential candidate. She announced Sunday afternoon that she was officially in the race. A female student who declined to be named speculated about Clinton's motives for taking ground transportation instead of a jet aircraft. 'Can you imagine if she stepped off a private jet in Des Moines or Iowa City and walked down a set of steps in realy expensive shoes and a thousand-dollar outfit?' she asked. 'That would be, um, a really bad idea. I like the van better. Is it a minivan? God, I hope it's not a minivan.' Future chef Ross Vander Peut said gay marriage is a 'deal-breaker' for him but worries that Hillary Clinton 'seems like, kinda like a control freak' Monticello, Iowa is a sleepy farm town whose main street is lined with shops sporting signs that look like relics from the mid-twentieth century . Most students in Monday's random sample chose not to talk about Mrs. Clinton. All of the will be old enough to vote next year for the first time in their lives. Three said they didn't have an opinion about the Democratic front-runner. One looked up, shook her head, and put a pair of earbuds on. Two more said they would rather remain silent. 'You know, it's that ""If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all"" deal,' a young woman offered from behind her tablet computer. Moments later a group of young men walked down a hallway mimicking Bill Clinton's infamous 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman' press conference – and laughing uproariously. One who would talk is Bri Parks, a speech and psychology student who wants to be an FBI profiler because she likes 'trying to figure out how the human brain works.' Clinton can work to earn her vote, Parks said. 'If I heard her opinions and liked her ideas, I would support her.' But 'I hope people don't vote for her just because she's a woman.' Asked for the nicest thing she could say about Mrs. Clinton, Parks said 'she's not going at this saying, ""Look, I'm a woman, so vote for me."" She's not using her sex to prove a point.' 'She's looking at herself as a politician, not as a woman.' Students like these gathered in a Kirkwood Community College lounge and spoke with Daily Mail Online before and after classes on Monday . Bri Parks, a Kirkwood Community College student, said she hopes Americans don't vote for Hillary Clinton 'just because she's a woman' 'I don't think we should be putting people in extremely high political positions because of race, sex, or whatever,' Parks explained. 'Then you're doing things just because of what people look like.' Kirkwood serves between 22,000 and 26,000 students taking college-credit courses at sites in seven Iowa counties, according to a school official. The Monticello outpost is canceling many classes on Tuesday, making some students scratch their heads since 'this is the smallest part of Kirkwood,' as one pointed out. 'They could have had it somewhere else.' As it is, Kirkwood's students who do have class will have to dodge Secret Service agents and TV news cameras to get through the lobby. Some of them are recent high school graduates while others are finishing their 11th- and 12th-grade years collecting college credits one day per week. Ross Vander Peut, a self-described future chef, is one of the youngest. He's 16, a high-school junior, but will turn 18 just before the election. Vander Peut described himself as a libertarian – 'I like government to leave me alone,' he said – and gay marriage is 'a deal-breaker.' 'Equal rights, homosexual rights, it's one thing I will not sway on,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'If you are against gay marriage, you've lost my vote. There's nothing you can do to change it.' He hedged on Hillary, saying she 'seems like, kinda like a control freak.' 'But she also seems very strong-willed and determined. When she wants something done she probably does it herself.'","Daily Mail Online spoke to ten students at Kirkwood Community College's satellite campus in rural Iowa where Hillary Clinton will be Tuesday .

Police Chief Scott Keller confirmed to Delmarva Now that seven of the eight victims were juveniles between the ages of six and 16, but they have not been officially named as of midnight pending the notification of next of kin. Bonnie and Lloyd Edwards, encountered outside the home by a reporter from The Associated Press, identified themselves as the mother and stepfather of Rodney Todd, 36, whom they identified as the adult who died.

Lloyd Edwards said police told them Todd had died. 'It was disbelief,' he said. 'It's so hard. How can you understand something like that?' Mr Edwards also revealed that Delmarva Power had cut off the electricity to the house because of an outstanding bill. Matt Likovich, a spokesman for Delmarva Power, would not say Monday night whether the power had been cut off. He said the matter was being investigated. Edwards said, 'to keep his seven children warm, [Todd] bought a generator. It went out and the carbon monoxide consumed them.' According to AccuWeather.com, on March 29 temperatures dropped overnight into the mid-20s, with highs in the 40s. Bonnie Edwards described her son as a loving, caring young man who set an example for his children. 'I don't know anyone his age who would have done what he did' for his children, she said. 'I was so proud to say he took care of seven kids.' According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, carbon monoxide is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces. The harmful gas can build up indoors and poison people and animals who breathe it. The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. CO symptoms are often described as 'flu-like.' More than 400 Americans die each year from exposure to carbon monoxide. Sheets are held as a body is removed from a residence where a gas generator in the kitchen had run out of fuel .

"What would you get if one of the Queen's corgis ran off with one of Sir Ranulph Fiennes's Siberian huskies and had a puppy? A corgski, of course, just like Max. At just 18.5in from foot to shoulder, this diminutive fellow looks as if he was the runt of his litter. He is, in fact, a fully grown husky-corgi cross. But, unbelievably, Max has been abandoned and he's looking for a home. He's become a favourite with workers at the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex, who have been looking after him since he was found. Max (pictured) is a 18.5in high fully-grown husky corgi cross. After being abandoned, he has now taken refuge at the Dogs Trust in Basildon, Essex . Huskies, such as the one pictured, have become increasingly popular due to shows such as Game of Thrones . Pictured is a typical Welsh corgi. Max is part corgi, part husky, and is looking for a new home . 'It quickly became apparent that he was the epitome of the saying good things come in small packages,' says the Trust's Sam Davis. 'He caught the eye of our staff when he arrived, but as he was found as a stray, little is known about his life before.' Max is described as gentle, intelligent and big-hearted. There are currently 54 other wolf-like breeds being cared for by the charity's network of animal rehousing centres. The Trust is in no doubt that the trend is partly due to fans wanting to follow the stars of Game Of Thrones and Twilight, which have popularised wolf-like dogs such as Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian huskies. But many new owners are often unprepared to cope with the specific exercise and socialisation requirements of these breeds – and make a lifetime commitment to them – resulting in a significant number eventually being abandoned.","Max is a husky-corgi cross and measures 18.5in from foot to shoulder .

"The Green Party this morning pledged an end to austerity - with a £90 billion a year spending splurge . The Green Party today demanded an end austerity with a radical £176 billion a year spending splurge - paying for everything from free prescriptions to organic school dinners for all. State pensions would be increased by more than £60 a week, child benefit doubled, tuition fees scrapped and train fares cut by 10 per cent. The party also pledged to pump an extra £12billion a year into the NHS from day one, introduce universal free elderly care and nationalise the railways. But its election manifesto also revealed a host of left-field pledges - including a 'complete ban' on cages for hens and rabbits, an end to whips in horse racing and mandatory 'equality and diversity lessons' at school. Immigrants will also be given free English classes, while fruit and vegetables will be subsidised and children will be kept out of school until they are seven. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, unveiling her party's manifesto this morning, defended her 'vision of a fair economy'. She said: 'That fair economy demands the end to austerity. It demands we restore and enhance the essential public services we all but particularly the most vulnerable.' Ms Bennett's list of policy pledges will see government spending rise by £89 billion next year - and by £176billion by the end of the parliament. The extra spending would see an extra £11 billion going on debt interest. Under the party's proposal, an extra £198 billion of taxes will be introduced to pay for the raft of giveaways – worth an extra £6,600 for every taxpayer in the UK. Scroll down for video . Green Party leader Natalie Bennett and MP Caroline Lucas unveiled the Green Party general election campaigning at the Arcola Theatre, in London, this morning . Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, unveiling her party's manifesto this morning, defended her 'vision of a fair economy' The new taxes include £25 billion in new 'wealth taxes', levied at two per cent of the entire estate of someone worth £3million or more. It means someone with £10 million in assets would pay an extra £200,000 a year. Ms Bennett also proposed hitting those earning £150,000 or more with a new 60 per cent tax rate. There would also be a 'Robin Hood Tax' on financial transactions and a promise to close tax loopholes. Corporation Tax would rise to 30 per cent with duties on cigarettes and alcohol increasing by £1.4bn every year. The party would save cash by scrapping £15 billion of road improvement works. Instead the railways will be renationalised, a move the Greens claim will save £1 billion a year. Some £8 billion will be spent cutting public transport fares and HS2 will be scrapped. Tuition fees will be scrapped at a cost of £4.5 billion, while school funding will be increased by £7 billion. Grammar schools will be turned into comprehensives and the ‘cruel’ bedroom tax abolished. Ms Bennett told activists next month's election was a landmark for the party. She said it was a 'new kind of politics' where the economy and society could be run for the many and not the few. The leader said: 'It sees the end of the disastrous policy of austerity that is making the poor, the disadvantaged and the young pay for the greed and the fraud of the bankers. 'This is a vision that is exciting increasing numbers of Britons.' Turning to her jobs policy, Ms Bennett said: 'That fair economy demands every worker is paid a living wage. It is really not a radical statement to say that if you work full time you should earn enough money to live on. The party's manifesto listed a series of radical policies, including an extra £12billion for the NHS, free social care for the elderly, the nationalisation of the railways and an end to tuition fees . 'And yet we are the only UK party who is saying the minimum wage should immediately be lifted to a living wage and should reach £10 an hour by 2020.' The Green leader said protection of the NHS was at the heart of the party's election offer as she vowed to strip all private operators from the organisation. She said the 'expensive, destructive' market would be removed from the health service. Ms Bennett said: 'Behind that is an understanding of what privatisation has really meant for so many of our public services. 'It's meant the cutting of the pay and conditions of workers, it's meant the cutting of the quality of services and it has meant the shovelling of public money into private hands.' Other policies include re-nationalising the railways and policies to tackle climate change.","Greens pledge to increase government spending by £89bn next year .

"A coroner has has called for a change in the law to fence off garden swimming pools following the death of an 'adventurous' boy who drowned on his third birthday. Jack Rowe was found face down in his family's swimming pool in Upavon, Wiltshire, last July around 20 minutes after being reported missing to police. The toddler had been trying to reach a toy when he fell into the water, an inquest into his death heard. Three-year-old Jack Crowe died just days after celebrating his birthday with family (right) when he fell into their garden swimming pool . A coroner ruled the death as accidental after hearing how he 'never went near' the pool, according to relatives. Dr Clare Balysz, assistant coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, said she was in 'little doubt' of what had happened, calling for a change in the law to make fencing off swimming pools mandatory. The inquest heard how Jack was being looked after by his older brother Harry, 20, on his birthday while his parents, Nigel and Olivia Rowe, were out. When Harry returned from the bathroom to find Jack no longer in front of the television where he had been watching a Peppa Pig DVD, he alerted his father and stepmother who later called the police. As neighbours began combing the village in search of the toddler one family friend glanced at the pool in the family's garden. There, she saw Jack's lifeless body at the bottom. He was airlifted to Southampton General Hospital but later died. Olivia and Nigel Rowe are now raising awareness and money for survival swimming classes for children . The family launched a wide manhunt around their home village of Upavon, Wiltshire, after Jack went missing from watching television. He was found in the garden of their home (above) 20 minutes later . Recording an accidental death, Dr Balysz said:  'There is very little doubt in my mind as to what happened. 'I think he was an adventurous little boy and when his DVD of Peppa Pig finished he decided to take himself off outside. A charity has been set up in Jack's memory by his parents . 'I think he fell into the swimming pool and he may have been reaching for his toy. 'Children do run off the whole time and I think it’s very unfortunate and a tragic accident what happened to Jack. 'There was no fence surrounding the swimming pool.' She cited Australian laws which enforce child resistant barriers, adding that she planned to write to the Edward Thompson MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Children and Families, to implement it. 'I know it’s too late and it won’t bring Jack back but if something can be changed as a result of this at least something positive can come out of it.' Jack's parents are meanwhile campaigning to raise awareness for survival swimming lessons for children. Speaking of his son, chartered surveyor Nigel Rowe said: 'Jack has gone and we loved him - and we still love him now. 'But we still see ourselves as very lucky to have had him and because he was just so wonderful for three years. We are lucky enough to still have Ella, Harry and Laurence. 'We have difficult moments but we can look at ourselves being lucky and being unlucky but our lives go on and Jack was the unlucky one, not us. 'He was so safe with the pool and it created a degree of complacency and that is something we will always have to live with but that is hopefully all going to change.' Recalling the moment she saw the toddler at the bottom of the swimming pool, Caroline Dale said: 'I walked around the pool and I was looking hard at the bottom and I could suddenly see the shape of a small child. 'I looked in from the edge of the pool and I could see Jack was face down with his arms straight by his side. 'The colour of his clothing blended into those of the pool.' Just three days earlier the family held a part for the toddler during which they said he never went near the water's edge. Mr and Mrs Rowe said while they were lucky to have had Jack for three years. Above, the toddler with his parents and siblings, Ella, Harry and Laurence, in a family photograph . Jack's mother said she did not notice his body was in the water the first time she looked because she thought he would have floated to the top. 'I assumed that if he drowned he would have floated so I didn’t see anything in the pool and we went straight out to search the river instead. 'The little broom was floating and it had never been there before the party - it had remained in the pool since the party days earlier.' Paying tribute to her late son, she added: 'He was very outgoing, very confident, not mischievous but active. He was so easy and so kind. 'He didn’t like swimming. He loved his baths but the pool was too cold.' A post-mortem examination revealed Jack died from a cardiac arrest brought on by drowning in the pool. Detective Sergeant Jason Roberts from Wiltshire Police investigated the death and was ‘completely satisfied’ no one else was involved, describing it as ‘nothing more than a tragic accident’.","Jack Rowe died in July after falling into his family's garden swimming pool .

Lisa said Ruby kept escaping from their garden onto Mr Cook's land causing him to come and complain.

I was upset as I didn't want to cause trouble. We did our best to make sure it wouldn't happen again and I thought that would be the end of it.' But a few days later, Mr Cook returned to complain that Ruby had killed 120 of his birds and if he saw her on his land again, he would shoot her. James said he found this hard to believe as Ruby did not show any evidence of having attacked the birds as she never had blood on her fur or around her mouth. Lisa outside her home in Geldeston, Norfolk. She thought it would be the perfect place to raise her family but now wants to move following the devastating loss of their two family pets . Lisa added: 'She was gentle. I found it so hard to believe what he was saying was true. I said I wanted proof of dead pheasants before I gave him any money but we didn't hear from him again.' Terrified that Ruby's life was at risk if she escaped from their garden again, Lisa and James made the painful decision to have her re-homed. 'Ruby's safety came first so we have to give her away, it tore me apart for three or four months,' Lisa said. Her young son Ryan added he was also upset they had to give her away. 'Ruby was a really gentle dog, I loved her but she kept escaping. I was devastated, heartbroken, I had her for a long time,' he said. The family decided to keep one of Ruby's puppies, Marley, and hoped she would not have her mother's adventurous tendency to roam outside their garden. For years, they didn't have any trouble with Mr Cook so they decided to get two more dogs, Lily and Bella in 2013. But the three dogs started following in Ruby's footsteps and repeatedly escaped onto Mr Cook's land. The Tuttle's first dog Ruby, pictured, had to be re-homed because she kept escaping from their garden . Ryan said they tried to put up more fences and block holes to stop the dogs leaving their garden 'but they kept digging under the hedge and getting out.' However, as they had no further complaints from their neighbours, Lisa didn't think too much of it. In August 2014, they arranged to go away for a family holiday leaving her mother and sister to look after the three dogs. Three days into their trip, they received some shocking news. 'My mum called and said the farmer had complained that Lily and Marley had been on his land,' Lisa recalled. 'It was a shock as I hadn't had any runs in with him since Ruby. 'She said they had both been shot, they're dead. It was like a dream, I was devastated.' Mr Cook said the dogs had broken into one of his pens and slaughtered his birds. This gave his gamekeeper the right to shot them under the Protection of Livestock Act. Owners whose dogs are killed can prosecute on the grounds that their property has been destroyed. Lisa reveals how they tried to patch up holes in their garden walls and fences to stop the dogs getting out but they kept digging holes to escape . Marley, pictured, was killed for worrying livestock after the farmer's gamekeeper acted within the law when the dogs were said to break into a bird pen on farmer John Cook's property . But if the killer has a 'lawful excuse' - such as where there were no other means of ending or preventing the dogs worrying their livestock - they have not committed an offence. Mr Cook says he and his gamekeeper acted with the law and they have not been charged with any wrong-doing. It's a bitter pill for the Tuttles to swallow as they say they are bereft at the loss of their two pets. Ryan said when he heard the dogs had been killed he felt like 'a chunk of me was gone, it was like my heart was pulled away.' Meanwhile, Lisa, who still has one dog, Bella, says she is also struggling to come to terms with what happened and no longer wants to live in the area. She said: 'I'm on anti-depressants. I don't want to live here anymore. Everywhere there are reminders of what he's done and what he's taken away from us.'

"The nation has yet to hear the first words of Prince George. But thanks to new puppet show Newzoids, we can at least get a version of them. In true satirical style, the 20-month-old has been cast as a blinged-up rascal with a tattoo on his arm. Teasers for the ITV programme – which starts tonight at 9pm – show the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge worrying that their son has turned out a little, well, common. Scroll down for video . 'Rascal': A new satire puppet show sees Prince George 'blinged-up' with a tattoo, addressing a female doctor with 'Oi, oi! Hello treacle' A doctor is called to assess his condition and the young prince bounces on screen with a big, gold ‘G’ pendant around his neck. The youngster says to the waiting female doctor ‘Oi, oi! Hello treacle. Is that a ladder in your tights or a stairway to heaven?’ before proceeding to smack her on the bottom. The plotline plays off newspaper headlines which dubbed his mother Kate the Commoner. Debra Stephenson, one of the show’s impressionists, admitted that mocking the royal family is a daunting task. ‘It feels extremely mischievous doing all those voices but it is done for fun. I don't know how it would be received. It's a very daunting thought,’ she told the Daily Mail. Teasers for ITVs new puppet show sees the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge worrying that their son has turned out a little 'common' 'Daunting task': Newzoids starts Wednesday at 9pm and kicks off by making fun of the Royal Family . Big brother: Prince George could be days away of becoming an older brother as the Duchess is due to give birth to her second child 'mid- to late April' ‘You try and pass it off and think “Oh, they won’t possibly watch it” but there is always the worry that someone will be shown a clip on YouTube or something.’ Of the Prince George skit, she said: ‘I like it because it is so surreal. The papers have dubbed Kate 'Kate the Commoner' but she is clearly not common in any way. 'But the idea is quite funny, the idea she could have this throwback gene to something like this.’ Another of the show’s impressionists, Jon Culshaw, best known for Dead Ringers, added: ‘It was an idea that chimed with the writers to have Prince George as a bit of a rascal who runs around saying “Oi, oi!”. It’s an absurd and funny extreme.’ Prince George and his parents will be joined on screen by the Queen, Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall in a series of sketches titled Mrs Crown’s Boys. Other famous faces on the Newzoids roll call are Ant and Dec, Wayne Rooney, Beyonce, Harry Styles, David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, Barack Obama, Russell Brand and Simon Cowell.","Satire puppet show depicts Prince George as a 'blinged-up rascal'

"No-fly list: Chris Roberts, a computer security researcher on his way to give a talk about computer security vulnerabilities at a major conference was told he couldn't fly on United Airlines Saturday, due to comments he'd made on Twitter . United Airlines stopped a prominent security researcher from boarding a California-bound flight late Saturday, following a social media post by the researcher days earlier suggesting the airline's onboard systems could be hacked. The researcher, Chris Roberts, attempted to board a United flight from Colorado to San Francisco to speak at a major security conference there this week, but was stopped by the airline's corporate security at the gate. Roberts founded One World Labs, which tries to discover security risks before they are exploited. Roberts had been removed from a United flight on Wednesday by the FBI after landing in Syracuse, New York, and was questioned for four hours after jokingly suggesting on Twitter he could get the oxygen masks on the plane to deploy. Authorities also seized Roberts' laptop and other electronics, although his lawyer says he hasn't seen a search warrant. A lawyer for Roberts said United gave him no detailed explanation on Saturday why he wasn't allowed on the plane, saying instead the airline would be sending Roberts a letter within two weeks stating why they wouldn't let him fly on their aircraft. 'Given Mr. Roberts' claims regarding manipulating aircraft systems, we've decided it's in the best interest of our customers and crew members that he not be allowed to fly United,' airline spokesman Rahsaan Johnson told The Associated Press. 'However, we are confident our flight control systems could not be accessed through techniques he described.' When asked what threat Roberts posed if United's systems couldn't be compromised, Johnson said Sunday: 'We made this decision because Mr. Roberts has made comments about having tampered with aircraft equipment, which is a violation of United policy and something customers and crews shouldn't have to deal with.' Grounded: United made the decision not to allow Roberts to fly on United 'because he had made public statements about having manipulated airfare equipment and aircraft systems'. In this Tweet, Roberts speculates on whether he should give the command to drop a 737's oxygen masks . Hacking: Once onboard, he pondered on Twitter whether he would be able to hack into the flight's onboard computer settings. In a previous Tweet (seen here) he posted pictures containing details of aircraft data . Concern: Roberts was questioned by FBI agents  for four hours. All of his computer equipment, including an iPad, a MacBook Pro, several hard drives and several USB memory sticks were confiscated . Johnson said the airline reached Roberts several hours before his flight to tell him he couldn't fly. But a lawyer for Roberts said Sunday that when his client received that call, the caller would only say he or she was from United, and wouldn't give Roberts a name or callback number. When Roberts then tried calling the number back from his phone's caller ID, it rang instead to a resort hotel, and Roberts assumed it was a prank call, Roberts' lawyer said. In recent weeks, Roberts gave media interviews in which he discussed airline system vulnerabilities. 'Quite simply put, we can theorize on how to turn the engines off at 35,000 feet and not have any of those damn flashing lights go off in the cockpit,' he told Fox News. Roberts also told CNN he was able to connect to a box under his seat at least a dozen times to view data from the aircraft's engines, fuel and flight-management systems. 'It is disappointing that United refused to allow him to board, and we hope that United learns that computer security researchers are a vital ally, not a threat,' said Nate Cardozo, a staff attorney with the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, which represents Roberts. Expert? Roberts' talk that he was about to give was in part about the vulnerabilities of transportation systems . Blocked: United isn't happy about Chris Roberts being on its planes will no longer allow him to fly on its aircraft . Cardozo said Sunday he hasn't seen a copy of a search warrant that would have been used to seize Roberts' electronics, and that he's working to get the devices returned. The FBI declined to comment on the matter Sunday. The Government Accountability Office said last week that some commercial aircraft may be vulnerable to hacking over their onboard wireless networks. 'Modern aircraft are increasingly connected to the Internet. This interconnectedness can potentially provide unauthorized remote access to aircraft avionics systems,' its report found. Roberts took an alternate flight on Southwest Airlines and arrived in San Francisco Saturday evening. He speaks this week at the RSA Conference about computer security vulnerabilities.","Chris Roberts says he sent his tweet because he's frustrated that a security flaw isn't being addressed .

"Union barons handed Ed Miliband more than £1.6million in the first week of the election campaign – treble the donations received by the Tories. Figures released by the Electoral Commission revealed that Labour received £1.9million in the week to April 5, with 84 per cent coming from just three trade unions. It included a £1million cheque from Unite, entrenching Labour’s reliance on the union’s militant boss Len McCluskey. Ed Miliband received  £1.6m from union barons in the first week of the election campaign, figures have revealed . Conservative donations totalled just over £500,000 in the first week of the campaign, with about a quarter coming from donors with links to hedge funds. Critics have accused Labour of being bound by its union paymasters after the party unveiled policies including raising corporation tax, introducing a mansion tax, repealing the benefits cap, nationalising the railways and scrapping employment tribunal fees. Since Mr Miliband became party leader, thanks largely to union backing, nearly £7 in every £10 donated to Labour has come from the unions – amounting to more than £40million. In the first round of election donations registered, £506,240 was given by Unison, while the CWU gave £51,072. Labour received a £1million cheque from Unite, entrenching Labour’s reliance on the union’s militant boss Len McCluskey (pictured) The party did attract one large business donation, from property tycoon Sir David Garrard. The former tax exile, who was involved in the cash-for-honours controversy, gave £250,000. Ukip received only £35,416 in the period but last night its coffers were boosted by a £1million donation from Daily Express owner Richard Desmond, who gave £300,000 last year. In the week to April 5, the Conservatives received £501,850 and the Lib Dems £20,000. One of the most generous gifts to the Tories – £75,000 – came from Michael Tory, who was in charge of Lehman Brothers’ UK investment banking division when the bank nearly crashed the West’s economy. Sawsan Asfari, wife of long-time Tory donor and oil executive Ayman Asfari, gave £20,000. Syrian-born Mr Asfari, who has given the Tories about £400,000, was made a ‘business ambassador’ by David Cameron last year. Home insurance boss Richard Harpin of Homeserve gave £50,000. His company was fined £30million last year for a mis-selling scandal. Hedge fund manager, James Diner, who once dated model Caprice, gave £25,000 while socialite Fitriani Hay, who co-owns property development firm JMP Group with her racehorse-owning husband James, donated £66,850. Ukip received £25,000 from Robin Birley, who is also bankrolling Tory chief whip Michael Gove’s re-election campaign. Nick Clegg’s friend Anthony Ullmann, boss of polyester yarn company Autofil, and Joseph Zammit-Lucia, who describes himself as a ‘compulsive contrarian’ on his website, each gave £10,000 to the Lib Dems. Tory candidate Henry Smith said: ‘The union fatcats have once again lavished the dosh on Ed Miliband. That’s because they know he’s a weak leader who’ll dance to more than one tune: not only SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon’s, but their’s too. Those tunes mean more spending, more borrowing and Britain back to bankruptcy.’ Conservative donations totalled just over £500,000 in the first week of the campaign, with about a quarter coming from donors with links to hedge funds . David Cameron and Ed Miliband are indulging in fantasy economics, the TaxPayers’ Alliance claimed. It said both parties were making unrealistic spending pledges to win votes. The think-tank’s Jonathan Isaby said: ‘It’s clear that nobody is facing up to the true scale of the deficit reduction challenge. 'It is a fantasy to pretend that you can balance Britain’s books without significant spending reductions, and politicians must come clean about what they will be. Voters deserve real honesty.’","Labour received £1.9million in week to April 5, new figures have revealed .

"An unidentified college student managed to get away without any kind of punishment after cops caught her drinking underage at a festival - because she beat them at a game of Rock Paper Scissors. A video posted on social media site Vine by a user known as Old Row, shows the girl surrounded by her fellow festival goers at Texas-based country music festival Chilifest last weekend, facing up to three officers who are believed to have busted her for drinking, before challenging her to a round of the beloved playground game.

"David Crossley developed large kidney stones . Like many busy people, David Crossley often used to find himself so wrapped up in his working day that he would go without lunch, and often barely stopped for a cup of tea. In fact, David, 63, a musculoskeletal therapist from Birmingham, admits: 'I would often be so busy at the clinic that I'd forget to drink any liquid at all, other than the odd cup of tea or coffee. It had been the same way for years - although I would drink more water at weekends.' Last year, this habit caught up with him. He noticed a vague ache in his abdomen, stretching around to his back. 'It wasn't agonising but it just didn't feel quite right, so I went to the GP,' he says. 'As I had some bloating, he sent me for an ultrasound.' This revealed two large stones in his right kidney - a direct result, his doctors believe, of his low fluid intake. A CT scan showed that the stones were so large (6 mm across) they could not be passed naturally, and he needed surgery. One in ten of us will develop a kidney stone, and the numbers are rising dramatically. They are the result of waste products in the blood forming crystals inside the kidneys, which eventually build up into a solid lump. They can be excruciatingly painful - on a level, say experts, with childbirth. The stones often remain symptomless while they're in the kidney. They start causing pain - known as renal colic - once they travel down the ureter, the narrow tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. 'Renal colic is caused by the stone suddenly blocking the ureter,' says Mr Leye Ajayi, consultant urological surgeon at the Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth, London. The pain often comes on suddenly and can cause the patient to 'writhe around in agony', he adds. The pain can be intense enough to cause nausea and vomiting. Once on the move, a stone can take days or weeks to travel out of the body. In that time, it may cause persistent or intermittent pain in the back, groin or side, a need to urinate more than usual, and pain when urinating. Sometimes, if a stone blocks the exit of urine from the kidney, it can lead to a build-up of bacteria and trigger a kidney infection. Signs of this include a fever, shivering, extreme weakness, diarrhoea, or cloudy and bad-smelling urine. The bad news is that the number of people developing troublesome stones is rocketing. Emergency admissions to hospital for kidney stones have shot up during the past decade by 136 per cent, according to official figures, rising from just above 5,000 to almost 12,000 per year. Meanwhile, the number of people going in for planned non-emergency treatment for stones has almost doubled in the same period, rising from 26,666 in 2004 to 51,340. The cause for his condition, doctors believe, was low fluid intake . And bizarrely, it may be that healthier lifestyles - doing tough workouts at the gym, and then not drinking enough, or shunning carbohydrates - are partly to blame, and may be why cases are going up, especially among women. 'More men than women used to suffer from kidney stones, with a ratio of about three to one,' says Mr Ajayi. 'But an increasing number of women now get them, and the ratio is evening up.' The main cause of kidney stones is dehydration. 'Your kidneys are your waste-disposal system,' explains Dr Kathryn Griffith, the Royal College of GPs' clinical champion for kidney care. 'They discard all the waste chemicals produced by your body, and they can do this efficiently if enough liquid is drunk to help flush them through. 'But if you become dehydrated, you overload the kidneys with urine that has a high concentration of stone-forming chemicals, and these begin to bind together to build stones.' To avoid this, you need to drink enough to ensure your urine is 'the colour of white wine', says Dr Griffith - around 1.2 litres a day. You need more during hot weather or after exercise. Changing diet trends are also pushing the figures up. 'There has been a trend, especially in people either wanting to lose weight or bulk up muscle, to eat low-carb, high-protein diets,' says Dr Griffith. 'The animal proteins found in meat and fish break down into a waste chemical called uric acid (a known stone-former) in your urine. They also reduce the amount of citrate (a stone-inhibitor). 'This can lead to uric acid stones forming, especially if you also don't drink enough fluid to assist the kidneys in their disposal job.' There are other causes, too. Your kidneys remove sodium, which is the main component of salt, from your body. When they do this, they excrete calcium, too. But low-carb diets could also put you at risk . So the more salt you eat, the more calcium you will have in your urine, which can build into stones. Obesity is another risk factor. 'Obese people are more likely to have insulin resistance (where the body can't use insulin effectively),' says Mr Ajayi. This causes a change to the nature of urine, making it more acidic, which increases the risk of uric acid stones forming in the kidney. Eating excessive amounts of oxalate is another culprit, as it can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones - the most common kind. Oxalate-rich foods include tea, spinach, rhubarb, nuts, strawberries, beetroot and chocolate. They are all fine in moderation, but avoid large daily quantities. If you have more than two urinary tract infections within a short space of time, you should ask your GP for an ultrasound to rule out a less common kind of kidney stone called struvite stones, which are caused by a build-up of bacteria from repeated urinary tract infections, adds Dr Griffith. Virtually all stones under 5 mm in diameter can be passed naturally, with only prescription-strength pain relief and medication that relaxes the ureter needed while this happens, says Mr Ajayi. But if a stone is bigger, you may need to have treatment. The most common is extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). This involves sending shock-waves of energy through the skin that break down the stone. 'This works for stones up to about 10 mm in diameter, but not for bigger ones, or for stones that are very hard,' says Mr Ajayi. 'It's also ineffective in most cases for people with obesity, as the shock-waves have further to go to reach the stone.' For bigger or harder stones, a ureteroscopy is performed. Under general anaesthetic, a thin scope is passed up your urethra and a laser is used to break up the stone. For very large stones (those over 15 mm), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is used. A nephroscope - a telescope-like device - is inserted through a small incision in your back. The stone is broken up using a combination of high-frequency ultrasound and pneumatic energy (a bit like a pneumatic drill digging up a road). David Crossley had a ureteroscopy at the BMI Priory Hospital, Birmingham, in September. 'I was out the day after my surgery, and although there was some discomfort around my kidneys for a few days, thankfully I'm now stone-free.' He knows that a person who has had a stone has a 50 per cent chance of developing them again within five years unless they make changes to their lifestyle. 'The lifestyle changes that can be made to stop stones recurring are the same as those for avoiding them in the first place: proper hydration, low-salt, staying a healthy weight and reducing animal protein,' says Mr Ajayi. The British Association of Urological Surgeons advises that we should be aiming for no more than four of the following protein portions a day, two of which should be dairy to ensure you have enough calcium: 50-75 g of red meat, chicken or fish; two eggs; ½ pint of milk; 50g cheese; a small pot of yogurt. Mr Ajayi also recommends drinking water with lemon juice in it daily, as the citrate (a form of acetic acid) in lemons is a natural stone inhibitor that can prevent calcium from binding with other substances, such as oxalates, that lead to stones. Today, David ensures that he gets enough fluid. 'I didn't know that being too busy to drink enough could lead to kidney stones,' he says. 'I now drink water religiously!'","Doctors believe low fluid intake led to David Crossley's kidney stones .

"A 78-year-old Connecticut man with a long criminal history was arrested on Friday, but the man's lawyer claimed the arrest was a ruse intended to pressure him to talk about the biggest art heist in U.S. history. Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, . Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to . an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan McGuigan, contended Federal Bureau of . Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the . theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart . Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video . Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan McGuigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 . A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist . This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught . 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they . think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' McGuigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are . threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the . Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and . threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black. Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter . Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum . Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck . The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined . to comment on McGuigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, . 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the . museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair . allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs . in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on . the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum . The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces . Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung . In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an Édouard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case . gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar . FBI investigators have long said they believed organized . crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed . a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked . if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court . testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the . stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police . uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most . recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of . illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms . The FBI, pictured here in 2013, has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum .","Robert Gentile was  charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent .

"The mother of a recovering anorexic has taken the brave decision to reveal shocking photographs of her daughter's frail five-stone frame to help others gripped by the devastating eating disorder overcome their illness. Consumed by an obsession with the 'perfect body', Emma Walker slipped into a dangerous cycle, her weight plummeting in a matter of months. Such was the severity of her eating disorder, that the 15-year-old was admitted to hospital twice and faced rigorous counselling sessions. Today, Emma, whose decision to release the photos is supported by her mother Kim Waddington, said she wants to help other anorexia sufferers. By combating the compulsion to be skinny  - and instead focusing on getting fit and building her muscle definition - she is now a healthier eight stone. Emma Walker became obsessed with achieving the 'perfect body'. Within months her weight had plummeted to five-and-a-half stone (left) as the eating disorder anorexia took hold. Today, weighing a healthier eight stone (right) the 15-year-old is sharing her story to help others . Emma's mother Kim, left, said it was devastating watching her daughter face her 'horrific' ordeal . 'I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I went through,' Emma said. 'I went through hell. 'I've realised I was miserable when I'd lost weight. 'But I've learned so much from what I've been through and if my story can even help one person beat anorexia, I would be so happy. 'I'm 10 times stronger than I've ever been before.' Ms Waddington described watching her daughter battle the eating disorder as a 'horrific' ordeal. 'I felt so out of control and every day is a battle. I woke up thinking about it and would go to bed thinking about it,' she said. 'It's a monster that had taken over my daughter and we were fighting that monster every day. It was horrific watching my daughter go through it all.' Emma, from Blaby, Leicestershire, first felt the urge to lose weight after seeing pictures of celebrities in magazines. Quickly, she said, it became an obsession. She said: 'Whoever was on the front cover, I wanted to be like them. 'I became very depressed about the way I looked because I wasn't as skinny as them, I didn't want to look in the mirror anymore.' Within weeks her weight had plummeted to eight stone, but she was compelled to shed more. 'I would go online about 100 times a day, obsessively trying to find new ways of losing weight,' she said. 'I tried every diet I could find as I thought it would make me perfect. 'My body image changed but I still thought I was big; I wanted to lose more weight.' By the time she returned to school in September, Emma had dropped to a size four. She described herself as having 'an addiction' to losing weight. 'By the time I went back to school in September, I was barely eating anything,' she said. 'When I first started, people were complimenting me so it made me want to keep going, it was addictive.' Emma, pictured left and right while battling anorexia, first felt the urge to lose weight after seeing pictures of celebrities in magazines and social media sites. Quickly, she said, it became an obsession . But after being admitted to hospital twice, and extensive counselling, the teenager said she is now on the road to recovery, gradually gaining weight again, left and right . However, during her first term back in school, Emma's condition deteriorated as a result of no food and excessive exercise. 'I was exhausted,' she said. 'I would get colds frequently, my immune system was weak and a thin layer of hair had grown all over my body in an attempt to keep me warm. 'Worst of all, my periods had stopped. Now, looking back, that's one of the major warning signs - when you're body isn't healthy enough to carry a baby.' Finally, after resisting initially, Emma went with mother Kim Waddington, 46, to see her GP during the October half term. He told Emma definitively that she was anorexic and sent her straight to hospital. However, the teenager said being told how sick she actually was did not change anything in her mind. 'Being told I was anorexic didn't really change anything within me, I was still in denial,' she said. 'It felt like I was being forced to recover and that wasn't the right environment for me. 'In the end, I was drinking water and hiding food in my dressing gown to make people think I was improving. They let me out of hospital but I still wasn't gaining weight.' Emma's continued lack of progress started to cause arguments at home sparking 'hysterical' rows with her mother. 'It got really bad, I was throwing things at her as she was making me eat,' she said. 'She was distraught; I know now she was doing it for my own good but at the time it felt like she was punishing me.' By combating the compulsion to be skinny and rather focus on getting fit and building her muscle definition, Emma is now a healthier eight stone . Emma was admitted to hospital again in January - it proved to be the turning point. 'When I was admitted again, I was told my urea level was 15 when it is supposed to be 6, meaning I was dangerously dehydrated,' she said. 'My blood pressure was off the scale as well. It was then I realised that I couldn't do this anymore, my family didn't deserve what I was putting them through. 'I started going to counselling and it changed my outlook on the whole thing, it made me want to get better rather than feeling like I was being forced. 'I stopped looking at thin people on Instagram and started looking at body-building pictures, it made me think I want to be strong, not skinny, and it has made me slowly improve.' Now at a much healthier weight, Emma says she still has bad days but that she now wants to act as an inspiration to others. 'Everyone has bad days when they get up and don't like the way they look, and I'm no different,' she said. 'But people need to know that if you want to get yourself out of anorexia enough, it can be done. 'If my story can stop someone feeling as low as I did, I will be really happy.'

"Arrested: Veteran William Snyder, 34, has been charged in connection with the disappearance and death of his wife, Kelley Jo Snyder, 34 . The husband of a Pennsylvania mother of three has been charged with abuse of a corpse and evidence-tampering after the discovery of her body over the weekend. Army-veteran William Snyder, 34, was charged hours after the body of his wife, Kelley Jo Snyder, 34, was found in a river near to their home on Saturday. She was last seen alive on Easter Sunday. Police in Renovo say that Snyder has admitted moving the body from their home and also having fabricated a ransom note seeking $60,000 for his wife's safe return. Coroner Zachary Hanna said the cause and manner of death are pending results of toxicology tests. State police have said they expect more charges to be filed after the results are published. Snyder is currently in the Clinton County Correctional Facility on $500,000 bail and was arrested at a motel in the small town of Horseheads on Friday in New York after presumably fleeing last week. He was returned across the state border and charged the next day. A police affidavit seen by PennLive.com claims that Snyder, who uses the name BJ, has admitted removing his wife's body from their home and taking it to the Halls Run river. Recovered: The body of Shelley Jo Snyder was found in a river near to where she lived with her husband . Day out: William and Shelley-Jo Snyder with their son on a day out to the Met Life stadium in New Jersey . He is the alleged to have sent a ransom note to a local restaurant, himself and an email to police demanding money for her safe return. Snyder first reported his wife missing at 12.01 on the Monday following Easter Sunday sparking a huge search of the local area. Snyder and her three children said they had last seen Kelly Jo leave the family home at at around 5.45pm right before they sat down to eat their Easter dinner. She is supposed to have left the home to pick up sweet potatoes, but police claim she never made it the store. Police said they spoke to her 14-year-old son and he told them she had taken her wallet, bank card and identification with her. Family affair: Shelley-Jo was last seen at just before 6.00pm on Easter Sunday when she told her family she was going to buy some sweet potatoes . On Wednesday, during the search of the neighborhood, BJ's sister, T.T. Wertz found her sister-in-laws waller near to her house even though the area had been thoroughly searched. On Tuesday, Snyder spoke to Newswatch 16 before his wife's body was discovered. 'We just hope if she is out there and can see this or someone sees this and has any info to get a hold of us,' said Snyder to the local news station. In court papers, Snyder has admitted to sending the ransom note to his own address and to a local restaurant and an email to police before he was arrested. Neighbors of the pair have expressed disbelief at the turn of events. 'I think they are wrong. I don’t think it was him, so I think they need to do a little more investigating other than pinning on the husband,' said Faith Marr, a neighbor to Newswatch 16.","Husband William Snyder has been charged with evidence tampering .

"When Nic Newling recalls his childhood, he remembers misleading highs and deep depressions where the only option he could see for himself was committing suicide. But it was the unexpected and tragic death of his teenage brother, Christopher, who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective. Now, the 28-year-old is using his story of loss and confusion - in which he moved between doctors and psychiatric wards and was fed various concoctions of prescriptive medication before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - to raise awareness of mental illness. Mental health advocate Nic Newling struggled through the confusing highs and depressing lows of an undiagnosed bipolar disorder between the ages of 13 and 18 . It was the unexpected and tragic death of his older, teenage brother Christopher (pictured right with Nic left), who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective . Academically driven from a young age, Nic said that the time he was eight years old, he had planned his whole life out in his mind with the intention of becoming a vet. 'I got into a high school with a scholarship; at that point I was really happy for the first six months, but I pushed myself too hard and put an unrealistic amount of pressure on myself and just crashed. What it looked like was not having any other interests, being snappy and grumpy and angry - which are all things that are not like me at all,' he told Daily Mail Australia. His bad moods progressed into forms of anxiety and depression and what Nic described as an 'overwhelming sadness that didn't come from any particular place', before taking on a level of psychosis. 'When things first started getting bad, I was experiencing symptoms of agitation, panic attacks, I was withdrawing from friends and life and not finding pleasure in the things that I used to find pleasurable, I was experiencing what I thought was OCD behaviors and I started thinking I was hearing things that weren't real,' he said. Both Nic (left) and Christopher (centre, with eldest brother Ben right) suffered from mental health problems at the same time . Unlike Nic (left), Christopher (with Ben right) was not as open about his emotions and his anxiety and depression. His death came as a shock to the family who had been focusing on Nic's struggles . 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. 'I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room.' By year eight, Nic had admitted himself into a psychiatric ward - a move that marked the beginning of years of confusions and various treatments including electroconvulsive therapy - in a desperate bid to rid himself of his confusing emotions. 'On average, statistics show that it takes 20 years for someone with bipolar to go from having the symptoms to being diagnosed - and that's not even treating it,' Nic said. 'Compared to that, I'm one of the lucky ones.' A high achiever from a young age, Nic (pictured left and right) 'crashed' after pushing himself too hard in the first year of high school . His anxiety and depression progressed into a type of psychosis and he soon admitted himself into a psychiatric ward for almost nine months . But along with the cold, stale, square rooms, the psychiatric wards offered a surprising comfort: other people who were not afraid to talk about mental illness. 'I really liked that psych ward. I didn't want to leave because I met so many people there from different backgrounds and religions and with different ideas about the world … and the reason I really got along with these guys was because it was the first time I had met other people with mental health issues and that it was such a non-issue. 'They'd be like ""what have you got?"" and I'd say ""I think I have psychosis or depression"" and they'd just say ""OK, cool. Do you want to play Nintendo now?"" That planted the seed a little bit: maybe talking about this stuff is really helpful, not damaging.' The level of support and acceptance of mental health problems that Nic experienced was a far cry from the experience of his older brother Christopher. 'Everyone was really worried about me being suicidal because it was such a measured thought-out decision for me - I was sort of at the point where I was convinced there was no point in living but couldn't deal with the guilty because my family had been so good to me,' Nic said. 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic (pictured) was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun . 'Then Chris ended up killing himself when I had just turned 16 and he was just shy of 18. 'He had his heart set on being a professional rugby player but had some problems with his legs and had to get surgery. He was bed ridden for a while and that made his depression and anxiety a lot worse because he pretty much just lived for rugby. 'He became withdrawn: he wouldn't talk about his depression. I was open about it to close friends and family whereas he would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man. Devastated by the unexpected turn of events, Nic's eldest brother was left to organize Christopher's funeral while his mother became a recluse and the rest of the family tried to shield Nic from the event, desperate to avoid another tragedy. Christopher's (left and right) mental health problems peaked after a surgery that left him bed ridden and unable to play rugby: 'He would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man' 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness. 'After he died there were five chairs at the dinner table and only four people and you can't ignore that. We started having dinner in front of the television permanently because, what do you talk about? How can you discuss anything and have that chair sitting there?' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun. His death shattered their family: 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness,' Nic said (pictured from a young age with his brothers and father) 'Our first family Christmas in a very long time, just last year': Left to right Ben and his son Zach, mum, dad, Nic's best friend Ryle, Nic, and family friend Daisy . 'I'd had heaps of different meds for heaps of different diagnosis. I'd had shock therapy when I was 16 which was once I'd had every meds that existed for the condition and meant we were really scraping the bottom of the barrel by falling back on like 1960s meds,' he said. 'But it wasn't that the meds weren't working or the dosage was wrong, it was that I was being treatment for something I didn't have.' 'Now things are good. I take a small maintenance dose of medication, one pill a day, with no side effect: a mood stabilizer which just feels like taking a vitamin. I've got a great job working in mental health, I live with my best friend, have a great girlfriend - I don't want to say it's perfect, but what a dramatic turnaround!'

"Search: It has been revealed police spent £16,000 on hunt to find cancer sufferer Ashya King . The grandmother of brain cancer victim Ashya King has criticised police for spending more than £16,000 on the search for him. Hampshire police launched the hunt after the five-year-old, pictured, was taken from Southampton General Hospital by his parents last August so he could be treated abroad. The couple were found in Spain but released without charge. A Freedom of Information request revealed staff and officers claimed £12,712.97 in overtime over six days. A further £1406 was spent on accommodation, £792 on flights, £132 on travel and parking, £213 on food and subsistence and £900 on hiring experts to report to the CPS. Patricia King, 77, said: 'It's disgusting to spend all that money when there's crime going on. It's just a joke. 'It was absolutely disgraceful chasing my son and putting him in prison.' Medics claimed the Kings had put Ashya's life at risk by fleeing the country with him. However after their released he was flown to a hospital in the Czech Republic to undergo proton beam therapy and is now on the road to recovery. Assistant Chief Constable of Hampshire Constabulary Sara Glen said Ashya's welfare was the priority. She said: 'If we receive a report that there is imminent threat to the life of a child, we will act swiftly to provide a response to ensure that the child is located.

"Dr Dorin Scladan removed the 11lb (5kg) growth from the woman, who had believed she was pregnant . A Romanian woman who believed she was pregnant was devastated to be told she actually had an 11lb tumour inside her uterus. Madalina Neagu, 42, arrived at a hospital in with severe pain in her abdomen and told doctors she believed she was in labour. As a result, medics at Botosani County Hospital prepared to operate to deliver the child. But after carrying out tests, they were shocked to discover she wasn't pregnant at all. Instead, she was actually carrying a 11lbs (5kg) tumour inside her uterus. One of the doctors treating her, Dr Dorin Scladan, 47, said: 'As the woman told us she was pregnant, we initially expected pregnancy complications. 'In fact, the size of her belly was quite similar to that of a nine-month pregnant woman, so we didn't have any reason to doubt what she told us.' Dr Sclandan and his colleage Dr Camelia Todica, 43, carried out an operation to remove the tumour. The patient was then transferred to intensive care - and doctors say she will recover. Dr Scladan said: 'We don't often see a tumour of this size and in this location.' The news comes after last year MailOnline reported on the story of Lorna Fulton, 44, who desperately wanted a family and believed she was pregnant when her stomach began to swell. She had ballooned to a size 26 and her waistline had been expanding despite months of dieting. But while she hoped this was a sign she was expecting, specialists discovered a huge ovarian cyst. Mrs Fulton was forced to undergo a full hysterectomy at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary where medics drained more than 32 litres of fluid from her stomach. It was revealed she had been carrying around a 5st cyst, a sac of fluid that forms on the ovary, for months. She recovered after the operation, and although she now cannot have children, says she feels 'lucky to be alive'. Doctors carried out emergency surgery to remove the tumour from the woman's uterus, and she was transferred to intensive care . And in 2012, MailOnline reported on the story of Kayleigh Terry, 21, who believed she was pregnant with her first child after gaining weight. But she was terrified to discover she actually had cancer. An ultrasound scan revealed she had a large cancerous growth which covered an area from her breast to her lower abdomen. She was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma and had emergency chemotherapy to shrink the potentially deadly tumour. Miss Terry lost her hair and eye-lashes along with 3st in weight after the shrunken tumour was removed a few months later. But after treatment, she was given the all clear, and now hopes to start her own family.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament when he was found using his smartphone in the middle of a match . A chess grandmaster has been thrown out of an international tournament and faces a 15-year ban after he was caught sneaking to the toilet to check moves on his mobile phone. Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament when he was found using his phone in the middle of a match. The two-time national champion was exposed when his opponent lodged a complaint when he grew suspicious about his frequent trips to the lavatory. Tournament organisers found Nigalidze had stored a mobile phone in a cubicle, covered in toilet paper. They announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page. The complaint was made by Nigalidze's opponent in their sixth-round match in the tournament, Armenia's Tigran Petrosian. He said: 'Nigalidze would promptly reply to my moves and then literally run to the toilet. 'I noticed that he would always visit the same toilet partition, which was strange, since two other partitions weren't occupied. 'I informed the chief arbiter about my growing suspicions and asked him to keep an eye on Gaioz. 'After my opponent left the very toilet partition yet another time, the arbiters entered it. 'What they found was the mobile phone with headphones; the device was hidden behind the pan and covered with toilet paper.' Tournament organisers at the Dubai Open Chess tournament announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page . When officials confronted the Georgian, he denied owning the device but officials found the phone was logged into a social networking site under his name. They also found his match being analysed in one of the chess applications. He was promptly removed from the tournament and could now face a maximum 15-year ban from the game. When questioned about the offence, Nigalidze said: 'Not everything is true in what Petrosian said'. This is not the first time a player was caught cheating at a chess tournament. In July 2013, Bulgarian player Borislav Ivanov was suspended from playing for four months by his national federation. It had been found most of his moves matched those of the leading computer chess analysis programs. Two years earlier the French chess federation suspended three players, including the national team captain, when it was alleged they used text messages, a remote chess computer and coded signals to beat the opposition at the 2010 Chess Olympiad. In 2008, at the Dubai Open, an Iranian player was banned when he was found to be receiving help from someone watching the game's live broadcast on the internet and was sending the moves through text messages. Tournaments sanctioned by the International Chess Federation - including the Dubai Open - do not allow players to carry mobile phones and other electronic devices during matches.","Gaioz Nigalidze has been expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament .

He was taken to hospital shortly before 5pm yesterday, but died this afternoon. Mr Jack, a father-of-three, collapsed while covering the dress rehearsal of  Andy Murray’s wedding yesterday . This is the last picture taken by photographer Gordon Jack, which he tweeted - he became unwell as press and the public gathered outside Dunblane Cathedral for Andy Murray's wedding rehearsal and died later . Murray was feet away from the photographer yesterday when he lost his balance while taking pictures of the event. The 27-year-old former Wimbledon champion leant towards the photographer with visible concern after the incident, until he was ushered away by his security team. Mr Jack was found to be unconscious and was taken to Forth Valley Hospital, in Larbert, near Falkirk, where he is understood to have been placed in a medically induced coma. He died from complications following a heart attack. Mr Jack ran the Scotimage agency in Linlithgow, West Lothian and did freelance newspaper and public relations work. He is survived by his wife Gilly and three children Megan, Sam and Emily. Tonight, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon sent her condolences to Mr Jack's family.

"From a rusting Ferris wheel to a train rendered barely visible due to overgrown weeds, this Japanese theme park hasn't heard the happy screams of visiting children in a very long time. In its heyday, Kejonuma Leisure Land, in Tohoku, Japan, attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors. With an amusement park, campsite and driving range, the once-bustling family-friendly attraction closed its doors officially in 2000 following a drop in visitors, attributed to Japan's low birth rate and economic collapse. A rusting Ferris wheel perfectly captures the eerie remains of the abandoned Japanese theme park, Kejonuma Leisure Land . Today, the deserted merry-go-round and other relics of a bygone era are tourist attractions in their own right. Urban explorer Florian Seidel, 38, visited the creepy location, which is reported to be jinxed by an ancient curse, to document the extent of the site's ongoing dereliction. Looking at his images, it's hard to believe that the park, which opened in 1979, once attracted 200,000 visitors annually from around the country. Kansai-based photographer, Seidel, said of his project: 'Exploring Kejonuma Leisure Land was an amazing experience, it turned out to be one of the most underrated abandoned places I have ever visited.' Florian Seidel, a Kensai-based photographer, visited the site in 2014 to capture the park's ongoing dereliction . Other abandoned amusement parks have been 'photographed to death,' says Seidel, who felt as though there was plenty to see . In its heyday, the theme park in Tohoku, Japan, attracted approximately 200,000 visitors per year from around the country . The resort, which included an amusement park, campsite and driving range officially closed its doors in 2000 due to a drop in visitors . While most photographers who visit the site focus on the looming Ferris wheel, Seidel quickly realised that there was far more to see. 'Everything there had the right amount of natural decay with no signs of vandalism' he explained. 'It looked like time just forgot about it, despite the fact that it is located right next to a public road. 'Other locations, especially abandoned amusement parks, have been photographed to death, but at Kejonuma Leisure Land, I had the feeling that I was still exploring the place, constantly finding new things to take pictures of.' Today, the broken down remains of the park are tourist attractions in their own right, with many of urban photographers keen to take snaps . Most photographers who visit, focus on the looming Ferris wheel, but Seidel quickly realised that there was far more to see . Seidel refers to Kejonuma Leisure Land as 'one of the most underrated abandoned places' that he has ever visited . Several pair of shoes have been left behind inside the park, as well as plates, notepads and boxes . According to The Japan Times, the theme park was built next to the site of the 'pond of the ghost woman', an ancient myth which is claimed could have been factor in its untimely closure. The subject of the folklore is said to be a beautiful damsel, who supposedly lived near a pond in the area well-known for its abundance of snakes. One day the woman gave birth to a baby in the form of a snake, which slithered away into the pond, where its cries could be heard every night. Despite the fact that the theme park is located next to a very public road, there has been very little vandalism on the property . According to Japanese folklore, the park was built next to the site of the 'pond of the ghost woman' and is said to be jinxed . Some even attribute the myth as a factor as to the park's untimely demise, though others believe the closure was due to economic issues . According to the story, a beautiful damsel is said to have given birth to a baby in the form of a snake, which slithered away into the pond .

Allegedly, she cursed the area upon her death - an intriguing story that only adds to the 'eerie mystique' of this fascinating site . Driven mad by her serpent baby's incessant moans, the young mum committed suicide by jumping in the pond, cursing the site upon her death. Seidel said: 'A lot of Japanese people, especially women, are quite superstitious, so if that urban legend would have had any impact, I don't think the park would have been in business for 21 years; it would have been bankrupt within months.

"Not every Greek island lets you rent a boat and potter about at will, but Skopelos does. It's the difference between a good holiday and an adventurously good holiday - with some embarrassment thrown in. On day one, after manoeuvring our rented boat into sheltered waters off Kastani beach, I cut the throttle and my girlfriend threw out the anchor. Splash! Splendidly small: Skopelos has a relaxed, offbeat vibe that plays out in the pretty port of Chora . As the breeze pushed us back, the short anchor line quickly ran out until the end - then we heard a softer, more ominous splash. We hadn't noticed that the end wasn't secured. The rope sank fast. Oh dear. But our shame was admirably handled by the boat owners, who promptly gave us a second anchor, and assured us they would retrieve the original. This generosity of spirit set the tone for our week on this hilly, pine-forested island. Skopelos is known as the film location for Mamma Mia! and I had feared there might be endless reminders of the day when Meryl Streep's Donna found love. I need not have worried. The island lies in the Sporades, east of the mainland. With no airport, most people fly to Skiathos, followed by an hour's ferry ride. Arriving in Skopelos is special. Seal of approval: Kyle encountered two locals of the bewhiskered variety while sailing around Slopelos . It has one of the most scenic ports in Greece. Wooded hillsides are punctuated with white walls topped by terracotta-tiled roofs. A ruined Venetian fortress and dozens of chapels make you feel that this is a spiritual retreat. Many of the chapels were built by families as status symbols and are owned and maintained by their descendants, rather than by the Greek Orthodox Church. We opted for a villa. Up a steep hill from Skopelos town, and along a dirt track (vehicle needed) lies Villa Thea, with its cool stone floors, pool and large terrace. In the evenings, the lights from town twinkle and moonlight shimmers on the water. Thalpos Holidays Boat Hire operates out of sheltered Panormos beach on the west coast, a 20-minute drive from Skopelos town. With guidance from Mr Thalpos himself, the coastline was ours to explore in a 30hp motorboat. One day, we headed north, anchoring at the pine-fringed Neraki beach, which we had to ourselves, as it is only accessible by boat. Picnic perfection. The adjacent islet of Dasia comprises little more than rocks jutting out of the blue sea, but our appetite for maritime adventures was well rewarded here. Watching the whiskered faces of two monk seals rolling lazily in the sea was unforgettable. These shy, endangered marine mammals - once widespread around the Mediterranean and beyond - are now limited to small ranges, one of which is close to Skopelos. Glossa is a smaller town in the north, and its white-washed houses are as authentic as you might wish, with few compromises to mass tourism. We spent an enjoyable evening here before reaching one of the stars of the island, Agnanti, a restaurant perched high on a hilltop. Owner Nikos offers visitors fine traditional seafood as well as slow-cooked pork, and the terrace has some of the most spectacular views on the island. We were tempted to exclaim: 'Mamma mia!' Instead, we wondered how quickly we could return to this gorgeous island. It won't be soon enough.

"A billionaire tycoon wants planning authorities to grant permission for his new £4 million beachfront mansion which can jack itself up in the case of flooding which heats itself using the outside air in temperatures as low as -25C. Jim Ratcliffe, founder and chairman of chemical company Ineos, has applied to planning officials in the New Forest to seek to demolish an existing beach hut and replace it with a 'carbon neutral' mansion. The 62-year-old businessman who is based in Switzerland claims that the new house, if built, will be his only UK residence. The proposed beach house in this computer generated image would only be visible from yachts on the Solent . The high-tech planned mansion will be virtually 'carbon-zero' and uses renewable energy such as solar power . Billionaire tycoon Jim Ratcliffe wants to build a futuristic beach house on a site he owns overlooking the Solent . The planning application claims the building will be 'climate-change proof due to its jacking system. The building has been designed by Charles Morris, who was the architect responsible for the Orchard Room at Prince Charles's Highgrove Estate. According the document: 'The development proposals incorporate domestic-scale micro renewable energy systems, including an array of photovoltaic cells, solar hot water and an air source heat pump. 'The solar thermal hot water system provides hot water powered directly from the sun; the photovoltaic cells will provide electrictiy to power immersion heaters to ensure that there is hot water in all weather conditions. 'The air source heat pump will draw latent heat from the air even when air temperature is as low as -25C to heat the house via underfloor heating. 'The dwelling would be so thermally efficient and would harness so much renewable energy that it will not need a boiler. 'The dwelling has been designed to be lifted by 73 piston jacks, with with a capacity to lift 25 tonnes; this will allow the development to respond to rising sea levels over the next 100 years, this is truly innovative and truly unique.' Mr Ratcliffe is seeking to demolish the existing house on the site and replace it with the new mansion . The house has a revolutionary jacking system which can lift the property up in the case of flooding . The £4million luxury mansion will have stunning views of the Isle of Wight and is at the edge of the New Forest . Mr Ratcliffe bought the site in 2005 and has had several previous planning applications rejected. According to the plans, the house would only be visible from yachts on the Solent. His neighbours include Dire Straits lead singer Mark Knopfler and the band's bass guitarist John Illsley who live either side of the planned development. Graham Baker of the New Forest Association told the Times: 'Mr Ratcliffe bough a beach house, a small cheaply built occasional dwelling. He wants to erect a mansion in its place.' Mr Baker claimed the planned jacking system is not sufficiently unique to allow planners to grant the house permission. However, neighbour Frank Woodward, 89, who lives 100 metres away from the beach house said: 'This area was flooded a few years ago so I think it's a good idea. There used to be a much bigger house on that site. 'Mr Ratcliffe has got the money. He has to have a big house. People who are objecting have only been living here for five minutes.'","Jim Ratcliffe is the founder and chairman of chemical giant Ineos .

"Many Britons have given up on their dream of owning a home amid high house prices and poor pay rises, research has found . Many Britons have given up on their dream of owning a home amid high house prices and poor pay rises, a study shows. It found that just four in 10 renters (43 per cent) aged 20 to 45 are saving for a deposit to buy a home, compared to almost half a year ago (49 per cent). According to research from Halifax, three-quarters of UK renters also fear they will never be able to afford to buy their own house. This rises to eight in 10 for Londoners, where house prices have risen by double-digits in recent years. The mortgage lender’s report, called Generation Rent, said the data ‘strengthens the view’ that more people may be giving up on the idea of owning their own home and are instead accepting the idea of long-term renting. They said if people believe buying a house is completely unobtainable, ‘a lower level of homeownership will become the new normal’ and ‘the presumption that the UK is obsessed with homeownership may soon become a myth’. The survey found the three most common barriers to home ownership were the size of the deposit needed, high property prices and low incomes. Non-homeowners said they would be willing to save for about five years and four months to save for a deposit. But even then, owning a home remains out of reach for many. Government schemes such as Help to Buy have enabled people to get on or move up the property ladder with a low deposit. Scroll down for video . But while half of people believed this had a positive impact, 8 per cent believe this had a negative impact, amid fears it has fuelled demand, pushing up prices. Three-quarters of those surveyed also thought banks were reluctant to lend to first-time buyers. Figures recently released by the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed the number of first-time buyers getting on the property ladder last year reached its highest levels since 2007. More than 300,000 people bought their first home in 2014. Just four in 10 renters aged 20 to 45 are saving for a deposit to buy a home, according to research by Halifax . But Craig McKinlay, mortgages director at Halifax, said: ‘While there has been an increase in first-time buyers in the last 12 months, at the same time there is also a growing group of young people who believe they won’t be able to get a mortgage. ‘The difference between the reality and their perception needs to be addressed urgently if we are to prevent people from giving up on getting on the housing ladder.’ The survey questioned 40,000 people aged 20 to 45.","Just four in 10 renters aged 20 to 45 are saving for a deposit to buy a home .

"A women's rights group has slammed a popular eatery  for their latest advertising campaign which they claim objectifies women's bodies to sell beer. The Lowenbrau Keller, in Sydney's The Rocks, has released a social media and bus campaign featuring the slogan 'Wunderbra' underneath a photograph of a woman in a low-cut lederhosen holding a tray of beer steins. The same campaign also features an image of two women in a similar state of dress with the caption 'Make Mein A Dubbel', sparking outrage from Collective Shout, who claim the advertisements reinforces sexual objectification. Scroll down for video . Campaign group Collective Shout has slammed Sydney restaurant Lowenbrau Keller for an advertising campaign they claim sexually objectifies women . The Lowenbrau Keller campaign is being used on both social media and public transport platforms . 'Through this advertising Lowenbrau reinforces sexist attitudes and invites patrons to view female staff as sexual objects, exposing them to sexual harassment,' Melinda Liszewski, spokesperson for grassroots campaign movement Collective Shout, told Daily Mail Australia. '[The company's slogan] “Live it Large” and “Wunderbra” sends the message to an audience of all ages that women are to be valued for their body parts,' Ms Liszewski said. Ms Liszewski said that the 'Make Mein A Dubbel' advertisement also suggests that the two women shown are 'part of the menu'. Dan Hopkirk, Marketing Director for Urban Purveyor Groups who owns the Lowenbrau Keller, said that the advertisements were meant as 'fun play-on words' that people would be familiar with. '[The campaign was] designed as a portrayal of the typical Bavarian cultural experience enjoyed by millions during Oktoberfest in Munich every year, synonymous with this venue,' Mr Hopkirk said. 'The advertising slogans coupled with the imagery that has been used across the campaign, are popular anglicised German phrases which are fun play-on words,' he said. 'The Löwenbräu Keller campaign aims to embody the traditions of Oktoberfest which is about a celebratory occasion and enjoyable time spent with friends.' Ms Liszewski said that the Lowenbrau Keller, along with other establishments which the Urban Purveyor Group owns, including the Bavarian Bier Cafe, has a history of creating sexist and objectifying advertisements. 'A number of Lowenbrau advertisements make a direct comparison between the serving size of food and beverages and the size of women’s breasts,' she said. Ms Liszewski said that the advertisement also suggests that the two women shown are 'part of the menu' This images was tweeted from the restaurant's official Twitter account and posted to their Facebook page with the caption 'Is anybody suddenly thirsty?' The advertisements have garnered criticism from social media users who expressed their outrage over the allegedly objectifying images . 'This is explicitly spelt out via an ad on social media “Bigger is better - don’t you agree? We’ve got big biers, big meals and big…fun. #beer” and reinforced by outdoor advertisements.' The image, which shows a woman's chest next to steins of beer, was tweeted from the restaurant's official Twitter account, and was also posted to their Facebook page with the caption 'Is anyone else suddenly thirsty for a bier?'. The advertisements have garnered criticism from social media users who expressed their outrage over the allegedly objectifying images. 'Wie Sexistisch. If that is the attitude you wish have about your restaurant, then I wont be visiting it again! Guten Tag!' posted one social media user after the image was posted onto the Lowenbrau Keller Facebook page. One Twitter user uploaded a photo of the current 'Wunderbra' advertisement after spotting it on the back of a bus. 'I'm glad these advertisers drew the line before they went tasteless,' the social media user joked. According the Advertising Standards Board code, advertisers are prohibited from presenting men or women in a way that is sexually 'exploitative and degrading'. However, in 2007 the Lowenbrau Keller was reported to the Board for a previous campaign which showed a man dressed in traditional Bavarian clothing staring down the front of a woman in a low-cut lederhosen who is holding two steins of beer. The Board dismissed the complaint due to the 'ambiguity' of the claim that the man was shown to be staring at the woman's breasts, but ruled that the advertisement emphasised the woman's breasts and 'this did objectify the woman'. 'I'm glad these advertisers drew the line before they went tasteless,' a social media user joked when he posted this image to Twitter after spotting the ad on the back of a bus . 'Viewing these advertisements it is hard to believe it is 2015,' said Ms Liszewski . The Lowenbrau Keller responded to the claims and said that 'the last impression we want to give is that you can come to our restaurant and stare at our waitresses' breasts, and we have very strict house rules for anyone in our restaurant exhibitingoffensive behaviour.' However, Ms Liszewski said that the active social media media presence the restaurant had allowed fans of the establishment to express sexually harassing comments. 'Comments posted by fans on social media demonstrate this - “Big t*ts” …. “very nice jugs” … “this is what you will see on Saturday night big ass “beers” can’t wait"",' she said. In 2013, the Urban Purveyor Group released an ad for Oktoberfest, which is held in both the Lowenbrau Keller and the Bavarian Bier Cafe each year. The clip depicts 'Bavarian beauties training for Oktoberfest', clad in short shorts and crop tops as they run along the beach and the camera pans up and down the women's bodies. 'Viewing these advertisements it is hard to believe it is 2015. There is a growing awareness in the community that sexual objectification and sexist attitudes underpin the epidemic of violence against women in Australia,' Ms Liszewski said. Ms Liszewski said that the active social media media presence the restaurant had allowed fans of the establishment to express sexually harassing comments . The Advertising Standards Board advised that the Bavarian Bier Cafe removed the above ad after it was slammed for sexually objectifying women and comparing them to pieces of meat . 'The Urban Purveyor Group and associated restaurants need to get out of the dark ages and start treating women and girls with the respect they deserve.' Last year, the Bavarian Bier Cafe was forced to remove their campaign advertising their new range of ribs, after the ads were attacked for objectifying women. The Advertising Standards Board advised that the Cafe removed the ads, which depicted a fully clothed man with two women in low cut dresses on either side, in front of a rack of ribs with the slogan 'We've got the best racks'. The cafe claimed that for every serving of the ribs sold, the company would donate $1 to Treasure Chest Charity, a group which raises money for breast reconstruction for women who have suffered through breast cancer. 'Women are literally being referred to as a piece of meat,' Ms Liszewski said. 'The ad is inviting us to judge women by the quality of their breasts. It's bad enough that there is an opinion in the general community that this is what women are worth, but to link it to a breast cancer charity is just another layer of objectification.'","Sydney cafe Lowenbrau Keller has released an advertising campaign which features the slogans 'Wunderbra', 'Make Mein a Dubbel' and 'Haus Party'

Ryan Giroux is accused of shooting three people in a Phoenix motel, killing a man and injuring two women during the incident in March 18 in the suburb of Mesa, and will now stand trial. Another man was shot while working at a nearby restaurant, and then two more at separate apartment complexes, about two miles away. Police swarmed the city in a massive response, with Mesa police using sniffer dogs and searching cars to find the gunman, placing several buildings, a school and college in ‘lockdown’. The search ended with Giroux’s arrest in an empty apartment. The 41-year-old has now pleaded not guilty to one count of first-degree murder and 22 other charges at a hearing at the Maricopa County Superior Court on Monday. He has convictions in three states totally more than eight years for burglary, theft, armed aggravated assault and a marijuana violation, according to a previous statement from the Arizona Department of Corrections.

"A courtroom was thrown into chaos after a judge found a Chicago  detective not guilty of involuntary manslaughter after he shot an unarmed woman in the back of the head. Cook County Judge Dennis Porter, cleared 46-year-old Officer Dante Servin in the March 2012 shooting death of Rekia Boyd, 22. Moments before he announced the verdict on Monday, he asked loved ones who might be prone to outbursts to leave the courtroom, fearing there would be an emotionally-charged response . The victim's brother Martinez Sutton then screamed: 'You want me to be quiet? This m***** f***** killed my sister!' Not guilty: Cook County Judge Dennis Porter, cleared 46-year-old Officer Dante Servin (left) who shot Rekia Boyd, 22, (right) dead in Chicago in March 2012 . She was gunned down on March 21 as she stood with friends outside a property in Chicago's Lawndale neighbourhood. According to James Montgomery the family's lawyer, Servin pulled up to the group in an unmarked vehicle and told them to 'shut up'. Boyd was standing with her friend Antonio Cross, who reached into his waistband, pretending he had a gun, and charged at Servin, the court heard. She died after one of the five bullets from Servin's unregistered Glock handgun pierced the left side of her head. Servin has maintained he fired only because he felt threatened when he confronted a group at a park about the noise they were making. According to The Chicago Sun Times, Porter said in his ruling: 'Illinois courts have consistently held that when the defendant intends to fire a gun, points it in the general direction of his or her intended victim, and shoots, such conduct is not merely reckless and does not warrant an involuntary-manslaughter instruction, regardless of the defendant's assertion that he or she did not intend to kill anyone. He added: 'The absence of any evidence of reckless conduct renders it unnecessary for this court to consider whether the defendant was justified in his actions.' Porter also cleared Servin, who was off-duty, of reckless discharge of a firearm and reckless conduct. The cop told reporters when he left the courtroom that justice had been served. He said: 'I always maintained it was an accident what occurred to Miss Boyd. 'Miss Boyd and her family, they have my deepest sympathies. Chaos: The judge told loved ones to leave the court before the not gulity verdict was read out - fearing a spate of outbursts. Outside the court Servin (pictured) told reporters at the end of the hearing he has always believed the shooting was an accident . Disgusted: Boyd's supporters (pictured outside court) maintain that she was murdered and insisted the case is 'not over' 'Any reasonable person, any police officer especially would have reacted in the exact same manner that I reacted, and I’m glad to be alive. I saved my life that night. I’m glad that I’m not a police death statistic.' Outside the courtroom Boyd's supporters accused the judge of not having a heart, with one person adding: 'It ain’t over. We all know it’s murder.' In a statement to the Sun-Times, Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez said he was 'extremely disappointed with the verdict. 'I believe that my office had provided sufficient evidence before the court to not only demonstrate, but also to prove, that Officer Servin’s conduct was clearly reckless in the senseless fatal shooting of Rekia Boyd,' he said. ' 'Justice was denied today for Rekia Boyd and her family, and I extend my deepest sympathies as they struggle to come to terms with this unexpected decision.” The city settled a lawsuit for $4.5 million with Boyd's family in 2013.

"Teresa Sheldon has appeared in court charged with murdering son Tommy (pictured) and the attempted murder of another child who was also in the car . The mother of a five-year-old boy who died from fatal burns caused in a horrific car fire has been charged with his murder and the attempted murder of another child who managed to escape the flames. Teresa Sheldon, 38, from Dartford, Kent, has appeared in court charged with murdering her son Tommy and the attempted murder of another child who was also in the blazing Ford Fiesta. Tommy died two weeks after suffering horrendous burns in the fireball on a country lane in Hursley, near Winchester in Hampshire. Two passers-by  spotted the blazing hatchback and rushed to help when they spotted the little boy still inside the car. The pair bravely battled against the intensity of the flames and managed to open one of the doors of the car to reach Tommy. The schoolboy was treated at the scene before being taken to Southampton General Hospital and on to a specialist burns unit in Bristol. His mother was also taken to hospital for treatment after suffering serious injuries in the fire on August 11 last year. Despite the best efforts of medics Tommy, from Southampton, died from his injuries on August 25. Another child who was in the silver-coloured car managed to escape and survived. An inquest was opened in September by Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame Short but was adjourned while detectives from Hampshire police’s major crime team launched a murder inquiry. Sheldon has been charged with her son's murder along with manslaughter by diminished responsibility. She also faces a charge of the attempted murder of the other child, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Judge Keith Cutler remanded Sheldon, who gave her address as Dartford, Kent, in custody at the hearing at Winchester Crown Court. She is due back before the crown court in June.

"A two-year-old girl who died from a brain tumour has been frozen - in the hope she will one day be revived by advances in science. Matheryn Naovaratpong, from Thailand, is thought to be the youngest person ever cryogenically preserved. The toddler was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer last April after she failed to wake up one morning, Motherboard's Brian Merchant reports . After being admitted to a Bangkok hospital, tests revealed she had a 11cm tumour in the left side of her brain. Scroll down for video . Matheryn Naovaratpong, from Thailand, is thought to be the youngest person ever cryogenically preserved . Doctors diagnosed her with ependymoblastoma, a rare form of brain cancer that afflicts the very young. The outlook was bleak from the start - the disease has a five-year survival rate of 30 per cent. To make matters worse, Matheryn - known to her family as Einz - had fallen into a coma. After a months of intensive treatment, including 12 rounds of brain surgery, 20 chemotherapy treatments, and 20 radiation therapy sessions, it became clear there was little more doctors could do. She died on January 8th this year after her parents switched off her life support machine. By the time she passed away, she had lost 80 per cent of the left side of her brain - essentially paralysing the right side of her body. But determined for some good to come from her death, her family have had her body cryogenically preserved - by one of the biggest  providers of this service in the world. Matheryn is currently at the Arizona-based Alcor, her brain and body frozen separately at 196C. Her family's main - although many would argue, far fetched - hope is that one day, science will have progressed enough to restore life to her. Alternatively, her parents want the cells from her brain and other parts of her body to be saved, so the disease that killed her can be studied in the future. Aside from the huge number of 'what ifs', there is the cost. 'Membership' to Alcor costs $770 a year - plus a rather more hefty $80,000 for a 'neuro' (the procedure Matheryn had) or £200,000 to have a full body frozen. Alcor is also where the bodies of famous baseball player Ted Williams, as well as his son John Henry Williams, are stored. 'It [the freezing] provides the opportunity for Matheryn to breathe again when the technology is provided and appropriate for her disease,'  said her father, who found out about the cryopreservation firm on the internet. The procedure involves moving the patient onto an ice bed, coating them in freezing materials and artificially restarting the heart with a “heart-lung-resuscitator"". Over a dozen different medications are administered before blood is drained from the body and replaced with medical-grade antifreeze,. The chest cavity is then opened to attach the major blood vessels to a machine that flushes out all remaining blood, then slowly lowering the body’s temperature, at a rate of 1˚ Celsius every hour. After two weeks, the body reaches deep cryofreeze at -196˚ C. But as a family of doctors, they are hopeful, rather than unrealistically optimistic. And as Matheryn's doctor pointed out: 'Her life was made possible by modern science in the first place - she was carried by a surrogate because her mother had lost her uterus birthing a son.' The family also feels there are 'still considerable frontiers left to be examined when it comes to medicine and human physiology. 'They didn't want their daughter's life to end in vain,' Aaron Drake, Alcor's medical response director told Motherboard. 'They're hoping that by preserving the tissue cells of this particular cancer, they can come up with a better treatment plan, and maybe even eventually cure it. If you look at the global picture of what they're trying to accomplish, it's very altruistic.' But the process of cryogenically freezing the toddler wasn't just an emotional rollercoaster, but a logistical one, too. In an ideal world, she would have been flown to Arizona. But Matheryn's health was so poor and when she ended up on a ventilator, air travel became impossible. Instead, a doctor from Alcor flew to Thailand and, as soon as she was pronounced dead - at 6.18pm on that January evening - preservation of her body began. Matheryn is currently at the Arizona-based Alcor, her brain and body frozen separately.Her family's main - although many would argue, far fetched - hope is that one day, science will have progressed enough to restore life to her . Usually, the brain would be removed from the body and then frozen. But customs and repatriation issues to the US meant it was easier, according to Mr Drake, to undertake cryoprotective perfusion of Matheryn’s brain in Thailand. 'The team decided to do so without separating her brain from the rest of the body,' he said. The procedure 'involves moving the patient onto an ice bed, coating her in freezing materials and artificially restarting the heart with a “heart-lung-resuscitator"". Over a dozen different medications are administered before blood is drained from the body and replaced with medical-grade antifreeze,. Alcor's mission, according to the company website, is as follows... 'The preservation of individual lives, to be sought through the following prioritized list of fundamentals: . Maintain the current patients in biostasis. Place current and future members into biostasis (when and if needed). Eventually restore to health and reintegrate into society all patients in Alcor's care. Fund research into developing more cost effective and reliable means for 1-3 above. Provide public education as a means of fostering growth to support the goals of 1, 2, 3, 4 above.' So far, the company has performed over 130 cryopreservations. The chest cavity is then opened to attach the major blood vessels to a machine that flushes out all remaining blood, then slowly lowering the body’s temperature, at a rate of 1˚ Celsius every hour. After two weeks, the body reaches deep cryofreeze at -196˚ C. Matheryn underwent a procedure called a 'neuro'. This is where the the brain is removed and stored, rather than the whole body. It is now sitting in a stainless steel, vacuum-insulated container in Arizona filled with liquid nitrogen at -196˚C. But the question still remains as to how - if science did eventually progress enough - any frozen body would actually be revived. 'We know we can regenerate a small organ, and grow a new heart,' said Mr Drake. 'We know we can 3-dimensionally print cells and hearts. So at some point we would need to regenerate her entire body, or at least her organs, and put it all together. 'Then we’d need to transplant that brain into a new body.' However a growing number of people are showing interest in the pioneering technology. 'Our market is growing,' Mr Drake told Motherboard's Brian Merchant. 'The younger generation is more accustomed to seeing changes in technology. Any thing you can come up with, six months later, there’s an app for it. 'The younger generation sees this and thinks ‘sure why not’? - they can figure everything else out, so why not this? They feel this is kind of an inevitable thing.' And for Matheryn's family, it provides peace of mind and gives them some solace from the tragedy of her death. 'At least, we devoted her life and body for the progress and development of science,' said her mother, Nareerat. 'This is also another treat for our family, we know that she's alive although we have been separated.'","Two-year-old Matheryn Naovaratpong, from Thailand, died in January .

"An upcoming documentary describes Yelp as the internet's equivalent to the mafia, and the publicly-traded company is doing everything in its power to discredit the film before it is released. Yelp, founded in 2004 by two former PayPal employees, is a website that lets users write their own reviews of businesses like restaurants and doctor's offices. However, like many web businesses, Yelp's revenue comes mainly from advertising and the businesses that buy ads are often also rated and reviewed on the site. Kaylie Milliken is the filmmaker behind Billion Dollar Bully, an ongoing documentary focused on Yelp's impact on small businesses. While she hasn't finished the documentary yet, Milliken tells Daily Mail Online her research so far has indicated Yelp's advertising structure appears to punish businesses that choose not to advertise on the site - a claim that company has vigorously denied. Scroll down for video . A racket? A documentary filmmaker is currently working on a film about Yelp, which she says will unveil shady advertising practices at the company. Above, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman in August 2014 . Pay to play: Billion Dollar Bully is still in production, but filmmaker Kaylie Milliken says she's already interviewed several small businesses who believe they've been targeted by the company for refusing to advertise . 'Businesses feel extorted,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. 'After they decline advertising services from Yelp they feel like their good reviews get filtered out and their negative reviews come to the front.' And at hundreds of dollars a month for advertising, the price to work with Yelp is too big for many mom and pop businesses, Milliken says. Milliken first started investigating the company a year ago, when she went to see her doctor, who started talking about her negative experiences being listed on Yelp. 'The more she talked about it, the more my jaw just kind of dropped. I knew that they had aggressive salespeople - my husband is a small -business owner and he’s complained before about how pushy they can be. But then she started telling me about receiving reviews, really negative reviews by clients, and she couldn’t figure out who these clients were. 'She was really upset over it. And then she received a review where the client listed ailments about themsel[f] that she had never seen before, and this was the day after she had gotten off the phone with someone from Yelp,' Milliken told International Business Times. Tense: Last month, filmmaker Milliken (right) appeared on CNBC to speak about the movie. Yelp spokeswoman Shannon Eis (left) also appeared on the show to defend the company . Last month, Milliken released a trailer for her documentary in an attempt to fund the rest of the film's production. The day after the trailer was released, Yelp stock dipped four per cent. Following the stock drop, Yelp issued a statement to Business Insider, fiercely denying the claims in the trailer. 'There is no merit to the claims they appear to highlight, which have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law, investigated by government regulators, including the FTC, and disproven by academic study,' the company said. On the contrary, Yelp says its algorithm protects businesses, by weeding out potentially fraudulent posts seeking to boost a company's rating or drag it down. As a result, only about 75 per cent of posts are approved for posting on the site while the rest remain in a partially-hidden 'filtered reviews' section on each businesses' page. 'Because businesses have attempted to manipulate their ratings and those of their competitors by trying to post fake reviews, we have to protect consumers and honest businesses by preventing this behavior. As a result, Yelp has automated recommendation software in place to go through the more than 71 million reviews that have been submitted to Yelp to select the most useful and reliable content,' the company said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Yelp's company spokesman Shannon Eis went on CNBC to speak out against the documentary in a segment with Milliken, to further illustrate how the company's business practices have been backed by both the courts and independent investigations. However, the Harvard Business School study that the Eis cited in Yelp's defense wasn't solely focused on whether advertising impacts the ratings of businesses listed on the site - rather the investigation was designed to find out how many of the reviews on the site were fake. While the study's authors did find that businesses that advertise on the site are no more likely to have extreme 1 or 5-star ratings than any other business, they made it clear that Yelp's advertising practices were not the topic of their study and therefore their research was not exhaustive. 'While our analysis provides some suggestive evidence against the theory that Yelp favors advertisers, we stress that it is neither exhaustive, nor conclusive. It is beyond the scope of this paper, and outside the capacity of our dataset to evaluate all the ways in which Yelp could favor advertisers,' the paper reads. Standing up: Milliken says that most of the business owners she spoke to were too afraid to appear on camera, for fear of retaliation fro Yelp. Pictured on the left interviewing a business owner, in a photo posted to her production company's website . Work to be done: The Kickstarter campaign to fund Milliken's project reached its $60,000 goal. She plans to resume filming in May and have a rough cut by fall . Milliken says she doesn't place much faith in these cases or investigations, after interviewing several small business owners in the course of her research. 'One company began to advertise with Yelp, but then stopped when their contract came up. The next month they went from five stars to four stars, and then three stars. That story is so common. It happens over and over again and a lot of businesses feel so frustrated at this point,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. Milliken says that these business owners were so afraid of Yelp that about 80 per cent of them refused to go on camera for fear of retaliation on their own Yelp pages - which they are not allowed to opt out of. In their CNBC talk, Eis also accused Milliken of having a conflict of interest, since she had created several Yelp accounts to write fake reviews of businesses - including her husband's law practice. Milliken admitted to setting up the accounts, but said they were part of her research for the project. 'I think it's shocking and very telling that this billion dollar corporation has come after this grassroots production company - where there are only two of us - creating a documentary that were still in production over...and Yelp has fired back with all that...I think it does clearly show that they are concerned about what will be coming out in the documentary,' Milliken said on CNBC. Daily Mail Online reached out to Yelp for evidence of the allegedly fake reviews Milliken wrote, and the company sent screen grabs that show several accounts tied to the filmmaker and the fact that she commented on her husband's business page. While the 5-star reviews appear to be dated in 2011 (before Milliken says she started working on the documentary), Yelp did not provide copies of the actual reviews. Milliken says she reached out to Yelp for a sit-down interview, but that CEO Jeremy Stoppelman declined. In a statement, the company spokesman explained why they decided to pass on speaking to Milliken. 'Given that the title of the documentary already declares Yelp a bully before production and with a clear disregard for highly credible conclusions, we can be quite certain that our CEO's participation and any objective facts will not be fairly heard. We don't believe Mrs. Milliken is interested in the truth, considering she's shown such a disregard for it so far,' the statement reads. Prost Production's Kickstarter campaign reached its $60,000 funding goal, and Milliken says she will resume filming in May with plans to finish the project in fall so that she can submit it to the Sundance Film Festival.","Billion Dollar Bully, an upcoming documentary, focuses on the review site's impact on small businesses .

"A sheriff's department in Florida has released a video showing spring break revelers milling about on a beach not 10 feet from where an unconscious 19-year-old girl was being gang raped by a group of men. The brief cellphone clip came to light as deputies continued searching for two additional suspects in the March attack in Panama City Beach that was witnessed by hundreds of people who failed to intervene. So far, authorities have arrested a pair of students from Alabama's Troy University who were allegedly seen in a cellphone video recorded last month sexually assaulting a 19-year-old girl in Panama city Beach. Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen described the graphic video as the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' he had ever seen likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. He said the sickening footage shows at least three men surrounding an incapacitated woman on a beach chair. Scroll down for video . Hunt continues: Officials in Florida are searching for two men suspected of taking part in a gang rape of a 19-year-old unconscious girl at the Spinnaker Beach Club in Panama City, Florida last month . Caught on camera: This is a screen shot from a video clip released by the Bay County Sheriff’s Office showing the moment a man allegedly sexually assaulted a woman on a crowded beach. The image has been obscured by the sheriff's department . Impassive: The recording depicts a seemingly normal day at the beach for dozens of bikini-clad spring milling around and chatting about Instagram as a 19-year-old woman was allegedly being raped just steps away . Delonte Martistee, 22, of Bainbridge, Georgia, and Ryan Calhoun, 23, of Mobile, Alabama, were charged with sexual battery for the incident believed to have occurred between March 10 and 12. Sheriff McKeithen said the video of the attack showed hundreds of spring break revelers impassively looking on as the unconscious teenage girl was being raped by a group of men, CBS News reported. ‘People standing, almost rubbing the incapacitated girl,’ the sheriff said. ‘Standing there, more concerned about spilling their beer than they did someone being raped. McKeithen revealed that so far, his deputies have recovered more than four recordings of the sexual assault, and he believes that are more videos out there. The sheriff’s office released a short clip showing the crowd they said was present at the time. The recording depicts a seemingly normal day at the beach for dozens of bikini-clad spring breakers goofing off and standing around talking about Instagram. At one point, a few people cheer, but it’s unclear why. Caught: Last week, Delonte Martistee, 22 (left), and Ryan Calhoun, 23 (right), were arrested for sexual assault and officially suspended from Troy University . It is unclear from the video released what bystanders could actually see. But Sheriff’s spokeswoman Ruth Corley said the video was released ‘to show the crowd that was surrounding the incident and to show people, not only was it a horrible event, but it was witnessed by so many people who did absolutely nothing to stop or call police.’ The alleged victim told deputies she thought she had been drugged before the incident and that she was afraid to report it because she could not remember many details, Panama City News Herald reported. 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' the Bay County sheriff said. Officials did not release any more information about the two other men wanted in connection with the gang rape, but they said additional arrests are expected. Friday's charges against college track star Martistee and his classmate Calhoun stem from a video footage that was found on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. The video allegedly shows hundreds of people gathered around the girl as the men violate her while she lays on a beach chair. The unidentified victim believes she was drugged before the incident. Above, the beach behind Spinnaker is seen on April 12, 2015 . Martistee of Bainbridge, Georgia is a promising track star at Troy University according to officials, but he has since been removed from the team . Calhoun, of Mobile, Alabama pictured above in a picture from Facebook. Officials say they more arrests are expected . Above, a view of the Spinnaker Beach Club during a spring break party . In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. 'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media. In one video, police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her. And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach... If you condone this behavior, you should be in jail, as far as I'm concerned.' Following their arrest, Martistee and Calhoun were suspended from Troy University. The 22-year-old student-athlete, who remained in jail Sunday, was also removed from the track and field team.","Troy University students Delonte' Martistee, 22, and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, have been suspended from the Alabama school .

Countless teens, both boys and girls, have been sharing the disturbing results of their experiments on Twitter and Instagram . Surprisingly, given the sheer number of teens attempting the feat, it appears the results are far from desirable . The method - one this journalist won't be road-testing - works by way of the airlock created in the opening of the glass or jar, which increases blood flow to the lips and causes them to swell. Problematically, the results are said to last for hours, even days, with several people complaining that they were stuck with the after-effects for a lot longer than expected. Plenty of Twitter users have been quick to ridicule the craze. 'Stop with that Kylie Jenner challenge it's so gross,' one wrote. 'I hate our generation. It's so dumb. Like you guys are really sticking your lips in small cups,' another ranted. 'Do people not realise they're bursting blood vessels?' another pointed out.

"Patties Foods says its testing has found no link between its Nanna's brand frozen mixed berries and a national hepatitis A outbreak. The health department continues to investigate how 34 people in six states contracted the hepatitis A virus, all of whom consumed the same brand of frozen mixed berries. Patties Foods said no hepatitis A virus or E.coli were detected in any sample of its recalled and non-recalled Nanna's Mixed Berries 1kg product during its own testing. Managing director and CEO Steven Chaur said the company's microbiological and viral testing does not confirm any link between Nanna's Mixed Berries and the virus and shows no systemic failure of its quality assurance programs. Scroll down for video . Four adults, three in Victoria and one in NSW, have contracted potentially deadly Hepatitis A after condsuming the 1kg packets of Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries . The product contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile . But he said Patties Foods remains guided by the health department's epidemiology, with the 1kg product remaining off supermarket shelves until further notice while the company evaluates alternative supply sources. 'If our Nanna's product was the source, the lack of laboratory findings from the testing conducted by Patties Foods for the presence of E.coli, Coliforms or HAV indicates there has been no systemic failure,' he said in a statement on Wednesday. 'Regardless, Patties Foods has significantly increased protection measures to ensure that any risk is further minimised in future.' No evidence of HAV or E.coli was found in re-tests of all batches of frozen berries that were not subject to the recall. Hepatitis A (pictured) is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. The company said one of two opened sample packs from consumers who contracted hepatitis A did test positive for HAV in health department testing but it may have been open to contamination. A trace amount of HAV was detected in one of eight random sample packs from supermarkets but the department noted that only demonstrated the virus was present, not whether it was alive and could cause infection, the company statement said. A health department spokeswoman said its investigation is ongoing with the source of the hepatitis A virus still unconfirmed and the same brand of frozen mixed berries the only common exposure for all cases. Patties Foods is again supplying its non-recalled Nanna's and Creative Gourmet berries varieties onto supermarket shelves but only after each batch tested negative for HAV and E.coli, Mr Chaur said. He said Patties Foods was keen for a locally sourced berry range but it could take some time to develop the required infrastructure and crop volumes.

"TV celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz has defended himself after ten top doctors sent a letter to Columbia University urging the school to remove him from his faculty position because he is a 'charlatan' who promotes 'quack treatments'. Dr Oz, 54, is the vice chairman and professor of surgery at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons. The Harvard-educated doctor joined the faculty at Columbia in 1993. The doctors sent the letter to Lee Goldman, the dean of Columbia's Faculties of Health Sciences and Medicine. Scroll down for video . Ten top doctors sent a letter to Columbia University urging the school to remove TV celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz from his faculty position because he is a 'charlatan' who promotes 'quack treatments' ‘I bring the public information that will help them on their path to be their best selves,’ Oz said in a statement released through a representative of The Dr. Oz Show, according to USA Today. Columbia's Medical and Health Sciences Center . He continued: ‘We provide multiple points of view, including mine, which is offered without conflict of interest. That doesn't sit well with certain agendas which distort the facts.’ Dr Henry Miller of California's Stanford University led the effort and he was the first person to sign the letter, the New York Daily News reported. Miller said: 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. 'I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country. 'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.' He told CBS News that ‘a person who endangers patients and is a menace to public health should not be on the faculty of a prestigious medical institution’. The nine other doctors from across the country included Dr Joel Tepper, a cancer researcher from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and Dr Gilbert Ross of the American Council on Science and Health in New York City. The physicians accused Dr Oz of pushing 'miracle' weight-loss supplements with no scientific proof that they work. The doctors wrote that Oz, for years a world-class Columbia cardiothoracic surgeon, has 'misled and endangered' the public. From left to right, Dr Phil McGraw, financial advisor Suze Orman, host Oprah Winfrey, Dr Mehmet Oz and interior designer Nate Berkus participate in The Oprah Winfrey Show live from Radio City Music Hall in 2010 . The letter read: 'He has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain. 'Thus, Dr Oz is guilty of either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both. The New York Ivy League school responded Thursday, issuing a statement to The Associated Press saying only that the school 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.' Dr Oz first came to public attention as a frequent television guest of Oprah Winfrey. For the past five years, he's been the host of The Dr Oz Show. Last year, he appeared before a US Senate panel that accused him of endorsing products that were medically unsound. At the time, the doctor acknowledged some of the products he advised his viewers to use 'don't have the scientific muster to present as fact.' A show representative did not immediately return a call Thursday from the AP seeking comment. As vice chairman of Columbia's surgery department, Dr Oz still occasionally teaches, said Douglas Levy, spokesman for the Columbia University Medical Center. The controversy did not die down after his testimony. The company behind the""miracle"" diet supplement in question later agreed to pay a $3.5 million settlement over false advertising. A study that purported to prove the product's weight-loss benefits turned out to be based on fraudulent data and was retracted.","Dr Mehmet Oz is vice chairman at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons and is a professor of surgery .

"The Islamic State group claimed credit on Saturday a bombing near the US consulate in Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region a day earlier that killed two Turks. 'Security detachments were able to... detonate a car bomb left at the American consulate building in the city that led to the killing and wounding of many of them,' ISIS said in a daily audio message posted online. But the US State Department said the bombing in Ainkawa, near Kurdish regional capital Arbil, did not kill or wound any consular employees. People gather at the site of a blast in Arbil's Ankawa neighborhood, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq, on April 17, 2015 . Kurdish security forces respond to the large explosion, which can be seen in the distance . Saman Barzanchi, the head of the Arbil health department, said Saturday that two ethnically Kurdish Turks were killed and eight people wounded. Officials had said Friday three people were killed. An ISIS-spearheaded offensive overran large areas of Iraq last year, and forces from the Kurdistan region have battled the jihadists on multiple fronts in the north. The relatively stable region has largely been spared the bombings and shootings that have plagued other parts of Iraq on an almost daily basis. The last major attack was a suicide car bombing near the governor's compound in Arbil in November. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for two car bombings in Baghdad that killed at least 27 people on Friday. 'The fighters of the Islamic State detonated two car bombs in the heart of the Iraqi capital this evening and a third in Erbil,' the group said via its news agency.

"The mother of a high school student who has been prevented from attending classes as a consequence for not wearing the right style shoes has expressed her outrage over the 'ridiculous' situation. Riley Filmer, 14, turned up for classes wearing new shoes on the first day of term at McClelland College, in Melbourne's south-east, only to be told that the black soft-leather lace-ups did not meet uniform standards. The Year Eight student was prevented from attending her classes for the day, and has not been allowed back into the classroom since the incident, which her mother Anne Parker claims has disadvantaged and excluded her daughter. Riley Filmer, 14, has been prevented from attending classes at her Melbourne high school because her shoes do not meet the strict uniform guidelines . The secondary school's policy outlined in the 2015 Personal Learning Journal states that girls are to wear 'black leather lace-up school shoes (not fashion heels)' for both summer and winter uniforms, a guideline which Ms Parker said Riley's shoes meet. Ms Parker said that after going through five pairs of shoes in four school terms, she decided that her daughter needed a more practical and comfortable shoe to meet her needs. 'Rain, hail, or shine Riley has to walk to catch the bus, and then switch to another bus to get to school because of my work, and so we decided to look into a different type of shoe than the ones we had been buying,' Ms Parker told Daily Mail Australia. 'Is it that big a deal that my daughter has shoes they don't care for? Kids walk and skate, and catch a bus or a train, not every child gets driven to school. The rules need to cater for comfortable and practical shoes,' she said. The rubber-soled soft leather lace-ups were pointed out by a teacher on the first day of term, and Riley was taken to the school's office, where she was offered a pair of shoes from lost property, and remained until the end of the day. Ms Parker was not contacted to let her know that her daughter had been taken out of class, and said that she has had no contact with the principal of the school, Amadeo Ferra, despite Mr Ferra issuing a statement on Thursday reinforcing the uniform guidelines. The secondary school's policy states that girls are to wear 'black leather lace-up school shoes (not fashion heels)', which Ms Parker said the shoes comply to . Ms Parker said  her daughter needed a more practical and comfortable shoe to meet her needs . 'I just can't make sense of this. They've shifted the goal posts on what they are expecting of the uniform. When I spoke to the vice-principal yesterday I was told that her shoes aren't the type of shoes they're looking for, even though they are black leather lace-ups,' she said. Ms Parker was informed that the school was looking for shoes with more of a heel, but has been left baffled as to why her daughter is being punished for a non-existent rule. 'Why has she not been allowed to attend class while this grey area is being cleared up? If I decided to pull her out of school for four days, I would be in trouble. But for some reason they can pull my daughter out of classes simply because they don't like her shoes'. The 14-year-old has not been allowed back into classes since Monday, which Ms Parker said has caused significant issues when it comes to her daughter completing her school work. 'The school said that she hasn't been given an in-school suspension, but I don't know how else to look at it. She can't go to class. What is that if not a suspension?' Ms Parker said. 'She has been allowed to approach each of her teachers at the beginning of the lesson to ask for work, and some have given her work, but some haven't,' she said. 'It's the start term and so she is really struggling to complete work because she's not in class to have things explained to her.' Ms Parker also said that she pointed out to the school that being unable to attend classes and prevented from joining in with her classmates was exclusion, which went against the school's own policy. The school offered to buy Riley a pair of shoes which met the standards of the uniform policy, but Ms Parker said that she had declined the offer as she did not understand why her daughter was not able to wear comfortable shoes that she already owned. Ms Parker said that her daughter was being excluded from classes, which breached McClelland College's own policy on bullying and harassment . McClelland College's principal Amadeo Ferra said that the school was sticking by the uniform policy . Mr Ferra released a statement on Thursday addressing the issue. 'Our students are expected to wear black leather lace-up shoes. Shoes with a flat sole — ‘skate-style shoes’ — are not acceptable,' Mr Ferra said. 'We have done everything to assist the family concerned, including offering the student a pair of appropriate shoes,' he said. 'We still expect the student to wear the appropriate shoes but will be ensuring she receives regular classroom teaching, which is what we have always wanted,' reported The Herald Sun. Mr Ferra said that McClelland College's uniform policy was set by the school council, and involved consultation with the school community. Ms Parker said that she was disappointed and frustrated with the school, and couldn't understand why her daughter's shoes were drawing so much attention when the school had much larger issues. 'I had another parent say to me that she couldn't believe they were worried about school shoes when there are students walking around the local shops in school hours,' she said. 'Other parents have thanked me for sticking up for the kids and not letting the issue be swept under the carpet.' 'It seems trivial and sad when we look at what's going on in society and with kids these days. I just find it ridiculous'. Ms Parker has contacted her local MP, and has also submitted a complaint with the Victorian Board of Education, and hopes to get a response within the next two days. McClelland College has been contacted for comment.","Riley Filmer has been prevented from attending class because of her shoes .

"Women have long been warned that the older they are, the greater the risk of health problems for them and their baby - but research now suggests older fathers can also affect baby's health. This increases the risk of epilepsy, autism and breast cancer. Two-thirds of new UK fathers are now over 30, and the researchers say older would-be fathers should be better informed about the risks of conditions that can occur in their offspring. Whereas the menopause marks the end of reproduction, men are able to produce sperm throughout their lives. However, the quality declines and, according to the new research from doctors at the Centre for Reproductive Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, and other centres, this could have implications for the next generation. Men are able to produce sperm throughout their lives. However, the quality declines and this could have implications for the next generation . Worldwide data from more than 60 teams of researchers on the health risks associated with older fathers found that men aged over 35 had a 50 per cent lower chance of conceiving over a 12-month period than men 25 and under, even after taking into account the age of the would-be mother. The risk of miscarriage and premature birth also rises when the man is more than 40. A study of 23,821 pregnant women analysed by the researchers found that pregnancies involving men aged 50 or older were twice as likely to end in the loss of the foetus compared to younger fathers. And the problems may not end with conception. Advanced paternal age (over 40) increases the risk of breast cancer in their daughters by around 60 per cent, according to one of the studies the American researchers looked at (one of five to find a link between advanced paternal age and breast cancer). Children conceived by fathers over 40 also have a 30 per cent increased risk of epilepsy, a 37 per cent higher risk of Down's syndrome, a 14 per cent greater chance of childhood leukaemia, and a 70 per cent greater likelihood of central nervous system cancers (such as brain tumours). If the father is over 45, there is a threefold increased risk of retinoblastoma, a rare type of eye cancer. Older fathers are thought to be at higher risk of having children with autism and schizophrenia. If the father is over 45, there is a threefold increased risk of retinoblastoma, a rare type of eye cancer . Some of the biggest increases in risk are seen in genetic disorders. Achondroplasia, a common cause of dwarfism, is nearly eight times more prevalent in the children of fathers aged 50 and over. So, why might this be? In order to produce new sperm, so-called sperm 'precursor' cells have to divide. They do this every 16 days, which means by the time a man reaches 70, these cells will have divided around 1,500 times. With each division comes a risk of DNA mutation and genetic defects. A study from Iceland in 2012 found that the average child born to a 20-year-old father has 25 DNA mutations in their genes and that the number increases annually, reaching 65 mutations for offspring of 40-year-old men, increasing the risk of problems. Another explanation is that, after the age of 60, a high percentage of sperm is affected by so-called DNA fragmentation. Normally, the genetic material in a sperm cell is wound up like a tight ball of yarn to prevent the strands of DNA breaking. When the genetic material is not safely packaged, the DNA strands are vulnerable to breakage, or DNA fragmentation, which means the fertilised egg may not be able to develop normally and, in some cases, become unviable. With age, a man's testosterone levels also drop, with one in five men over 60 having low levels, leading to poor semen quality, which can affect conception rates. Advanced paternal age can also lead to birth defects, say the Baylor researchers, whose study is being published in the journal Fertility and Sterility. Dr Simon Fishel, chief executive of CARE Fertility, says: 'Even though men keep producing sperm, the decline in sperm DNA with age is now uncontroversial, with potentially devastating effects on the offspring of older men. 'It is not as marked or obvious an effect that we observe in women, which makes it all the more insidious and risky for populations in which men are reproducing later in life. 'This study is telling us we need to sit up and take note, and start to educate the public on the risks of the male biological clock, and not just the female.' Women are generally counselled that as they reach their late-30s, their risk of not just conceiving, but of having a healthy child decreases as the quality and quantity of their eggs deteriorate. At 35, a woman's risk of conceiving a child with Down's syndrome is about one in 350, but by age 45, it is about one in 30. Yet currently, patients are rarely warned about how advanced paternal age may present risks to their offspring, but this should change, says Dr Dolores Lamb, director of the Centre for Reproductive Medicine and Professor of Urology and Molecular and Cellular Biology at Baylor College of Medicine. 'The medical community must do a better job of educating couples that there are some risks associated with conception at advanced paternal age,' she says. One issue will be identifying the age at which problems may occur. One study the researchers looked at, which set out to find a cut-off age for men, found that semen quality declined continuously with age, with no point at which risk suddenly increased.","Two-thirds of new UK fathers are now over 30 .

"For the first time, the Government's drug regulator - the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - has approved a remedy containing a traditional Chinese herb. The product, Phynova Joint and Muscle Relief, contains sigesbeckia, a herb traditionally used to treat aches and pains caused by arthritis. 'Until now many GPs have been wary of recommending Chinese herbs, but now there is one product that we know is produced safely and at the optimum dose,' explains Professor George Lewith, a complementary medicine researcher from Southampton University. Sigesbeckia is a herb traditionally used to treat aches and pains caused by arthritis . 'Sigesbeckia gives us another alternative to anti-inflammatory drugs which come with potential side-effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding.' Professor Lewith doesn't use the product himself, but says that before having hip replacements for arthritis he used another herb, Devil's Claw, as a remedy for joint pain. He isn't the only orthodox doctor who recommends complementary therapies to his patients... HERBAL MEDICINE FOR COLDS AND DEPRESSION . Dr Mike Dixon, a GP in Cullompton, Devon, and chairman of the College of Medicine, says he is a 'fan' of herbal medicines because they are 'safe, help to encourage self-care by patients and, in cases such as mint and aloe vera, can be grown by the patients themselves, making them virtually free'. 'My go-to remedy in the cold season is a herb called pelargonium, which I take as soon as I feel a cold coming as it prevents the virus replicating,' he says. 'I also use mint tea for indigestion and make a remedy from the lemon balm that grows in my garden to help me sleep. You just put five leaves in a cup of boiling water and leave it to brew. The remedy I most commonly suggest to patients, though, is St John's wort. There is strong evidence that it helps in tackling mild to moderate depression. It is also a potential treatment for long-term tiredness. 'It can interfere with the contraceptive Pill and some other medications - but it's definitely something that I suggest patients should consider.' Before taking St John's wort, check with your pharmacist or GP. Dr Mike Dixon says he is a 'fan' of herbal medicines because they are 'safe' (posed by model) HYPNOTHERAPY FOR BOWEL TROUBLE . Professor Peter Whorwell, a gastroenterologist at the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester, specialises in helping people with severe Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). 'By the time they come to me most other treatments have failed, and I recommend hypnotherapy to probably 70 to 80 per cent of them as part of a treatment package including medication, diet and lifestyle changes. 'It works on about 80 per cent of those who try it. IBS involves abnormal muscle spasms of the gut and hypersensitivity of the gut to pain, and is aggravated by stress. Hypnotherapy tackles all three of these causes. 'I have been taught self-hypnosis to help me sleep when my mind is whirring. I think it's a skill every doctor should learn.' TURMERIC FOR ACHES AND PAINS . Dr Uzma Ali, an NHS GP who also works at the Integrated Medical Centre in London, explains that as a child she was always given a glass of warm milk with half a teaspoon of the spice turmeric if she fell over. Dr Uzma Ali was always given a glass of warm milk with half a teaspoon of the spice turmeric if she fell over . 'Only now do I know why that was - turmeric contains an ingredient called curcumin which has been found to have a powerful anti-inflammatory action. 'Now, if I see patients with problems like sports injuries, back pain, whiplash, fibromyalgia or sciatica, I suggest that they add a supplement of curcumin to their treatment - or, if they can't take painkillers, that they use it as their primary remedy. 'My favourite remedy is called Dehlvi's Haldi capsules, which contain turmeric, but you can buy turmeric/curcumin capsules in health stores - or just add more to your cooking.' ACUPUNCTURE FOR MIGRAINES . Dr Tanvir Jamil, a GP at Burnham Health Centre, near Slough in Berkshire, has been treating his patients with acupuncture for years. 'I mostly offer this to patients for pain relief - particularly migraine. If medication or lifestyle changes such as reducing stress aren't working, acupuncture will often help. I normally give patients one session a week for four weeks. The number of GPs in Britain who practise homeopathy . 'I combine Chinese acupuncture - which works along energy lines called meridians in the body, that Chinese practitioners believe become imbalanced during illness - and Western acupuncture, which concentrates the needles where it specifically hurts. 'So for migraine, I'd use the needles around the face, either side of the eyebrow, the cheek and just under the ear - along with points in the hands. 'I decided to learn acupuncture when I was a junior doctor over 20 years ago. The evidence is good enough that the government health watchdog, NICE, recommends acupuncture on the NHS for migraines. 'I have had acupuncture myself for neck pain in the past. Exactly how it works isn't known but my personal theory is that it somehow stops the nerves being as sensitive to pain signals. 'It's a once-a-week treatment and there are no side-effects - it could save the NHS a fortune if it was used more widely.' YOGA FOR SKIN COMPLAINTS . Every morning Dr Stefanie Williams, a dermatologist and medical director of European Dermatology London, does ten to 15 minutes of yoga and 20 minutes' meditation at lunchtime. 'Both help my stress levels and also benefit my skin,' she says. 'The stress hormone cortisol raises levels of inflammation in the skin - and this not only triggers faster ageing but aggravates conditions such as acne, eczema and rosacea. The stress hormone cortisol raises levels of inflammation in the skin - yoga can alleviate this . 'For this reason I also advise my patients, whether they are coming to me for skin problems or merely for cosmetic procedures, to try yoga or meditation as part of their treatment plan. 'They are often surprised by the idea, but many have experienced their skin flaring up when they are stressed, so once I explain the science behind why that happens they are very keen to include it.' HOMEOPATHY FOR INDIGESTION . Most conventional doctors are highly sceptical of homeopathy, questioning the idea that minute amounts of a substance that triggers symptoms can also be used to treat those symptoms. Not so Dr Tim Robinson, a GP in Beaminster, Dorset, who has been a GP for 25 years and a homeopath for 20. 'I use homeopathy myself - most commonly Nux Vom, which I take when I get indigestion - and I do suggest the remedies to some of my patients. 'It is helpful when conventional medication has nothing to offer, or where it's contra-indicated. 'For example, if I have a menopausal woman coming to see me with hot flushes and she can't take HRT because she has had breast cancer, or has been using HRT for the recommended two to four years and must come off it, there are a few homeopathic remedies I can suggest - belladonna being the most common. 'Homeopathy is also useful for chilblains - there are topical orthodox treatments for this but they aren't very effective. 'The idea behind homeopathy is that dilute forms of substances that cause the symptoms of a condition can also help to treat it. 'In a study of 20,000 people by Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, 70 per cent of them said they felt a positive benefit.'","The Government's drug regulator has approved a 'herbal remedy'

"This is the moment a family got a shock after an elderly buffalo escaped being dinner for lions - only to run headlong into their car. Moya Gerber was travelling in her vehicle through the Kruger National Park, South Africa, when she spotted a male and female lion trying to bring down a Cape Buffalo. Moya's sister Rone Odendaal, 24, who is a teacher at Laerskool Lothair, located in the village of Lothair, began taking pictures of the struggle, before noticing the buffalo was heading for the road. Battle: Moya Gerber and her sister Rone Odendaal, 24, spotted this struggle between two lions and a buffalo in the Kruger National Park in South Africa, so they stopped to photograph it . Collision: After a few moments the buffalo managed to escape the lions' clutches, but headed straight for the road instead before running into the side of Ms Odendaal's car . While the beast managed to escape being eaten by the lions, it did receive a nasty knock to the head after running into the side of their van. Speaking to MailOnline, Ms Odendaal, who uploaded the pictures to her Instagram, said: 'We were on holiday. We go to the park a couple of times every year but this is the first time something like this has happened. 'It was on the third day of a five day trip in the morning that we saw the buffalo. We were on the h3 road, going from the from Malelane satellite camp  towards Skukuza camp. 'It started when we saw two male lions just past abridge heading towards a waterhole. 'They got a drink of water and then slept under bushes on our left hand side and then we spotted the buffalo on our right side. 'The wind was in the lions favour, they jumped up in unison and walked fast over the road towards the buffalo.They looked really hungry and needed food, that's when the action started. 'The lions stalked the buffalo before one jumped on its back. That lion held on for almost 30 minutes until the buffalo ran towards the cars. It's horn punctured a car wheel which gave the lion a fright. 'The other male lion got thrown through the air but came back and also started biting the buffalo by its tail. We could smell the blood. Life or death: Miss Odendaal, a teacher from the village of Lothair, captured these images of the beasts fighting with one-another before the buffalo crashed into her vehicle . Explain that to the insurers! A fully grown buffalo can weigh up to 1,750lbs - about half the weight of a VW Golf - and stands six foot tall, meaning it left quite a dent in the car's door . 'Just before the lions could bring the buffalo down it punctured the car wheel and then ran into our car taking the mirror off. 'I was in the car with my sister and her two children, one-year-old Hendri, and Lisa who is four. 'The children started crying after the buffalo hit the car but we told them to sit really still. 'I hoped that the lions would manage to bring the buffalo down in order to feed. They need to eat as well but other people were screaming for the poor buffalo. 'I gained even more respect for lions watching this with my own eyes the perseverance it takes to try and bring it down and the buffalo really hurt them running through the bush with them.' She also revealed that the unlucky buffalo caused around £11,000 worth of damage to the car. Nadav Ossendryver, the founder of Latest Sightings, a website that tracks animals in the Kruger park, uploaded the pictures last week and said it was something he'd never seen before. Ms Odendaal's friends also joked about the close-shave on Facebook, with Jeremy Hallett quipping: 'Explain that to your insurance!' The Kruger National Park spans 7,500 square miles of territory in the north east of South Africa along its border with Mozambique, making it one of the largest game reserves in Africa. One of a kind: When Miss Odendaal's images were uploaded to website for spotting wildlife in the Kruger park, it's founder said he had never seen anything like it before . The park is home to more 12,000 elephants, 1,000 leopards, 2,800 lions, and 27,000 African Buffalo, with the climate ranging from savanna scrubland in the south, to tropical in the north. The buffalo that call the park home can reach heights of six foot and weigh around 1,750lbs - or around half the weight of a VW Golf. The male African lion, pictured here, reaches an adult weight of just under 500lbs, making it the second largest big cat after the tiger, but still nowhere near as large as the buffalo.","Rone Odendaal, 24, took pictures of two lions hunting an elderly buffalo .

"Police are investigating the theft of about $70,000 worth of bull semen from a farm in southern Minnesota. Mower  County Sheriff Terese Amazi said farmer Daniel Weness, of LeRoy, reported on Tuesday that a storage canister with vials of bull semen was taken from his unlocked barn. The canister was worth about $500, and the vials of semen were worth from $300 to $1,500 apiece. Scroll down for video . About $70,000 worth of bull semen was stolen from a farm in southern Minnesota sometime between April 1 and April 7 . The Semen, stolen from Daniel Weness's farm (pictured) was taken from an unlocked barn. A $500 canister held vials of semen worth between $300 and $1,500 each . The theft happened sometime between April 1 and 7. The man said the only time he and his hired hand were away from the farm was on Easter Sunday, according to the Austin Daily Herald. Police have no suspects. Chief Deputy Mark May said that there is a market for bull semen because it helps farmers on transportation costs of putting a bull and a cow in the same pen to breed. 'A lot of people purchase bid on it or purchase it instead of transporting their animals to and from a site,' he said. 'They can just purchase a vial of bull semen and inseminate their cow and I guess it's just more reliable that way.' Mark May, chief deputy of the Mower County Sheriff's Office said that there is a market for bull semen because it helps farmers reduce transportation costs of animals . Frozen semen can live for many years, often outliving the bull it originally came from, according to the Washington Post. 'A lot of farmers these days use artificial insemination to increase genetic diversity within their herds,' Linnay Yarger, an agriculture teacher at Austin High School told KAAL. 'The range in value depends on the bull it comes from,' she added. 'Some genetic qualities are more highly sought after than others, so the higher priced semen is coming from maybe an award winning bull or a quality that is sought after.' Welness said he has about 80 animals on his farm.","Daniel Weness reported on Tuesday that a storage canister with vials of bull semen had been taken from his farm .

"A loving father has helped his seven-year-old son, who suffers from a congenital heart defect, to view his surgery scars as beautiful marks of bravery by proudly sharing a photo of the boy's battle wounds online. When Mark Gentle, from Farmington, Maine, found his son Carter sobbing because he thought that the scar from his fifth open-heart surgery - an emergency procedure to repair his pacemaker - was 'ugly', the concerned dad posted a snapshot of the little boy's chest to his Facebook account in the hopes of generating some wider support and, in turn boost Carter's confidence. 'We told him that his scars are beautiful and make him look like a superhero. How many likes can Carter get for his bravery?' Mark wrote alongside the picture, which has received nearly 1.5 million likes since it was posted on April 11. Brave boy: Mark Gentle shared this photo of his seven-year-old son Carter modeling his open-heart surgery scars on Facebook after he found his son crying over his physical appearance . Dedicated dad: The father-of-three hoped to boost Carter's confidence by posting the picture, which has received nearly 1.5 million since it was posted last week . Mark, who only expected likes and comments from his Facebook friends, told Today that he and his wife Sarah were amazed when the photo received 200,000 likes in the first day. The overwhelming response prompted Mark to turn up the volume on his cell phone and remind Carter that every beep he heard should serve as a sign that someone was supporting his bravery. 'He would look at me with these big eyes each time and say, ""Dad, is that for me again?""' Mark said. 'It's been a huge confidence booster and it has been therapeutic for Carter.' Mark explained that when his son first removed his bandages 'he went down to the bathroom to look in the mirror and he just started sobbing'. Feeling better: Carter, who has a congenital heart defect, can be seen showing off one of the scars on his chest. His most recent surgery was an emergency procedure to repair his pacemaker . Real fighter: The seven-year-old boy has had five open-heart surgeries since he was born . Support system: Carter's dad Marke can be seen holding his son's hand in the hospital as he sleeps . 'He said, “People are going to think I'm ugly. My scars look horrible,""' he recalled. ‘As a parent, it just tears your heart out. As much as that kid's been through, the last thing I ever want him to worry about is scars.' Mark told Carter that 'his scars are what makes him, him', while explaining there are a lot of people who have them. And thanks to his dad, Carter is seeing his scars in a new light - especially after thousands of commenters have written him words of support, while others have shared photos of their own scars. 'Don't worry buddy scars are pretty cool and chicks will dig them. 'You are not ugly. You are a very handsome little man,' wrote Jessyka Champaigne, who also posted a snapshot of one of her own battle wounds. Sleepy boy: After surgery, Carter's chest scar was covered with superhero stickers . Say cheese: Carter smiled for the camera has he pushed his IV drip during one of his hospital stays . Family moment: Mark and his wife Sarah posed for this photo while Carter was in the hospital . She continued: 'Keep your head up. I've had 12 surgeries and counting, this one is my biggest scar (goes down my back) [and I] wear it proudly. You're tough.' Another woman added: 'I have MANY scars from a horrible accident. They show the world how strong and brave you are, so I am proud of them. I wear them with pride. We can overcome anything.’ Meanwhile, someone else commented: 'You do look like a superhero!' 'His scars are what makes him, him,' Carter's dad noted. 'They show everybody what he's overcome and that he was stronger than the disease that tried to kill him.'","Carter Gentle, from Farmington, Maine, cried over the appearance of his 'ugly' scars after having his fifth open-heart surgery .

"A former teacher at a prestigious girls' school, attended by some of Los Angeles' most affluent families, has been sued by a former student, alleging sexual abuse. An unnamed 30-year-old former Marlborough School student filed the lawsuit against Joseph Koetters, who taught English at the Hancock Park school which charges $35,000-per-year. The lawsuit alleges that when Koetters was in his early-to-mid 30s he took part in a yearlong sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student, which began in the 2000-2001 school year. Joseph Koetters, a former English Teacher at Marlborough School in Los Angeles, is being sued by an unnamed 30-year-old former student who alleges that he sexually abused her . In the lawsuit, unnamed teachers and school officials are held responsible for not ending the relationship, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Marlborough ignored allegations against Koetters at the two previous schools he had worked at, the lawsuit claims. He spent time working at Pasadena's Polytechnic School and Calabasas' Viewpoint School. Marlborough officials are accused of ignoring complaints made by other female students during his time working at the school. The former teacher was arrested in February and charged with two counts of oral copulation of a person under 18 and two counts of sexual penetration by a foreign object, all of which allegedly took place during his time at Marlborough. Koetters pleaded not guilty and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted. The woman who filed the civil lawsuit is the same one mentioned in the criminal case, her attorney David M. Ring told the Los Angeles Times. The lawsuit alleges that when Koetters was in his early-to-mid 30s he took part in a yearlong sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student, which began in the 2000-2001 school year. The lawsuit claims that unnamed teachers and staff members did not stop the relationship or properly discipline Koetters . Koetters also allegedly impregnated the woman, who then had a miscarriage, according to the criminal lawsuit. The alleged victim of both lawsuits spoke to police in July after a different former Marlborough student wrote an online essay accusing the school of not properly acting upon her allegations of Koetters' inappropriate contact with her. Mikaela Gilbert-Lurie's essay, published on xoJane, revealed an inappropriate relationship that Koetters instigated with her in 2011 while she was a 16-year-old junior. In her essay, Gilbert-Lurie said that Koetters crossed the student-teacher boundary when she asked to interview him for the school newspaper. He agreed, replying 'It's a date' to her email. Later when they met up outside the school, she wrote that he dodged her questions and turned the conversation towards romantic poetry, saying he could lend her one of his favorite books. At the end of the conversation, his hands brushed against her knee. Other students, including the one who filed the lawsuit, came forward after Mikaela Gilbert-Lurie (pictured) wrote an online essay about her experiences at Marlborough with Koetters . While Gilbert-Lurie admitted in her essay that the flirting made her feel good at first, she became less comfortable with their relationship when he started getting more explicit in their email conversations. He said he knew how to draw boundaries with other students but not with her and talked about how her short school skirt made her 'so alluring'. A few day later, the teen wrote him saying they needed to stop so she could focus on finals and 'just being 16'. Koetters responded 'Ugh, Ok,' but continued to harass her in class and through email, the teen claimed. With the support of her brother, she decided to tell her parents. In 2011, Gilbert-Lurie and her parents informed the school about Koetters' inappropriate behavior, prompting an investigation. Head teacher, Barbara Wagner, told the family that the complaint would be taken seriously - and was allegedly advised by the president of the board of trustees to handle the matter internally. When asked if there had been previous complaints against Koetters, it appeared that the head teacher failed to mention a similar complaint in 2005. It does not appear that complaint by a female student was credited at the time, according to the magazine. Koetters, who had taught at Marlborough for 14 years, was sent to sexual harassment training following Gilbert-Lurie's complaints and stripped of his position as chair of the English department - but was not fired because it was a 'first-time offense'. Marlborough private school in LA costs $35,000-a-year and attracts female students from some of Los Angeles most prestigious families . Gilbert-Lurie was moved to another English class. Marlborough claimed last year that they were unaware of Gilbert-Lurie's allegation from her xojane essay that Koetters had touched her knee. The University of Pennsylvania student said that the school had been informed. Koetters remained at the school alongside Gilbert-Lurie for another year before starting a new job at the elite Polytechnic School in Pasadena. Marlborough School announced in the fall of 2014 that Wagner would resign by the end of June 2014, after it was revealed that she did not properly respond to students' allegations against Koetters. Marlborough School was not immediately available for comment.","Joseph Koetters has been sued by an unnamed Marlborough student, 30 .

"Duke was not the only big winner following Monday's NCAA championship game. In an upset even more surprising than the Blue Devils victory over the slightly favored Wisconsin Badgers, Sam Holtz, a 12-year-old sixth grader from Lake Zurich, Illinois, beat out 11.5million entries to win the annual ESPN Tournament Challenge. And for this impressive feat, Sam gets bragging rights and an amazing sense of accomplishment. But not the actual grand prize of a $20,000 Best Buy gift card and an all-inclusive trip for two to the Maui Jim Maui Invitational college basketball tournament in Hawaii this November. For that prize, valued at $30,000, Sam would have to legally be an adult as contest rules state individuals must be at least 18-years-old to qualify. Scroll down for video . Sam Holtz (above) beat out 11.5million entries to win the ESPN Tournament Challenge on Monday . This as he selected Duke (above) to win the NCAA title game, which they did by overcoming the favorite Wisconsin badgers 68 - 63 . 'It feels really, like, exciting and I feel pretty cool right now for winning it because it’s a really hard thing to do,' Sam told ABC News. 'I was just talking to ESPN and they said that I’m underage and can’t get any of the prize and they’re going to send some goodies even though I entered under my dad’s consent, which I’m pretty irritated about.' That being said, like any enterprising child, Sam does have an idea for the folks at ESPN as it pertains to compensation for his historic fete. 'For ESPN, I came in first and this was a rare thing that you can rarely get and I still don’t get anything and I think I deserve something out of it,' Sam said. 'Even if I just get an Xbox or something.' Sam's plan may not work however, as it would have taken a second amazing feat for him to actually win the prize, with the top 1percent of entries being entered for a random drawing, which in this case would put his odds at roughly 1 in 115,000. As for his strategy, Sam seemed to adopt a seldom seen cool and relaxed approach when it came to making his picks, and says he was barely even aware how well he was doing. 'I didn’t really pay attention to my bracket until the Final Four when I went on my phone and realized, ""Woah, I’m in sixth place,""' said Sam. 'Then I zoned into those games and realized, ""Hey, I have a chance here.""' Sam should now be eligible for the $30,000 grand prize of a $20,000 Best Buy gift card and an all-inclusive trip to Hawaii this November, but is too young . He's got it: With a few minor exceptions, Sam picked a remarkably accurate bracket who was, including 100percent correct from the Elite Eight onward. He only had two teams wrong in the Sweet 16 . Sam is not the only winner going home empty handed either, as under NCAA guidelines college athletes cannot accept any forms of payment or gifts, which means the boys from Duke also head home with no prize money or Xboxes. Though, to put things in perspective, Sam had to deal with approximately 11,499,936 more competitors than any of the teams in the tournament. Sam is also helping out all those adults who obsessed over their brackets and then became irrationally angry as their teams lost by offering some helpful tips to make next year better. 'Just pick the team that you like and pick whoever you want,' he said. 'You never know what’s going to happen in March Madness so just pick teams that you really like.' ESPN might be smart to give the level-headed kid who knows his college basketball a job as a commentator at next year's tournament instead of that Xbox. Assuming he is old enough.","Sam Holtz beat out 11.5million entries to win the ESPN Tournament Challenge on Monday .

"Tesco is close to ditching the last of the private jets used by its top executives after an accounting scandal that sparked the biggest crisis in its 95-year history. Britain’s biggest grocer operated a multimillion-pound fleet of five aircraft for its bosses, but after a disastrous year new chief executive Dave Lewis admitted the planes gave the wrong image and put them up for sale. Four have been sold and the final one, a Hawker 800, will be gone by the end of next month. A similar plane can cost up to £67,000 to charter. Tesco's old Gulfstream 550, worth around £30 million,  that was capable of flying 14 executives at a time . Just days ago, Tesco managed to sell its seven-year-old, Gulfstream 550, worth around £30million new. It was capable of flying 14 executives at a time. With a top speed of 580mph, powered by two Rolls-Royce engines, it was the height of luxury, kitted out with DVD players, widescreen TVs and a bar . It even had cabins allowing executives to sleep in full-sized beds on longer journeys to America and Asia. Mr Lewis hopes the sale of the fleet will draw a line under a difficult year in which Tesco lurched from crisis to crisis, including a fraud investigation into after a £263million black hole emerged in its accounts. The supermarket haemorrhaged senior staff losing its chairman, chief executive and finance director while being hit hard by competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl, who have stolen customers. In September Lewis was parachuted in from consumer goods giant Unilever. However less than four weeks after informing the City he no longer wanted to maintain the fleet, Lewis could not resist hopping onto a private jet to visit seven locations in Asia in four days. A spokesman said: ‘In October we said we would dispose of the five aircraft we operated. The last aircraft will be handed back by the end of May at the latest. Tesco spent nearly £29 million flying executives to different parts of the world between 2005 and 2012 . ‘The aircraft have not been used by Tesco since December. In future we will use chartered aircraft only if there is a compelling business justification and travel cannot be completed by scheduled airline.’ Between 2005 and 2012 the firm has spent nearly £29 million flying executives to different parts of the world. Previous chief executive Sir Terry Leahy has been reported as saying he preferred flights with EasyJet than flying on private jets but still managed to spend £2.3 million on the planes in 2009. The bill increased dramatically under the management of former boss Phil Clarke. In February 2011 under the tenure of Clarke it had jumped to £8.9 million. A brand new Gulfstream was delivered and sold almost immediately in November along with a Cessna Citation and another Hawker.","Tesco operated multimillion-pound a fleet of five aircraft for its bosses .

"This is the terrifying moment a gigantic tornado sweeps past a hapless motorist in Illinois, who films it from his truck. The driver, Sam Smith, begins filming with the tornado just a few hundred yards in front of him. It's an apocalyptic sight - and Mr Smith feels trapped, because he can't make out which direction it's moving in so doesn't know how to escape. This is the terrifying moment a gigantic tornado swept past a hapless motorist in Illinois, who filmed it from his truck . The driver, Sam Smith, begins filming with the tornado just a few hundred yards in front of him . Harrowing: It then passes right in front of his truck - while Mr Smith spoke to his son on the phone . He says on the video: 'This is a tornado and I cannot tell which way it is going. So I don't know how to get away from it. But it looks like it's coming right towards me.' Sounding remarkably calm, he continues: 'Yep, it's going to come right over me. Let's see if I can back up a little bit and get under the bridge. Yeah, it's coming right over me. 'Oh c**p. I've never been in a tornado before. Totally crazy. It's coming right over the top of me. It's a little bit scary. 'I don't really know what to do except I guess just sit here. Maybe duck down. Oh my gosh. That's crazy. Crazy, crazy. Holy smokes. The truck feels like it's about to lift up off the ground.' The tornado blows debris across the road in front of Mr Smith's truck . As the tornado sweeps past Mr Smith says that the truck felt like it was going to lift off the ground . Mr Smith was travelling from Minneapolis to Indiana on business last Thursday when the harrowing encounter took place . Mr Smith said afterwards that he hung up on his son so he would think they were disconnected as 'it seemed things were going to get real bad' Fortunately the tornado passes leaving Mr Smith unharmed and his truck intact, but the footage clearly shows that it was a close call. Mr Smith was travelling from Minneapolis to Indiana on business last Thursday when the harrowing encounter took place. He said afterwards: 'There was heavy rain and I saw cars pulling off the side of the road. I thought it was because they did not want to drive in heavy rain. Then it started hailing very large golf ball-sized hail. I thought the truck would be dented so I pulled off the road under and over-pass with several other vehicles. 'As I was leaving that over-pass my son called and I answered. It was then that I saw the tornado far off in the distance. He was excited and asked me to record it. So as I approached the next over-pass I pulled under it. 'Having no idea it was coming right my way. I continued to film and backed my truck further under the over-pass. As it got closer and closer I realized it was most likely going to hit me. I remained calm since I had my son on the phone. As it got closer it seemed likely things were going to get real bad and so I hung up on my son without saying goodbye so he would think we just got disconnected. The video tells a pretty good story from there.' According to the Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma, Mr Smith should not have backed his car under a bridge when he caught sight of the tornado. It says on its online tornado safety guide that if you're in a vehicle when one comes near that you must 'avoid seeking shelter under bridges' as it can create 'deadly traffic hazards while offering little protection against flying debris'. It continues: 'There is no safe option when caught in a tornado in a car, just slightly less-dangerous ones. If the tornado is visible, far away, and the traffic is light, you may be able to drive out of its path by moving at right angles to the tornado. 'Seek shelter in a sturdy building, or underground if possible. If you are caught by extreme winds or flying debris, park the car as quickly and safely as possible - out of the traffic lanes. Stay in the car with the seat belt on. Put your head down below the windows, cover your head with your hands and a blanket, coat, or other cushion if possible. If you can safely get noticeably lower than the level of the roadway, leave your car and lie in that area, covering your head with your hands. If you're in a mobile home it strongly advises to leave immediately and to head to the basement if you live in a house that has one. If you're in a building with lots of glass occupants should go to a windowless room on the lowest floor possible, the guide says.","Extraordinary footage taken by driver on business trip to Indiana .

"Preconceptions, I find, can be really unhelpful, so before travelling to The Datai, a luxury hotel in Malaysia, I decided not to find out anything about it. I preferred instead to be delighted - or otherwise - on arrival. I was travelling with my old mucker Doon Mackichan (from Smack The Pony, Plebs, The Day Today). Our paths first crossed almost 30 years ago as rookies on the comedy circuit, but since then we have, by chance, both acquired part-time homes in the same seaside town. It is Doon who has taught me to stride like a warrior into the freezing Channel. Luxury personified: The Datai Hotel has all the colour and wonder of the Emerald City, says Maria McErlane . Setting off for the Far East, there was something of the Hinge and Bracket about us, blithering away in actressy tones, trying to charm the Air Malaysia crew into granting us a cheeky upgrade. (Which failed.) But that was soon forgotten and the joy of leaving Britain behind in cold mid-December was fully realised when we disembarked into the densely tropical humidity of Langkawi. After a 30-minute taxi ride through darkness and impenetrable forests, The Datai appeared with all the colour and wonder of the Emerald City. Full-size carved horses illuminated by antique torches guarded the entrance, as beautiful silk sari-clad Malaysian staff welcomed us with cocktails. In the background, the ubiquitous lobby pianist/singer warbled away to I Just Called To Say I Love You. A minor note of tedium. Langkawi is an archipelago of 104 islands in the Andaman Sea, 20 miles off the coast of Malaysia. In 2007 it was given World Geopark status by Unesco. The Datai Hotel and Resort is in the north west of the island. Maria McErlane (left) with painter Doon Mackichan at The Datai hotel in Malaysia . This paradise in the middle of a ten million-year-old rainforest was created in 1990. Designed by Australian architect Kerry Hill around Datai Bay - a white sandy crescent beach voted one of the ten most beautiful in the world, with its magnificent backdrop of jungle and mountains - the resort took three years to complete. To minimise its impact on the jungle, Hill limited the size of the main building and added 40 villas over the extensive grounds, along with restaurants and a spa alongside a creek. He sourced wood, marble and stone from across the island and mainland Malaysia to create Mayan walls, Malay roofs and Japanese screens. The result sees soft, subtle colours creating an atmosphere throughout of calm tranquillity, offset by genuine animal sounds that could well come from a Now That's What I Call Jungle Noises Volume 1. Leaving the main building behind, we were taken by golf buggy down the 'yellow brick roads' through the enchanted forest, across bridges, and past waterfalls and freshwater streams to our elegant beach villa where we were met by our butlers. Keen to revive our weary bones, Doon asked if it was safe to swim. 'No,' came the answer. 'Why not?' she questioned, expecting to be told of danger. 'Because it is dark,' the butler replied with a smile. Spot of swimming anyone? The Andaman Ocean turns out to be the perfect choice for a dip at any time . Clearly he doesn't know Doon. She has been part of a team swimming the Channel in extreme conditions and also took part in the World Ice Swimming Championships in Finland ('you can feel your body slowing down as hypothermia begins to set in', she boasts). She is made of stern stuff. Despite it being close to midnight, we ran down to the beach, disrobing and squealing, before plunging into the silky-smooth Andaman sea. Phosphorescence streamed through the water, illuminating our limbs as we swam towards the lights of Thailand on the horizon. It was a magical beginning to our holiday. Back at our opulent Balinese-meets-New England villa, we were quite overcome by the super-sized beds, hot outdoor showers, plunge pool, Bose sound system, zillionthread soft cotton sheets, quietly whirring wooden fans, high-tech lighting (we longed for a light switch) and blackout blinds. Buggies can be summoned at a moment's notice, but the next morning we preferred a stroll on the beach, through the jungle, along wooden walkways and up the 139 Mayan temple-inspired steps to breakfast. Clutching our nature books, we were serenaded by squawking macaques and doe-eyed dusky leaf monkeys swinging from Tarzan vines through the trees. First class display: The pair were serenaded by doe-eyed dusky leaf monkeys in the trees . Brahminy kites and green imperial pigeons flew overhead, and we both leapt back in horror when a three foot long monitor lizard slithered across the path into the undergrowth. It really was a first-class display from the jungle inhabitants. After breakfast on the terrace, we took mountain bikes and cycled to the resort's golf course. Golf is not really my thing, but if you know your sand wedge from your nine iron, this course is fantastic - everything is groomed to within an inch of a Stepford wife. In fact, the Els Club Teluk Datai has been voted the best 'new' golf course in the world. Having ignored the warning to keep all doors and windows closed, Doon arrived back at the villa to find a scene of devastation: a monkey burglary. Every drawer had been wrenched open, newspapers shredded, jars unscrewed, suitcase contents scattered and chocolates eaten - tiny slivers of silver paper being the only remains of a Toblerone. Doon had painted a watercolour earlier that morning which the monkeys had 'relieved' themselves on. We didn't need a forensics team to identify our uninvited guests as chocolatey paw prints were everywhere. I was secretly rather thrilled with their ingenuity. After such excitement, a sea dip was needed before several Beach Club cocktails and much embellished recounting of 'Monkeygate'. The four restaurants at The Datai are overseen by executive chef Richard Millar. There's the Beach Club specialising in Mediterranean and international cuisine; The Gulai House, tucked into the forest and offering intensely flavoursome Malay and Indian offerings; the Dining Room in the main building; and The Pavilion, a restaurant on 100ft-high balau stilts erected with the help of elephants (yes, really). Doon remarked that it resembled a 'birds' nest in the sky', albeit one that serves traditional Thai cuisine. Such was our commitment to sampling all the restaurants, we both managed to gain half a stone in a week. Maria heads to the beach after a lazy breakfast . The most pleasing element of our beach view was the lack of visiting boats, save for the Naga Pelangi (Rainbow Dragon), a traditional wooden Malaysian junk schooner hand-built in the boatyards of Duyung island on the east coast of Malaysia. We were invited aboard for a trip to the Geopark to watch brown eagles feed and, in Doon's case, to find dolphins. Her chosen method to summon these creatures was to serenade them in full operatic mode with songs from Carmen - an impressive but futile exercise as they stayed away. If the many activities at The Datai become too much, gentler pursuits are on offer, such as an 8am nature walk that teaches participants the ways of the forest. For me, however, it was a bit early for concentration, so I excused myself and enjoyed a lazy breakfast. Later, in the bathroom, a bean bagsized frog fell from the air-con vent on to my head before hopping on to the cistern, blinking into the daylight: a reminder, were one needed, of the Herculean task it must be preventing the jungle from taking back its land. During our stay, in a futile attempt to counter the calorific intake, we swam morning, noon and night. One longer excursion across the tranquil Datai Bay with flippers and snorkels resulted in us being spiked by sea urchins and stung by jellyfish. Neither incident was a huge deal, but the Datai nurses were on hand within moments of us returning to land, and even took time to check on us the following day. Before leaving Datai, we squeezed in a trip to the spa, which is open to the jungle. I could see the creek below and hear the monkeys gossiping. The ubiquitous plinky-plonky spa musak was quickly redundant when the heavens open and the full rainforest orchestra began its symphony in earnest. During my 90-minute treatment - a Ramuan massage - I'm not sure I have ever been, nor will ever be again, in such a state of zen relaxation. The Datai was truly special. Mystical, spiritual, romantic, luxurious, life-affirming... and fattening. We can't wait to go back. Experience Travel Group (experiencetravelgroup.com, 020 3468 6268) offers seven nights' B&B at The Datai from £1,999 per person, including return flights from Heathrow and transfers.","Comedian Maria McErlane travelled with buddy Doon Mackichan .

"Kitted out: Mr Carney out running in Hyde Park . Just how many water bottles does a man need when running? If you’re the governor of the Bank of England, the answer seems to be four.

The belt is available for $64.95 (£35) at Kintec, a Canadian sports retailer based in Vancouver, suggesting Mr Carney, originally from Canada, bought it before he moved to the UK. He was also wearing headphones and top-of-the range running shoes. His adidas Energy Boost ESM Shoes, in green and black, cost £120. According to the manufacturer, ‘more boost beneath your feet means more fuel in your tank’. They feature a ‘form-fitting techfit® upper’ which is ‘engineered for natural, flexible support and a seamless, sock-like fit’, the firm’s website states. Mr Carney, in charge of the world’s sixth largest economy, completed his look with a grey jumper, which was drenched in sweat by the end of his training session. The father of four daughters, who turned 50 last week, is known to be a keen sportsman and likes to keep fit. At Harvard, he played in goal for his ice hockey team. In 2011, he completed in Canada’s Ottawa marathon, finishing the 26.2-mile sprint in just three hours and 48 minutes in 2011 – an hour and 40 minutes shy of the winning time that year. He continued running when he moved to London to become the Bank of England chief in 2013, and is known to sometimes run from his home to Bank’s headquarters in the City of London to avoid the traffic. ‘Like many other Londoners I do run to work or home from work from time to time,’ he said in an interview. He will be running the London Marathon in aid of Cancer Research UK, a Bank of England spokesman announced in January.

"A Pakistani supermodel has been charged with money laundering offences after she was caught carrying over half a million dollars in Islamabad airport. 21-year-old Ayyan Ali - who has modeled everything from mobile phones to ice cream - was jailed after a staggering amount of money was discovered in her carry-on bag, the Guardian reports. She was charged with attempting to illegally transport more than the legal $10,000 cash limit out of the country on March 14 - and has been in a Rawalpindi prison since. Ali was last seen in public wearing an 'uncharacteristic' black burka outside court as a horde of fellow models gathered nearby. Scroll down for video . Illegal: The staggering amount of cash found on Ali is way more than the $10,000 it is legally allowed to fly out of the country with . Arrested: Pakistani supermodel Ayyan Ali (pictured) has been in jail since March 14, when she caught with over $500,000 in her carry-on bag in Islamabad airport . Found out: Ali was caught with the money in the VIP departure lounge of Benazir Bhutto International Airport (file photo) In recent years she has been one of the most famous models at Pakistan Fashion Week which has been described as a 'three-day extravaganza'. A former model-turned-public relations guru says the country's fashionista circles can talk about nothing else. Frieha Altaf added: 'Some are unkind because they are jealous – everyone b*****s about the beautiful people.' Ever since she was caught in the VIP departure lounge of Benazir Bhutto International Airport, she has been housed in Adiala which is the central prison of the garrison city Rawalpindi. Officials there have denied claims she is receiving special privileges because of her celebrity status with one officer saying private cells are only made available for government officials and the 'highly educated'. She has been denied bail to the outrage of her lawyer who said: 'All agencies have interrogated her and she is no more required for any purpose whatsoever. Sardar Ishaq added: 'She is living with ordinary criminals – ladies involved in murder cases. It will ruin her life.' Many in Pakistan's fashion world think she was manipulated into carrying the money - including the 'grand dame' of the country's blossoming industry. Unfair: Ali's lawyers say she had yet to check in and was going to hand the money over to her brother before flying . Victim? They claim Ali - who has modeled everything from mobile phones to ice cream - is being targeted because of her celebrity status . Anger: 'We respect so-called intellectuals but why don't we respect in this society people who are promoting our culture?' one of her lawyers asked furiously . Maheen Khan said: 'My first reaction was there goes one more girl. A lot of these girls come from very protected families and can be very naive. I think of her as a victim.' Suspicions peaked when she reportedly told a customs court that she was given the money from a businessman with connections in Pakistan's politics. Khurram Latif Khosa - one of the lawyers working on Ali's case - said the money came from a legitimate property sale and the model had no intention of taking it out of the country. He claims she had yet to check into her flight was waiting in the lounge for her brother who was was going to take the cash to Karachi. Khosa says Ali is being unfairly treated by the press and courts because of her position as one of the country's most glamorous and well-known personalities.

PR powerhouse Altaf believes ALi has the strength to recover from the ordeal, saying: 'It takes guts as well as beauty to stand up and be a model in this country. 'You have to have the strength to resist the pressure that comes from society, the social stigma, the questions people always have about you.'","Ayyan Ali was caught in Islamabad airport with the money in her carry-on bag .

"A 96-year-old paedophile became Britain's oldest prisoner after he was jailed for the historic sexual abuse of two young girls. Gaston Pinsard was sentenced to 18 months behind bars after he admitted carrying out the  assaults  more than 50 years ago. The 96-year-old, who claimed he was himself abused at a notorious Jersey children's home, first targeted his victims when they were just five-years-old. Frail Gaston Pinsard, 96, is thought to be Britain's oldest serving prison . A judge branded the historic case 'distressing' and 'unpleasant' as he jailed the frail father-of-four. Guernsey's Royal Court heard that Pinsard was born in 1919 and claimed he had endured years sexual abuse at the Haut de la Garenne children's home. The Jersey home came under intense scrutiny in 2008 after police took statements from 192 alleged victims of historic child abuse. Pinsard joined the army after leaving Haut de La Garenne, where he realised his sexual outlook and experiences were different to other peoples. The court heard he later indecently assaulted the two young girls through curiosity and naivety. The abuse began in 1951, and the court was told the victims did not report what was happening because they were too young to understand what was happening and that they trusted Mr Pinsard. He was first questioned by Guernsey Police officers last year and immediately confessed to carrying out the abuse over a nine year period. The court heard how Pinsard touched the first girl on numerous occasions between 1951 and 1955, and the second between 1964 and 1969 at his home in St Sampson, Guernsey. In a statement read out in court Mr Pinsard admitted he felt ashamed and knew at the time what he was doing was wrong but he could not control it. Pinsard was married with four children at the time of the offences, which took place over a period of nine years and only stopped when he decided to 'stop his filthy habit'. He explained to the court how he 'didn't want to hurt any children'. His wife has now passed away, but Pinsard was accompanied to court by his son. At an earlier hearing the defendant, who uses a hearing aid, admitted nine charges of indecent assault. The Haut de La Garenne children's home in Jersey, where the paedophile claims he was abused as a young boy . Pinsard's defence asked the court to exercise extreme caution, suggesting it would be difficult for the prison to accommodate his needs and medication. In sentencing, Judge Russell Finch acknowledged it was 'a difficult situation' and took his age and health into account, stating that a younger man would have received between seven and nine years. Accounting for the risk of the defendant becoming ill and dying in Prison, Mr Finch sentenced Pinsard to two 18-month sentences in Les Nicolles prison, which will run concurrently. The Prison Officers Association have said they believed Pinsard is the oldest serving prisoner in the British Isles.

"Traitor Edward Snowden has revealed he did not read all the top-secret intelligence documents he leaked – a move which put lives at risk from terrorists. In a television interview the fugitive squirmed as he admitted only ‘evaluating’ the files stolen from GCHQ and the US National Security Agency. The former US spy also acknowledged there had been a ‘f***-up’ when newspapers that were handed the classified material failed to redact sensitive details exposing operations against Al Qaeda. Scroll down for video . Last Week Tonight host John Oliver flew to Moscow to grill Edward Snowden about the leaking of 'harmful' documents and asks him to explain why he did it . But in an outburst of arrogance, Snowden said such potentially catastrophic blunders were a ‘fundamental’ price of liberty. The 31-year-old stunned the world in June 2013 – less than a month after the murder of Lee Rigby by Islamic extremists – when he broke cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole classified documents. He leaked information about attempts by spying agencies including GCHQ and the NSA to view citizens’ private information, claiming internet history, emails, text messages, calls and passwords were harvested. But security chiefs have warned that secret techniques, revealed by Snowden’s leaks to the Guardian newspaper, have made it easier for terrorists and organised criminals to avoid detection. Last month, Home Secretary Theresa May attacked the harm done by the traitor – now one of the world’s most wanted men. Terror experts said lives were being lost because he had hampered security service operations. They warned that extremists had altered their tactics after he leaked details from intelligence agencies – with fatal results. In Sunday night’s interview with British TV host John Oliver, for US channel HBO, Snowden pointedly avoided saying he had read every document he handed over to journalists. At one point the British comedian asks Snowden whether he had read all of the documents he sent to journalists. The whistleblower said he had an 'understanding' of their content . He would only say: ‘I’ve evaluated all of the documents that are in the archive.’ Pressed, he added: ‘I do understand what I turned over.’ But he acknowledged ‘recognising the concern’ over whether he knew enough about the contents of the files or the abilities of reporters to protect classified details. Snowden admitted there had been a ‘f***-up’ with the way in which some of the information about the NSA and GCHQ, Britain’s intelligence agency, had been released. Last year, the New York Times published a slide containing the name of the NSA employee who prepared it. The target of the surveillance was also identified as Al Qaeda in Mosul, Iraq. Snowden said such details should have been removed and, in a feeble attempt to defend his actions, added: ‘In journalism we have to accept that some mistakes will be made. This is a fundamental concept of liberty.’ Unconvinced, Mr Oliver replied: ‘You’re giving documents with information that you know could be harmful which could get out there … We’re not even talking about bad faith, we’re talking about incompetence.’ Oliver tries to get Snowden to explain the leak in the context of nude pictures. The ex-CIA systems administrator claims the government can see most of the pictures you share . It is one of the few occasions in which Snowden has been put on the spot over his treachery as he normally speaks only to Left-wing media who have published his leaks. Lord West, a former First Sea Lord and security minister, said: ‘Since the revelations of the traitor Snowden, terrorist groups have changed how they communicate and talk to each other. ‘His actions have made us all less safe. No doubt people will die who would not have died had he not been so irresponsible.’ Robin Simcox, of the Henry Jackson Society security think-tank, said: ‘This is exactly the danger that those who believe Snowden’s actions were hugely irresponsible – and potentially fatal – warned of. ‘This interview seemed to show how little Snowden had thought about the potentially deadly consequences. Snowden stole a huge amount of sensitive documents and as a result terrorists and other serious criminals have adapted their methods accordingly.’ Snowden handed an estimated 200,000 of the 1.7million stolen classified documents to journalists. In June 2013, he told the Guardian: ‘I carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest.’ This is a transcript of Snowden’s interview: . John Oliver: How many of those documents have you actually read? Edward Snowden: I’ve evaluated all of the documents that are in the archive. Oliver: You’ve read every single one? Snowden: I do understand what I turned over. 'These things happen': Edward Snowden, above, during his television interview . Oliver: There’s a difference between understanding what’s in the documents and reading what’s in the documents. Snowden: I recognize the concern. Oliver (cuts in sarcastically): Right, because when you’re handing over thousands of NSA documents, the last thing you want to do is read them. (laughter) Snowden: I think it’s fair to be concerned – did this person do enough, were they careful enough? Oliver (cuts in): Especially when you’re handling material like we know you’re handling. Snowden: In my defence I’m not handling anything any more. That’s been passed to the journalists and they’re using extraordinary security measures to make sure this is being reported in the most responsible way. Asking the Questions: John Oliver . Oliver: But those are journalists with a lower technical skill set than you. Snowden: That’s true but they do understand like you and I do just how important it is to get this right. Oliver: The New York Times took a slide, it didn’t redact it properly and in the end it was possible to see that something was being used in Mosul on Al Qaeda. Snowden: That is a problem. Oliver: Well, that’s a ****-up. Snowden: It is a ****-up and these things do happen in reporting. In journalism we have to accept that some mistakes will be made. This is a fundamental concept of liberty. Oliver: Right, but you have to own that then. You’re giving documents with information that you know could be harmful which could get out there. Snowden: Yes, if people act in bad faith. Oliver (cuts in): We’re not even talking about bad faith, we’re talking about incompetence. Snowden: We are, but you will never be completely free from risk if you’re free. The only time you can be free from risk is when you’re in prison. He added: ‘There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn’t turn over, because harming people isn’t my goal.’ A report by the Henry Jackson Society last month revealed terror suspects were using human couriers instead of email and phones following the leaks by Snowden. Daily operations of British spies have been damaged, with Islamic State seizing on the information – making it harder to track down its operatives. Al Qaeda militants are known to have changed communication methods to avoid detection, and have produced a video advising fellow extremists on the matter. GCHQ has lost track of some of Britain’s most dangerous criminals because of the way Snowden exposed its operations. Officials had to stop monitoring drug gangs, paedophiles, human traffickers and money launderers. The agency has also been forced to tone down or abandon surveillance amid fears the tactics are too easy to spot and could force criminals to fall off the radar. Mrs May told the Commons home affairs committee that the leaks ‘did cause damage’, adding: ‘It has had an impact on the ability of our agencies to do the work they need to do.’ Snowden, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy files in one of the biggest leaks in US history. He claims he had to act because the US government’s policies were a ‘threat to democracy’. He fled to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location. A Guardian spokesman said the newspaper had ‘nothing to add’ in response to Snowden saying he had ‘evaluated’ the documents and whether this had put people at risk. How the Guardian changed headline to protect its favourite 'whistleblower' The Left-wing Guardian newspaper climbed into bed with Edward Snowden when he leaked the top-secret intelligence documents, publishing a string of damaging stories. And yesterday it was still giving the so-called whistleblower an easy ride when reporting on his clash with TV host John Oliver on his US show Last Week Tonight. The initial story on the Guardian website focused on the sensational revelation that Snowden had apparently not read all the documents. The headline stated: ‘Edward Snowden tells John Oliver he did not read all leaked NSA material.’ It added: ‘The whistleblower admits his actions carried dangers.’ But within hours it had toned down the headline so it focused less on his irresponsibility and incompetence. It was changed to: ‘John Oliver presses Edward Snowden on whether he read all leaked NSA material.’ The sub-heading was amended, to the softer: ‘HBO host posts uncomfortable questions to NSA whistleblower in interview in Moscow.’ A Guardian spokesman said the headline was changed because ‘an earlier version stated that Edward Snowden admitted he had not read all the NSA documents he leaked. In fact he did not answer that question’.

"GPs are the gateway to NHS care – nine out of 10 times, the first contact a patient has with the health system is through their GP. Yet access to GPs has become a major policy and political issue. The crisis in A&E has led some to blame a lack of available GP appointments for people heading to emergency departments instead. Weekend opening hours for GPs has been touted as one solution - by improving access, many patients won’t need to take up other care services. The crisis in A&E has led some people to blame a lack of available GP appointments, prompting more people to visit the emergency department instead . Since the summer of 2013, a number of GP surgeries in London have been piloting seven-day opening, as part of the Challenge Fund initiative - funding for which was recently increased from £50 million to £100 million. Through the Challenge Fund, GP surgeries were asked to bid for funds for extra opening hours, but this was solely for set-up costs, for example, the sharing of medical records. Running costs had to be covered by surgeries from existing budgets. We wanted to know whether the flow of patients to A&E from four of these pilots in central London changed compared to a control group of 30 other surgeries in central London. In our study, we found an eight per cent drop in A&E attendances among patients of the pilot surgeries compared to the control group. We also found an eight per cent drop in A&E admissions among elderly patients, those aged 65 or more, of the pilot surgeries. This is because cautious doctors in emergency departments are more likely to admit elderly patients to hospital, while GPs, familiar with their case histories, may be more comfortable treating and sending them back home. The effect was also largest at weekends. And the fall was only in cases of mild to moderate severity. There was no effect in the most urgent cases such as those caused by accidents or brought to A&E in ambulance. Weekend opening hours for GPs has been touted as one solution to relieve the mounting pressure on A&E departments - by improving access, it is thought many patients won’t need to take up other care services . Based on these findings, we calculated that this eight per cent fall would translate into two million fewer visits to A&E each year if weekend opening was made available nationally. Given that the average cost of a GP consultation is about £27, while that of an A&E visit is £114, two million fewer A&E visits would imply a cost saving of £194 million for the NHS. From research carried out by Thomas Cowling and colleagues, we know that there is an association between GP access and the number of non-urgent A&E visits. In 2010-11, the GP surgeries that were most accessible also had lower A&E non-urgent visits compared to the GP surgeries with the least access. A one point increase in the percentage of registered patients who seek GP appointments within two week days increases non-urgent visits by 0.7 per cent. Increased travel time to hospital also reduces non-urgent A&E visits. Out-of-hour services and walk-in centres, of course are already available. The last Labour government encouraged extra hours but the policy was eventually dropped. On the whole, most of us are happy with access to our GP. In a survey of GP patients conducted in 2014, three-quarters of respondents said that they found opening hours convenient. But among those who found GP opening hours inconvenient, 74 per cent wanted surgeries to be open on Saturdays, 71 per cent late hours (after 6.30pm) and 37 per cent wanted them open on Sundays. Around 24 per cent of people said it was not easy to get through to their surgery on the phone. One issue is also about the demographic of service users. The crisis has become a key political issue. David Cameron has promised to introduce seven-day access to GP services by 202, while Ed Miliband has vowed to introduce a 48-hour target for GP appointments . As one GP put it: 'Longer opening is a fine idea but the problem is that the people who see us the most - young children and elderly - are the ones that don’t have a problem with appointments on a Monday afternoon. Labour has promised a 48-hour target for GP appointments (at a cost of £100 million), while the Tories have promised a seven-day access to GP services by 2020. David Cameron said that the move could take pressure off A&E wards which are 'not the right place for frail, elderly people'. Seven-day opening, however, does not actually mean all surgeries are open all week. In many places, weekend or late opening is rotated between nearby surgeries. It’s a practical and cheap solution, especially for small surgeries which have less resources to spend, fewer GP and nursing staff, so less flexibility in adding weekend shifts. Further evaluation of other pilots may point us towards the most cost-effective arrangement for weekend openings.","Nine in 10 times, the first contact a patient has with the NHS is via a GP .

"Officer Michael Slager has received a visit from his mother and pregnant wife in prison for the first time since he was charged with fatally shooting Walter Scott. Slager, 33, is being kept in isolation and can not walk down a hall in Charleston County Jail without the entire cell block being cleared first, according to his lawyer. But on Friday, his wife Jamie, who is eight-and-a-half months pregnant, and his mother Karen Sharpe were allowed to speak to him. On Tuesday, Slager was charged with murder after opening fire on 50-year-old Scott last weekend. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

When Scott fled - allegedly fearing reprimand for not paying child support - Slager followed, and shot him in the back. His attorney Andy Savage told CBS that Slager is housed in a room with one small window and does not have any interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail. He said that when he met Slager on Wednesday for 60 minutes, that it took an hour and 45 minutes to move the North Charleston police officer to the meeting place because they had to clear all of the cell blocks. A jail staff member told the New York Daily News: 'He wouldn’t last one week in the general population. Everyone inside is talking about it. Of course people want to get at him.'

CBS reports Slager's mother is expected to visit her son Friday for the first time since the shooting. She has defended her son in an interview, saying she cannot believe that he would do anything like what he's accused of. She also revealed that his wife, who is eight months pregnant, is devastated. Ms Sharpe said that she will never watch the video footage of the fatal shooting. She also expressed her sympathy for Walter Scott's family, the man her son shot dead. I just can't,' Sharpe told ABC News. 'Maybe to some people, 'Well, you're being in denial,' but I'm sorry I just can't. I just - I know how Michael is.' She went on to say her son loved being an officer. 'I can't imagine him doing something, it's just not like him,' she said of the shooting. 'That's just not his character. It's not.' On Friday it was revealed that no warrant had been issued for Walter Scott's arrest when he ran from Officer Michael Slager moments before he was shot dead, it has been revealed. Court records show he was $7,500 behind on child support when he was pulled over on Saturday and had already been jailed three times for missing payments. His family believe the fear of being thrown back in prison was the reason he tried to flee during the deadly traffic stop. But there was nothing directing officers to bring him in to face a family court judge, despite the fact his last payment was only in 2012. Escape: Dashcam footage released on Thursday shows Walter Scott running away from his car minutes before he is shot dead by Officer Michael Sager. His family believed he fled over fears he would be arrested for being behind on child support payments . History: Scott had already been jailed three times over missed payments, but court records have revealed there was no warrant out for his arrest when he was pulled over. Minutes later he was shot dead . In 2008, after a traffic stop in which he was charged with an open-container violation and driving under suspension, he was sent to jail in Charleston for six months for failing to pay about $6,800. In 2011, bench warrants ordered deputies to bring him in, and Scott spent a night in jail when he was $7,500 behind. In 2012, he spent another night in jail when he owed $3,500. On Thursday a police dashboard camera video released Thursday shows Scott bolting from his Mercedes after he pulled over. The camera on Slager's patrol car captures him telling Scott his third brake light is broken, before asking him to produce insurance papers. Scott, who appears to be accompanied by a person in the passenger seat, explains he does not have any documents as he has yet to officially buy the car. 'I haven't bought it yet, I'm about to do that Monday.... My car is down,' he says. Horrifying: Scott was gunned down as he ran away from Sager, who has since been charged with his murder . The officer appears calm, checks his licence, then tells him: 'I'll be right back with you.' When Slager returns to his vehicle, Scott flees, running towards the park where he would die moments later. Off camera, a scuffle can be heard, with shouts of 'Taser, Taser, Taser!' and 'Get on the ground!' Slager's account has been called into question after a shocking video taken by a witness shows the officer shooting Scott in the back. In the dash cam footage, captured from Slager's patrol car, the officer explains, 'The reason I've pulled you over is because your third brakelight is out.' The conversation is muffled, with music playing in Slager's car obscuring the sound. He can be heard asking Scott for his licence, registration and insurance card. Scott responds that he doesn't have papers as he has not yet to bought the car. 'Alright let me see your licence,' Slager replies. 'So you don't have any papers in the glove pocket?' Scott repeats that he does not and he is paying for the car on Monday. Slager returns to his car. A minute later, Scott opens the door, and gestures to Slager, who shouts, 'you've got to stay in the car!' Scott then sits back inside the car - and moments later flees. The only other footage of the incident shows the moment Scott was shot. Released earlier this week, it begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.","Officer Michael Slager is being held at Charleston County jail .

"While every aspiring actor dreams of Hollywood stardom, an A-list career doesn't always show up. For actors hovering somewhere between the big time and the dole queue, there is the comforting world of the British soap opera, where stars are guaranteed regular work and a spot in the nation's living room three times a week. If long-running series such as EastEnders, Coronation Street and Emmerdale have been a launchpad for many an acting career, it's also provided a safe haven for those looking to side-step from a different career or reinvigorate their public profile. Scroll down for video . Gracing the cobbles: After first achieving fame with Girls Aloud, Sarah Harding has turned her hand to acting, signing up to appear in four episodes of Coronation Street . Walford-bound: Denise Van Outen is the latest big name to sign for EastEnders. The former Chicago star has admitted that she's turned down the offer twice before . This week saw some big-name announcements in the land of soap, with former Girls Aloud star Sarah Harding announcing that she's putting her pop career on hold to star in at least four episodes of Coronation Street. A Street insider told the Mirror: 'We're delighted to land Sarah - her character has real potential. 'She will prove a real trouble-making fly-in-the-ointment - especially for Tracy Barlow. At the other end of the soap map, Denise Van Outen will soon be seen charging through Albert Square; the actress is to play Max Branning's new love interest, Carin Smart, in the long-running series. Mum-of-one Denise admitted that she'd previously turned down offers from the soap, firstly because of other work commitments and then because she was a new mum and didn't want the often gruelling schedule that comes with a soap contract. Sarah and Denise aren't the only names to sign on the dotted line for soaps at an interesting stage in their careers. Two days ago, celebrated stage actress and 70s child star Bonnie Langford announced that she will also take a new role in EastEnders, playing the role of Carmel Kazemi. We know lots about the stars who've carved out successful careers after leaving soap operas; Kylie, Anna Friel, Guy Pearce, Sarah Lancashire, Joanna Lumley and even Jude Law... but there's also a growing list of faces who you might not have expected to see mucking out the stables in Emmerdale or pulling a pint behind the Queen Vic. Let us explain. A  healthy career (left, pictured in The Football Factory) wasn't helped by comments Dyer made about the September 11th terror attacks and some dubious remarks in a lad's mag. When Eastenders came knocking in 2013, he promptly signed up and hasn't looked back (pictured right with co-star Barbara Windsor) DANNY DYER . London actor Dyer was seen as a big-name signing when he agreed to play Mick Carter, a new landlord at the Queen Vic in EastEnders. After starring in films such as Human Traffic and The Football Factory, the actor had seen his career soar and was even cast by leading English playwright Harold Pinter in two of his plays and then took a starring role in an adaptation of another, The Homecoming, in 2008. His famously loose tongue saw Dyer's popularity plummet somewhat though after he made controversial comments about the 9/11 terror attacks and offered some dubious advice in lad's mag Zoo. The star turned down the offer of EastEnders in 2009 but after finally accepting in 2013 hasn't looked back. The cockney rebel even bagged  the Serial Drama Performance award at the National Television Awards earlier this year. More Met Bar than the Yorkshire Moors...but Patsy Kensit made a huge success of her stint in Emmerdale, playing superbitch Sadie King . PATSY KENSIT . The Yorkshire moors might have been the last place that you'd expect to find Patsy Kensit but in 2004, the actress announced that she'd been tempted north by the role of soap villain Sadie King. Despite a glamourous life that had seen marriages to rock stars Dan Donovan, Jim Kerr and Liam Gallagher and a set of celebrity friends, Patsy was anything but afraid of heading to the countryside to get her acting career back on track. She later said of the role: 'The one great thing about being an actress is I love playing different characters and I was really blessed with Sadie King.' 'She was this total bitch and the writing was incredible. I worked with a brilliant cast and I learnt so much from them. I loved it.' Actress Michelle Collins left EastEnders in 1998 after a decade of playing Cindy Beale...only to make the leap to rival soap Coronation Street after a period of stage and screen work in 2011 . MICHELLE COLLINS . For ten years, Michelle Collins caused chaos in Albert Square as evil Cindy Beale. When she was written out in 1998, a series of high profile drama roles followed including Two Thousand Acres of Sky, The Sleeper and Daylight Robbery. The lure of soapland proved too strong though and by 2011, Michelle had ditched less reliable stage and screen work in favour of a regular spot on rival soap Coronation Street. Playing the landlady of the Rovers Return, Michelle stayed until 2014 when she left amid rumours that she was unhappy with the lack of screen time that her character was being afforded. The Carry On films ensured Barbara Windsor was a household name but her career was reborn when she was cast alongside Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp in Eastenders in 1994 . BARBARA WINDSOR . In possibly the most perfect piece of casting ever performed in soapland, EastEnders snapped up national treasure Barbara Windsor just as her star was fading. The actress, made famous for her saucy antics in the Carry On films, had seen bigger theatrical roles all up but dry up by the time EastEnders tapped on her agent's door. Peggy Mitchell was born and Barbara was the perfect foil to rugged eggheads Grant and Phil Mitchell. The actress stayed in the role for sixteen years, signing in 1994 and leaving in 2010. Now elevated to soap royalty, she's contracted to appear in one episode a year. EastEnders put Barbara back in the spotlight and other roles followed; next year she is set to reprise the role of Dormouse in Tim Burton's sequel to his 2010 Alice in Wonderland film. A love affair with the soaps: Daniella Westbrook, who has admitted to having a tough year and was even spotted working in a friend's pub, will soon return to the set of Channel 4's Hollyoaks . DANIELLA WESTBROOK . After much publicised struggles with sobriety, Danniella Westbrook is heading back to her soap roots, after recently informing fans that she plans to return to Hollyoaks. The star confirmed her return as former jailbird Trudy Ryan on the Channel 4 show, bringing to an end a difficult 12-month period during which she lost her family home and returned to rehab. Daniella, who was cast as Peggy Mitchell's daughter Sam in EastEnders when she was just 16, famously battled a cocaine addiction which forced her septum, the bridge under the nose, to collapse. In recent years, the actress has appeared on reality television and even had a stint in Los Angeles but will be relieved to back in the bosom of British soap.","Sarah Harding and Denise Van Outen are the latest big-name signings to agree to contracts with British soap operas .

"Picture the scene: You come home after work feeling too exhausted to cook - only to find a delicious meal worthy of a Michelin-starred restaurant waiting for you. It sounds like a fantasy, but it could be about to come true thanks to a robot chef developed by British scientists. They have come up with a set of robotic arms so sophisticated that they are capable of cooking meals from scratch. Scroll down for video . New hospitality: British scientists spent almost 18 years developing the robotic 'chef' hands . Scientists at the Shadow Robot Company spent almost 18 years developing the hands, which are each governed by 24 motors, 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors. According to its creators, the arms can chop, stir, whisk and baste well enough to recreate almost anything you would care to eat, whether it is a simple home-cooked supper, or an elaborate concoction designed by a world-class chef. The hands move a little slowly, hovering strangely above the work surface whenever they are not busy, but they imitate human movements closely enough that they can do things such as wipe a spoon on the edge of a pan to prevent drips. The device will be sold from as early as 2017 as part of a purpose-built high-tech kitchen, priced at around £10,000 ($14,000), which includes an oven, hob, dishwasher and sink. Engineers at the Shadow Robot Company spent almost 18 years developing the hands, which are each governed by 24 motors, 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors. Working from a small workshop in Islington, North London, they used to sell a few dozen devices a year, primarily to other scientists who used them for their own research. Even Nasa is understood to have ordered a pair to ‘inspire’ its engineers. According to its creators, the arms can chop, stir, whisk and baste well enough to recreate almost anything you would care to eat, whether it is a simple home-cooked supper, or an elaborate concoction designed by a world-class chef. The hands move a little slowly, hovering strangely above the work surface whenever they are not busy, but they imitate human movements closely enough that they can do things such as wipe a spoon on the edge of a pan to prevent drips. But last year, after Russian engineer Mark Oleynik from Moley Robotics approached the team with the notion of turning the hands into an everyday household gadget, the concept of the robot chef was born. Kitchen revolution: A robot in the Robotic Kitchen prototype created by the Shadow Robot Company cooks a crab  soup at the company's booth at the world's largest industrial technology fair, the Hannover Messe . Working away: The robotic hands are each governed by 24 motors, 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors . Even if there are a few splatters, it shouldn’t matter - the gadget will load the dishwasher and wipe down the work surfaces afterwards. The arms will tuck up out of the way when not in use, making space for their owners to get their own hands dirty. Mr Oleynik, who is spearheading the project, said: ‘All the things which are possible with the hand are possible here. There is no limitation. The £10,000 ($14,000) device will be sold from as early as 2017 as part of a purpose-built high-tech kitchen which includes an oven, hob, dishwasher and sink . Bon appétit: Chef Tim Anderson checks crab soup prepared by the 'robot chef' at  the Hannover Messe, in Hanover earlier today . ‘A lot of people want to go to Michelin-starred restaurants, but they are quite expensive and may be quite far from the home. This is an opportunity for people to enjoy very good food, and for a reasonable price.’ The only cuisine that is off the robot’s menu at the moment is sushi, which requires exceedingly steady pressure and nimble fingers to make, but the team plan to conquer that as well by the time it goes on sale. By that point, they claim, users will be able to order meals from an iTunes-style library of recipes devised by professional chefs, making it possible to tuck into Michelin-standard food on a daily basis. People will also be able to train the robotic arms to cook their own favourite family recipes, by demonstrating them a few times while wearing high-tech gloves and wrist-bands. Users will be able to ‘order’ dinner on their way home, or breakfast for when they wake up, using an app on their smartphone, picking recipes depending on the ingredients they have in stock. They will also be able to choose dishes based on their nutritional content. And just in case, the unit has emergency equipment if there’s a fire.","British scientists invents robotic hands able to cook a meal from scratch .

"Microsoft has a new pilot program to hire people with autism for full-time positions within the company. The announcement was made on the company's blog by Microsoft Corporate VP of Worldwide Operations, Mary Ellen Smith, who has a teenage son, Shawn, with autism. The positions will be based at its Redmond campus in Washington and the program will be run in partnership with Specialisterne, a Danish nonprofit that helps train people with autism for careers in IT. Smith wrote on the blog: 'It's simple, Microsoft is stronger when we expand opportunity and we have a diverse workforce that represents our customers.' The announcement was made on the company's blog by Microsoft Corporate VP of Worldwide Operations, Mary Ellen Smith, who has a teenage son, Shawn, with autism . 'The day my son was diagnosed I distinctly remember the final words of two doctors I overheard as my husband and I left the medical center, ""I think they understand."" 'I also remember how we walked to the car, pulled onto the road, drove 15 miles to our home, and entered the house. All in silence. We did not know what to say. 'But we do now. What we learned over the last 15 years was to find our voice. To model what a unique advantage a young man like my son Shawn can offer. 'To think of where he is now, a college freshman and part-time employee, and where he has the potential to go, makes my husband and I so proud. The positions will be based at its Redmond campus in Washington and the program will be run in partnership with Specialisterne, a Danish nonprofit that helps train people with autism for careers in IT . She added: 'I am also proud of how our society and our workplace is moving forward with the commitment to help support people with autism and disabilities in general.' Last year Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was forced to apologize for saying that women don't need to ask for a raise and should just trust the system to pay them well. Nadella was blasted on Twitter and in blog posts for his comments, which were made at an event for women in computing. He had been asked to give his advice to women who are uncomfortable requesting a raise. His response: 'It's not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along.' Microsoft is now focusing on diversity. Last year Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (pictured) was forced to apologize for saying that women don't need to ask for a raise and should just trust the system to pay them well . Not asking for raise, he added, is 'good karma' that would help a boss realize that the employee could be trusted and should have more responsibility. Still, his comments at the event, the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, underscored why many see technology companies as workplaces that are difficult to navigate or even unfriendly for women and minorities. Tech companies, particularly the engineering ranks, are overwhelmingly male, white and Asian. Criticized for their lack of diversity, major companies say they are trying to address the problem with programs such as employee training sessions and by participating in initiatives meant to introduce girls to coding. Twenty-nine percent of Microsoft's employees are women, according to figures the company released last year. Its technical and engineering staff and its management are just 17 percent female. That's roughly comparable to diversity data released by other big tech companies last year. Commenting on Microsoft's decision Sarah Lambert, Head of Policy at the National Autistic Society, told Daily Mail Online: 'It's encouraging to see a global company like Microsoft recognise the untapped potential of adults with autism and we hope that other organisations follow their lead. 'Autism is a spectrum condition and many people may have strengths such as accuracy, a good eye for detail and reliability, which can benefit all sorts of businesses, not just the technology industry.'","Microsoft Corporate VP of Worldwide Operations, Mary Ellen Smith, who has a teenage son Shawn with autism, made the announcement .

"Two hitmen associates of a ‘Freddy Krueger’ killer who tried to gun down a rival during London’s bloodiest gang feud have been jailed for a total of 44 years today. Christopher Annan, 24, and Tyrone Wright, 20, took part in a gun attack on Tottenham Turks gang member Inan Eren. The 35-year-old victim, who survived, was ambushed as he arrived home on the evening of 30 December 2012, shot three times in the arm, stomach and buttock. The attack was led by hitman Jamie Marsh-Smith, 23, a fearsome hired gun who had earned the nickname ‘Freddy’ after the Nightmare on Elm Street killer. Jamie Marsh-Smith (left) known as 'Freddy' after the Nightmare on Elm Street character, executed gang boss Zafer Eren (right). He also took part in the attack on Eren's cousin Inan for which two men were jailed today . The deranged Freddy Krueger. Marsh-Smith got his nickname carrying out contract hits, including the failed one on Inan Eren on December 30, 2012 . He was locked up for at least 38 years in July last year for the attack on Mr Eren, the murder of crime boss Zafer Eren, and a botched attempt to kill his own getaway driver Samuel Zerei, 22. A jury at the Old Bailey this afternoon convicted Annan and Wright of attempted murder after a retrial. They both held their heads in their hands when the verdicts were announced, while cries of ‘they are innocent’ rung out from the public gallery. Judge John Bevan QC sentenced both men at 2.15pm. He blamed Wright’s parents as the two hitmen were jailed for the gun attack which has left victim Inan Eren permanently on crutches. Annan, the older of the pair, was jailed for 24 years with a five year period of extended licence. Wright, who was just 18 at the time of the shooting, was jailed for 20 years. ‘It gives me no pleasure whatsoever to have to sentence young men such as yourselves for serious gun crime of this kind’, said Judge Bevan. He said the ‘medieval turf war’ between the two Turkish families had now reached ‘epidemic proportions.’ ‘It’s high time the two families and their connections realise the manipulative and lawless behaviour will have consequences beyond the normal level of punishment,’ the judge added. ‘This was professional offending by a gang acting for profit as hitmen, of which Jamie Marsh-Smith was in charge and the leader.’ The judge said there had been 26 incidents in the drug war between the Tottenham Turks and the Hackney Turks since 2009, including 19 where guns were used. Annan was jailed for three-and-a-half years in 2006, when he was just 16, for stabbing a boy who had punched him. He was jailed for three years in 2008 for dealing crack cocaine and heroin, and was also convicted of possession of heroin in 2012. He was jailed for 38 years for the shooting of Inan Eren, the murder of his cousin and crime boss Zafer Eren and a botched attempt to kill his own getaway driver . Inan Eren had given evidence in court on crutches, and still has one of the bullets lodged in his body. He was gunned down by his front door as he desperately tried to get inside to escape the gunmen. ‘I accept he thought he was going to die, and he was shot in the presence of his wife and child’, said the judge. The judge added he could not be sure who the gunman was during the attack, but accepted Wright had played a lesser role as a junior member of the crew. Getaway driver Samuel Zerei was shot by Marsh-Smith because he feared he would ‘blabber . Annan, of Denham Road, Whetstone, was told he will serve at least two thirds of his 24 year sentence before being released. Wright, of Lea Bridge Road, Leyton, was told by Judge Bevan: ‘I feel sorry for you for the lack of parental discipline and guidance, which so many young men like you suffer.’ Relatives of the two men stood weeping outside the Old Bailey for over an hour after the pair were jailed. When jailing Marsh-Smith in July last year, Judge Bevan condemned both sides of the Turkish gang war that has claimed five lives since 2009. ‘The use of the streets of this city for the Turks to fight a medieval turf war over drug distribution, in this case using Afro-Caribbean males as hitmen, is as intolerable as it is unacceptable’, he said. Today’s verdicts are the latest chapter in a ‘bloody and lethal’ feud between the ‘Tottenham Turks’ and the ‘Hackney Turks’ criminal gangs in north London that has raged since 2009. In March 2009 innocent shopkeeper Ahmet Paytak, 50, was shot dead at Euro Food and Wines in Hornsey Road, Holloway, by Ricardo Dwyer, a hitman hired by the Hackney Turks. Dwyer, then 27, was jailed for 32 years in December 2013 for the attack, which seriously wounded Mr Paytak's son Huseyin, then 21. On October 2, 2009, Tottenham Turk member Oktay Erbasli was shot and killed while driving in Tottenham. Three days later the Tottenham Turks took revenge with the shooting of 21-year-old Cem Duzgun at a social club frequented by Hackney Turk members in Upper Clapton Road. The feud continued with the murder of Ali Armagan, 32, near Turnpike Lane tube station on February 1, 2012. Bungling hitman Ricardo Dwyer (left) shot dead innocent shopkeeper Ahmet Paytak, 50, in March 2009 at Euro Food and Wines in Hornsey Road, Holloway . Then on the evening of December 30, 2012, Marsh-Smith, Annan and Wright shot Inan Eren as he arrived home. When Mr Eren survived the attack, the target shifted to his cousin Zafer Eren, another leading member of the Tottenham Turks. At 7.20pm on April 18, 2013, Zafer was shot as he walked through the security gates to his home at Fontaine Court off Southgate High Street in north London. Marsh-Smith donned a V for Vendetta mask before firing seven shots from the pavement, three of which struck Mr Eren in the back. He then escaped in the back of a burgundy Peugeot 308 driven by Zerei. Four days after that attack, Marsh-Smith shot Zerei in Markfield Park, Tottenham because he feared he would ‘blabber’. Marsh-Smith, of Ennerdale House, Green Lanes, Manor House, north London, was convicted of murder and two counts of attempted murder. He was jailed for life with a minimum of 38 years. Zerei, of Hathersage Court, Newington Green, north London, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years. Marsh-Smith’s half brother, Wayne McNeish, 32, of West End Lane, West Hampstead, was jailed for four-and-a-half years in July for perverting the course of justice by helping Marsh-Smith to flee the country after the shootings.","Christopher Annan, 24, and Tyrone Wright, 20, jailed for attempted murder .

Last week South Korean prosecutors formally charged Kim Ki-Jong with attempted murder . The prosecutors' office in Seoul said Kim, was charged with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and obstruction of duty. Kim, 55, was a known maverick activist who had been handed a two-year suspended sentence in 2010 for hurling a rock at the then Japanese ambassador to Seoul. He has denied any intention to kill Lippert, but the prosecutors office said in a statement that the crime was clearly deliberate. 'There was an intention to murder because (Kim) used a lethal weapon in a pre-meditated crime to attack the ambassador's face and neck repeatedly,' it said. Kim has told investigators the ambassador was the 'symbolic' target of his opposition to annual US-South Korea joint military exercises, which he blames for blocking dialogue with North Korea. The annual drills have long been condemned by Pyongyang as rehearsals for invasion. Kim insisted he had acted alone and not on the orders of Pyongyang, but prosecutors said they were looking into whether he has violated the South's strict National Security Law banning any act seen as aiding North Korea or promoting its ideology. Investigators have ransacked Kim's home as part of an investigation into Kim's possible links with North Korea. Kim had visited the North seven times and once tried to erect a memorial in Seoul to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il after his death in 2011. North Korea has rejected accusations that it may have been behind the attack as a 'vicious' smear campaign by Seoul.

The young royal completed her look with a pair of Chelsea boots and carried her favourite Rebecca Minkoff quilted handbag for the second day in a row . On Wednesday, the Princess was seen out and about with a female friend rocking a similar urban chic outfit. At the end of last month, the young royal, who lives three and a half thousand miles away from her family in the UK, celebrated her 25th birthday. In the middle of a Palace function, her father, Prince Andrew, whipped out his iPad and used it to video call his daughter, who currently lives in Manhattan. The shop stocks trendy brands including Stella McCartney, Proenza Schouler, Missoni, J Brand and Chloe . If that wasn’t enough, the prince got his 400-strong audience in the State Apartments at St James’s Palace to sing a cheery rendition of Happy Birthday, accompanied by a trumpeter from the Scots Guards. The royal, who was hosting the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs, introduced the stunned audience to the singalong at St James’s Palace, saying: ‘We are going to do something new this evening. ‘The lady in the middle is my youngest daughter and it’s her 25th birthday today.’ Laughing Eugenie, wearing a pair of novelty birthday candle glasses to mark the occasion, and accompanied by her sister, Princess Beatrice, and mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, smiled and waved. Andrew told her: ‘You will notice that we have somebody here to play (gesturing to the trumpeter).’ He then turned to the lance corporal and added: ‘If you will lead us in Happy Birthday please...’ There were cheers from the crowd as the song came to an end, while plenty of others waved and tried to capture the moment on their camera phones. Eugenie looked delighted and said she was ‘very proud, Pops’ of her father’s role in the awards, which celebrate innovation and technology in the creative industries. But the singalong did not impress his ex-wife, who joked - in the style of a Eurovision announcement - that the rendition scored ‘zero points’. The Duke of York holds an iPad as he invites the audience at the Pitch@Palace event to sing happy birthday via FaceTime to his daughter Princess Eugenie . Sarah added: ‘We think you all need to go for choir practice.’ Andrew, however, was content with the gesture. ‘Having been told this was a bad idea, it worked,’ he said. The Prince, who used a Pitch@Palace event last year to send the first royal selfie, joked: ‘’What was it somebody said about children and dogs?’ The social media-savy Royal is also the only senior working royal to have his own personal Twitter account.

"Letting the Scottish Nationalists dictate the direction of the UK government would be like getting King Herod to 'run a baby farm', Boris Johnson warned today in an escalation of Tory attacks on the SNP. The Tory London Mayor warned against allowing Nicola Sturgeon's SNP to dominate the government of the UK, 'an entity that they are sworn to destroy'. He likened it to 'asking a fox to look after the henhouse or a temperance campaigner to run a brewery'. Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson warned against allowing Nicola Sturgeon's SNP to dominate the government of the UK 'an entity that they are sworn to destroy' Ms Sturgeon launched her SNP manifesto today, boasting that she can 'lead the UK' with polices on British foreign policy, benefits, energy bills and English university tuition fees. The SNP leader vowed to use a surge in support for her party to dictate the direction of the UK government, calling for an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Ed Miliband would have to pay for propping up a weak Labour government. Ms Sturgeon set out a 'programme for delivery on a UK-wide basis', raising the prospect of Scottish nationalist MPs calling the shots on policies which apply only in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Polls suggest up to half of Scots are planning to vote SNP, handing the party dozens of seats and leaving Labour's Ed Miliband unable to secure a majority. The SNP has claimed that it will be 'entitled to vote against any bit of legislation' and 'any bit of spending' it does not agree with. Mr Johnson, who is expected to play a more high profile role in the Tory campaign from this week, issued a blunt warning about allowing an anti-Union party to dictate policy in Westminster. 'You wouldn't get Herod to run a baby farm, would you?,' he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. 'It would not normally occur to you to interview a convicted jewel thief for the post of custodian of the Tower of London. 'You would not dream of asking a fox to look after the henhouse or a temperance campaigner to run a brewery or Attila the Hun to work as a doorkeeper for the Roman senate. 'Any such course of action would be totally nuts. So can someone tell me why in the name of all that is holy there are some apparently rational people who are even contemplating the elevation of the Scottish Nationalist Party to a position of effective dominance in the government of the United Kingdom - an entity that they are sworn to destroy?' He said the SNP want to 'end Britain, to decapitate Britannia' but Mr Miliband has no chance of entering Number 10 without their support. Nicola Sturgeon today demanded an end to austerity as the price for propping up a Labour government in what was quickly dubbed a £140billion 'ransom note' for Britain . The SNP want higher taxes, to scrap Trident and end efforts to reform the welfare system, Mr Johnson warned. Mr Miliband will be left 'sitting in the driving seat, pretending to be steering the car - but all the time he will have clever Nicola next to him, whispering in his ear, and perpetually yanking the steering wheel to the Left'. Speaking at her manifesto launch, Ms Sturgeon said she had not 'heard the comments of Boris Johnson directly'. But speaking at the SNP manifesto launch, she said: 'If he did say that, then that is an entirely offensive comment, and I think it will be treated as that not just by people in Scotland but across the UK, who, in my experience, ordinary people the length and breadth of the UK do not see Scotland that way at all and do not see the SNP in that way at all.' However, the warning was echoed by David Cameron today, in a speech setting out the risks to England, Wales and Northern Ireland if the Scottish Nationalists are calling the shots. The Prime Minister yesterday suggested key services like roads and hospitals in the rest of the UK would suffer as a price of SNP support. ''This would be the first time on our history that a group of nationalists from one part of our country would be involved in altering the direction of the government of our country. I think that is a frightening prospect,' he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show. 'People thinking in their own constituencies, is that bypass going to be built, will my hospital get the money it needs? Frankly this is a group of people that wouldn't care about what happened in the rest of the country. 'The rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Northern Ireland, wouldn't get a look-in. 'That is the prospect we face if we don't get the majority Conservative government that is in our reach.'","London Mayor warns the SNP want to 'end Britain, to decapitate Britannia'

"Firefighters tackling a huge blaze at an Oxford hotel saved a couple’s wedding when they salvaged their rings and the bride’s dress from the charred building yesterday. Lauren Halliday and Steven Smith feared they would have to get married in their jeans after they were evacuated from the Randolph Hotel on Friday. The ceremony went ahead at St Edmund Hall in the city. Eighty guests fled the fire at the 119-bedroom hotel, which featured in TV’s Inspector Morse. No one was hurt. Eighty guests fled the fire at the 119-bedroom hotel, which featured in TV’s Inspector Morse. No one was hurt . Seventy firefighters fought the blaze and the damage was expected to run into hundreds of thousands of pounds. The extent of the damage to the Grade II listed Victorian building remains unclear but aerial pictures of the scene showed gaps in the roof and exposed beams. The five-star hotel, run by the Macdonald chain, includes the Morse Bar, named after being used as a frequent setting for many scenes where Morse and Lewis deliberated on complex cases. Cast and crew also stayed there while filming the detective drama. The Morse Bar has featured in episodes of the follow-on TV series, Lewis, too. Seventy firefighters fought the blaze and the damage was expected to run into hundreds of thousands of pounds . Roads were closed around the hotel as fire crews fought to stop the flames spreading, while its staff and guests were evacuated. Eyewitness Anabel Bacon, who was on the roof terrace of the Ashmolean Museum opposite the imposing, gothic hotel, said there was an initial plume of smoke, which stopped very quickly - but “all of a sudden it resumed again with just as much force”. She said: ‘The fire service was there very quickly after the second plume erupted, within five minutes. Everyone was surprised… no one knew what was going on.’ The fire's cause is not known and the extent of the damage to the Grade II listed building remains unclear .

"Northern Ireland's tourism board is hitting back at actor Kit Harington after the Game of Thrones heartthrob cracked a few jokes at the expense of its capital city. Harington, who plays the character Jon Snow, poked fun at Belfast and tourism bosses when he appeared on a late-night chat show to promote the HBO series’ return to TV screens. The 28-year-old Londoner joked to host Seth Myers that Belfast is ‘wonderful for two or three days’ and emphasized that he has spent five years filming in the city, drawing laughter from a studio audience. Scroll down for video . Game of Thrones star Kit Harington told host Seth Myers that Belfast is 'wonderful for two or three days' Northern Ireland is a principal filming location for Game of Thrones, which has a studio in Belfast, and fans travel from all corners of the world to visit beauty spots where scenes are shot. Tourism bosses have leveraged the show’s popularity to draw visitors and they said it has helped Belfast to become one of the most popular city break destinations in the UK. In a brief exchange on Monday night’s show Myers, host of Late Night with Seth Myers, which airs on NBC in the US, pointed out that Game of Thrones films in ‘a lot of incredible locations’, including Croatia and Spain. He added: ‘Your part isn’t in the nice places. What would you say to the traveller going to Belfast, or the tourist going to Belfast?’ The Londoner plays the character Jon Snow on the HBO programme, which is set to return for a fifth series . Harington said: ‘It’s wonderful for two or three days.’ Myers said: ‘And you’ve been there for years?’ Drawing more laughter from the audience, Harington replied: ‘Five years. No, I have to be careful about what I say.’ Harington added: ‘They’ve got a wonderful tourist board. They celebrate three things, which is having the most bombed hotel in Europe, which is great … and they built the Titanic, which is a ship that sunk on its maiden voyage and now they have Game of Thrones, the most depressing TV show in history. So it’s a wonderful, depressing tourist board.’ Host Seth Myers didn't include Belfast when he identified Game of Thrones' 'incredible' filming locations . Harington, appearing on Late Night with Seth Myers, said Belfast has a 'wonderful, depressing' tourism board . In response to the interview a Tourism Northern Ireland spokeswoman said the filming of Game of Thrones as a ‘key asset and a key area for growth in Northern Ireland.’ The spokeswoman told MailOnline Travel: 'Belfast and Northern Ireland is recognised as a great short break destination. 'Belfast was recently voted, for a fourth consecutive year by TripAdvisor, as one of the UK’s top 10 best destinations among travellers from around the world. 'In recent years significant investment into our tourism infrastructure has created unique visitor experiences. This includes Titanic Belfast which was recently named Europe’s number one visitor attraction and since it’s opening in 2012 has exceeded visitor number expectations, attracting over two million visitors from across 145 countries.' Tourism bosses said Titanic Belfast has attracted more than two million visitors from 145 countries . The Dark Hedges in Country Antrim is one of the most recognisable filming locations from Game of Thrones . Belfast was named the seventh best city break in the UK in this year’s TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice Awards. A spokeswoman for Visit Belfast added: ‘The success of big budget film and TV productions locating to Northern Ireland has provided the tourism industry with a unique and priceless opportunity to promote both our city and our spectacular rural setting to a truly global audience. ‘Belfast’s Titanic story and the filming of Game of Thrones at stunning sites across Northern Ireland have provided a powerful combination in attracting growing numbers to both Belfast and Northern Ireland over recent years. ‘Just as Titanic Belfast has become the city’s most popular visitor attraction, Game of Thrones, in its success, has created a demand for a growing number of tourism enterprises from bus tours, walking trails to activities such as archery and banquets. ‘All these complement the range of attractions, activities and events, great food and hospitality that Belfast and Northern Ireland already offers the short break visitor.’ Harington isn’t the first person affiliated with Game of Thrones to stir up controversy with comments about Belfast. Last year HBO’s president of programming, Michael Lombardo, apologised after he told US magazine Vulture that the show’s producers were struggling to adapt to life there. He said: 'It's a little bit of a personal challenge I don't think they contemplated when we initially found our location in Belfast, what that meant for them personally… Belfast is not the most cosmopolitan of cities to spend half of the year.' He added: 'I don't think they have a hard time, but the good news is work keeps them busy, let's just say that.'","Actor Kit Harington made the comments on Late Night with Seth Myers .

"Just 13 and in the grip of a terrifying obsession surviving on just one piece of fruit a day, anorexic schoolgirl Laura Scurr's body started to shut down. The 15-year-old, from Whitley Bay, was left on a heart machine after she collapsed through starvation but has now spoken about pressures put on teenagers to be a 'size zero'. Laura became so obsessed with having the perfect figure she would hide food down the side of her bed, lying to her mother about eating and sometimes surviving on just a piece of fruit a day. Scroll down for video . Laura Scurr, 15, has spoken out about the pressures on young girls to be a size zero after, having becoming obsessed with her own weight, she developed anorexia . But her dramatic weight loss led to horrific consequences when she suddenly collapsed at her family home and was rushed to intensive care. Laura has spoken about her two-year fight with anorexia and revealed the pressures she felt to be thin. She said: 'At the worst point I was hiding food down the sides of the settee or beds, lying to my mum about having meals, and eating about 100 calories a day. 'I would even try to have mashed potato with each meal so I could hide the rest of the food under it, that way it looked like I'd ate more.' After spending a week on a heart monitor at North Tyneside General Hospital, Laura was finally offered support from eating disorder organisations as she began her recovery. Problems started for the teen two years ago when she decided she wanted to go on a diet. 'I was nearly 13 stone and felt like I was too big,' Laura said. 'I'd been bullied a little bit because of my weight, people saying things like 'here comes the whale' and that made me feel horrible. Laura was living off just one piece of fruit a day and would hide her food down the side of her bed so her parents wouldn't see it . Laura continued: 'I would look around at the other girls and they all seemed to be skinny and, of course, I wanted to be like them and fit into all the different types of clothes. 'But it wasn't just people I knew. I felt there was a lot of pressures from all over the place. Everywhere you looked there seemed to be this idea that girls should be a size zero.' Laura agreed with mum Sue, 48, to go on a 'sensible diet' but soon the Whitley Bay High School pupil became frustrated, wanting to lose more weight, quicker. According to the NHS Anorexia or Anorexia nervosa, to give its full name, is a serious mental health condition in which people try to keep their body weight as low as possible. It is often said that people will often restrict their intake of food, make themselves vomit or increase the amount of exercise they are doing. The condition often develops in people who are anxious about their body shape or weight, or in those who fear being fat or wish to be thin. Anorexia most commonly occurs in women, starting around the age of 16 or 17. Although there are cases of men suffering from the disease too. Often people suffering from anorexia will obsessively count calories, take laxatives and repeatedly weight themselves or check their bodies in the mirror. If you think you know someone who is suffering from the disease talk to them gently about it. Often it can be hard for them to seek help. You can also seek advice from an eating disorder charity such as Beat, who will be able to talk you through how to help them and how to handle the situation. In February 2015 it was estimated that around 725,000 people were suffering from an eating disorder in the UK - 10 per cent of those were suffering from anorexia. 'It was coming off quite slowly, at about 2lbs a week,' said Laura. 'But I became much more obsessive about it and decided to reduce my calorie intake. 'In the end, I was virtually eating nothing, maybe an apple or orange a day. 'I could tell my parents were getting worried, they couldn't understand why I didn't want to eat.' Lack of food soon took its toll on Laura's health and her heart rate started slowing. She said: 'I was in bed for three or four days, never going out of the house. 'I would feel dizzy or pass out because my heart rate was so slow.' Finally after a week of eating virtually nothing, Laura collapsed. No happy and healthy Laura has made it to the semi final of Miss Teen GB, the competition aims to stay away from size zero stereotypes . Sue, who works in sales, said: 'An ambulance was called and she was taken to hospital and put on the heart monitor for a week. Her body had just started to shut down. 'It was frightening, I was shocked that this was happening to my daughter. 'I remember sitting by her hospital bed and saying ""Laura, do you realise how sick you are?"" but she just said ""I don't care, as long as I'm skinny"". 'It was then I realised just how much pressure she, and all girls, were under to look a certain way.' After getting discharged Laura began working with eating disorder teams (EDICT) and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to help in her recovery. Today, her body image is better than ever and her new-found confidence has allowed her to make it through to the semi final of Miss Teen GB. The contest aims to promote 'positive and confidence-building experiences' for young girls, away from size zero stereotypes.","At 13, Laura Scurr went on a diet which would turn into a scary obsession .

"Two children have been killed in what police are calling an accidental vehicle fire at a Las Vegas apartment complex. Investigators say four children were playing in and around a parked minivan Saturday evening at the Arcadia Palms on East Sahara Avenue  when one of them unintentionally set a fire inside. Two of the children managed to escape unharmed and quickly requested help. The other two children became trapped and were found dead inside after the fire was put out. Two young children have died after a minivan they were playing in on the parking lot of the Arcadia Palms apartment complex in Las Vegas caught fire and exploded (police scene pictured) Police say it appears the 6pm fire was unintentional and accidental, and no criminal charges are expected because of the age of the child who started the fire. The names and ages of the children as well as the cause of the fire were not immediately released. Kelvin Young, 29, a resident of the complex, told the Las Vegas Review Journal he went toward the burning vehicle after he saw a plume of smoke. Shortly after, he described hearing a woman shout 'My baby!' and 'My nephew!' Another resident told KLAS-TV that a woman, believed to be one of the boy's mother, was taken to hospital shortly after the incident and described hearing a huge explosion. They said authorities informed them the pair were related. Residents at the apartment complex say they heard a huge explosion followed by a massive plume of smoke .

"Hillary Clinton’s now-famous Scooby Doo van made an appearance in Council Bluffs, Iowa on Thursday for a closed-door meeting with state Democratic Party officials – and it idled in a handicapped parking space from beginning to end. Footage broadcast by KETV-7 in the nearby city of Omaha, Nebraska, showed the presidential nominee emerging from a cafe, greeting onlookers and walking past the blue handicapped-parking sign to climb into the vehicle. Secret Service agents are technically federal law enforcement officers, so there was no chance of a parking ticket, even if Scooby had been left unattended. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS .

KETV trailed Clinton to the Main Street Cafe in Council Bluffs, and spoke to Pottawattamie County Democratic Chairwoman Linda Nelson. The cafe meeting was so secret, Nelson told the station, that everyone in the room was told to hand over their cell phones and cameras before it began. The Secret Service typically does not comment on security arrangements for dignitaries. Mrs. Clinton has round-the-clock protection, including a van chauffeur, because she is the wife of a former U.S. president, Bill Clinton. On Wednesday near Des Moines, Iowa, Daily Mail Online trailed Clinton's motorcade. The phalanx of 7 cars included a second 'Scooby'-mobile outfitted to look identical to the one Clinton was riding in.

"Hollywood producer and studio executive Harvey Weinstein will not face criminal charges despite the groping allegations made against him by a former Miss Italy finalist. Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police Weinstein groped her during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca Film Center office in Manhattan on March 27. Battilana claimed the 63-year-old father of five asked if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt. Scroll down for video . The Manhattan District Attorney concluded a criminal charge against Harvey Weinstein is 'not supported' Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police the Hollywood producer groped her in his office on March 27 . Battilana refused to cooperate with authorities for four days after making the allegation against Weinstein . The Manhattan District Attorney's office investigated the Italian model's claim, but has decided not to prosecute Weinstein, the New York Post reported. Battilana is a former Miss Italy finalist . District attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero said on Friday: 'This case was taken seriously from the outset, with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit. 'After analyzing the available evidence, including multiple interviews with both parties, a criminal charge is not supported.' Weinstein, who always maintained his innocence, could have faced misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations proved true. Battilana refused to cooperate with authorities for four days after lodging the complaint against Weinstein. The delay led to speculation Battilana made the groping allegation in a bid to try and land a part in one of Weinstein's films. Once that 'pipe dream' came to nothing, she decided to cooperate and pursue the criminal case, according to sources. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, founded Miramax with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. They have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004.

"A South African writer has claimed Australia is more racist than her homeland - where segregation by skin colour used to be law. While she originally called South Africa home, Sisonke Msimang, 41, moved to Australia with her husband and children in the last few months. As a journalist and an activist, she has spent years writing about and commenting on human rights, race relations and government accountability in South Africa, including a stint working for the United Nations. However, upon relocating she said she's been faced with the realisation, that much like her native South Africa: ‘The deepest and most abiding forms of racism’ in Australia are directed toward our own indigenous population. 'A lot of the people I speak with say ‘I just treat you as a human, I don’t see race’ but they have to remember that people have different experiences because of their race everyday' ‘When I say something or someone is racist, it’s not meant to be the worst insult in the world, people really get their backs up and this has only made the conversation about race so immature,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I think the racist element [in Australia] lies in the difficulty in grappling with past and present. There is a reluctance to admit and accept that this country, like the U.S. or Canada, has deep seeded race issues.' While protests about Islam infiltrating Australia have dominated the media, Ms Msimang said she started to recognise a systematic approach to 'assimilate’ and 'eradicate' Australia’s Indigenous heritage, simply by denying that Aboriginal Australian's have different needs to white Australians. 'A lot of the people I speak with say ‘I just treat you as a human, I don’t see race’ but they have to remember that people have different experiences because of their race everyday,' Ms Msimang told Daily Mail Australia. While protests about Islam infiltrating Australia have dominated the media, Ms Msimang said she started to recognise a systematic approach to 'assimilate’ and 'eradicate' Australia’s Indigenous heritage, simply by denying that Aboriginal Australian's have different needs than white Australians. ‘We are all committed to building a better Australia by talking about principals that we hold dear, one of which is the entitlement to a fair go, however at the same time people don't realise that people of colour don’t always have a fair go.' Ms Msimang said we can only reach level footing by recognising that difference isn't always a bad thing. She beleives while we continue to ‘treat everyone exactly the same’ we'll only further deny how race affects those with different values. In her article  Ms Msimang said the Australian government employed tactics of ‘trickery, disposition and violence’ that are ‘as ugly as you’ll find anywhere in the world’. ‘Aboriginal people are over-represented in the criminal justice system, and have health and educational outcomes that – if they were taken alone – would make Australia look like a developing country,’ she wrote. Ms Msimang slammed Prime Minster Tony Abbott for his 'out of touch' comments that claim Australia could no longer ‘subsidize lifestyle choices if those lifestyle choices are not conducive to the kind of full participation in Australian society that everyone should have.’ She condemned the federal government’s plans to cut funding for ‘remote’ communities in June this year that could lead to the closure of around 150 rural communities predominately populated by Aboriginals. Ms Msimang slammed Prime Minster Tony Abbott for his 'out of touch' comments that claim Australia could no longer ‘subsidize lifestyle choices if those lifestyle choices are not conducive to the kind of full participation in Australian society that everyone should have.’ ‘Tony Abbott is the poster child for foot in mouth and it’s not really surprising that he would make a racist statement and not apologise for it,’ Ms Mismang told Daily Mail Australia. She said Aboriginal people don't make a 'lifestyle choice' to live on the land, instead, it's their connection with country that's meant they've stayed there and the fact that such plans could be even contemplated speaks to a ‘far larger problems in this country.’ In Ms Msimang’s eyes, forcing Indigenous communities who have an innate ‘connection to country’ to leave their homes and ‘assimilate’ into normal ‘civilised’ society mirrors our gruesome history where children were systematically torn from their families and ‘taught the ways of white society.’ In Ms Mismng’s eyes, forcing Indigenous communities who have an innate ‘connection to country’ to leave their homes and ‘assimilate’ into normal ‘civilised’ society mirrors our gruesome history where children were systematically torn from their families and ‘taught the ways of white society.’ ‘Right now the conversation in Australia exists in the past which only allows people to say ‘oh, they need to get over it, we used to be racist but we aren’t anymore' While Ms Msimng made note that these ‘startling’ practices are all too similar to those implemented during South Africa’s apartheid, she maintains South Africa has started to move forward by recognising race difference where Australia continues to deny the issue. ‘Right now the conversation in Australia exists in the past which only allows people to say ‘'oh, they need to get over it, we used to be racist but we aren’t anymore'',' she said. Ms Msimng thinks we need to start thinking about reconciliation in a more 'balanced' way that accurately recognises history and difference. ‘In my country it is incredible how far admission of guilt has gotten people. For many, the beginning of building better race relations is saying ‘yes I have benefited from a system that has been really crappy for you and your people'.’ Black South Africans are pictured burning the passbooks they were forced to carry which stopped them accessing white only areas during the apartheid . ‘The issue for aboriginal people is that they're still such a minority and that makes it hard for them to define the terms of the conversation.’ She said Australian's need to ‘lance the wound’ so they can have conversations based on honesty rather than 'fake kindness’ ‘Australian’s are the nicest racists I have ever met but you have to realise we [black people] are not going to break if we start to have real conversations about difference. In fact, it will only make us stronger.’ South Africa’s apartheid illustrates a dark history of  institutionalised racial discrimination that was enforced between 1948 and 1994. The controversial race laws touched on every major aspect of life including, prohibition of marriage between non-whites and whites, the sanctioning of ‘white only’ areas, the banning of political protest and the classification of all South Africans as either white, black or mixed. All coloured people were required to carry ‘passbooks’ that contained a photo, fingerprints and information on accessing ‘non-white’ areas. Non-compliance with race laws were dealt with harshly including fines, whipping and imprisonment. Notably in 1960, a large group of South Africans refused to carry their passes and the government responded by declaring a state of emergency that lasted for 156 days, leaving 69 dead and 187 wounded. ‘Australian’s are the nicest racists I have ever met but you have to realise we [black people] are not going to break if we start to have real conversations about difference. In fact, it will only make us stronger.’","Writer Sisonke Msimang said Australians are being racist by denying there are no differences between races .

"The family of one of the five men arrested as part of massive anti-terrorism raids in Melbourne were warned by police the group were falling victim to Islamic State recruiters. Ahead of the arrests that stopped an alleged terrorist attack planned for Anzac Day, ASIO contacted the families of some of the would-be killers and cautioned them the men were becoming radicalised. The family of one suspect said they were last year told to stop their son communicating with the extremist recruiter, who groomed Melbourne terrorist Numan Haider, according to News Corp. Scroll down for video . Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday afternoon . Search warrants were obtained by police for the south-east Melbourne homes of Sevdet Ramadan Besim, 18, Eathan Oswald Almo Cruse, 19,  Ismail Safi, 19, and Mehran Azami, 18, and another man who cannot be identified. Besim lived in Hallam and Cruse was from Eumemmerring, while Safi and Azami hailed from Narre Warren. Police said  the threat was 'fully contained'. It is alleged there was a plan in place to attack police and members of the public with swords and knives, which forced police to act. Sevdet Besim was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' and appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court. He did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody for a filing hearing on April 24. Multiple photos of Mr Besim on his social media pages show him posing with one raised index finger, a symbol that other ISIS supporters have also frequently used . Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said the 18-year-old men, from Hallam and Hampton Park, were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider, the 18-year-old who was shot dead after stabbing two officers outside a Melbourne police station on September 23. He is one of two 18-year-old men police arrested for allegedly planning an 'ISIS inspired' attack on an Anzac Day ceremony. The duo were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (pictured) The second teenager is still being interviewed by police who plan to charge him with a number of offences related to preparing for and planning terrorist acts and possessing prohibited items. A number of 'edged weapons' - including knives and swords - were seized at some of the properties searched. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews dubbed the plans 'simply evil' on Saturday morning, while insisting the individuals 'do not represent any faith, culture or religion'. 'It is alleged both men were undertaking preparations for a terrorist attack at an Anzac Day activity in Melbourne which included targeting police officers,' Australian Federal Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Neil Gaughan said on Saturday morning. Commissioner Patton later added: 'Some evidence that was collected at a couple of the scenes and some other information we have, leads us to believe that this particular matter was ISIS-inspired.' A total of five teenagers were arrested as part of the Melbourne Joint Counter Terrorism Team operation named Operation Rising, which saw 200 officers' raid seven properties on Saturday morning. Three of the men were released by Victoria Police on Saturday evening. But, according to Australian Federal Police Acting Commissioner Michael Phelan, all five had been on the radar of counter-terrorism investigators. 'Particularly since late last month the investigation ramped up and it became very obvious to us that their plans were specific,' he told reporters in Sydney. 'We received information earlier this week that led us to undertake the resolution today. Mr Patton added investigations had begun last month. The teen was interviewed by police all morning before travelling to the Magistrates Court where he was charged . Mr Besim did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody for a filing hearing on April 24 .

Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton (pictured) later added that evidence 'collected at a couple of the scenes and some other information we have leads us to believe that this particular matter was ISIS-inspired' Three other men, also aged 18 and 19, were arrested separately in Narre Warren.

One 18-year-old man from Narre Warren was charged with weapon offences, while the two others men from the same suburb, aged 18 and 19, are currently in custody assisting police with enquiries (stock image) It is understood police chose to execute the search warrants immediately as they 'couldn't be sure that they [the arrested men] wouldn't act earlier'. An 18-year-old man, from Hampton Park, is also expected to be charged with offences relating to preparing for a terrorist act and remains in custody. The three other men were released after being questioned for most of Saturday. It is expected one of them - a third 18-year-old - from Narre Warren will be charged on summons with weapons offences. The two other Narre Warren men, aged 18 and 19, have been released pending further enquiries. 'I think the entire Australian community should be concerned about the young age of these men, this issue is not just for law enforcements agencies, but the broader community,' Mr Patton said. 'We need intervention strategies to make sure they [young adults] don't go down this path.' Mr Patton confirmed that the arrested teens were not related, but were 'associates' and some had attended the Al Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale. Mr Patton confirmed that the arrested teens were not related, but were 'associates' and that some had attended the Al Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale . Mr Patton said police would charge the two teens with a number of offences including the possession of prohibited items, adding that 'edged weapons' were found at one property (stock images) Mr Haider, whose body is pictured being taken to the coroner for examination, died when he was shot by officers after stabbing two policemen outside a Melbourne police station on September 23 . But he insisted the 'the individuals were acting by themselves and are not representative of any religious, cultural or national group'. Three of the teenagers are believed to have suffered minor injuries during the arrests and were taken for medical examination, with one man reported to have suffered a head injury. Searches continued at several addresses throughout Saturday. Police said the investigations were ongoing. Residents living next door to the homes that were raided in the early hours of the morning have described waking to glass smashing, screams and 'fire-cracker like' noises before seeing lights. 'It woke me up, I heard a whole heap of screaming outside. It kept going for at least 20 minutes. It scared the crap out of me,' one neighbour told the Herald Sun. 'I was woken up through hearing the car doors everywhere and the police telling them to get down,' another said. Most of the residents said they were shocked by the news of the arrests, describing the teenagers as 'lovely guys', 'nice people' and 'the perfect neighbours'.

It comes just two months after Sydney housemates Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25, were arrested at their Fairfield home just hours before they allegedly planned to carry out a terrorist plot. Police uncovered a machete, a hunting knife and an Islamic State flag during a raid of their squalid granny flat in western-Sydney. A video featuring one of the men standing in front of the flag while making threats of carrying out a terrorist attack was also uncovered. In September of 2014, Australia saw 15 men arrested across Sydney's west and north-west in the country's largest ever terrorism-raids. More than 800 police officers searched 25 properties in the early hours of the morning with the aim of dismantling a terror-plot to behead a random member of the public. Omarjan Azari, 22, who was arrested in his Guildford home during the raids, faced court in late February after officers alleged he was involved in the plot.

"Russia yesterday lifted a ban on supplying Iran with an air defence missile system which could be used to protect nuclear sites. Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead for the deal, with the defence ministry saying it was ready to supply the S-300 missile equipment ‘promptly’. The move is likely to anger both the U.S. and Israel at a time of heightened tensions between the world powers and following a landmark deal on nuclear weapons. Moscow blocked deliveries of the surface to air missiles to Iran in 2010 after the United Nations imposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme, barring hi-tech weapons sales. Russia yesterday lifted a ban on supplying Iran with the air defence S-300 missile system (above), which could be used to protect nuclear sites . But the Russian president lifted the ban after Tehran struck an interim deal with Britain and five other countries to curb nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The framework deal, reached this month, intended to significantly restrict Iran’s ability to produce nuclear weapons, while giving it relief from international sanctions. The negotiations have been heavily criticised by Israel which has warned against Iran having any nuclear activities. Russia signed the £545million ($800m) contract to sell Iran the S-300 missile system in 2007, but later suspended their delivery because of strong objections from the U.S. and Israel. Vladimir Putin (above) gave the go-ahead for the deal, with the defence ministry saying it was ready to supply the  equipment . The contract to deliver the system was heavily criticised by Israel and the U.S., who feared it could be used to protect Iranian nuclear sites. When it was cancelled, Iran filed a lawsuit with a court in Geneva, seeking £2.7billion ($4bn) in damages for breach of contract, but the court has not yet issued a ruling. Moscow said it had no choice but to annul the deal when the UN imposed sanctions, outlawing the sale of advanced weapons. Despite the sanctions, Russia and Iran have remained close allies. The deal on Iran’s suspected nuclear activities is supposed to be finalised by June 30. There is no firm agreement on how or when to lift the current sanctions. The announcement comes as the U.S. slammed Russia for flying a fighter jet close to a U.S. reconnaissance plane in an ‘unsafe and unprofessional manner’ last week. Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said the U.S. was filing a complaint to Russia after the incident over the Baltic Sea, in the international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot’s action were ‘unsafe and professional due to the aggressive manoeuvres it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed’, Mr Wright added. Russian officials reportedly denied their pilot did anything wrong. The incident was not first time the U.S. protested to Moscow what it considered to be an unsafe intercept. Last April, a Russian fighter jet intercepted a US reconnaissance plane in international airspace over the Sea of Okhotsk.","Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead  to supply the S-300 missile equipment .

"This bundle of joy was a special spring surprise for both his mother and the farmers who delivered the 20lb new-born after a gruelling three-hour birth. He was so big that it took Shepherd John Hendy and a team of three helpers to help mother Jean deliver the young lamb near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, who they've now named Big Ben. Suffolk black lamb Jean is seven years old and an experienced mother but Ben is twice the weight of all his brothers and sisters born before him, all weighing the average weight of 8-10lbs. Big Ben: the 20lb lamb is twice the weight of the average new-born, towering over peers . Proud mum: Jean with huge son Big Ben after a three-hour labour at a Leicestershire farm . Ben isn't the biggest lamb ever born in this country but Jean Morris from the farm said Big Ben was comfortably the biggest they have ever delivered. 'I don't think there was anything unusual about either parent and this is the first time we have bred a lamb as large as this,' she said. 'His mother must have been relieved when it was over.' She added that the farm hopes to keep Ben as a breeding ram in the hope he will pass his amazing features to his future flock. 'This year we had 86 ewes to lamb but no-one expected anyone like him,' she said. 'We are thinking about keeping him as a tup - a breeding ram - to see if he passes on his weight to the lambs he sires.' Almost as big as a person: Ben dwarfs the other 86 ewes born at the same farm this season . Ben's arrival came just a fortnight after the largest lamb born in the UK weighed in at a massive 24lbs in north Wales. He was named The Big One and is believed to be the heaviest lamb ever born in the wild. Last year Goliath was born at a hefty 22lbs 5oz in Wellington in Somerset. The title for the heaviest Suffolk cross lamb was Bruno, nicknamed 'Woooly Lamboth', who was born in Worcestershire in 2009 at a healthy 21lbs. Bruno was spared the chop because of his size as his owner decided to keep him as a pet because he was curious to know just how big he would get. New Zealand is the world's biggest producer of lambs. But the largest new-born lamb ever recorded there weighed just 15.5lbs.","Farmers named him Big Ben as he dwarfs other 85 ewes born this season .

"Brontosaurus has made a thundering comeback after being sent into exile by the scientific community. The long-necked dinosaur was one of the largest animals to ever walk the Earth with its legacy captivating children's imaginations the world over. But despite the 'thunder lizard' being deep rooted in popular culture, for more than a century scientists believed the infamous dinosaur never existed. The giant dinosaur and its evocative name - meaning 'thunder lizard' - has enthralled generations of youngsters.But since 1903, experts have believed the creature was originally misnamed. Pictured is a Brontosaurus as researchers see it today -- with a Diplodocus-like head . The researchers looked at 477 anatomical features across 81 individual dinosaurs found in museums throughout Europe and US. Instead of the traditional method of plotting how similar each species is to the others, they instead used a 'specimen-based protocol'. This meant they could analyse each individual animal, despite its species, and allowed them to look at differences within each species, as well as between different species. The main shape of the tree supported what other paleontologists had previously proposed.  But fossils that were originally labelled Brontosaurus appeared different from two Apatosaurus species. Most of the differences were in tiny anatomical features, but one distinctive trait was that Apatosaurus has a wider neck than Brontosaurus. Since 1903, experts have been arguing the creature was originally misnamed. Instead of belonging to the genus, or species 'family' Brontosaurus, they said it should in fact have been classified as 'Apatosaurus'. Now new research has shown that it is, after all, sufficiently different from Apatosaurus to deserve its own genus name. Scientists from the UK and Portugal submitted the evidence for resurrecting Brontosaurus in a study almost 300 pages long published in the open access journal PeerJ. 'The differences we found between Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus were at least as numerous as the ones between other closely related genera, and much more than what you normally find between species,' said Dr Roger Benson, one of the authors from Oxford University. The researchers used statistical techniques to calculate the differences between species and genera of 'diplodocid' dinosaurs - a group that included some of the longest animals that ever walked on the Earth. The researchers looked at 477 anatomical features across 81 individual dinosaurs.

Most of the differences were tiny anatomical features, but one distinctive trait was that Apatosaurus has a wider neck than Brontosaurus. The researchers looked at 477 anatomical landmarks across 81 individual dinosaurs.The general shape of the tree supported what other paleontologists had previously proposed, but fossils that were originally labelled Brontosaurus appeared different from two Apatosaurus species. Pictured is the revised family tree . The scientists claim that three known species of Brontosaurus exist — Brontosaurus excelsus, which was the first discovered, along with Brontosaurus parvus and Brontosaurus yahnahpin. They also found two members of the group, Diplodocus and Supersaurus, may have reached lengths of up to 112 ft (34 metres). Apatosaurus, also from the group, had an average length of 75 ft (22.8 metres), and weighed around 16.4 tonnes, they said. Colleague Emanuel Tschopp, from Nova de Lisboa University in Portugal, said: 'Our research would not have been possible at this level of detail 15 or more years ago. 'In fact, until very recently, the claim that Brontosaurus was the same as Apatosaurus was completely reasonable, based on the knowledge we had.' In 1877, Marsh’s crew uncovered the bones of a species he dubbed Apatosaurus ajax. Two years later, he found another giant dinosaur and named it Brontosaurus excelsus (pictured) Emanuel Tschopp (left) and Octávio Mateus examine a Galeamopus skull, a genus of diplodocid dinosaurs, as part of the study . The complex history of the the Brontosaurus has its roots in the ‘bone wars’ of nineteenth-century. This was characterised by a race between paleontologists Edward Cope and Othniel Marsh defined the era to find dinosaur fossils. In 1877, Marsh’s crew uncovered the bones of a species he dubbed Apatosaurus ajax. Two years later, he found another giant dinosaur and named it Brontosaurus excelsus. In the early 1900s, after discovering a fossil that was similar to both Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus, other researchers decided that the two dinosaurs were of the same genus. Eventually, palaeontologists agreed that Brontosaurus should be named Apatosaurus. This was under rules that state that the first name given for an animal takes priority. Brontosaurus has a complex history. In the 1870s, palaeontologists led by Othniel Charles Marsh discovered two enormous partial skeletons of long-necked dinosaurs in the US and shipped them to the Yale Peabody Museum in New Haven, Connecticut. Marsh described the first of the creatures as Apatosaurus ajax, the 'deceptive lizard', after the Greek hero Ajax. Two years later, he named the second skeleton Brontosaurus excelsus, the 'noble thunder lizard'. Neither skeleton was found with a skull, and Marsh reconstructed one for Brontosaurus excelsus. However, his reconstruction, based on evidence from another long-necked dinosaur, Camarasaurus, was later found to be wrong. Shortly after Marsh's death, scientists from the Field Museum of Chicago found another skeleton similar both to Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus. In fact they were so similar that experts decided it would be correct to treat them as two species from the same genus: Apatosaurus. The final blow to Brontosaurus came in the 1970s when researchers showed that Apatosaurus/Brontosaurus was not closely related to Camarasaurus but Diplodocus, another dinosaur from the same era. Diplodocus had a slender, horse-like skull, rather than the box-like one reconstructed by Marsh and modelled on Camarasaurus. Brontosaurus is one of the most charismatic dinosaurs of all time, inspiring generations of children thanks to its size and evocative name. But researchers long believe Brontosaurus was in fact a misnomer, and it should be correctly referred to as Apatosaurus (artist's impression pictured) Paleontologists Emanuel Tschopp and Octávio Mateus are pictured measuring a sauropod dinosaur femur on the right. On the left is an artist's impression of Brontosaurus . The myth was born that Brontosaurus was actually an Apatosaurus with the wrong head. In science, the distinction between species and genera is without clear rules. But the researchers argue the to resurrect Brontosaurus was not a matter of personal preference . 'We tried to be as objective as possible whenever making a decision which would differentiate between species and genus,' said Professor Tschopp. 'It's the classic example of how science works', said Professor Mateus, a collaborator on the research. 'Especially when hypotheses are based on fragmentary fossils, it is possible for new finds to overthrow years of research.'

"Malcolm Brabant spent two years in and out of mental institutions after a yellow fever vaccine . When award-winning BBC foreign correspondent Malcolm Brabant walked into a clinic one afternoon to have a yellow fever vaccine, he was warned the possible side-effects could be dizzy spells and a headache. Yet within 24 hours of having the jab, in April 2011, Malcolm had been reduced to a sweating, shivering wreck, gripped by a fever so strong it took two weeks and a spell in hospital before his temperature was brought down. Then the psychosis began. A shooting star, glimpsed from the balcony of his home, convinced Malcolm - who had no previous history of mental illness - that he was a modern-day Messiah. 'I went completely bonkers,' he says today. 'The vaccine fried my brain.' Malcolm, 59, who had the jab in preparation for an assignment in the Ivory Coast, believed his Kindle could fly, that dead friends were contacting him and that he could stop traffic just by thinking about it. He spent the next two years in and out of mental institutions, unable to work - and even attempted suicide. Fortunately, he has since made a full recovery. But Malcolm believes the yellow fever vaccine - available in High Street vaccination clinics, GP surgeries and even Boots - could have dangerous side-effects that affect more people than previously thought. Since its invention in 1951, more than 540 million doses of the vaccine have been given. Anyone travelling to parts of Africa or South America is advised to have it. Yellow fever is a serious viral infection spread by mosquito bites. Symptoms include fever, chills, loss of appetite and nausea. While many people recover after five or six days, 15 per cent enter a second, toxic phase, with recurring fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice due to liver damage. They may also start vomiting blood. This toxic phase is fatal in about 20 per cent of cases. Clearly a dangerous illness, there is no doubt vaccination can be life-saving. But Malcolm and others who say they have been adversely affected by the jab want the manufacturer to investigate. Malcolm, who for many years was the Beeb's man in Greece, had the jab in a clinic in Athens, where his family was living. Next morning, his new wife Trine, found him downstairs, shivering and sweating, his face beetroot red. 'I was beside myself with worry,' says Trine, 55, an author and journalist. 'It wasn't just the fever but the change in character. He became irrational, then emotional - crying.' When his fever showed no signs of relenting after five days, Trine took Malcolm to hospital. The doctors, who also discovered through blood tests that Malcolm had suffered recent liver damage, told him they believed he'd had an adverse reaction to the vaccine. He believes the yellow fever vaccine could have dangerous side-effects . They managed to lower his temperature. But his mental problems were only just beginning. Formerly agnostic, Malcolm became convinced he was Jesus, and two weeks after being admitted to hospital he was moved to a mental hospital and given anti-psychotic medication. It was a harrowing time for Trine. 'One day I visited him in hospital and he stripped off his clothes and asked me to turn the sheet into a nappy and put it on him so everyone could see he was Jesus,' she says. 'Doctors had told me not to upset him, just to do what he asked, so I did it. It was heartbreaking.' After three weeks, Malcolm was discharged in May 2011, and seemed to be recovering, so went back to work. But within weeks he deteriorated again. Malcolm developed full-blown psychosis, and over the following months moved between psychiatric hospitals in different countries - in the UK, Greece, and eventually with money running out, in Trine's native Copenhagen. On one occasion he attempted to take his own life. Happily, Malcolm was well enough to be discharged from hospital in July 2012 and has since made a full recovery. He is now pursuing the manufacturers of the vaccine, Sanofi Pasteur, to admit liability for what happened to him. As Trine explains: 'Every doctor we dealt with said they thought he'd suffered an adverse reaction to the vaccine. Since May 2011 I have been back to Sanofi Pasteur many times, but they are refusing to do anything or even meet us.' Malcolm is not the only person who believes they have had an adverse reaction to the drug. He is in touch with 12 others who believe they, too, have suffered grave side-effects. The NHS says that up to three in ten people who are immunised with the yellow fever vaccine suffer a mild headache, muscle aches, mild fever or soreness at the injection site - and that these symptoms occur because your immune system is trying to fight the small dose of yellow fever you have been injected with. These symptoms may last for up to 14 days after the injection. It's thought that far fewer people, four in a million, suffer more serious psychotic or neurological reactions, mainly unconnected to the symptoms of yellow fever itself. One of those is former Royal Naval Commander Graham Beard, who is convinced the jab, which he had in July 1999, ruined his health. He still suffers bizarre attacks, with loss of vision, hearing impairment, vertigo and headaches (posed by model) A fortnight after being given the injection, Graham, now 56, experienced terrible pains down his left side. He spent three weeks in Watford General Hospital and another three in the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queens Square, London. 'No diagnosis was made, except that I had suffered a major neurological illness,' says Graham, a father-of-two from Wales. After three months at home convalescing, Graham - who had also been unable to move - finally got movement back in his limbs and the pain disappeared. But then began a series of debilitating attacks which continue to this day. 'While now controlled by epilepsy medication, I still suffer bizarre attacks, with loss of vision, hearing impairment, vertigo and headaches, which occur sometimes daily or with gaps of several days or weeks,' he says. 'The most I have ever had is 19 in a single day. The stress and exhaustion from these attacks essentially stopped my career. I managed to hang on for ten years, but by 2010, after 32 years in the Navy, I realised I wasn't being fair on the team. 'Having struggled to accommodate the condition, while taking a staggering succession of medications and having constant tests, it finally beat me and I had to walk away from the career I loved.' Graham always mentioned to specialists that his symptoms seemed to have begun after he had the yellow fever jab and, consequently, he has been advised by medical professionals it's likely that a vaccine caused the problem. But it was only after hearing about other cases such as Malcolm's that he decided to speak out. 'Surely the company that makes the vaccine has a moral duty to review it to see if it should be modified or replaced,' says Graham. As long ago as 2005, Dr Thomas Monath, a former Harvard public health professor and world expert on yellow fever, confirmed that the vaccine can cause 'really severe and significant adverse events'. He told Good Health: 'While we should not overlook the 60 years of wide use of yellow fever vaccine, with a remarkable record of safety and effective prevention of this terrible disease, rare and unusual adverse events temporally associated with vaccination may occur. Some of these, such as the neuropsychiatric syndromes described in Mr Brabant's case, may not be acknowledged as causally related in the official literature.' The manufacturer, however, does not believe it needs to reassess the vaccine. In 2013 Dr Ronald Neeleman, head of vaccination innovation at Sanofi Pasteur, admitted to a conference that the vaccine hadn't been reviewed in many years, saying it serves 'a small market, with very low returns, and there is not really an incentive to redevelop'. A spokesman told Good Health that the company takes reports of adverse events 'very seriously' and ensures they are investigated promptly, but 'after carefully examining all the medical information that has been disclosed to us up to April 2013, we have been unable to establish any evidence for a causal relationship between the administration of the yellow fever vaccine Stamaril and Mr Brabant's reported medical condition. 'The current state of scientific knowledge does not support that these reported symptoms could be biologically plausibly linked to the natural history of the disease, nor the mode of action of the vaccine. 'Similarly, the observation of an event after vaccination does not automatically mean that vaccination has caused this event.' Malcolm, who has written a book, Malcolm Is A Little Unwell, won't be satisfied until the experiences of people like him are acknowledged in official literature about the vaccine and he has been offered compensation. 'The vaccine almost destroyed me,' Malcolm says. 'I want justice for my family, and the hundreds of others whose lives have been ruined.'","BBC foreign correspondent Malcolm Brabant had a yellow fever vaccine .

'In the next phase of this case you will learn a lot more,' defense lawyer Judy Clarke told jurors during closing statements . in Tsarnaev's trial. O'Toole also reminded jurors to avoid all media coverage, . especially on the second anniversary of the bombings on . Wednesday. The prosecution is expected to portray the ethnic Chechen as an Islamic extremist adherent of al Qaeda who planted one of the two homemade pressure cooker bombs at the race's finish line on April 15, 2013, because he 'wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people,' in the words of Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty. The defense, meanwhile, is expected to play up the role of his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, in carrying out the attack. In closing arguments last week, defense attorney Judith Clarke contended that Tamerlan was the driving force behind the bombing, with Dzhokhar following along. Tamerlan died during the brothers' chaotic final day of freedom. Three days after the bombing, the pair shot dead a police officer and carjacked a Chinese businessman as they attempted to flee the city. The carjacking victim escaped and alerted police to their plans, setting the stage for a gunfight between the Tsarnaevs and law enforcement that ended when Dzhokhar roared off in the stolen SUV, running over his brother.

During the guilt phase of the trial, U.S. District Judge George O'Toole had limited the amount of evidence the defense could present about the relationship between the brothers, who had immigrated to the United States from Russia a decade before the attack. But the sentencing phase, which the Justice Department announced on Friday would begin on April 21, will provide the defense with an opportunity to focus on that element of the case and possibly to call Tsarnaev to testify. The death penalty is controversial in Massachusetts, where it is illegal under state law but allowed in federal cases. The state has not seen an execution since 1947. The bombing killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29; Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, 23; and 8-year-old Martin Richard.

The drug already works for women with cancer fuelled by BRCA gene mutations, the defect that led to actress Angelina Jolie having her ovaries removed. New ‘exciting’ new research suggests the drug, already used to treat women with breast cancer, could also help men with genetic faults within their prostate cancer (pictured) tumours . Up to 30 per cent of men with advanced prostate cancer have tumours that have DNA defects and these respond particularly well to olaparib. The London trial of olaparib, which is owned by AstraZeneca, was led by researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden hospital. They found 16 out of 49 men with advanced prostate cancer responded to the drug, also known as Lynparza. It stopped prostate cancer growth, generating lower tumour cell counts in the blood and improved responses in medical scans. The drug - called olaparib - can extend the length of time that a prostate cancer patient lives with the disease without it getting worse, according to new clinical trials. Olaparib is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations. It is one of the first of a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors work by blocking the cancer cell’s ability to repair damage. Cancer cells that have a mutation in a BRCA gene rely completely on the PARP protein to fix the damage. PARP inhibitor drugs suppress this protein and can stop BRCA mutated cells from growing so they eventually die. Side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only cancer cells with genetic defects are targeted. Most of the men who had detectable DNA repair mutations had disease control lasting much longer than expected. This suggests the men most likely to benefit from the drug could be identified by testing to look for mutations. Olaparib became the first of a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors to be granted approval last month for use in ovarian cancer by the European Commission and the US Food and Drug Administration. The inhibitors work by blocking the cancer cell’s ability to repair damage. Cancer cells that have a mutation in a BRCA gene rely completely on the PARP protein to fix the damage. The inhibitor drugs suppress this protein and can stop mutated cells from growing. Side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only tumour cells with genetic defects are targeted. Professor Johann de Bono, who was the trial chief investigator, said: ‘This opens up the exciting possibility of delivering precise treatment for advanced prostate cancer, guided by genomic testing and based on the molecular characteristics of patients’ tumours. 'It shows that PARP inhibitors can be effective in a wider group of patients than had been thought – in men as well as women, patients with mutations in their tumours as well as those with inherited mutations, and in those with a wider range of gene defects.’ The drug, olaparib, is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations. It works by blocking the cancer cell’s ability to repair damage . Dr Emma Hall of the Institute of Cancer Research said: ‘We’ve seen a significant improvement in the length of good quality life men can hope to live even with the most advanced prostate cancers. 'These encouraging results show that olaparib could be the next drug to add to those already available.’ The results of the trial were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research conference in Philadelphia. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence will now decide whether olaparib should become widely available on the NHS. A decision is expected in September. Dr Iain Frame of Prostate Cancer UK said: ‘We want to get to a stage where every man gets the treatment he needs for his specific cancer.’ Researchers did not specify the length of time for which olaparib was able to stop advanced prostate cancer worsening.","Olaparib is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations .

"HBO's hit series, Game of Thrones, is set to return with its much-anticipated fifth series, and that means the stunning settings where it was filmed are bracing for another influx of tourists. While the programme has already filmed in some of the most picturesque places around the world - including Croatia, Iceland and the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland - series five has opted for slightly warmer fare. With most of the upcoming series shot in southern Spain, which stands in for the world of Dorne on the imaginary continent of Westeros, travel referral service Zicasso is looking to attract all die-hard fans with a luxury tour of some of the country's most historical, and most beautiful, cities. To celebrate the fifth series of Game of Thrones travel service Zicasso is offering a luxury themed tour of southern Spain . Seville, Spain . With much of the series set in a desert ruled by House Martell, the cities of Andalusia offer the perfect filming location for the ancient towns depicted in Game of Thrones. Though the tour begins in Madrid, guests are quickly herded south to explore the history and architecture of past Moorish rulers. In the Andalusian capital, Seville, travellers will spend three nights adhering to a full itinerary which includes a stop at the world's largest Gothic cathedral, registered by Unesco as a World Heritage Site. From there, fans will head toward Alcazar, a former Muslim fort that is celebrated for its Mudejar architecture. From Malta to Morocco, these are the various filming locations that are just as beautiful in real life as on screen . The seven-night Game of Thrones tour kicks off in Madrid, Spain (pictured) with who days of sightseeing before heading further south . From there, the tour heads to the Andalusian capital, Seville, including a stop at the world's largest Gothic cathedral . The former Muslim fort of Alcazar is the next stop, where the palace, celebrated for its Mudejar architecture, is one of the oldest in service . The Alcazar, a Unesco World Heritage Site, also provides the setting for the Water Palace of Sunspear in the series . The upper levels of the Alcazar are still used by the Spanish royal family as their official Seville residence, making it the oldest palace still in service. Registered by Unesco as a World Heritage Site in 1987, the Alcazar's stunning courtyards and lavish gardens also offer the perfect setting for the Water Palace of Sunspear, a retreat for the Princes of Dorne. Here, Prince Doran Martell, portrayed by actor Alexander Siddig, will meet with Jaime Lannister, played by actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, in order to try to save the land and his people. It's not the first time that the Alcazar has been used as a filming location. It was also the set for the court of the King of Jerusalem in 2005's Kingdom of Heaven and was also used while filming Lawrence of Arabia in 1962. From Seville, Game of Thrones enthusiasts will head to the town of Osuna, specifically to take in the city's impressive bullring . Although the HBO series filmed all around Osuna, it's the bullring that is of particular interest, as it will appear as Daznak's Pit . Osuna and Granada, Spain . A day trip to Osuna is also on the docket, specifically to take in the city's impressive bullring, which will appear as Daznak's Pit in the upcoming season. On the sixth day, guests will travel to nearby Granada to experience the rolling hills and timeless buildings, and, of course, an authentic flamenco show. It is here that fans will find one of the finest examples of Moorish architecture in Europe, the remains of the Alhambra palace, with its stunning arabesques, high ceilings and tiled walls. While crews reportedly visited the stunning Alhambra while scouting locations, fans will have to tune in to see whether or not it makes an appearance. The Lake Myvatin region of Northern Iceland is recognisable as the Beyond the Wall area in the hit show Game of Thrones . For the icy scenes, programme makers favoured the Hverfjall volcano in the Lake Myvatin region of Northern Iceland . Iceland . Throughout the series, Iceland has represented the northern-most tip of Westeros, with show runners preferring the real-life landscape to scenes created through computer generated green screens. In fact, the crew liked the country's majestic vistas so much that they returned to the areas of Thingvellir and Hvalfjordur in summer 2014 to film again. While the icy crater of the Hverfjall volcano has made several appearances, fans will also likely recognise Thingvellir National Park from Arya's storyline and as the setting for the battle of the Hound and Brienne. The Stangford Castle Ward Estate and the Castle Ward tower stands proudly in County Down, Northern Ireland . In Game of Thrones the castle towers are transformed into Winterfell, where the head of House Stark rules over his people . The breathtaking beech tree lined road is known as the Dark Hedges to locals near Stanocum in County Antrim, Northern Ireland . Northern Ireland . Although the bulk of the show's filming in Northern Ireland takes place in a studio in Belfast, there are several noteworthy off-site filming locations that offer the Northern Irish economy a much-appreciated tourism boost thanks to hardcore fans. Among them, The Stangford Castle Ward Estate and the Castle Ward Tower, both of which stand proudly in County Down. The Castle was the principle filming location for the pilot and season one, standing in for Winterfell's courtyard. However, to fans of Game of Thrones, the beautiful pathway will be more recognisable as the Kings Road and the Dark Hedges of Armoy . The Iron Islands, where the character Theon comes from, are actually based on Ballintoy Harbour in Northern Ireland . Here, fans welcomed the House of Stark to rule over their people. Also noteworthy is the Ballintoy Harbour in Country Antrim, which fans will recognise from Theon's homecoming, and the beech tree lined road known as the Dark Hedges, in nearby Stanocum. Though the tranquil pathway is beloved by locals, it's probably best recognised as the Kings Road and the Dark Hedges of Armoy in the series. The sun sets on the beautiful town of Essaouira, in Morroco, which Game of Thrones fans may recognise as Astapor . The fortified city of Ait-Benhaddou provided the setting for the fictional city of Yunkai, which featured in the show's third season . Clearly, the ancient city's red citadel and the nearby Ounila River impressed the Game of Thrones producers . Morocco . For the third series, film crews headed to Morocco to film sequences in the fictional cities of Yunkai and Astapor. Two locations were used in the North African country, Essaouira and Ait-Benhaddou, both of which are Unesco World Heritage Sites. Ait-Benhaddou, a fortified mud-brick fortress city, is better known by Game of Thrones fans as Yunkai, while the stunning walled town of Essaouira transformed into Astapor, which played a vital role in the series three finale episode. It's hard to look at the coastal city of Dubrovnik, Croatia and not see the backdrop of King's Landings . The Minceta Tower and fortification is a UNESCO World Heritage site on the Dalmatian Coast in Dubrovnik . Dubrovnik, Croatia . It's hard to look at Croatia's stunning Dalmatian coast city and not see King's Landing. The site of endless drama, incestuous affairs, a shocking beheading and the Battle of Blackwater, this tourist-loved town along the Adriatic Sea was not actually the first choice for the pivotal backdrop. In the first series, the historic city of Mdina, Malta, was used as the filming location, before switching to Croatia at the start of series two, a move which allowed creators to film near the sea. When the show runners switched to filming in Croatia at the start of series two, they were able to film near the Adriatic Sea . The Minceta Tower is possibly most recognised as the House of the Undying from the series two finale episode . The Minceta Tower, part of the Walls of Dubrovnik, also played a pivotal role in the series two finale. Also the highest point of the city, the Tower is notable for being the spot where Khaleesi Daenerys Targaryen walked around and around before entering the House of the Undying. And the Unesco Heritage Site is now just one of several stops on the newly-created themed walking tours that have popped up around the city to cater to globe-trotting Game of Thrones fans. The natural limestone arch of the Azure Window, in Gozo, Malta, was used during filming in the show's first series . The stunning natural wonder is perhaps best recognised as the backdrop for the Daenerys and Khal Drogo wedding in series one . Malta . And finally, no Game of Thrones themed trip around the world would be complete without a visit to this Mediterranean archipelago. Comprised of just three inhabited islands - Malta, Gozo and Comino - the historical republic is home to an impressive nine Unesco World Heritage Sites. Among them, the historic stone city of Mdina, which provided the backdrop for King's Landing during much of the pilot and series one episodes. During the first season, the city of Mdina, Malta, was the location of King's Landing (pictured: the historical city gate monument) Unfortunately, Maltese officials were said to have complained that protected habitats were being damaged during filming, in particular on the island of Gozo, meaning that from series two onwards, these exterior scenes were shot in Croatia. Home to the Azure Window, Malta's smaller sister island of Gozo, is a breathtaking sight, recognised by Game of Thrones fans as where Daenerys Targaryen wed Khal Drogo. Island officials took issue with the crew over potential damage inflicted on the natural wonder and thus, producers were forced to change filming locations at the start of series three. The fifth series of Game of Thrones debuts in the US on April 12 and in the UK and Australia on April 13.","HBO's hit series, Game of Thrones, set to return with its fifth season, which was filmed all over Europe .

"From David Cameron and Nick Clegg sitting on the Gogglebox sofa to Ed Miliband doing a Kate Winslet in Titanic, these are some of the best memes posted in reference to the leaders’ debate. Other images show Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon posing with a rather sceptical face, and Mr Miliband superimposed over London rapper Plan B, issuing a call to ‘come at me bruv’.

The images were inspired by a debate that saw Mr Miliband warned he would not get into power without lurching left, as Miss Sturgeon told him he is ‘not strong enough’ to win power on his own. He took a high-risk choice to appear with the SNP leader, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Green leader Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood - but David Cameron and Nick Clegg stayed away. The Prime Minister and his deputy were therefore superimposed over Christopher Steed and Stephen Webb, two men from Brighton who commentate on TV in the Channel 4 series Gogglebox.

"Jordan Speith is in prime position to win the Masters, maintaining the lead during the final round at Augusta. The 21-year-old has begun the last day of the hallowed tournament after setting a scoring record for 54 holes of 16 under par. He is playing alongside British contender Justin Rose in the final, showcase pairing, and will be looking to avoid the disappointment of last year, when he finished runner-up. Some of his American rivals, such as Tiger Woods, have slipped down the leaderboard. But others, including Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson are still posing a threat. Jordan Speith, pictured during his final round on Sunday, is in prime position to win The Masters, taking a four shot lead into the final round at Augusta . He is playing with British contender Justin Rose, who began the day four shots off the pace . Spieth, who squandered a front-nine Masters lead on Sunday last year and settled for sharing second behind Bubba Watson, is the man to beat for the top prize of $1.8 million at the $10 million event. 'Last year definitely left a bad taste in my mouth,' Spieth said. 'Looking at trying to get some revenge. I've got a long way to go still.' The spotlight belonged to Spieth, who could break Tiger Woods' 1997 tournament record of 18-under 270 by shooting 69 in the final round. The former world number one Woods started the day some shots back, and caused concern on the 7th hole when he seemed to injure his finger. He then pulled up on the 8th tee, shaking off the same hand while his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn watched from the crowds. If he wins, Spieth would become the second-youngest winner in Masters history, five months older than Woods when he won his first major in 1997. Spieth could also become only the fifth wire-to-wire winner in Masters history, joining Craig Wood in 1941, Arnold Palmer in 1960, Jack Nicklaus in 1972 and Ray Floyud in 1976. Spieth is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds, but Norman squandered a six-stroke lead in making the greatest last-day collapse in major golf history and lost by five to Nick Faldo. Tiger Woods  waits to play a shot on the first hole during the final round. He started the day further down the field looking to make up lost ground . The former world number one let go of his club and shook his hand after hurting his wrist during after playing a shot in pine needles . His girlfriend, gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn, was spotted walking up the first way as he got his round underway . She has been on hand to support her beau at Augusta throughout the week . No player in Masters history has ever reached 19-under at any stage of the tournament but Spieth flirted with it Saturday, making four birdies in five holes to stand 18-under before a double bogey at 17 and a 10-foot par save at 18, and could threaten again Sunday. With 22 birdies through 54 holes, Spieth broke Woods' record of 21 in 2005 and is on pace to shatter Mickelson's Masters 72-hole birdie total record of 25 from 2001. But Spieth has not made the Masters a runaway. Rose, who closed with five birdies in the last six holes Saturday, is trying for a second major crown - 22 months after his breakthrough at Merion. And Mickelson is still in position to potentially become the second-oldest winner in Masters history after Jack Nicklaus, who was 46 when he won in 1986. Mickelson has only one top-10 in his past 31 starts but it was a runner-up effort at last year's PGA Championship. Mickelson won the 2004, 2006 and 2010 Masters, as well as the 2005 PGA Championship and 2013 British Open. Should he win Sunday, he would match Faldo and Lee Trevino as six-time major champions. Spieth (above with girlfriend Annie Verret on her 21st birthday) is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds . On Saturday it was reported that the Dallas, Texas native has just bought $2.3million on a stunning Texas mansion and has a gorgeous girlfriend, Annie Verret, who also happens to be his high school sweetheart. Spieth grew up the oldest of three siblings to Shawn and Chris Spieth. Steven, Spieth's younger brother, is an athlete as well, and plays basketball for Brown University. Then there is his youngest sibling Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum, and who has played the biggest role in shaping her brother's career according to Spieth's mother. She says Ellie helps the young superstar stay so grounded. 'Jordan wouldn't be where he's at today if he didn't grow up with Ellie,' said Mrs. Spieth in an interview with ESPN. 'Jordan realizes this isn't real life at the Masters. Trying to sit around and have dinner when his sister doesn't want to eat when everybody else is eating and has a fit, that's real life.' Spieth on his own website has said: 'Being Ellie's brother humbles me every day of my life.'","The Dallas native will play alongside Justin Rose in the final pairing .

"BBC programmes are set to move online as part of a new 'internet first' strategy designed to compete with web services such as Netflix and Amazon. Corporation bosses fear they could be losing younger viewers who are used to watching video online rather than through their TVs, and are promoting digital services in a bid to tackle the problem. But the revelation could spark controversy over the future of the licence fee, because viewers are currently able to use the BBC's online services without paying for them. Going digital: Popular TV shows such as Poldark could one day be migrating to the web as part of BBC plans to become an 'internet first' broadcaster . Matthew Postgate, the BBC's chief technology officer, said in an interview that the corporation needs to remain 'relevant' to a new generation of viewers. 'It's my job over the next five years to put in place the production foundations to be internet first,' he told the Financial Times. He added that traditional media groups such as the BBC would have to 'learn lessons' if they want to 'compete with organisations that were born in the digital age', which are not tied to the methods used to produce broadcast TV. Online services such as Netflix and Amazon have increasingly been producing their own programmes in a bid to take on major broadcasters, while catch-up services including BBC iPlayer have been growing in popularity. Netflix has won plaudits for shows such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black, which can only be watched by subscribers who access the service through their computer, tablet or internet-enabled TV. Hit: Strictly Come Dancing is another popular BBC show which could be affected by the 'internet first' plan . Popular: But shows such as Eastenders, pictured, have lost viewers thanks to the rise of the internet . The rise of catch-up TV, as well as the proliferation of digital services, has caused audiences to shrink dramatically - for example, the remake of Poldark starring Aidan Turner attracted 6.9million viewers for its first episode, less than half the number who tuned in to the original series 40 years ago. While other programmes such as Eastenders and Strictly Come Dancing remain popular, primetime audiences are still much smaller than the highs they reached before the advent of the internet. Matthew Postgate was appointed the BBC's chief technology officer on a salary of £225,000 - more than the Prime Minister - in July last year. He was previously head of BBC research and development, working on digital projects including high-definition internet broadcasts. Mr Postgate was also involved with developing the BBC iPlayer, and was at one point in charge of the corporation's mobile services. He was educated at Bristol University, and worked as a telecommunications consultant before joining the BBC in 2003. Mr Postgate was appointed last year on a salary of £225,000 to pick up the pieces after the failure of the £100million Digital Media Initiative, which was scrapped by director-general Tony Hall. The strategy was designed to streamline all the BBC's online services and give its staff access to the corporation's whole archive at once, but it collapsed in 2013. Technology chief John Linwood was sacked over the fiasco, but last year he successfully sued the BBC for unfair dismissal. Mr Postgate told the FT: 'Rather than trying to deliver one large project, we've been taking off the different components and moving forward.' Last year it was announced that BBC Three, the youth-oriented digital TV channel, will be taken off the air and become internet-only. The move could herald a new wave of services moving to the internet - but Mr Postgate insisted that other channels will remain on broadcast TV for the time being, saying: 'BBC Three was a brand that you could move from one platform to another relatively easily.' Mr Postgate also predicted that more and more BBC services will be consumed via mobile phones and tablet computers rather than on traditional channels. He wrote in a blog post last night: 'We will increasingly use the internet to deliver programmes and services to you in the future - whether that's to the big screen in the living room or the smartphones and tablets scattered over the house.' Radio 1, which is also aimed primarily at young people, has expanded its online offerings via sites such as YouTube - controller Ben Cooper said last month that it was 'no longer a music station' but a 'multi-platform youth music brand'. Future: The BBC has increasingly been promoting its services on digital platforms such as iPlayer . Figures released in November showed that children spend half as much time as adults watching ordinary broadcast TV, but much more time watching online video. If the trend continues, the television licence fee could be under threat as viewers opt out of the £145.50 payment and watch online instead. It is thought that around 500,000 people take advantage of the so-called 'iPlayer loophole', but that figure is likely to rise if more BBC services become online-only. MPs recently called for the licence fee to be amended so that viewers who only use catch-up services will have to pay it. Mr Postgate said in a statement today: 'I'm not talking about the BBC only putting its content online. My role is to make sure that the BBC’s technologies that underpin everything we do - from our newsroom infrastructure and new in-the-field production and editing tools, to how we keep the BBC on air and online - are set up in the best possible way, and take advantage of new internet-based technologies.' When the Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was launched in 2008, it was hailed by BBC chiefs as 'the single most important initiative we are working on'. But before a year had elapsed, it was floundering so badly insiders referred to it as 'Don't Mention It.' The BBC originally appointed IT firm Siemens to implement the scheme. But it ditched the company in 2009 as the project floundered and took it back in-house. By then, £26million had already been wasted but it is understood the BBC later recouped the cost from Siemens. In February 2011, the National Audit Office condemned the corporation over its handling of the DMI after it ran 21 months behind schedule. The public spending watchdog found the expected gains had been overstated and the difficulty of delivering it was underestimated. The Public Accounts Committee criticised the BBC for awarding the contract to Siemens without putting it out to open tender. The project was meant to allow production staff to access all video and audio material on their computers. As hundreds of staff moved to the corporation's new headquarters in Salford, this would prevent them having to transport tapes of archive material by road from London, reducing production costs. But the costs of the project continued to spiral to £98.4million until it was finally halted in May 2013.","BBC is aiming to compete with internet services which have captured younger generation of viewers .

"She might be approaching her 89th birthday but nothing was going to stop the Queen from enjoying a ride in the spring sunshine this morning. The monarch, 88, was spotted trotting through Windsor Great Park aboard her faithful black Fell pony, Carltonlima Emma. Joined by a groom on another of her Fell ponies, the Queen cut a relaxed figure as she enjoyed her ride but, as is her wont, eschewed a helmet in favour of one of her silk scarves. Enjoying the sunshine: The Queen enjoys a ride on her Fell pony Carltonlima Emma . The Queen, who has never worn riding helmets, has been encouraged to wear the safety hats in the past but is reportedly reluctant to wear one because of her hair. Speaking in an interview last year, her racing trainer Ian Balding recalled the moment he asked why the monarch never wears a riding hat. The Queen is said to have replied: 'I never have and you don’t have to have your hair done like I do.' Her Majesty is famous for her love of horses and first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a Shetland pony, named Peggy, aged four. Since then, the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds, among them Betsy, a black farm-bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50's, and Surprise, a grey gelding whom the Queen famously galloped down the course at Ascot in 1961. Equine enthusiast: Her Majesty adores the ponies and breeds them at Hampton Court . No helmet: The Queen never wears a riding helmet, preferring instead to ride in a silk headscarf . Cutting back: She has ridden less in recent years as a result of a niggling knee injury . Long term love: The Queen has ridden all her life and continues to breed several breeds of horse and pony . Recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over Trooping the Colour on horseback. Nevertheless, the Queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and, according to sources, is a familiar sight at her Windsor stables. She is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. Along with her thoroughbred race horses, the Queen also breeds Fell ponies and has a stud specialising in Highland ponies at Balmoral. First love: The Queen's first pony was a tiny Shetland named Peggy who was given to her at the age of four . Familiar sight: The Queen riding her much-loved horse Burmese during Trooping the Colour . Seal of approval: A Fell pony foal similar to those being bred by the Queen at Hampton Court . One of the oldest equine breeds on the planet, Fell ponies like the Queen's mount Carltonlima Emma, have roamed the moors of Cumbria since the Neolithic period. Docile, hardy and thick-set, the majority of Fell ponies are black, grey or bay and measure between 13 and 14hh. Highly prized by the Carvetii, the Iron Age tribe who occupied the region more than two millennia ago, the ponies later caught the eye of the invading Romans and were used as trade goods all over the Empire. The Romans also helped develop the breed into the relatively large animal it is today. Originally thought to have stood around 12hh tall (similar to Dartmoor and Exmoor ponies), by the end of the Roman period, the average Fell was more than a hand higher. Another invader to fall in love with the Fell pony was the Vikings, who used the animals as pack ponies; a use continued by the Normans. By the 13th century, the Fell's usefulness as a pack animal was well-established and the pony played an important role in British trade until the end of the 18th century. Following the Industrial Revolution, Fells were used to transport iron ore and coal from mine to town, as well as underground when the height of the shaft allowed. Although previously used in trotting races, the Fell pony really came into its as a riding horse in the 1950s, when its gentle nature and pretty looks made it the pony of choice for families. Today, the pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages, among them the Queen who breeds Fell ponies at her Hampton Court stud.

"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon today left the door open to a second referendum on Scottish independence before 2020.

But Ms Sturgeon today refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis'.

Alex Salmond said the vote was an 'opportunity of a lifetime' and two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: 'We have always said it's a once in a generation thing.' But in a series of TV election debates between Scottish leaders, Ms Sturgeon has shifted her position and today left open the possibility that the promise of another vote could be included in a future SNP manifesto. Under pressure she said that 'something would have to change' before she promised a referendum, and people would have to vote for it. She said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, there is not another referendum on the cards. 'In order for another referendum to be in an SNP manifesto in future, something significant would have to change from the situation we had last year in the referendum.' Ms Sturgeon, who was campaigning in Paisley today, left open the idea of demanding a referendum in next year's Scottish Parliament elections . Opponents claim Ms Sturgeon had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on a referendum, after insisting last year's vote was a once in a generation event . During a fractious and at times shouty debate on BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged her to rule out another vote. Ms Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, added: 'You clearly don't want to tell people before they vote in this election, what will happen in the next election. 'You have a conference coming up in September, you have 80,000 new members who might be popping along, are you going to put a motion at your conference on this to put a referendum into your next manifesto?' Ms Sturgeon said: 'I am not planning another referendum right now, I haven't published the 2016 manifesto. It will be this time next year before we publish the 2016 one.' Mr Rennie said the SNP leader had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis' on another referendum. He said: 'People need to know whether their vote for the SNP this time round will trigger a referendum in the SNP's manifesto in 2016. Nicola Sturgeon's refusal to answer this basic question makes clear that Scotland faces neverendum. 'It matters because during the referendum we know the SNP took their eye off the ball. As a result, public services were neglected. 'We have seen from Canada the economic impact of an uncertain constitutional environment. Quebec lost jobs and wealth. That damaged the province in the long term. I want a Scotland which builds a stronger economy and a fairer society, balancing the books and delivering more powers.' During a TV debate, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and Tory leader Ruth Davidson challenged Ms Sturgeon to come clean on her plans for Scotland . Ms Sturgeon later accused her opponents of 'reviving Project Fear'. The First Minister was questioned about SNP plans to increase Scotland's financial powers, which economists have suggested would leave a £7.6 billion spending gap, during a third televised election debate in under a week. Ms Sturgeon said that full fiscal autonomy would take several years to implement but with new powers Scotland would start growing its economy and revenues. She said: 'This week we've seen the Project Fear that dominated the referendum revived by these three unionist parties, trying to talk down Scotland and assert that we're not capable of running our own affairs.' Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said: 'This (the figure) didn't come from us. You're right in saying this came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. It also came from a group of Scottish-based economists that projected the gap to be bigger.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: 'To make this £7.6 billion up Scotland would have to grow at twice the rate of the rest of entire advanced world, so how would you do that Nicola?'","SNP leader refuses to rule out calling for another vote on independence .

"Hillary Clinton has told a series of whoppers about her family history in order to appear more sympathetic to immigrants'-rights activists, according to documents that surfaced online Wednesday. Buzzfeed found U.S. Census records and Selective Service documents – draft cards – that establish that three of the former secretary of state's grandparents were born in America. That clashes with what Clinton herself has claimed publicly, including Wednesday afternoon in Norwalk, Iowa. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Clinton claimed on Wednesday that all of her grandparents 'came over' from other countries, but in fact only one was born outside the US . Hillary was participating in a staged 'roundtable' discussion about small business issues in Norwalk, Iowa . 'All my grandparents, you know, came over here,' she said during a small business roundtable event, 'and you know my grandfather went to work in lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and worked there until he retired at 65. He started there when he was a teenager and just kept going.' Clinton made the statment to underscore her support for changing the status of milions of illegal immigrants. 'We are turning down people who really want to work,' she said. 'I mean, they are here to work. And a lot of them now have children who are American citizens, and they are doing the best they can to try to make a good life for themselves and their families.' The underpinnings of her personal story, however, seem false. STAGING: Most reporters were kept out of the Capital City Fruit company 'for space reasons' although the warehouse had plenty of room to go around . Both of Clinton’s maternal grandparents, named Della Howell and Edwin Howell, were born in Illinois, according to Buzzfeed's records research. And while her paternal grandfather, Hugh Rodham Sr., immigrated to the U.S, his wife Hanna Jones Rodham was born in Pennsylvania. In a speech last year in Kentucky, Clinton claimed Hanna 'immigrated with her family as a young girl to Scranton [Pennnsylvania] and went to work, very young, in a silk mill.' 'She traced her Methodism back to the Wesley brothers themselves,' Clinton said, 'who converted her great grandparents in the small coal mining villages of Southern Wales.' The Clinton camp quickly acknowledged the accurate Rodham family history. 'As has been correctly pointed out,' a campaign spokesperson told Buzzfeed, 'while her grandfather was an immigrant, it appears that Hillary’s grandmother was born shortly after her parents and siblings arrived in the U.S. in the early 1880s.' But the insider insisted that Mrs. Clinton had simply believed what her family members had told her. 'Her grandparents always spoke about the immigrant experience and, as a result she has always thought of them as immigrants,' the spokesperson said.","Clinton claimed Wednesday in Iowa that 'all my grandparents came over here' as immigrants .
She said last year that one of her grandmothers immigrated to Pennsylvania and worked in a silk mill .
But Buzzfeed found American Census records showing that only one Clinton grandfather, adn neither of their wives, was born outside the US .
Clinton apparently shaded the truth to seem more authentic with her argument that illegal immigrants should have more legal access to jobs ."
"Jeremy Clarkson last night launched into a bizarre rant about being sacked from the BBC, saying the upside meant he could now swear without being reprimanded. The former Top Gear presenter made his comments when he was guest of honour at a charity auction in the Cotswolds.

Hundreds of fans paid £15 a ticket to watch Clarkson oversee the auction at Chipping Norton town Hall. He also joked about 'trawling the job centre' for a hosting job when he spotted an opening for the charity auction. In a typical Clarkson moment, he mistook a male bidder for a female but responded by saying: 'I have worked with James May, it is easy to get confused in these situations.' Clarkson, who celebrates his 55th birthday tomorrow, previously lived in a sprawling £900,000 house one mile outside the town. It was his first public appearance since he was sacked from the BBC for allegedly assaulting a producer in the now infamous row over a steak supper in a Yorkshire hotel. He was accused of punching producer Oisin Tymon following a day's filming.

"The man who was sat in the car with Walter Scott moments before his fatal shooting has broken his silence. Pierre Fulton was in the passenger seat when Officer Michael Slager pulled them over for a broken tail light. When Scott fled, Fulton and another officer stood by the Mercedes watching in shock as Slager chased him into a park and shot him dead. Now, as Slager faces murder charges and national scrutiny, Fulton's attorney has released a statement. Warning: Graphic Content Below . Scroll down for audio and video . 'He didn't deserve to die': Pierre Fulton, who was in the car with Walter Scott when Officer Michael Slager pulled them over for a broken tail light, has broken his silence. He said he does not know why Scott ran . 'Walter was a dear friend and I miss him every day. 'Over the past five years he helped me to become a better man and showed me the value of hard work. 'I'll never know why he ran, but I know he didn't deserve to die. Please keep Walter and his family in your prayers and respect my privacy moving forward.' His words on Monday night came as audio surfaced of Officer Slager laughing and admitting to experiencing a rush of adrenaline in the minutes following the deadly shooting in South Carolina on April 5. Slager, 33, can be heard chuckling nervously while talking with a senior officer. The conversation was picked up by the dashcam in the officer's patrol car following the incident in North Charleston on April 5. The dashcam footage showing Scott, 50, a Coast Guard veteran, being pulled over for a broken tail light just minutes before Slager shot him, was released to the media on Thursday. The camera continued to record for another hour and a recording of the audio feed, including the conversation between Slager and a senior officer, was obtained by The Guardian. 'By the time you get home, it would probably be a good idea to kind of jot down your thoughts on what happened,' the senior officer said. 'You know, once the adrenaline quits pumping.' 'It's pumping,' Slager said, laughing. The senior officer replied: 'Oh yeah. Oh yeah.' The senior officer told Slager during the conversation to go home and relax, assuring him that he would not have to answer questions about the shooting for days. Scott was shot five times in the back as he ran away from the traffic stop. The father of four's death has sparked a nationwide debate about police brutality and bias against black people after a witness published video contradicting the police account of the event. Slager can be heard laughing nervously while talking with a senior officer. The conversation was picked up by the dashcam in the officer's patrol car following the incident in North Charleston on April 5 . Slager, 33, who is white, said that he felt 'threatened' by Scott, who is black, during a confrontation over his Taser, but video shows the civilian running away before being shot. The dashcam also recorded a cellphone call that Slager received about five minutes before his conversation with the senior officer. 'Hey. Hey, everything's OK, OK?' Slager said, after an iPhone ringtone was heard. Slager then appears to say: 'He grabbed my taser, yeah. Yeah, he was running from me.' His wife, Jamie, is eight months pregnant with their first child. Slager was fired from the North Charleston police and charged with murder on Tuesday. A group of black attorneys have called for the second officer connected to the fatal shooting to be arrested. National Bar Association officials said that Officer Clarence Habersham, 37, who was the second policeman to arrive at the dead man's body after Slager, should be fired and prosecuted for filing a false report. The National Bar Association is calling for North Chareston officer Clarence Habersham, 37 (right) to be arrested for falsifying a report about the actions of  Michael Slager, 33 (left), during the death of Walter Scott . Habersham (right) was the second office to arrive at the body of Scott, 50, and did not report Slager's actions leading up to the shooting . Habersham, who approached the body after Slager went to go grab the Taser that fell, can be seen examining Scott. Slager then drops the Taser next to the dead body in the presence of Habersham. Habersham then used his radio to report that Scott had gunshot wounds to his chest, right side, and backside. However, the black officer gave a two-sentence supplemental report and said that he tried to render aid to the body, which no one in the video does. Officers in the video are seen walking around and checking the pulse of the body. Sergeant James Gann wrote in his report that he helped Habersham administer first aid and CPR. On April 4, 2015 I Officer Habersham responded to the empty Lot behind Mega Pawn in reference to the above incident. I (Habersham) attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and directing the best route for EMS and fire to take to get to the victim faster. Video released after Slager's account into the death shows Scott (left) running away from the traffic stop when he is shot. Mourners have placed flowers at a memorial to the veteran (right) over the past week . Slager said after the incident that he 'felt threatened' by Scott, though video shot by Feidin Santana contradicts his report . Feidin Santana, who filmed a widely circulated video of the incident, said he did not any officers giving Scott CPR. The National Bar Association, the country's oldest group of black lawyers, said that Habersham 'deliberately left material facts out of his report' and left it 'incomplete'. The group said it was 'outraged' by the incident and that any other officer of the seven that quickly arrived on the scene should be indicted if they filed a false report. Police are interviewing all officers involved, a police source told CBS News. Chief Eddie Driggers said that he would not comment because the investigation is ongoing. Habersham was accused of excessive force by another black South Carolina resident, Sheldon Williams, 47. POLICE VERSION . Police officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday. He said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light. He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager. The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement. According to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott. At that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said. He added that his actions were in line with procedure. Police then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.' His department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim. WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS . Slager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back. The footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. Footage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. It is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse. A black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid. They are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. Relatives of Scott say their goodbyes to him on Saturday at a funeral that was was so widely attended that hundreds were left outside . Williams, who has multiple criminal convictions, said that he was pinned to the ground, handcuffed and had his face stomped on during a 2011 arrest. He said he did not resist arrest . Scott was laid to rest on Saturday, his casket draped in an American flag and accompanied by his distraught mother. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside. US senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended. Slager is being held without bail and faces punishments as serious as the death penalty if convicted. Judy Scott, the mother of Walter, leaves the funeral for her son in Charleston, South Carolina. The service was also attended by a number of the state's politcians .

"Hodor hodor hodor. Hodor hodor? Hodor. Hodor-hodor. Hodor! While this sentence might puzzle many, fans of the hit HBO show Game of Thrones, the fifth season of which had its US premiere last night, will understand the reference. Hodor is the brawny, simple-minded stableboy of the Stark family in Winterfell. His defining characteristic, of course, is that he only speaks a single word: 'Hodor.' Hodor, a character in Game of Thrones, earned his name because he says only the word 'Hodor' over and over again. He may have expressive aphasia, according to Jordan Lewis, of Penn State Medical School . But those who read the A Song of Ice and Fire book series by George R R Martin may know something that the TV fans don't: his name isn't actually Hodor. According to his great-grandmother Old Nan, his real name is Walder. 'No one knew where 'Hodor' had come from,' she says, 'but when he started saying it, they started calling him by it. It was the only word he had.' Whether he intended it or not, Martin created a character who is a textbook example of someone with a neurological condition called expressive aphasia. LOSING THE ABILITY TO SPEAK . In 1861, French physician Paul Broca was introduced to a man named Louis-Victor Leborgne. While his comprehension and mental functioning remained relatively normal, Mr Leborgne progressively lost the ability to produce meaningful speech over a period of 20 years. Like Hodor, the man was nicknamed Tan because he only spoke a single word: 'Tan.' Just a few days after meeting Dr Broca, Leborgne passed away. Dr Broca's autopsy determined tissue damage, or a 'lesion', in the frontal lobe of Mr Leborgne's left brain hemisphere, just next to a brain fold called the lateral sulcus. In 1861, a French physician called Dr Broca found a particular part of the brain is involved in language. It became known as Broca's area (pictured  in red). Damage to Broca's area causes language problems . Over the next two years, Dr Broca acquired brains from 12 more patients with Mr Leborgne's symptoms – all of the autopsy evidence was strikingly consistent. Neuroscientists are still examining this small region of the brain, now often referred to as 'Broca's area' to work out its many functions. Most research has focused on a patient's inability to form syntactically complex sentences when this area is damaged. More recent work using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has also reported that Broca's area is active during language comprehension tasks, interpretation of movement and comprehending various gestures also associated with speech, such as waving goodbye. HOW BRAIN DAMAGE AFFECTS SPEECH . In collaboration with French scientists in 2007, a group at the University of California revisited the brains of Mr Leborgne and Mr Lelong (another of Mr Broca's patients who could only speak five words) using MRI scans. One of their most interesting findings was that their lesions extended much deeper than Broca had reported, suggesting that multiple brain regions were probably contributing to their speech deficits. This evidence of widespread damage is unsurprising. Mr Leborgne, Mr Lelong – and even Hodor – are actually more extreme examples of individuals with expressive aphasia. The new series of Game of Thrones, featuring Hodor, played by Kristian Nairns, aired yesterday . More commonly, a person with the disorder will express themselves in 'telegraphic speech', which usually comprises three or so words, including a noun and a verb. For example, someone may say, 'Anne, dog, walk' to mean 'I walked the dog with Anne today.' The most common cause of expressive aphasia is stroke, which occurs when a blood clot blocks a vessel in the brain, resulting in tissue damage due to lack of oxygen. It's estimated that expressive aphasia occurs in 12 per cent of stroke patients, while roughly 35 per cent of stroke patients suffer from a language aphasia of some form. Expressive aphasia can also be caused by a tumour, haemorrhage, a haematoma in the membrane covering of the brain, or trauma to the head. It has been reported that Mr Leborgne suffered from epileptic seizures as a child – some have speculated that he may have experienced head trauma during one such episode. So what's Hodor's story? Did he sustain a blow to the head, suffer a stroke, or was he simply a giant baby dropped by his mother? He may only speak one word, but like the other characters in the show, Hodor too may have a quite an interesting backstory.","Hodor is a character in Game of Thrones who only speaks a single word .

"Edward Snowden is being ‘exploited’ under a deal he made with the Russians to guarantee him asylum, a leading spy analyst has claimed. Mr Snowden may have been told not to speak out on Russian surveillance but continue attacking America in order to save himself from jail in the US, Andrei Soldatov said. He accused the former US spy of not being ‘transparent’ and said he was being ‘secretive’ about his arrangements with the Russian authorities. Edward Snowden is being ‘exploited’ under a deal he made with the Russians to guarantee him asylum, a leading spy analyst has claimed . After Mr Snowden, 31, revealed himself in June 2013 as the civilian CIA worker who stole a vast tranche of classified documents, he fled to Hong Kong and then Russia where he was given asylum. The decision by Russian President Vladimir Putin was seen as a snub to US President Barack Obama at a time when relations between the two countries are strained. But the details of the arrangement have never been made public, and Mr Snowden has never addressed them. Mr Soldatov, who runs a website which is an online watchdog of Mr Putin’s intelligence agencies, spoke out in an interview with the Daily Beast, a US news and culture website. Mr Soldatov is also an author, investigative journalist and analyst who has been working on the Russian security state for a decade. It was thought that Edward Snowden was living in a secret location in Russia after his 2013 leaks made him a wanted man by the US Government – but it seems he’s actually set up shop in the middle of the White House. At least, that’s where the whistleblower is according to Google Maps. A business called Edward’s Snow Den has appeared in the US President’s headquarters thanks to the clever work of internet pranksters. Nothing happens when the icon for it is clicked, but for a short while it was listed as a snowboard shop, open between 5am and 11pm, according to thenextweb.com. Several reviews appeared underneath the listing, including one which gave it a five star rating and described it as a ‘great source of classified information’. Whistleblower Edward Snowden speaks to European officials via videoconference during a parliamentary hearing on improving the protection of whistleblowers, at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg . He said: ‘I think there is some sort of a deal with the Russian authorities. ‘It seems Snowden insisted that he’d never be used by Russian propaganda. ‘He never made it onto (Russian TV station) RT or other state media outlets and of course they would be happy to have him. ‘He’s clearly being exploited - after all, many repressive measures on the Internet in Russia were presented to Russians as a response to Snowden’s revelations.’ Mr Snowden is still a wanted man in the US where, if he returns, he will face espionage charges that could see him jailed for life if convicted. Mr Soldatov said: ‘It seems the idea is to stress that he’s just not in the US, he’s somewhere, but not in Russia. ‘I don’t think it was his strategy from the beginning. After all, he questioned (Vladimir) Putin last April during Putin’s annual question-and-answer press conference about mass surveillance in Russia. ‘So my impression is that it’s not his decision.’ Mr Snowden has been branded a traitor in the US and the UK where terrorism experts have said that lives were being lost because he had hampered security service operations. He stole information which revealed how spying agencies including GCHQ and the NSA monitored citizens’ private information, including call history and emails. Mr Snowden recently gave an interview to British comedian John Oliver for his weekly US TV show in which he admitted he had not read every document he leaked. In his toughest grilling to date, Mr Snowden said that he had ‘evaluated’ all the documents but squirmed and gave non-answers when pressed. He also acknowledged there had been a ‘f***-up’ when newspapers that were handed the classified material failed to redact sensitive details exposing operations against Al Qaeda.","Analyst claims Snowden under orders not to speak out against Russia .

"These amazing images reveal a kaleidoscope of colours in icy caves underneath a glacier. The rainbow caves are given their various colours by light refracting through the ice - with the thicker the ice, the more emerald they appear. And a photographer, from Kamchatka, in the Russian Far East, also decided to add his own take - by lighting flares and breathing fire to turn the normally blue hues into dark reds. Scroll down for video . The caves are found near the Mutnovsky volcano, 45 miles (72km) south of the regional capital of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky .

The extensive caves, some parts of which have water in them, were first discovered by Mr Budkov by chance . The ice cave's unique formations are created by the heavy winter snow becoming compressed and forming ice. Then as the short, summer months arrive, intensive melting of the ice creates ravines which flow and hollow out the caves and tunnels. The incredible lights shining purple, blue, green and yellow are no computer trickery - they are the result of sunlight streaming through the glacial ice into the hidden world below. The cave was carved out of the glacier by an underground river that is sourced in a hot spring gushing from the Mutnovsky volcano itself.

"Haunting never-before-seen images showing Captain Scott's doomed expedition team setting off on their ill-fated trek to the South Pole have sold for a staggering £30,000. The archive of 52 celluloid negatives show the great British adventurer and his men heading off in the snow-covered wilderness during the ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition of 1912. Some of the pictures show the herd of ponies the team used to haul the equipment-laden sledges on the 800 mile trek that would end with the deaths of Scott and the polar party of Edward Wilson, Lawrence Oates, Edger Evans and Henry Bowers.

The photographs were taken at the expedition base camp of Cape Evans on Ross Island . Setting off: Scott's team pulling a sled as they depart from base camp. The unseen photographs of the Antarctic expedition have been sold at auction for £36,000 to an unnamed buyer . The images also show the team of husky dogs used for part of the expedition. The two types of animal proved to be Scott's downfall as he got rid of the dogs on the final leg of the trek, wrongly believing they would not make the ascent of Beardmore Glacier. In the event, Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen beat Scott to the pole by 34 days, largely because his team used dogs to haul their gear the entire way rather than use slower ponies. Two of the men featured in the archive were dog handlers Cecil Meares and Dimitri Gerof. Other pictures in the archive show the flimsy-looking pyramid tents that sheltered the men from the bone-chilling temperatures of -70F as well as them trekking in the snow. There are also general shots of the harsh landscape and ice shelves that only a handful of men had visited until that point.

Official photographer Herbert Ponting brought the negatives back to England with him in preparation for Scott to use for lecture and fundraising tours around the world upon his return . They had been in the family of the collector ever since and were sold by Henry Aldridge and Son Auctioneers of Devizes, Wiltshire, to an unnamed buyer. Andrew Aldridge, from the auctioneers, said: 'The negatives offer an incredible snapshot into one of the most famous British Antarctic expeditions of the 20th century. 'They show the brutal nature of the environment these brave men went on to endure. 'The clarity of the images is truly remarkable and includes previously unseen elements including the polar party marching, pitching tents and them having lunch. 'The vast majority of Ponting's pictures are in the Scott Polar Research Unit. As far as we can tell most of these negatives haven't been published before.' Scott's Terra Nova expedition arrived at Cape Evans on Ross Island in January 1911. After seeing out the austral winter Scott's polar party of 16 men set off in the November 1911 to be the first people to reach the South Pole. Scott and his men made it to the South Pole on January 17, 1912 only to find Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had beaten them. All five men perished on their return journey after enduring dreadful conditions . Most of the images are owned by the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University. They include general shots of the harsh landscape and ice shelves that only a handful of men had visited until that point . Sold at auction: The negatives were retained by Ponting and were sold by his family to a private collector after his death in 1935. They have now been sold by an auctioneers to an unnamed buyer . The supporting party of 11 men returned as planned at various stages during the 800 mile trek, leaving Scott, Wilson, Oates, Evans and Bowers to reach the pole. The men made it to the South Pole on January 17, 1912 only to find Amundsen had beaten them to it. On their return journey, the five men endured dreadful conditions and suffered from a lack of food and frostbite. Evans died on February 17, 1912 and a flagging Oates famously died on March 16 after walking out of the tent into a blizzard to give the remaining three a chance of survival. Scott, Wilson and Bowers died in the tent on or about March 29. Their bodies were found eight months later by a rescue party.","The photos were taken at the expedition base camp on Ross Island in 1911 .

"Phillip Schofield was left speechless today after a guest with Tourette's syndrome blurted out 'silver fox' at him mid-interview. Ellie Grant, 22, was appearing on ITV's This Morning to discuss how she suddenly developed the condition - and how she had found love with fiance Jordan - who is deaf. The pair hit the headlines earlier this year after being labelled the perfect match because whenever she becomes rowdy, he simply switches off his hearing aid. They appeared on  today's show to discuss how they met - and how they live with both of their conditions. But in the middle of the pre-recorded interview, Miss Grant suddenly suffered a verbal tic - and blurted out 'silver fox' at Phillip, 53. Silver fox is the nickname of the father-of-two, who smiled, but looked bemused and slightly embarrassed at the remark. Co-presenter Amanda Holden quickly chipped in kindly, saying: 'It's a good one to have', regarding his nickname. Viewers reacted with amusement at the moment, which one person hailed 'the greatest Tourette's TV moment of all time'. During the interview, the couple discussed how after developing Tourette's syndrome aged 21, Miss Grant worried that she'd never find a boyfriend who would put up with her inappropriate outbursts. But months later, she found the perfect match in her deaf partner Jordan, who simply switches off his hearing aid whenever she has a series of loud tics. She told Phillip and Amanda: 'The night before I’d been out drinking, so I went to the shop to get a  sandwich. 'I looked at a sandwich and I started shouting ""marshmallow"" and I thought ""this is a dodgy hangover"". 'I picked up a bag of crisps and I started shouting ""marshmallow"" and ""Japan"". I thought ""what the hell's going on?"" By the next day, Miss Grant, who had lived a totally normal life until this point, was involuntarily yelling swear words and racial insults and began lashing out with kicks and punches. Ellie Grant, 22, was appearing on the show to discuss how she suddenly developed Tourette's syndrome - and how she had found love with fiance Jordan - who is deaf . But she left presenter Phillip Schofield bemused and speechless after blurting out 'silver fox' - his nickname - at him mid-interview . Co-presenter Amanda Holden quickly chipped in, kindly rubbing him on the back, saying: 'It's a good one to have', regarding his nickname . Miss Grant, from Ironville, Nottinghamshire, was working as a community support worker when she started 'ticking' while queuing in a supermarket last January. She found herself unable to stop blurting out 'marshmallow' and immediately called her doctor for an appointment after she ran back to her car in shame. By the time she saw her GP the next day, her ticks had already increased ten-fold, and she began shouting words like 'n****r' - as well as 'Japan' and 'I'm a t**t'. 'My arms were smacking my face as I was sat there in the waiting room,' she recalled. 'I was being horrible to everyone. There were a lot of swear words, and stuff like 'carry on looking at me and I'll take you to Japan'. It came on so quickly.' Miss Grant was told she should see a specialist and, after MRI scans confirmed she was not suffering from brain damage, the family discovered she had Tourette's. Miss Grant went on to develop OCD and anxiety, and gave up work as well as cutting herself off from friends and family and shutting herself away in her room. Viewers took to Twitter to express their amusement at the situation . But in late February last year, her aunt Annie took her out for a drink at her local pub, where she bumped into Mr Pettier. Miss Grant said: 'Jordan was in the pub and he was the only person not to look at me. Everyone else was laughing and looking and having conversations about me. 'I thought ""why isn't he?"". I went outside and he also came out. Then I saw his hearing aid and I started saying ""deaf, deaf"" - it was a new tick. Tourette's syndrome is a neurological condition affecting the brain and nervous system that causes sufferers to make involuntary noises and movements called tics. Tics can be vocal - such as grunting, coughing or shouting - or physical – such as the jerking of the head or jumping up and down. The exact cause of Tourette's is unknown but it can come on suddenly, usually in children or teenagers, but also in adulthood. It is believed the condition is brought on by a problem with the basal ganglia, which are a group of specialised brain cells located deep inside the brain. It is thought that the problems may be caused by excessive levels of a naturally occurring chemical called dopamine. Another theory is that Tourette’s syndrome may be linked to an infection in which antibodies produced by the body to fight the infection interact with brain tissue, affecting the brain's functioning. 'I was like ""oh god, I'm sorry"" and he said ""I'm deaf, it doesn't matter what you said, I can't hear you"". 'It was amazing and we just hit it off straight away.' One of Miss Grant's biggest fears was staying over at his house because her ticks continue through the night - but Mr Pettier immediately put her at ease. 'He said he turned off his hearing aid through the night so he wouldn't be able to hear me at all. I thought ""this is amazing'', she said. 'I was keeping my mum up at night, but now the only person I keep up in the night is our dog.' The pair moved in with each other in July and Mr Pettier is now a carer for Miss Grant, who suffers severe physical ticks, as well as her verbal outbursts. Mr Pettier, who has been 97 per cent deaf since contracting meningitis aged five, said: 'Meeting Ellie completed me. Her ticks were never a problem for me - I thought it was cute if I'm being honest. 'I used to get frustrated not being able to hear things properly but we even each other out. 'Things I can't do like phone calls she does, things she can't do like chop food I do. I could never imagine life with out her now. 'As Ellie's mum says we're the 'Undateables' and I wouldn't have it any other way.'","Ellie Grant, 22, was appearing on the show to discuss her condition .

"As the youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Kylie Jenner was bound to have a different upbringing to your average teen. Since Keeping Up With The Kardashians started in 2007, when Kylie was just nine years old, she has been one of the biggest tween stars - with a ticket to every A-List event in town. And as she teeters on the brink of adulthood, the reality star appears poised to overtake all of her siblings as the most talked about member of her famous family. Scroll down for videos .

The raven-haired teen stunned in her McQ Alexander McQueen black mesh dress which flashed a bit of skin with its sheer detailing. We bet that made Tyga roar in delight...

An LBD with a twist such as this one will be a great investment for your wardrobe and whenever someone asks you where it’s from (because they will) you’ll be proud to divulge. McQueen, darling...

Visit site . Kylie had a relatively normal childhood until the age of nine, when the Kardashian family started to invite cameras into their home for the filming of their reality show. By 2012, when she was 14 years old, Kylie opted to leave Sierra Canyon School where she was a student and be home-tutoured through an at-home education programme. By the age of 17, Kylie already has several projects to her name, including two nail varnishes, a clothes collection, a show line and a range of accessories with her sister Kendall. But her extracurricular activities that grab the most attention are her choices in clothing, her rumoured boyfriend and the many provocative poses that she publishes on her Instagram account, which has more than 21 million followers. Kylie Jenner posted a series of pictures of herself in skimpy clothing during her trip to Coachella festival . Like all of Kris Jenner's daughters, Kylie has a deep interest in fashion, but her style is by far the most revealing of all of the family. The star is regularly photographed out and about in clothes that are instantly emulated by her legions of teen fans - her style is considered the edgiest of all her family. Kylie recently hinted that she had her nipples pierced in a post on Snapchat . While her sister Kendall is idolised for her supermodel looks, it is Kylie's edgy fashion sense that is most admired within her family and among their peers. At Coachella, Kylie paraded around the desert in a skimpy jumpsuit that gathered instant praise from young women and guaranteed that she stood out from the millions of copycat festival goers in boho-chic. On the same day, she posed up for pictures in a pair of granny pants and managed to achieve the impossible - making them look cool. Flashing the flesh is not something that fazes Kylie - she regularly uploads selfies of herself in a bikini for her many fans. Just last week, Kylie posted a picture on snapchat where she hinted at having her nipples pierced. In the photo Kylie had drawn red circles around where her nipples would be under her sweatshirt and captioned it: 'New jewelry in other secret areas.' Kylie and Kendall are part of the new breed of the Kardashian family - while Khloe, Kourtney and Kim embrace the polished body-con look, the two younger sisters are more in tune with the the grungy fashion of the last two years. While hints at nipple piercing might raise a few eyebrows in certain camps, it is this rebellious behaviour by Kylie that is keeping the family current for a younger generation - one that has little in common with Kim, who has now settled down and started a family. Momager Kris says that it's Kylie's unique style that sets her apart from the rest of the family and makes her appealing to fans. 'I realized two to three years ago, my older daughters were asking Kylie for fashion advice,' she said, adding that her influence can be seen in the family's Steve Madden fashion line.' Kylie's choice of attire regularly raises eyebrows but is adored by her legions of fans, who copy her every look . Kylie is very body confident and her Instagram page is full of selfies . Kris continued: 'Kylie decided she had this edgy style she wanted to bring to the table, and she wasn't satisfied going along with what Kendall wanted.' Kylie and Kendall both appeared on Time Magazine's 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014 list, which listed among their achievements, that they had: 'hosted red carpet events, released clothing and nail polish lines and even published a dystopian young-adult novel.' Earlier this year it was also announced that Kylie would be releasing a clothing line at Topshop with her sister Kendall. But while Kylie's clothing draws a huge amount of attention, it is her knack with the make-up brush that has really racked up column inches for her over the last six months. Like many 17 year olds, Kylie spends a significant amount of time in front of the mirror practicing new make-up styles. Unlike Kylie though - they don't have the added benefit of regular sessions in a professional make-up artist's chair and endless expensive mascaras, blushers, lipsticks and foundations at her disposal. She has used this to her advantage and is widely considered among her family to be the expert at applying make-up. Kylie with her rumoured boyfriend Tyga,24 . Kylie is often targeted for the pictures she posts of herself with overly-plump lips . In fact, while the rest of her sisters get their faces professionally done before attending celebrity events, Kylie is the only one who does her own. Her sister Kim said: 'She's so good at makeup.' The main feature that has attracted so much attention are Kylie's lips, which she swells to three times their natural size by using expertly lining outside her lip line. Kylie told E! News: 'Everyone thinks I have one specific lip colour, but I have, like, 10 different nudes. 'I love lip liner and overlining my lips.' Always the sign of a trendsetter - this look has now turned into a trend, with young women across the US and Europe attempting to ape the look. Even the British supermodel Suki Waterhouse got in on the act by making over her sister Maddie using the Kylie tactic and posting the results on Instagram a few months ago. Kylie has grown up in the spotlight. Here she is pictured with her sister Kendall, mother Kris and father Bruce as a young girl . Kylie and Kendall are pictured out with their sister Kim in 2008 . After growing up in the spotlight, Kendall and Kylie both appear to have matured much faster than their three older half-sisters. For the last seven months, Kylie is reported to have been in a relationship with the American rapper Tyga, who shares a two year old with his ex-girlfriend Blac Chyna. The couple were first pictured together at Bordeaux airport in France last October and have since been pictured out several times together. Last November, they served food at a homeless shelter on Thanksgiving and were also pictured shopping for toys for Tyga's son. More recently, Tyga joined the Kardashian-Jenner family on a visit to church on Easter Sunday and last weekend he went on a road trip to Coachella with Kylie and her sisters Khloe and Kendall. But while speculation has continued to grow about the couple, Kylie has managed to remain admirably quiet on the issue, even when baited by stars like Amber Rose, who called her a baby. Kylie recently revealed that she is ready to leave the family home she shares with Kris Jenner and move into a place of her own . In fact, Kylie is far removed from being a baby - now she is just four months shy of her 18th birthday, the star is already getting ready to move out of her family home into a place of her own. In a recent interview with Teen Vogue, she said: 'I'm moving out when I turn 18. I'm ready to live on my own. 'It's a really big step, but I'm ready. 'I want a house near my family in a quiet neighborhood with a front yard and a backyard that my dog will like. 'Also, I have so many shoes, and none of them fit in my old closet.' With a rumoured music career on the way, with a new single called Forever Real, featuring Iggy Azalea and Tyga reported to be released later this year, it seems like this young lady is on the brink of even bigger stardom.","Kylie Jenner is the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner family .

"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was pictured enjoying a Roman holiday this week as he took a stroll around a tourist market in the Italian capital. Bezos, who is worth $34.7billion from his online marketplace, blended in with the throngs of tourists at the Campo de' Fiori on Tuesday, happily snapping pictures of the stalls with his Amazon phone and a camera. The Internet mogul was accompanied by family members and a discreet security guard as he took in the bustling market at the heart of the Eternal City.

The billionaire founder of Amazon was seen snapping away at stalls in the marketplace using both his Amazon phone and camera . Bezos, who is worth $34.7billion, blended in with tourists but was also discreetly accompanied by a security guard around the Italian capital . The 51-year-old wandered around the stalls dressed casually in a pair of aviator shades and blue checked shirt with a woman and young boy before buying a few things. Campo de' Fiori is one of the most popular tourist spots in Rome, selling a diverse array of products from the flowers that the square takes it names after to coffee pots and fake Italian soccer shirts. Bezos was not accompanied by wife of 22 years, MacKenzie. The couple have four children, three sons and a daughter adopted from China. Bezos is ranked number 15 on Forbes' billionaires list for his vast wealth but he still suffered a knock in 2014 after dropping down the list when he lost $7.5 billion. The Roman holiday appeared to be a well-deserved break for Bezos whose space company, Blue Origin, announced earlier this month that it had finished work on a rocket engine for a suborbital spaceship. Blue Origin expected to begin flight tests this year. Bezos said last week that the partnership between United Launch Alliance and his company on a new rocket engine was 'incredibly exciting'. The so-called New Shepard spaceship is designed to fly three people and/or a mix of passengers and payloads to altitudes about 62 miles (100 km) above Earth. Bezos was spotted at the popular tourist spot, Campo de' Fiori, in central Rome during a spring vacation .

"Holidaying with the lair of a tiger as your closest neighbour might not sound like the cleverest idea in the world but it is certainly a once-in-a-lifetime experience that won't be forgotten. For £3,500, tourists are being invited to book a trip to Russia and sleep in the natural habitat of the Siberian tiger, one of the world's most endangered animals. Bespoke tour operators Natural World Safaris is offering the rare trip which also gives guests a unique opportunity to view the big cat. A safari stay in Russia offers tourists the chance to spot, and sleep near, one of the world's most endangered animals- the Siberian tiger . Bespoke holiday providers Natural World Safaris is offering the rare trip which gives guests a unique opportunity to view the big cat . The trip to Durminskoye Reserve in Khabarovsk lasts seven days in total with guests spending time in the wild environs inhabited by the last remaining Siberian tigers, and setting camera traps with the experts in the hope of catching an insight into the lives of these endangered predators. They will walk in the footsteps of the world’s biggest cats and spend time with Alexander Batalov, a frontline Russian conservationist who has spent the last 20 years of his life trying to protect the rare Siberian tiger. The facilities are described as 'basic' and guests are provided with a translator throughout the stay. The daily activity is to explore the Reserve in the hope of picking up tracks of the Siberian tigers that reside in this area. This shot was captured at night as a Siberian Tiger walked down a narrow road in the Durminskoye Reserve, where guests can stay . Huntsman’s hut in the forest – sustainable hunting is still allowed in the forest and the hut is also used as a base of operations . The safari does not actively track them as this risks guests coming face-to-face with the animals themselves, which is why still and video cameras are set up. The images and footage from these actively assist Alexander and his team as they work to save the tigers of the region from extinction. Managing Director of Natural World Safaris and expert in wildlife encounters, Will Bolsover, told MailOnline Travel: ‘The trip is one of the rarest wildlife travel opportunities remaining today. Alexander Batalov, a frontline Russian conservationist, has spent the last 20 years of his life trying to protect the rare Siberian tiger . Inside Balatov's hut, dedicated to the natural world as you might expect with a range of feathers and animal bones . 'Spending time with Alexander Batalov in the home of the some of the last remaining Siberian tigers in Russia’s Far East, setting camera traps, tracking tiger footprints and collecting vital conservation data is a superb opportunity.’ It is estimated the current wild population of Siberian tigers under 400, making the species officially endangered. Siberian tigers were once found throughout the Russian Far East, northern China, and the Korean peninsula but by the 1940s, hunting had driven the species, also known as the Amur tiger, to the brink of extinction with no more than 40 individuals remaining in the wild. While the population has now stabilised somewhat, sightings in the wild are extremely rare as the tigers have the largest home range of any tiger subspecies and a limited density of prey means they have to search over large areas to find food. Guests will stay in a wooden cabin on the Natural World Safari trip to see the Siberian tiger . 'Guests will be staying directly in the heart of the tigers' habitat, but with the cats being extremely elusive, it obviously isn’t guaranteed that they will even come face to face with a tiger at all,' Bolsover said. 'While they are out setting camera traps and observing scent trails, footprints, scratch marks on trees, they will be exactly where the tigers tread. 'While they are out in the forest or in the camp, a tiger could be 20m away, 200m away, or as far as two miles away- it’s difficult to put a numerical value on it.'

"A father today pleaded not guilty to illegally buying a firearm his 15-year-old son then took to school to kill four of his classmates and take his own life. Raymond Lee Fryberg Jr. was arraigned in Seattle on Thursday, nearly six months after his son Jaylen Fryberg killed four students at Marysville Pilchuck High School then himself. Fryberg had been the subject of a permanent domestic violence protection order that prohibited him from ever having firearms when he allegedly bought a Beretta pistol in January 2013. According to the criminal complaint, the order was against him in Tulalip Tribal Court in 2002 by a girlfriend who said he had threatened her, slapped her and pulled her hair. In court: Raymond Lee Fryberg Jr. walks out of the Federal Courthouse in Seattle on Thursday after he pleaded not guilty to illegally possessing a firearm. His son Jaylen used the gun to kill four classmates last year . Support: Fryberg, who is accused of lying about whether he had a restraining order against him when he bought the gun in January 2013, attended court with eight friends and family members . He allegedly bought the firearm from a gun shop and answered 'no' on the federal firearms purchasing form when asked if he was the subject of a restraining order that prohibits him from 'harassing, stalking or threatening your child or an intimate partner'. Fryberg's lawyer, John Henry Browne, previously said that 'there was never an order prohibiting him from owning or even purchasing firearms' from the tribal court. The issue in court will be whether he lied on the federal purchasing form, Browne said. Michael Lee, a lawyer with Browne's firm who attended the arraignment, said 'there is a distinction between what comes from a state court and a tribal court' in terms of restrictions placed on the subject of the order. Lee said they would secure the tribal order through discovery to make that point. Had the protection order been filed in a state court instead of the tribal court, it would have been entered into a criminal records database and would have surfaced during a background check. Gunman: Jaylen Fryberg, a freshman, shot dead four of his classmates then himself last October . But the order was never entered into any state or federal criminal databases because of a flawed reporting system between tribes and outside authorities. Tribes have long called on the federal government to fix this problem or provide access to the databases so they can enter the orders themselves. After The Associated Press reported on the problem last week, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it would host a conference in August with the tribes to try to resolve the problem. A federal grand jury issued an indictment on April 8 charging Fryberg with a single count of unlawful possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. Fryberg was released from custody on the condition that he attends his court hearings and stays away from guns. Victims: The shooter's cousin Andrew Fryberg , 15, (left) was killed, as was girlfriend Zoe Galasso, 14 (right). Reports suggested that the shooter had a crush on Galasso and was upset she was dating his cousin . Victims: Gia Soriano, left, and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, both 14, died days after the attack from gun wounds . Hit: Nate Hatch was also shot in the jaw but he survived and has recovered. He is pictured three months ago . He appeared in court on Thursday flanked by eight friends and family members. He declined to speak with reporters. If he is convicted on the charge, he faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. U.S. Magistrate Judge Mary Alice Theiler set his trial for June 22. Fryberg's son, 15-year-old Jaylen, used the gun to kill four friends and wound another in the cafeteria of the Marysville-Pilchuck High School after inviting them to lunch on October 24, 2014. The well-liked freshman who had recently been a Homecoming prince, shot dead Gia Soriano, Zoe Galasso and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, all 14, and Andrew Fryberg, 15. He also shot 14-year-old Nate Hatch in the jaw, but the teenager survived and has recovered.","Raymond Lee Fryberg Jr. 'bought a gun in 2013 despite a domestic violence protection order against him banning him from doing so'

"Police are investigating a Tory MP over claims he attempted to bribe voters with chocolate cake. Jesse Norman allegedly gave out cake while campaigning for re-election at an Asda supermarket in his Hereford constituency.

Scroll down for video . CLAIM: MP Jesse Norman is being investigated by police over claims he attempted to 'bribe' voters with chocolate cake, pictured above . Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2. He described the allegations as ‘nonsense’, saying: ‘We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children, who are not even voters.’ The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year. The 57-year-old has criticised the 'absolutely ridiculous'  investigation after he was told he will face no further action. Mr Rose said: 'The officers told me today that I have now entered the political world and I must no longer hand out sausage rolls. 'They told me I have got to watch anything I do. So I'm going to stay away from bakeries from now on - if I see one I'm going to run a mile.'

Students at Wellington College, in Berkshire, spent the last year studying a different classic book for their imminent AS-level exam. The mistake only came to light when mock papers arrived and no exam questions related to the taught text. Prestigious: A spokeswoman for the school, which charges £33,000-a-year, said parents had been satisfied by the prompt actions of the school after staff discovered they had been teaching the wrong English text . Now pupils will have to cram their studying into just a few weeks with extra lessons put in place by the school. Sources close to the school, which proudly boasts to be the Best Public School in the Tatler Schools Guide 2014 on its website, said students were left devastated by the blunder. The mistake is believed to have occurred when a teacher changed a text on a spreadsheet without notifying other staff. According to The Sun, the college, whose alumni includes Will Young, Rory Bremner and Made in Chelsea's Caggie Dunlop, apologised for the error but would not name the works of literature involved. Stumped: Students at the posh school are said to be upset by the blunder which has seen nearly a year of hard work go to waste (file photo) A spokeswoman said: 'Only one AS-level English text was wrong out of several. This happened two months before the exam is due to take place. 'A programme of extra lessons was immediately put in place. Students and parents expressed satisfaction with the prompt way the school addressed this. 'The school is running an investigation to see what has happened. No teacher has been sacked. Wellington College is sorry this mistake happened.'","Teacher blunder revealed when mock exam arrived and text didn't feature .

"Hillary Clinton has garnered one of her first major endorsements in run bid for the White House: The nation's largest lesbian political action committee. The group, LPAC, launched Lesbians4Hillary on Monday to support the former First Lady's bid to become the nation's first female president. Lesbians4Hillary, co-chaired by pioneering tennis great Billie Jean King, said: 'Hillary Clinton is a proven leader and she has a strong track record when it comes to inclusion -- specifically for women and the LGBTQ community. Scroll down for video . Tennis star Billie Jean King (right) is co-chairing the Lesbians4Hillary campaign. King, pictured with Clinton in 2008, helped run the former Fiirst Lady's 2008 Women for Hillary Clinton wing . King, pictured with Clinton in 2001, said: 'Hillary Clinton is a proven leader and she has a strong track record when it comes to inclusion -- specifically for women and the LGBTQ community' 'Her entire career has been a road map to get her to this moment and she has earned my respect and my vote to become the next President of the United States of America. I am honored to join LPAC and help lead our effort to elect Hillary Clinton in 2016.' King, who was outed as a lesbian in 1981, was a leader of the group 'Women for Hillary' in 2008, as well. The video in which Hillary announced she was running for president included a clip of a lesbian couple . The Twitter handle for the new group is @lezs4hillary . Many gays and lesbians point to Clinton's 2011 speech in Switzerland as Secretary of State in which she declared: 'Human rights are gay rights and gay rights are human rights.' In the video released yesterday announcing Clinton's candidacy for president, two gay couples were included. Among them, two lesbians who look lovingly into each other's eyes. However, in her 2008 campaign, Clinton did not support gay marriage. It took her five years - to publicly say that she supported gay marriage. President Barack Obama publicly announced his support for gay marriage nearly a year earlier in March 2012. The Economist called Clinton's stance on gay marriage, 'cautious to the point of cowardice.' 'It is not convincing to argue, as her supporters do, that she is only free to make her views known now that she has stepped down as America's chief diplomat. Her successor at the State Department, John Kerry, and has not been stoned as a blasphemer on any of his stops around the world to date,' the magazine's US columnist wrote. Critics also point out that as First Lady, she did not oppose her husband signing 'Don't Ask Don't Tell,' which banned being openly gay in the military or the Defense of Marriage Act, which banned gay marriage at the federal level.","LPAC, a pro-LGBT Super PAC, launched Lesbians4Hillary on Monday .

"It looks like a cross between a catamaran and a hovercraft, but these strange vehicles are actually new new type of aircraft developed in China. Two prototypes of the CYG-11 seaplane were tested this week over the sea off the coast of Haikou in Hainan Province in China. The aircraft is believed to be a joint project between Russia and China to build new types of super-efficient seaplane. The CYG-11 seaplane (above) uses reduced drag and increased lift from wing-in-ground effect to glide . The vehicles takes advantage of an aerodynamic phenomenon known as the wing-in-ground effect - where lift is increased and drag decreased when an aircraft's wings are close to the ground. Length: 13m . Wingspan: 15.6 m . Weight: 3800 kg . Seats: 12 people . Maximum load: 1200 kg . Maximum range: 1500 km . Flight speed: 175 - 250 km/h . Flight height: 3-5 m . Wave height: 1.25 - 3 m . By placing the wings low on the fuselage of the aircraft, this effect is increased and the the result is an aircraft that essentially floats on a cushion of air. Engineers behind the CNY 5 billion (£500 million) project say the aircraft are capable of flying 62 miles (100 km) on 28 litres of fuel. With a maximum range of 930 miles (1,500 km), the aircraft can reach a top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h). The aircraft races over the wavetops at a height of between three to five metres (9-15 feet). The CYG-11 aircraft, which have been developed by the Hainan Yingge Wing in Ground Effect Craft Manufacturing Company with Russian engineers, can carry 10 passengers plus two flight crew. The company claims to have just finished building a larger version of the aircraft capable of carrying 40 people, but it hopes to develop bigger aircraft capable of carrying between 55 and 120 passengers. The Hainan Yingge Wing in Ground Effect Craft Manufacturing Company tested two prototypes of the plane . The prototypes are designed to carry two pilots (above) and 10 passengers but larger craft are in development . The plane can be used like a catamaran initially until it builds up enough speed to lift off from the ocean . It says the aircraft could find uses for coastal defence, customs patrols and perhaps even be used as the public transport of the future along 'marine highways'. Gu Jianxin, a spokesman for the company, told the Southern Metropolis Daily: 'The current technology research and development has matured into mass production. 'The main plan is to invest in tourism, freight , maritime search and rescue and other aspects.' The CYG-11 (above) has been developed with Russian engineers and could be used to patrol coastlines . The aircraft (above) is designed to fly at low level between 3 m and 5 m above the surface of the ocean . Engineers say the aircraft (above) could even provide public transport of the future along 'marine highways' He estimates that it will cost around $20 million dollars for each vessel. Powered by two large propellers at the front of the aircraft, the CYG-11 can be driven in the sea much like a catamaran. Once it reaches flight speed the aircraft's wings will begin to lift it off the ocean and it will glide along on a cushion of air. Huang Dong, one of the pilots who flew the aircraft during the tests, said: 'It felt like when you ride a motorboat then the feeling is just as comfortable as sitting on a plane. There are no boat bumps.' The company are developing larger aircraft that they hope will be able to carry up to 120 passengers .","Two prototype aircraft were tested off the coast of Haikou, in the Hainan Province of China .

"Trevor Noah doesn't take over as Daily Show host until later this year, but he's already ingratiating himself with American comedy royalty. The South African, whose announcement as Jon Stewart's replacement surprized many last month, was spotted taking in a baseball game in New York on Monday along with Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David and broadway star Matthew Broadrick. The quartet were all present at Citi Field in Queens to watch the game between the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies. Scroll down for video . PR exercise? Trevor Noah was photographed on Monday at Citi Field along with Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David as the New York Mets took on the Philadelphia Phillies during Opening Day . Broadway star Matthew Broderick was also present as the South African comedian came to grips with that most American of pasttimes . Earlier Noah and Seinfeld had been photographed filming a segment for Seinfeld's acclaimed Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee online series. The pair were filmed walking around the DUMBO neighbourhood of Brooklyn and behind the wheel of a white Ferrari. Noah's very public appearance with New York Jewish comedy royalty comes not long after he was accused of anti-Semitism in the wake of his surprise promotion to Daily Show host. Cynics might wonder if Monday's very public appearance with Seinfield and David was a concerted move to combat that negative publicity but alternatively perhaps the comedian is undertaking a crash course in learning about American culture. His successor Stewart had an infamous obsession with the Mets that became a long-running joke on the Daily Show for over a decade. Noah, who is little-known in the US, rocketed to national fame last month after he was named as longtime host Stewart's replacement on the satirical news program. Earlier Noah and Seinfeld had been photographed filming a segment for Seinfeld's acclaimed Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee online series . Noah and Seinfeld were filmed walking around the DUMBO neighbourhood of Brooklyn and behind the wheel of a white Ferrari . However, the excitement surrounding the announcement was tinged by hundreds of internet users accusing the 31-year-old - who is a quarter Jewish - of anti-Semitism for a series of 'offensive' posts. The comedian quickly apologized and told his two million followers: 'To reduce my views to a handful of jokes that didn't land is not a true reflection of my character, nor my evolution as a comedian.' It comes as Comedy Central, which hired Noah as a correspondent on the show just three months ago, has defended its newest star as a 'provocative' comedian who 'spares noone, himself included'. In a statement, the network said: 'To judge him or his comedy based on a handful of jokes is unfair.' It added: 'Trevor is a talented comedian with a bright future at Comedy Central.' Noah, the son of a half-Jewish Xhosa mother and a Swiss father, drew fire for jokes that were described as tasteless, hateful, and unfunny. The controversial tweets were posted between 2009 and 2014. In May last year, Noah tweeted: 'Behind every successful Rap Billionaire is a double as rich Jewish man. #BeatsByDreidel.' Noah's very public appearance with New York Jewish comedy royalty comes not long after he was accused of anti-Semitism in the wake of his surprise promotion to Daily Show host . 'Not a true reflection': In a tweet earleir this month, Noah told his two million followers: 'To reduce my views to a handful of jokes that didn't land is not a true reflection of my character, nor my evolution as a comedian' A year earlier, he posted: 'Note to self - Langostines are not Jewish prawns.' Meanwhile, during a soccer match in January 2012, he joked: 'Messi gets the ball and the real players try foul him, but Messi doesn't go down easy, just like jewish chicks. #ElClasico.' He also slammed the United States' midsection in a 2013 tweet, writing that 'When flying over the middle of America the turbulence is so bad. It's like all the ignorance is rising through the air.' And in 2009, Noah, who can speak an impressive six languages, wrote: 'Almost bumped a Jewish kid crossing the road. He didn't look b4 crossing but I still would hav felt so bad in my german car!' On Tuesday, the tweets were being posted online by enraged bloggers, who slammed Noah as 'racist'. One said: 'Jon Stewart, born Leibowitz, won't be happy about these highly antisemitic tweets.' Stewart has voiced his full support for his successor, calling the incoming host 'incredibly thoughtful and considerate and funny and smart.' He promised that Noah 'will earn your trust and respect. Or not. Just as I earned your trust and respect. Or did not.' More seriously, he said if viewers give Noah the chance to prove himself, 'it's going to be well worth it.'","The South African comedian, whose announcement as Jon Stewart's replacement surprized many, was spotted at Citi Field on Monday .

"Sean Heslop, pictured, has been suspended as executive principal of two schools over allegations that a former pupil is expecting his baby . One of Britain’s top headmasters has been arrested after he allegedly began a relationship with a former pupil now said to be pregnant with his child. Cambridge-educated Sean Heslop, 47, was questioned on suspicion of abusing his position of trust after claims about the affair came to light last month. Mr Heslop, who separated from his wife last year, has been suspended from his job as executive principal of two academy schools in Kent. But a family member claimed he was ‘the happiest he’s ever been’ as he was looking forward to becoming a father this summer. The former pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, became pregnant at the end of last year after leaving school and starting at a London university. The woman, who is now 18, described herself as a ‘mummy-to-be’ on one social media page and posted online a picture of the three-month scan of her unborn child. She wrote that she was ‘in a loving relationship’ and had a lot of support, but said some people were quick to judge her because she was a pregnant teenager. The ex-pupil recounted in a blog how her former headmaster came to visit her at university after she began her degree last September. Mr Heslop split from his Canadian wife Celine, 44, in the autumn after nine years of marriage. He has not been seen at the £850,000 home they shared in Battersea, south-west London, for several months. ‘Sean is the happiest he’s ever been because he’s going to be a dad. They are really excited and he is so happy to be a father,’ an unnamed relative told The Sun. Mr Heslop was educated at Queens’ College, Cambridge, before completing a teacher-training course at King’s College London. The woman, a former pupil at one of the schools Mr Heslop was in charge of, has reportedly been boasting online to friends that she is going to be a mother (pictured, a scan of her child) Despite the police investigation, Mr Heslop is 'the happiest he has ever been' according to sources close to him because he is 'going to be a father' He worked as an English teacher at a top grammar school in Barnet, north London, before becoming head of English at another leading grammar in Orpington, south London. In 2004, he was appointed head of Tiffin boys’ grammar in Kingston, south-west London. Under his leadership it was one of the first schools in the country to be rated ‘outstanding’ in every category by Ofsted. While there he was criticised by some parents for dramatically reducing the amount of homework given to pupils, so they would have more time to develop their own interests. There was also controversy after it emerged the school had spent all of its £800,000 reserves in four years, plunging it into financial crisis. In 2009, he took over the running of the Folkestone Academy in Kent on a salary estimated at more than £100,000 a year. He was also given responsibility for the Marlowe Academy in nearby Ramsgate at the end of 2013. The 47-year-old has been questioned by detectives over allegations of abuse of trust and has been released on police bail . Mr Heslop was appointed as executive principal at the Marlowe Academy in Ramsgate Kent, pictured, in 2013 . Parents of pupils at the two schools were informed of his suspension in letters last week, but were not told the reason. The governors said in a statement: ‘The executive principal of the Folkestone and Marlowe Academies has been suspended from his duties. An investigation remains ongoing, the nature of which is confidential. ‘This has not interfered with and will not inhibit the good work going on in the schools, where the respective head teachers and their senior leadership teams ensure that teaching and other school activities continue as normal and that school routine is unaffected.’ A Kent Police spokesman said: ‘On March 31 police arrested a 47-year-old man on suspicion of abuse of a position of trust. ‘He was later released on bail until July 30 pending further investigation.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Sean Heslop has been questioned by detectives over the allegations .

"The Justice Department said Tuesday it has opened a civil rights investigation into the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who suffered a fatal spinal-cord injury under mysterious circumstances after he was handcuffed and put in the back of a police van. Baltimore police officials, meanwhile, released the names of six officers who were involved in the arrest and the van transport of the 25-year-old and who've been suspended pending an investigation. But the developments were cold comfort to hundreds of residents who on Tuesday evening took to the streets of West Baltimore to protest the police force in Gray's name. Taking to the streets: Protestors again took to the streets of Baltimore on Tuesday to demonstrate against city police following the death of Freddie Gray, 25 . Federal investigation: The protets erupted just as the Justice department announced it had launched an investigation in the the 25-year-old's mysterious death . Vigil: Rev.

The protesters rallied site of Gray's arrest and then marched to a police department a couple of blocks away, chanting and holding signs that read: 'Black Lives Matter' and 'No Justice, No Peace' - slogans that have come embody what demonstrators believe is widespread mistreatment of blacks by police. The crowd outside the Western District Police Station on Tuesday included 53-year-old Pricilla Jackson, carrying a sign reading, 'Convict Freddie's killers.' The sign lists the names of the six officers, who've been suspended with pay. The suspended officers were identified as: . Freddie Gray died Sunday after he 'had his spine 80 percent severed at his neck' during an arrest in Baltimore last Sunday . Also on Tuesday: City officials released the names of six cops who were involved in Gray's arrest. They've all been suspended with pay as the investigation continues .

Officers William Porter and Edward Nero and Garrett Miller, who all joined in 2012. Police on horseback were helping to control the crowd and at least one person was detained - an activist who jumped past police barriers - as protesters filled a street the length of a city block. Gray was taken into custody April 12 after police 'made eye contact' with him and another man in an area known for drug activity and the two started running, Baltimore police said. Gray was handcuffed and put in a transport van. At some point during his roughly 30-minute ride, the van was stopped and Gray's legs were shackled when an officer felt he was becoming 'irate,' police said. Protestors raise their fists and candles in solidarity on the streets of West Baltimore to protest the police force in Gray's name . Children and adults alike gather to protest over the death of Gray, 25, who died from spinal injuries on April 19, one week after being taken into police custody . Rev.

A protester holds up a sign which read: 'Black lives matter. Justice 4 Freddie' Two people walk towards Baltimore Police Department's Western District police station during the march while one holds a sign which says 'Justice 4 Freddie' Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said that Gray asked for an inhaler, and then several times asked for medical care. He was eventually rushed by ambulance to a hospital. Gray died Sunday - a week after his arrest - of what Deputy Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez described as 'a significant spinal injury.' Exactly how he was injured and what happened in the van is still not known. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said investigators are 'gathering information to determine whether any prosecutable civil rights violation occurred.' It's not uncommon for federal investigators to look into allegations of excessive police force. Justice Department investigations in the last year include probes into the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri - a case that resulted in no charges against the officer - and an ongoing review of a police chokehold death of a New York City man. There's a high threshold for bringing federal civil rights charges against police officers in such cases. Federal investigators must show an officer willfully deprived a person of his or her civil rights by using more force than the law allows, a standard that's challenging in rapidly unfolding confrontations in which snap judgments are made.

Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (right, with Police Commissioner Anthony Batts) said that she is frustrated by the lack of answers given in the police report . In the Baltimore case, six police officers have been suspended with pay while local authorities also look into the death. The officers have been on the force anywhere from three years to 18 years. According to court documents, Officer Garrett Miller accused Gray of carrying a switchblade, which was discovered in Gray's pocket after he was stopped. The lawyer for Gray's family said he believes the police had no reason to stop him. 'They've made concessions on lack of probable cause,' attorney Billy Murphy said. 'Running while black is not probable cause. Felony running doesn't exist, and you can't arrest someone for looking you in the eye.' Kim Deachilla, a spokeswoman for the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3, said a law firm that contracts with the union is representing them. The officers' specific roles in the arrest were not released by city officials. Bystander video of the arrest shows officers on bicycles, in patrol cars and outside the transport van. Batts said the reason for Gray's stop is 'a question we have to dig into.' Gray's death has prompted daily protests and a vigil was planned Tuesday evening at the spot where he was arrested. About 100 people had gathered around the start of the rally. Video shows Gray screaming out in pain as he is taken to the van. Spectators thought he had broken legs though police said an autopsy showed he did not . In a video of the arrest, it appears the officers dragged Gray to a police van while he screamed out in pain . Gray died on Sunday morning at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center from his spinal injuries . Harold Perry, 73, a retired small businessman who is nearly blind, said he heard the arrest through his bedroom window. A young man was screaming 'You're hurting me! Get your knee off my back,' Perry said. He said he also heard the young man say, 'I'm an asthmatic.' In the bystander video, Gray is screaming, but it's not clear what he is saying. Capt. Eric Kowalczyk, a department spokesman, said Batts met with all six officers involved in Gray's arrest on Monday. The Baltimore Sun first reported the meeting. At a news conference Monday, officials vowed transparency and pledged to hold those found responsible accountable. Batts said the investigation will be completed by May 1 and the results will be sent to the state attorney's office to determine whether criminal charges will be filed. Batts also said he is ordering that police review and rewrite 'effective immediately' its policies on moving prisoners and providing them with medical attention. News crews meet protesters holding up homemade signs with slogans such as 'Black lives matter' and 'Justice 4 Freddie' Citizens and groups including Justice League of NYC took to the streets Monday to protest following the death of Gray .

"A father who is feared to have fled to Syria with his partner and four young children was a member of a banned extremist group, it was reported last night. Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, their daughter Zoha, seven, and their three sons Essa, four, Zakariva, two, and Yahya, one, were all caught on camera on a cross-Channel ferry. They left their home in Slough, Berkshire, without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to family members, which is out of character, police said. Scroll down for video . Detectives have released CCTV footage of   Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four young children, who have been reported missing from Britain, at a busy ferry port as they apparently head to Syria . Police say Mr Malik (pictured with one of his young children) had told his family he wanted to 'go and live in a Muslim country' and the family left without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to relatives, it is claimed . Members of Mr Malik's family tonight said they had been left 'completely devastated' and issued a desperate plea for the six to return home. In a statement, they said: 'We are totally distraught, upset and in shock' Police have warned that the Muslim family, who were last seen in Slough, Berkshire on April 7, may be heading to Syria. They are pictured at Dover port before catching a ferry to Calais, France on April 8 . The family, from Slough in Berkshire, are believed to have boarded the Dover to Calais ferry just after midnight on April 8 before travelling south through Europe including to Budapest in Hungary on April 12 . Protest: Malik, seen holding the 'hands off Muslims!' sign, outside Regents Park Mosque last year - next to him is Abu Rumaysah who jumped bail to flee to Syria . But radical preacher Anjem Choudary said yesterday Malik was a member of the banned group Al-Muhajiroun and a 'champion for sharia' who regularly attended the group's demonstrations. Neighbours said the family were known to police and had been questioned on suspicion of terrorist involvement four years ago. Uniformed police waited for the family for three days before talking to them, they said. There will now be questions for police after they failed to stop a suspected extremist from slipping out of the country with his family. Choudary said Malik remained 'very influential in the community' after Al-Muhajiroun was banned five years ago. 'Back in the day he was a member until the group was banned. He was still part of our demonstrations and lectures but I hadn't seen him for a few months,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 'Asif is a very good friend of mine. I haven't seen him for a while but from what I gather in the reports he and his family have left the country.' He added: 'He is a very studious man, a very good Muslim character. He was always a champion for sharia and is very influential in the community.' Choudary also criticised the Government for trying to restrict British Muslims from travelling to Syria. 'I think they want to live under sharia and escape the oppressive life they have in this country and under this government,' he added.

Zoha Malik (left), seven, and Essa Malik (right), four, are among the family's four children who are missing . The family were last seen on Tuesday, April 7, and were captured on CCTV boarding a ferry from Dover to Calais on Wednesday, April 8. They are believed to have travelled south through Europe by train and were seen in Budapest on Sunday, April 12, before making their way to Turkey. Relatives reported them missing to police on Thursday and officers are concerned they may be seeking to travel to Syria. Last night, Malik's family said they were 'completely devastated' by the family's sudden decision to leave Britain. 'All we wish for is your safe return and especially the return of the children. We are not angry with you, we are just heartbroken,' they said in an appeal to him. Zakariya Malik (left), two, and Yhaya Malik (right), one, were last seen with their family in Berkshire on April 7 . Mr Malik and Miss Kiran's last known address in Slough was in this block of flats (pictured on the left, above) Neighbours said today that police had broken down the door on Thursday night to enter the family's home . Thames Valley Police's Acting Deputy Chief Constable, John Campbell, said it was a 'real concern' they had reached Syria. 'I'm not suggesting for one moment that they are intending to join Islamic State,' he said. 'At the same time we know that [relatives] have voiced some concerns about the family's intentions. There's been a suggestion that [Malik] in the past has said that he would like to live in a Muslim state.' Acting deputy chief constable John Campbell (pictured at a press conference in Kidlington today) said Thames Valley Police is 'extremely concerned for the safety of this family, especially the four young children' The alarm was raised when some of the children failed to attend Claycots Primary School in Slough . Yesterday, the family's next-door neighbour said they had been in trouble with the police four years ago. He added: 'People were saying that they were extremists and that police were listening in on their phone calls. I think they were under surveillance. 'The police sat in the stairwell for three days waiting for them. 'It's such a shame. Those kids are now in danger because of what their parents believe in.'","Asif Malik, 31, Sara Kiran, 29, and their four children last seen on April 7 .

"A third-grade teacher and married mother of three from Florida has been charged with selling acid and Xanax pills to an undercover officer with her 20-year-old boyfriend. Cheryl Heineman, 45, from St Cloud, was arrested Wednesday at Central Avenue Elementary School in Kissimmee on multiple counts of sale and delivery of narcotics. The woman's suspected accomplice and lover, 20-year-old Jack Lindsey, is facing the same charges. Scroll down for video . Breaking Bad: Cheryl Heineman (left), 45, a third-grade teacher from Florida, is accused of selling narcotics to an undercover officer with her 20-year-old lover, Jack Lindsey (right) Hauled off to jail: Heineman was arrested Wednesday outside Central Avenue Elementary School in Kissimmee, where she's worked since 2005 . The arrests came at the conclusion of a six-week investigation that was launched in early March after an informant tipped off police that Lindsey has been known to deal drugs. According to a 26-page arrest affidavit, an undercover detective contacted Lindsey late last month asking to purchase acid and Xanax. The officer stated that he had bought various controlled substances - Xanax, hydrocodone, tramadol, oxycodone, ecstasy and methamphetamine - from the suspect on three previous occasions. Investigators believe that Heineman, who is married and has three sons, had a romantic relationship with Lindsey and would act as his driver on drug deals, reported WKMG. Lindsey arranged a meeting March 25 with the undercover officer acting as a buyer in the parking lot of the Tractor Supply store on 13th Street in St Cloud, telling him that 'his girl' would deliver the product. Partners in crime: According to police, Lindsey set up a drug deal last month, telling an undercover cop acting as a buyer that 'his girl,' Heineman will deliver the pills .

"An airline passenger who was stabbed with a pen by a woman sitting next to him because he was snoring compared the bizarre attack to being 'stung by bees'. Lenny Mordarski, 68, was viciously poked with the blue ballpoint before take off on the Southwest Airlines flight from Chicago to Manchester, New Hampshire on Thursday. He told ABC7: 'Imagine being asleep and then being stung by bees, and then waking up and going owww.' He added: 'She was smirking... I mean, she said zero at this point, and I just kind of, and all I wanted to do was not be sitting next to her.' Scroll down for video . Lenny Mordarski, 68, was viciously poked with the blue ballpoint on a flight to New Hampshire on Thursday because he fell asleep and was snoring before take-off . Lenny Mordarski, 68, described the attack by a female passenger to 'being stung by bees... owww!' The woman was removed from the flight following the air rage incident and put on a later flight out of Chicago . Crew appear to pass the pen used by the female passenger in the assault on fellow traveler as he slept . The woman, dubbed 'Psycho Pen Lady' by another fellow passenger, was removed from the flight. The Southwest Airlines flight which was scheduled to leave  Midway International Airport at 1.15pm was delayed for almost two hours due to the 'disturbance'. The Chicago Fire Department was called to evaluate Mr Modarkski after he was stabbed in the arm. Mr Mordarski said he would not be pressing charges following the incident. His best friend, photographer Michael Sutton, said the pen stabbing began after Lenny's arm brushed up against the woman while he slept. Mr Sutton, 41, told Daily Mail Online: 'She took her pen and stabbed his arm several times causing him to yell out in pain. 'The pilot ordered the plane back to the gate to escort he off the flight where we gave a statement and she was removed for endangerment. 'Luckily he wore a thick long sleeve shirt or there would have been blood. He will have a few bruises in the morning. 'The passengers cheered when they heard she wasn't coming back on.' Southwest Airlines supplied the men with free gin and tonics and when the plane landed, a flight attendant said: 'Please keep your writing utensils to yourself and have a great day'. The woman was allegedly 'smirking' when she was removed from the plane. Southwest accommodated her on another flight. In a statement to Daily Mail Online, South West Airlines said: 'A customer on flight 577 was removed from the flight before takeoff after poking her seatmate in the arm with a pen.

"When complete strangers Niamh Geaney, 26, and Karen Branigan, 29, discovered they looked so alike that they could be identical twins earlier this week, they made headlines around the world. But the Irish pair aren't the only unrelated twosome to boast real life doppelgängers - and the celebrity world is no exception. Whether actresses Liz Hurley, 49, and Jacqueline Bissett, 70, or model David Gandy, 35, and soap star Dean Gaffney, 37, there's no shortage of Hollywood lookalikes. Among the more unlikely pairings is Hunger Games star Josh Hutcherson, 22, who stunned film fans when he stepped out at a première in Spain this week bearing a striking resemblance to James Alexandrou, 30, an actor best known for his role as Martin Fowler in Eastenders. Scroll down for video . Oi, Pat! Martin's in the Hunger Games! Josh Hutcherson arrives at a première in Madrid looking remarkably like Walford's Martin Fowler .

Looking a long way from Panem, Hutcherson's chubbier cheeks, darker hair and stubbled chin gave him a distinctly Walford-worthy appearance, which was only emphasised when the night concluded with the 22-year-old having what looked like a heated argument with girlfriend Claudia Traisac. But the Hutcherson-Alexandrou pairing isn't the only set of twins to emerge from Eastenders, which produces a remarkable number of stars who bear a striking resemblance to Tinseltown's finest. Other unlikely double acts include TV hard man Ross Kemp, 50, who played Grant Mitchell in the long-running soap and who, with his stern expression and shaved head, looks strikingly similar to Hollywood hard man Bruce Willis, 60.

"He was once the most powerful man in the world, but former US President Bill Clinton says he believes he should take a more backstage role should his wife, Hillary, decide to run for President. In an interview with Town & Country Magazine, the 68-year-old revealed that he believes he has lost his natural flair for political campaigning, adding that becoming a grandparent to his daughter Chelsea's six-month-old daughter Charlotte has tamed the angry side of his personality which once helped to propel him to victory. 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody. I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad.' he said. Scroll down for video . Back seat? President Clinton plans to stay out of the limelight if and when Hillary Clinton launches her expected run for president, he tells Town and Country Magazine in a new interview . Doting grandparents: The Clintons had long spoken of their desire to have a grandchild - a dream which came true last year when their daughter Chelsea gave birth to baby Charlotte (pictured) Undecided role: 'I've told Hillary that I don't think I'm good [at campaigning] anymore because I'm not mad at anybody. I'm a grandfather, and I got to see my granddaughter last night, and I can't be mad,' he said . 'I think it's important, and Hillary does too, that she go out there as if she's never run for anything before and establish her connection with the voters and that my role should primarily be as a backstage adviser to her until we get much, much closer to the election.' The interview provides a rare inside look at the couple's mindset ahead of a widely expected impending presidential announcement. According to reports, Mrs Clinton is currently in the process of preparing to launch her bid within the next two weeks, and she's rumored to have already signed a lease for her campaign office in Brooklyn. However, she has to officially declare as a candidate within the next two weeks if she is going to run. If Mrs Clinton is elected, the former President added that his wife 'would have to assess what she wants me to do'. In addition to his new, calmer outlook on life, former President Clinton may have other reasons for wanting to avoid playing an active part in his wife's campaign. Ready for more? Mrs Clinton is widely expected to launch a bid within the next two weeks . Looking back: The former President's role in Hillary's 2008 campaign was reportedly a source of great tension in the Clinton camp . According to reports at the time, his role in his wife's 2008 campaign was a source of great tension in the Clinton camp. Many of his political advisers joined her campaign, and some of them didn't get on with Mrs Clinton's staff. And this time around, Mrs Clinton is thought to be off on a good foot, holding a substantial lead over her fellow Democrats, as well as a top spot in general election polling. Mr Clinton added that the couple has not discussed what her campaign – or her potential election – would mean for their philanthropic foundation. 'We might have to change the [foundation] rules again. But we haven't talked about that yet, and I don't think we should,' he said. 'You can't. It's hard for any party to hang onto the White House for 12 years, and it's a long road. A thousand things could happen.' Whatever occurs, Mr Clinton's priority is to keep the foundation alive whether he's running it or not. Outspoken: The former President previously sparked controversy on his wife's campaign trail, including with remarks about President Obama's 2008 campaign being a 'fairytale' ahead of the South Carolina primary . Groundbreaking: Mrs Clinton has the chance to become the first female president in American history, which would make former President Clinton as the 'First Man' The Bill effect: Mrs Clinton is ahead in the polls and it is thought that the Democrats would like to see her run for the White House. The family is pictured at former President Clinton's second inauguration . The Clinton Foundation is running 3,100 projects around the world, affecting the lives of 430 million people. The former President has spoken about life as a grandfather and how watching baby Charlotte grow has been 'a hoot'. 'It's amazing,' Mr Clinton said on the Ellen Show towards the end of last year. 'Hillary and I only have one child and she's quite wonderful, but it's been a long time since she's been that age.' Meanwhile, daughter Chelsea has said her parents are totally involved in their granddaughter's life, all the way down to changing diapers. She told Jimmy Kimmel that they are  embracing their new roles as grandma and grandpa Clinton. 'They're changing diapers, reading to her, helping her go to sleep at night,' she said. 'It's just been such a joy for me to watch them sort of rediscover that part of their lives and to watch them as grandparents.'","Former First Lady Hillary Clinton has not announced whether or not she will run for President .

"A historic SpaceX launch that could change the way man gets to space blasted off today from Florida under perfect conditions. Within minutes of liftoff, the California company  was making its third attempt to land the leftover booster on an ocean platform. But it didn't go to plan. Billionaire founder, Elon Musk, tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.' Scroll down for video . The booster appears to have landed but Elon Musk said that 'excess lateral velocity' caused it to tip over . SpaceX said it will post a video in the next few days, but images tweeted by Musk reveal that the booster landed successfully. The impact of landing, however, caused it to tip over destroying the lower part of the rocket. Landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand. Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks another step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference. Elon Musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to Earth. Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year . The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic ocean . While the booster landing didn't go to plane, the launch was successful. It took place at 4.10 ET from Florida under perfect conditions, after a attempt had to be scrubbed on Monday due to lightning . The 208ft (63 metre) tall Falcon 9 rocket, carrying a Dragon capsule, thundered off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 4:10 p.m. The Falcon 9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing and science experiments to the ISS - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts. The supplies should arrive the six space station astronauts on Friday. The rocket was was due to take off yesterday, but the launch was  scrubbed due to bad weather. On board the Dragon capsule is an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. The Italians in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee-drinking in space. SpaceX, meanwhile, hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first-stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. The Dragon - the only supply ship capable of returning items intact - will remain at the ISS until around May 21 . At liftoff time, the orbiting lab was soaring over Australia. The delivery of food and equipment will arrive Friday . Soon after the launch, Elon Musk tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival' Dragon, the SpaceX supply ship, holds more than 4,000 pounds of food, science experiments and equipment for the six space station astronauts . Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions.' The Dragon — the only supply ship capable of returning items intact — will remain at the space station until around May 21. During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform. A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs . The launch sequence as it happened. All stages of the launch went to plan, except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand . On board the Dragon capsule is an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy . The ISSpresso machine uses a normal Lavazza coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine. Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated. The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. As well as the espresso machine, the SpaceX Dragon supply ship also holds experiments for Nasa's one-year space station resident Scott Kelly, who moved in a couple weeks ago. Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko also will remain on board until March 2016. This will be the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit. The company also is working on a heavy-lift version of the Falcon rocket, which uses 27 engines, compared to the nine currently flying. The Falcon Heavy is expected to make its first test flight late this year. At Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex 40, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket stands ready to boost a Dragon capsule on its fifth commercial resupply mission. This image was taken on Monday, before the attempt was scrubbed due to bad weather . This was Space X' third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge.

"Officials at an elementary school in Maine have come under fire for teaching students about transgender issues without first seeking the approval of parents. During a lesson on tolerance and acceptance, children at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point were read I Am Jazz, a book about a child 'with a boy's body and a girl's brain' who eventually finds a doctor that tells the family the boy is a transgender. Some parents are unhappy with the school after they say their children came home with questions about gender and wondering if they too might be trans. I Am Jazz is a book about a child 'with a boy's body and a girl's brain' who eventually finds a doctor that tells the family the boy is a transgender . One unnamed mom was so angry she contacted conservative pundit Sean Hannity after she felt that the school ignored her initial complaint. 'I feel like my thoughts, feelings and beliefs were completely ignored….My right as a parent to allow or not allow this discussion with my child was taken from me. It is very upsetting to me that I didn't have an option at all,' she told Hannity.com. 'When I spoke with the principal he was very cold about it. It's amazing how thoughtless the school has been with this whole thing.' The mother claims that lesson prompted her 7-year-old son to start asking a lot of questions and questioning if he might be trans - something that he had never previously spoken about. 'I was taken aback by it… Being seven, once you put something in their mind they don't forget so easily,' she said. In the wake of Hannity contacting the school asking for clarity, officals have now apologized. Allyn Hutton, the superintendent of the local district, said she supported the reading of the book but admitted that parents should have been first notified. Officials at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point, Maine, have come under fire for teaching students about transgender issues . Allyn Hutton, the superintendent of the local district, admitted that parents should have been first notified . 'We have a practice of if a topic is considered sensitive, parents should be informed. In this situation, that didn't happen,' she said. 'The whole culture at Mitchell School is about teaching tolerance and respect. The people presenting the lesson thought [I Am Jazz] was one more piece of teaching that lesson. In retrospect, we understand that toleration is tolerating people of all opinions.' But at least one parents has come out in support of the school's initial decision to select the book as appropiate for teaching young students. 'People in this country, parents in this country are outraged by bullying, teen suicide rates and the depression in children. The staff of Mitchell School is doing something about this. By teaching acceptance and love they are shedding a light on [LGBTI] issues,' reports Gay Star News. 'LGBTQ issues should never be classified as a ""sensitive subject"" — there is nothing sensitive about the way we are born. Blonde hair, brown hair, gay, straight or somewhere in-between, we are all people and we all need acceptance.' The book at the center of the controversy, I Am Jazz, is based off of the life of now 14-year-old Jazz Jennings who, although born a boy, claims to have identified as a girl since he was two-years-old. 'From the time she was two years old, Jazz knew that she had a girl's brain in a boy's body. She loved pink and dressing up as a mermaid and didn't feel like herself in boys' clothing,' reads the book's description on Amazon.com. 'This confused her family, until they took her to a doctor who said that Jazz was transgender and that she was born that way. Jazz's story is based on her real-life experience and she tells it in a simple, clear way that will be appreciated by picture book readers, their parents, and teachers.'","Officials at Horace Mitchell Primary School in Kittery Point, Maine, have come under fire for teaching students about transgender issues .

"The families of five Chinese feminists detained by police for more than a month facing charges of 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble' have issued a plea to authorities for their release. The female activists were arrested the weekend before International Women's Day, as they were preparing to hand out leaflets about sexual harassment on public transport. The five women - Li Tingting, 25, Wei Tingting, 26, Wang Man, 32, Zheng Churan, 25, and Wu Rongrong, 30 - have been linked to several stunts over the last few years which aim to highlight issues such as domestic violence and the poor provision of women's toilets in China. The Chinese feminist activists (all pictured) have been detained by police for more than a month and face being jailed for up to five years if they are charged with 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble' They now face being jailed for up to five years if they are charged. Prosecutors will announce later today whether the women should be formally arrested, released or have their cases sent back to the police, their lawyers said. The vague charge of 'provoking trouble' has been increasingly used by Chinese police under President Xi Jinping to detain and jail protesters from holding small-scale demonstrations. The activists were described as 'young, kind-hearted, and full of a sense of responsibility to society,' ten of their parents and spouses wrote in a letter to Beijing prosecutors which was posted online on Saturday. 'These five girls, who we care for and love deeply, have not made a mistake, let alone committed a crime,' they said, adding 'they have all striven to uphold our nation's basic policy of gender equality'. Activist Li Tingting, 25, (pictured) poses with letters protesting about the poor provision of female toilets - she and others have since been arrested . 'Supporting gender equality and the interests of women is no crime!' Their detention on March 8 has prompted renewed condemnation of China's tight controls on political activists from human rights groups as well as the US. Police interrogations of the women - several of whom suffer from chronic health problems such as asthma and an unspecified heart condition -have focused on a 2012 stunt named 'Occupy Men's Rooms', one of their lawyers, Liang Xiaojun, told AFP on Sunday. Prosecutors have until Monday to formally approve their arrest or police will be obliged to release the women, he added. The parents said in their letter that the women 'have been detained for over a month and we have not had a decent explanation'. 'Please restore their freedom and dignity as soon as possible!' they added. Meanwhile China has lodged a formal . protest with Washington after U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and . Secretary of State John Kerry called for the release of the activists, the foreign ministry said on Monday. The tussle over the activists could further strain ties . between China and the United States, which frequently grapple . over everything the value of the yuan currency to China's . growing military assertiveness. Biden tweeted on Saturday that China should release them, . saying, 'We urge Chinese leaders to show respect for women's . rights,' and adding, 'Rights of women and girls should never be . suppressed.' Activtsts Wei Tingting, 26, (left) Wang Man, 32, (right) face charges of 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble' In a statement on Friday, Kerry said the U.S. government . backed the efforts of the activists, saying, 'We believe that . Chinese authorities should also support them, not silence them.' China has lodged 'representations' with the United States . over the comments, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said. 'We urge the United States to respect China's judicial . sovereignty and not use any pretext to interfere in China's . internal affairs,' he told a daily news briefing. 'China is a country of rule of law,' Hong added. 'China's . legal authorities will handle this case in accordance with the . law.' Hillary Clinton, the Democrats' 2016 presidential . front-runner, annoyed Beijing last week with similar calls to . free the women. Britain and the European Union have also . expressed concern about the case.

"They were once sprawling palace compounds that were used to intimidate and strike fear into the hearts of Libyans. Now the homes and residences of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi have been reduced to rubble - and even used as pet markets to sell birds and dogs. Four years after the 2011 revolution that saw Colonel Gaddafi's hold on Libya crumbled, the once feared Bab al-Aziziya compound, situated in the capital city of Tripoli, resembles a wasteland. Scroll down for video . Colonel Muammar Gaddafi stands with his wife and children near Bab al-Azizia palace in November 1986, before it was left in ruins by air raids . Reduced the rubble: The former Bab al-Aziziya palace, which boasted a zoo, fairground and pool, now lies in a derelict state . During his rule, Libyans would be nervous just walking anywhere near the fortress-like seat of the Gaddafi regime. The dictator ruled for almost 42 years, after he took control in a coup d'etat in 1969. Following an uprising as part of the Arab Spring in 2011 and ensuing civil war, he was hounded out of Tripoli and killed by members of the National Transitional Council. Speaking about life before the uprising, Tripoli taxi driver Hassan said people feared to go near the Bab al-Aziziya compound in Tripoli. 'People were afraid even to look at the walls, for fear of being arrested,' he said. All that remains of the palace, which had been hit in a 1986 US air strike before being pounded by NATO four years ago, are a few ruined buildings, the green flooring of Gaddafi's home and a dug-up network of underground tunnels. Then: A mural of a smiling Colonel Gaddafi was painted on the side of the Bab al-Aziziya palace, but was a symbol of fear and terror to Libyans . Growing up Gaddafi's children enjoyed their own fairground within the palace in Tripoli - yet millions of Libyan people suffered under his reign . Now: The palace has lain in ruin for almost four years, after it was hastily bulldozed by rebels once they took control of it in 2011 . Nowadays, only shabby outbuildings are left on the palace grounds, covered in graffiti and revolutionary slogans, while holes leading to a network of underground tunnels that once ran under the stronghold can still be accessed . The monument of a gold-coloured fist clenching a US fighter plane was vandalised and sent off to Misrata, a rebel bastion during the revolt which ousted and killed Gaddafi. At a safe distance from his people, Gaddafi lived behind fortified walls with his wife, their children, close advisers and guards. Apart from the bedouin tents on which Gaddafi prided himself and which accommodated him on travels abroad, the compound once showcased a zoo, an indoor pool, countless murals and a fairground in its gardens. Rebels posted for photos in a foreign dignitaries reception room at Bab al-Aziziya when they stormed the building in 2011 . The rebels later bulldozed the palace - but the green flooring from Gaddafi's home is still visible in parts of the derelict site . Gaddafi had expanded the grounds by knocking down adjacent neighbourhoods. Bab al-Aziziya 'was a symbol of the Gaddafi era. Today, we have destroyed this symbol, we have demolished and razed it to the ground,' said Adel Mohammed Farina, tourism ministry spokesman of a Tripoli-based government. 'He (Gaddafi) will be mentioned briefly in history books and documentaries but nothing of his will remain as it is,' said Farina. Rebels hastily bulldozed much of the compound when they captured it in August 2011. A Libyan army soldier patrols the heavily-fortified compound in March 2011, before the beginning of the civil war and fighters took it over . Having taking control of the palace in late 2011, rebels used a crane to remove the statue of the US plane clutched by a fist outside the building . Rubbish now piles up at the site of the former Tripoli palace. Plans to turn the site into a national park have never materialised . Homeless families moved into the few buildings left standing, and initial plans to turn Bab al-Aziziya into a national park have not materialised. The walls are splattered with graffiti and revolutionary slogans - some with the names of fighters killed in the battle for the compound. Another of Gaddafi's homes in Sabha in the south of the country has suffered the same fate. In the eastern city of Benghazi, birthplace of the revolution and which has since become an Islamist stronghold, traders have converted his more than 10-hectare palace grounds and barracks into a marketplace to sell birds, dogs and other pets. 'We dreamt of a better life after the fall of Gaddafi, but here we are in his ruins,' said Mohammed Suleiman, 43, surrounded by children. The site of Gaddafi's palace in the Libyan city of Benghazi is now a market place, packed with traders selling bric and back, clothes and pets . A LIbyan man holds high a bird, available to buy from the market. Four years on, the landscape has completed changes for Libyan people . The old palace site was out of bounds for many but is now a thriving market. 'It is is a powerful message to the new rulers' says one Libyan . 'This is a powerful message to the new rulers of Libya. If Gaddafi had given us freedom and treated us with dignity, with a decent standard of living, he would still have been here.' In 2012, the Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia which the United States has branded a terrorist organisation occupied Gaddafi's Benghazi home and turned it into their headquarters. It was pulverised in air strikes launched last October by anti-Islamist forces loyal to the internationally recognised Libyan government based in the country's far east. Now, the area is used as a dumping ground where the city's municipality burns household rubbish. 'This place is not worthy of being anything but a dump. It reminds us of a black chapter in our history and many painful memories,' said Ali al-Masrati, a passer-by. The former palace in Benghazi is now a dumping ground for people's rubbish, having once symbolised Colonel Gaddafi's grip on Libya .","Opulent palace in Tripoli - which once had a zoo, fairground and pool - was razed to the ground during revolution .
Libyans were 'even afraid to look at walls of palace', for fear of being arrested while Gaddafi was in power .
Now his former strongholds lie in ruin, after civil war which devastated country and saw Gaddafi killed by rebels ."
"About 4.45 billion years ago, 150 million years after the solar system formed, Earth was hit by a Mars-size object called Theia. The collision created the moon, but debate has raged exactly what happened during this event - and a mystery has persisted on why the moon and Earth are so similar in their composition. Now, conflicting studies have provided two different theories - one that Theia was similar to Earth, and another that Earth and the moon were showered by debris following the collision. Three studies have provided different theories for what happened after Earth was struck by a Mars-sized object called Theia, 4.45 billion years ago. What is agreed on, though, is that the impact actually happened (artist's illustration shown). This is known as the giant impact hypothesis . The two theories appear in the journal Nature across three studies - two in favour of the ‘similar to Earth’ theory, and the other favouring the ‘shower of debris’ model. In the latter theory, a team of scientists at the University of Maryland said the impact of Theia with Earth was so violent, the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon. Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. But one mystery has persisted, revealed by rocks the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and Earth so similar in their composition? Several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of Earth and the moon. Perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the Earth and then later condensed to form the moon. Or Theia could have, coincidentally, been isotopically similar to young Earth. A third possibility is that the moon formed from Earthen materials, rather than from Theia, although this would have been a very unusual type of impact. This cloud would have been composed of some Earth material, explaining the similarity between Earth and the moon, and other material. ‘This means that, right after the moon formed, it had exactly the same isotopic composition as Earth's mantle,’ said Dr Richard Walker, a professor of geology at UMD and co-author of the study. Both bodies have a similar isotopic ‘fingerprint,’ notably similar types of Tungsten, suggesting they had a similar origin. One difference, though, is that Earth has proportionally much less of a lighter isotope known as Tungsten-182. The team said this is because after both bodies formed, Earth swept up more debris that had little Tungsten-182. ‘We still need to work out the details, but it's clear that our early solar system was a very violent place,’ added Dr Walker. The team said their theory largely rules out the idea that the Mars-sized body Theia was of similar composition, or that the moon formed from only material contained in the pre-impact Earth. The other studies, though, disagree. Scientists at the Israel Institute of Technology and the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado said that Theia actually had a similar composition to Earth. Dr Alessandra Mastrobuono-Battisti and colleagues simulated collisions between protoplanets and compared the composition of each surviving planet with the composition of its last giant impactor. In one theory, a team of scientists at the University of Maryland said that the impact of Theia with Earth was so violent, the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon. Shown is an artist's illustration of the young Earth and moon . The University of Maryland team examined the tungsten isotopic composition of two moon rocks collected by the Apollo 16 mission, including sample 68815, seen here. When corrected for meteoritic additions to Earth and the moon after formation of the moon, the two bodies had identical Tungsten isotopic compositions . Supporting evidence includes the Earth's spin and Moon's orbit having similar orientations. Moon samples indicating the surface of the moon was once molten also provide evidence,  as does the moon's relatively small iron core. The moon also has a lower density compared to Earth, while there is evidence of similar collisions in other star systems (that result in debris disks). Giant collisions are also consistent with the leading theories of the formation of the solar system. And finally, the stable isotope ratios of lunar and terrestrial rock are identical, implying a common origin. They found that 20 to 40 per cent of impactors had similar compositions to the planets they impacted, whereas planets that formed in the same simulation tended to have distinct compositions. The authors suggest their results may explain the similarities between Earth and the moon - and why their compositions differ from those of other planets in the solar system. ‘We find that different planets formed in the same simulation have distinct compositions, but the compositions of giant impactors are statistically more similar to the planets they impact,’ the researchers wrote. They said their theory has a 20 per cent probability of correct. Whichever theory turns out to be correct though, both are in agreement that the formation of the moon remains a confusing mystery that is yet to be fully solved. ‘This is interesting stuff and no one has all the answers regarding the formation of the moon - we certainly don't claim to,’ Dr Walker, one of the authors of the former study, told MailOnline. However, the other theory says that Earth (left) and the moon (right) are so similar because the initial Mars-sized object, Theia, actually had a similar composition to Earth. Dr Alessandra Mastrobuono-Battisti and colleagues simulated collisions between protoplanets to make their finding .","The moon formed when a Mars-sized body called Theia hit it early on .

"George Osborne has refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term. The Chancellor appeared to leave the door open when asked if he would be ‘depriving more families’ of the payments which are worth more than £1,000 per year. More than a million households lost out when the Coalition announced that families with one parent earning £50,000 would pay tax on child benefit. Earners over £60,000 lost out altogether. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne, pictured visiting the Red Cone Cafe in Stourbridge, refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term . The controversial measure, brought in two and a half years ago as part of the Government’s austerity programme, was criticised for penalising single-earner families and stay-at-home mothers. It meant anyone earning less than £50,000 – even a couple on £49,000 each - still received the full entitlement of £20.70 a week for the first child, and £13.70 for every subsequent child. Mr Osborne was asked at a briefing in central London on the economy this morning whether he could ‘rule out depriving more people of child benefit, like you’ve already done in this Parliament?’ The Conservatives say they would cut £30billion of spending if they win a second term. Of this £12billion would be slashed from the welfare bill, with the rest from government departments and further cracking down on tax avoidance. While the Prime Minister has given a commitment to protect the state pension, few other savings have been set out apart from reducing the cap on a family’s annual benefits from £26,000 to £23,000. Mr Osborne did not directly answer about reducing the threshold, only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system Universal Credit, which is being rolled out nationally. The respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies have suggested that increasing Universal Credit for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save £4.8billion a year. The Chancellor said: ‘You can judge us on our record in this Parliament. If we wanted to put child benefit into Universal Credit we would have done it when we set up Universal Credit. ‘We’ve got a track record, we’ve got a plan based on clear principles of making work pay, sharpening work incentives.’ Asked again why he did not rule out any type of child benefit cuts, he said: ‘I’ve given you a very clear answer. We’ve created a welfare system where child poverty is down, inequality is down, we have a record low number of workless households and what we are doing is creating welfare system where it pays to work and we protect the most vulnerable. ‘We are going to carry on doing that in the next Parliament. But we can’t do any of these things without economic security and a growing economy.’ Mr Osborne was asked at a briefing in central London on the economy this morning whether he could ‘rule out depriving more people of child benefit, like you’ve already done in this Parliament?' The Chancellor said the Coalition had saved £21billion in this Parliament, and the ‘same principles’ would apply if his party win a second term – with further reforms to welfare . The Chancellor said the Coalition had saved £21billion in this Parliament, and the ‘same principles’ would apply if his party win a second term – with further reforms to welfare. ‘This is perfectly achievable and anyone who thinks that the job of reforming welfare has somehow been completed, I think, is mistaken. ‘We want to go on creating a welfare system which rewards work and the aspirations of families and protect the most vulnerable’, he said. It is widely speculated that the Conservatives could restrict child benefit to just two children, to save around £2billion a year. Work and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith is sympathetic to the idea. He recently said it was ‘well worth looking at’ and could save ‘significant money’ and help with ‘behaviour change’ by forcing couples to think carefully about whether they could afford to have another child. It was not seriously considered in this Parliament due to opposition from the Liberal Democrats and David Cameron appeared to reject it last year amid concerns it would alienate low-income families. The event attended by Mr Osborne, and Treasury minister David Gauke and Priti Patel was an analysis of the Labour’s party fiscal plans, if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street. He claimed the Labour party would ‘never’ eliminate the budget deficit – unlike Tory plans to run a surplus by 2020 – because they would borrow billions of pounds every year and not cut spending. ‘When the economy's growing, and we're not in recession, we should be raising more than we spend’, he said. ‘That's the way, proven around the world, to bear down on your national debt and best prepare yourself for any future economic storms. Fixing the roof while the sun is shining. ‘The Labour Party don't want to do that, they only talked about balancing the current, day to day, spending while continuing to borrow to pay for capital spending. What they don't tell you is that means a permanent, never-ending budget deficit.’ Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said Mr Osborne had put middle income families in the firing line. He said: ‘The Tories won't admit where their £12 billion of welfare cuts will come from, but after this press conference it's now clear middle income families are in the firing line. ‘George Osborne repeatedly refused to rule out rolling child benefit into universal credit. This would mean 4.3 million families losing over £1,000 a year, according to the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies.’ An aide to Mr Osborne played down suggestions the Conservatives were planning changes to child benefit. �4a, .","Chancellor paves the way for further cuts to payments with £1,000-a-year .

"A pre-med student in New York City is taking microscopic images of diseases and other biological structures and turning them into prints for her innovative new athletic apparel and accessories line. Lizzie Cochran, a student at Columbia University, has launched a KickStarter campaign to fund her upcoming fashion line Epidemia Designs, which she came up with after spending days upon days staring at cells through microscopes in her biology classes, and then spotting an article on epidemics that displayed images of deadly diseases from recent history. 'The one that jumped out at me was the flu of 1918 virus,' Lizzie told Today. 'It was one of the most devastating epidemics in the history of the world, but there on the page, colored with dyes, it just looked incredible, interesting and vibrant.' Scroll down for video . From the microscope to the mat: Proposed clothing line Epidemia will take images from biology and print them on eye-catching active apparel . Picture of health: Among the designs is a sports bra showing images from a healthy mammogram . Lizzie, who will be returning to her native Texas for medical school in the fall at University of Texas San Antonio, was soon mocking up ideas for clothing incorporating the beautiful and unique imagery she'd seen on slides during her classes. Using mirroring, Photoshop and kaleidoscope effects, each biological subject was turned into an eye-catching pattern that could be printed on fabric. The designs in the line include scarves printed with rabies and chicken pox patterns, a flu of 1918 tote bag and yoga pants depicting polio, muscle cells and rabies. The patterns will also be available for printing on iPhone cases after the company, which has already raised $13,798, reaches its $15,000 crowdfunding goal. In her design work, Lizzie also began to see the potential for changing perceptions of infectious diseases, as well as the relatively apathy towards them that results in the preventable deaths of 1.5 million children per year simply because they haven't been vaccinated. The brains of the outfit: Pre-med student Lizzie Cochran came up with the idea for the fashion line after studying biology under a microscope . Giving 'cell phone' a whole new meaning: Epidemia will offer phone cases with eye catching patterns from microscopic images including that of heart tissue, chicken pox and polio . From the Petri dish to the yoga pant: Epidemia legging,s like the pair featuring a lung x-ray design pictured, will initially be priced at around $75 . 'Frankly, it's unacceptable,' Lizzie told Today. 'It's not like we're trying to solve an unsolvable problem. We really have the power to lead the way toward a healthier future. We already have the tools.' With this idea in mind, Lizzie is promising to send 15 per cent of the profits to funding projects aimed at limiting the impact of preventable diseases such as polio, rubella and hepatitis, as well as expanding medical care access around the globe. Now, with an expanding team - and an exploding online following - Epidemia's goal of $15,000 has nearly been reached, meaning the line is just on the cusp of going into production. Team Epidemia: Based on the strength of her idea, Lizzie has enlisted a new VP of retail, Taylor Newby (third from right), and several friends as models for the project . Showing off their muscles: The Kickstarter campaign to produce the clothing for the public has nearly reached its goal of $15,000 . The first group of designs lined up will be called 'She's Got It' will have the theme of beauty in a woman's body and will feature images of brain, nerve, heart and epithelial (stomach). Aside from bringing awareness of preventable diseases to the forefront, the 'She's Got It' line has its own unique purpose. 'We hope women will wear these clothes and feel empowered to join the discussions of public health, science and technology that are so vital to our world,' Lizzie explained. 'Our hope is that our stylish, feminine, fun, and most importantly, interesting designs will appeal to girls of all ages - and maybe encourage them to get involved in the scientific community.'","Pre-med student Lizzie Cochran has created clothing and accessories influenced by the microscopic structure of anatomy and disease .

The three men were stopped from boarding a plane to Istanbul with Hamza Ahmed, 19, at JFK Airport after riding on a Greyhound bus with him from Minneapolis to New York in November. Ahmed was indicted for lying to the FBI during a terrorism investigation, conspiring to provide material support to the ISIS and attempting to provide material support in February. He has pleaded not guilty. No public charges were filed against his companions and little information was released about them.

"Poland said it is demanding a formal apology from the U.S. over the comments made by FBI director James Comey (pictured above) The US ambassador for Poland has been forced to apologise for comments made by the head of the FBI who blamed Polish people for helping the Nazis kill Jews during the Holocaust. James Coney had written an editorial opinion piece for the Washington Post claiming Poland shares responsibility for the Holocaust with Germany. The piece sparked outrage among Polish politicians and media. US Ambassador Stephen Mull met with the Polish deputy foreign affairs minister and apologised for the comments. He said: 'I made clear that the opinion that Poland is in any way responsible for the Holocaust is not the position of the United States. 'Nazi Germany alone bears responsibility.' Mr Mull said he now had 'a lot of work' to do to rectify the situation. Comey's April 16 opinion piece in the Washington Post stated that Poland played a role in Nazi Germany's genocide of six million European Jews in the Holocaust. 'In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn't do something evil,' Comey wrote. The piece was titled Why I require FBI agents to visit the Holocaust Museum. 'They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do,' it continues. Scroll down for video . Poland's president Bronislaw Komorowski told public television that Comey's comments showed a 'lack of historical knowledge' and were an 'insult to thousands of Poles who helped Jews'. On Sunday foreign ministry spokesman Marcin Wojciechowski wrote on Twitter that Mull would 'receive a note of protest and a summons for an apology.' US Ambassador Stephen Mull apologised to Poland . The US Ambassador was quick to present an informal apology at memorial ceremonies in the Polish capital on Sunday marking the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Six million Polish citizens were killed under Nazi Germany's occupation of Poland during World War II. While half of the victims were Jewish, the other half were Christian. Historical records show instances of Poles turning against their Jewish neighbours, either killing them or giving them up to the Nazis. Poles also risked their lives and families to save Jews. In 2012, US President Barack Obama caused outrage in Warsaw when he labelled a World War II Nazi German facility in occupied Poland used to process Jews for extermination a 'Polish death camp'. He subsequently expressed 'regret' at what he called his inadvertent use of the erroneous term 'Polish death camp.' Poland's government keenly watches the global media for descriptions of former Nazi German death camps as 'Polish. It says the term - even if used simply as a geographical indicator - can give the impression that Poland bore responsibility for the Holocaust.

"Nineties style is hot right now. Chokers, berry-coloured lips, round sunglasses and Calvin Klein logo T-shirts are all the rage with a new generation of fashion fans. But news that JNCO, the brand responsible for the huge wideleg 'rave' jeans, is set to make a comeback has horrified many of the people who wore the ridiculous pants the first time around. The return of the highly impractical jeans, which featured giant leg openings approaching 50in, has us contemplating the retro fashion Nineties and Noughties trends that really should be left in the past. Femail rounds up the worst offenders... Scroll down for video . JCNO jeans, popular at Nineties raves, are threatening to make a comeback . 1. THE BUCKET HAT . A casual Nighties piece, the bucket hat is characterised by its wide, downwards sloping brim and limp structure. Originally a staple of fishermen and farmers, it soon enough found its way into popular culture and temporarily dominated the music scene. After gaining prominence in the Nineties and early Noughties, the trend was ditched in favour of softer and more flattering shapes, but fashion-forward celebrities such as 27-year-old Rihanna aren't letting it go quietly. THEN: The bucket hat was originally a staple of fishermen and farmers, but seeped into popular culture, and was sported by the likes of singer Christina Aguilera, now 36, in 2001 . NOW: Pop star Rihanna, 27, was spotted in July 2014 wearing a floppy bucket hat . 2. CAMOUFLAGE PRINT . For those of us non-military personnel not in need of immediate concealment from predators, very few can understand why time and time again, camouflage print manages to seep into our wardrobes. Usually in variations of olive and khaki - but also available in more garish shades - the pattern consists of shapeless blobs that imitate foliage. The brash pattern was favoured by Noughties bands such as Beyoncé's former band, Destiny's Child and today is seen on silk pants or sports luxe trousers worn by street smart stars such as 24-year-old Jourdan Dunn. Beyoncé, now 33, was a big fan of camouflage print in 2001 back when she was still with Destiny's Child . THEN: Destiny's Child wore camouflage print in garish variations of bright blue back in 2001 . NOW: Jourdan Dunn, 24, attempted to bring back the camouflage look in the form of skinny trousers and a crop top in February 2015 . 3. TAKING IT TO THE MAX . Sometimes a trend becomes so popular that a few fashion-forward thinking individuals try to take it to the extreme. Designer prints and double denim are two styles that worked well for celebrity wardrobes in the Nineties, . And today young reality star, 17-year-old Kylie Jenner is one of many who definitely don't follow the 'less is more' style mantra. THEN: In the Noughties, pop stars such as Victoria Beckham, now 44 (pictured left in 2000), Britney Spears, now 33, and Justin Timberlake, now 34 (pictured middle to right in 2001), loved to take trends to the maximum . NOW: 17-year-old reality star Kylie Jenner sported double denim out and about in Los Angeles earlier this month . 4. UGG BOOTS . The shapeless sheepskin UGG boot was a huge celebrity trend in the Noughties, with heiress Paris Hilton, 34, owning piles of pairs. They are not pretty, or remotely glamorous, but the cosy factor means that they remain popular with off-duty actors and models today, with actress Kristen Bell, 34, being one of the more modern fashion offenders. THEN: Heiress Paris Hilton wore UGG boots at Heathrow in 2006 and NOW: Kristen Bell wears hers on set between takes earlier this month . 5. DAISY DUKES . Tiny, tiny denim shorts have been around for the longest time, but were brought back to popularity by Jessica Simpson, 34 (pictured below), in the film remake of The Dukes of Hazzard in 2005. Extremely frayed, and impractically short, most stylish women are opting for slightly longer, more conservative styles this summer. But we can always count on Miley Cyrus, 22, to keep things flirty - wearing hers cut seriously high on the thigh. THEN: Tiny denim shorts, aka Daisy Dukes, were reintroduced to our wardrobes by Jessica Simpson with the promotion of the film reboot of The Dukes of Hazzard in 2005 . 6. JUICY COUTURE TRACKSUITS . Juicy Couture's matching two-piece velour tracksuits were the staple wardrobe of the likes of Nicole Richie, 33, Paris Hilton, 34, and Britney Spears, 33, in the Noughties. Available in all manner of garish shades, they were perfect for lounging around the house in and today celebrities like Nicki Minaj, 32, are keeping the rainbow sweatpants in style. THEN:  Britney Spears stepped out in a Juicy Couture velour tracksuits in 2005 before her wedding to Kevin Federline . NOW: Nicki Minaj stepped out in 2014 in the red version of the Juicy Couture tracksuit, proving that it's maintained its popularity since the Noughties . 7. COLOURED SUNGLASSES . Rainbow lenses were a Nineties favourite for boy bands such as *NSYNC and pop princesses like Britney. These days they are sported by the likes of the mostly very stylish 22-year-old model Cara Delevingne and 17-year-old reality star, Kylie Jenner, with a mirrored sheen giving them a 2015 update. Shady bunch: Justin Timberlake, now 34 (pictured left in 2000), and Britney Spears, now 33 (pictured right in 1999), were fans of brightly coloured sunglasses in the Nineties . NOW: Model Cara Delevingne and reality star Kylie Jenner are both fans of coloured sunglasses . 8. CORSETS AS OUTFITS . Corsets first became popular in the 16th Century, worn under clothes to help transform women's shapes. In the Nineties they were being sported as outerwear, spearheaded by a very sexy Victoria Backham as Posh Spice, now 44. And today they are being incorporated into dresses and tops to add edge to red carpet wear by young stars like 22-year-old Selena Gomez. THEN: Victoria Beckham (pictured in 2004) popularised wearing corsets and lingerie as outerwear in the Noughties . Not very posh: Victoria Beckham sported tight corset structured dresses to events such as the MTV movie awards in 2007 (pictured left) and the Victoria's Secret Fashion show in 2007 (pictured right) NOW: Selena Gomez works a sultry look to an awards ceremony with a corset-based gown . 9. HAREM TROUSERS . Characterised by loose, baggy legs which nip in at the ankle, these Middle Eastern style trousers are a hard to wear shape for anyone with any kind of curves. Before she discovered pencil skirts reality star Kim Kardashian, now 34, was a huge fan of the voluminous pants. Today they are still sported by supermodel legs like 51-year-old Elle Macpherson. THEN: Reality star Kim Kardashian previously championed the wearing of harem trousers back in 2009 . NOW: Supermodel Elle Macpherson steps out in a pair of leopard print harem trousers .","JNCO 'rave jean's are on their way back .

"Bereaved families say the report is being dragged out so figures like Tony Blair can rebut its findings . The families of Britain’s Iraq war dead expressed their disgust last night after learning the long-awaited official report into the conflict may be delayed yet again. Publication of Sir John Chilcot’s inquiry, which began in 2009 and has cost the taxpayer almost £10million, had already been pushed back until after the election. Yesterday it emerged it is unlikely to be published until next year at the earliest. Bereaved parents said they were disgusted that their suffering was being dragged out to give leading figures in the inquiry, like Tony Blair, the chance to rebut its findings. They added they were now expecting a whitewash when the report is finally published. Earlier this year it emerged the report, expected to criticise dozen of senior figures involved in the 2003 conflict, had been pushed back until after the election because it was too politically sensitive to publish so close to a national poll. But sources close to the investigation have now told BBC’s Newsnight that ‘nobody thinks it will come out this year’. In comments that caused anger among military families, the sources suggested that ‘once they had failed to meet the pre-election deadline, they gave up trying to speed things up’. Further delays will fuel speculation that those criticised are trying to bury damning revelations. Last night Rose Gentle, whose son Gordon, 19, was killed in Iraq in 2004, told the Mail: ‘I’m actually disgusted. I now definitely do feel like I am being fobbed off. How long do we have to wait? It has been 11 years since Gordon died and they are dragging it out for all the families.’ Reg Keys, whose 20-year-old son Tom died in 2003, said: ‘We were told from Sir John that it would be a robust and thorough inquiry and we would get the answers we were looking for. This Chilcot inquiry is like an open wound and we need those answers. To have to wait until 2016 for them is just ridiculous.’ Mr Keys, 62, added he thought the final report would likely be ‘watered down’. Liberal Democrats foreign affairs spokesman Tim Farron said speculation about a delay was ‘deeply concerning’. He added: ‘Hundreds of thousands of families have had their lives torn apart by the Iraq War and deserve answers. It is simply not good enough for this process to be continually delayed and the report must be published.’ The findings have been held up by the process of ‘Maxwellisation’ – giving individuals in the report a chance to respond. Newsnight’s diplomatic editor Mark Urban said it had become a ‘nightmare’, with some of those criticised given drafts running to ‘hundreds of pages’. Delayed: Sir John Chilcot (pictured) began his inquiry in 2009. It has cost the taxpayer almost £10million, with the findings unlikely to be published until next year at the earliest, it has emerged . Mr Blair has previously denied responsibility for hold-ups to the inquiry – which stopped taking evidence in 2011. But bereaved families say they are now expecting a whitewash when the report is finally published . Wrangling between the inquiry and Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood over the publication of Whitehall conversations and communications between Tony Blair and President George W Bush has also caused delays. Janice Procter, 53, whose son Michael Tench, 18, was one of the youngest to die, told the Mail: ‘It is a total whitewash, I think the longer that it has gone, the longer it is giving people a chance to change their responses. It is all lies, lies, lies. I don’t think anybody will get an answer from it.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he was ‘dismayed beyond belief that we are having to wait so long – and now, it is being reported, even longer than I had feared – to finally find out the truth of what happened.’ Mr Blair has previously denied responsibility for hold-ups to the inquiry – which stopped taking evidence in 2011. Neither the Government nor the inquiry would comment on any delays.","Sir John Chilcot's inquiry began in 2009. It has cost taxpayer almost £10m .

"A Germanwings flight bound for Italy from Germany was evacuated last night due to a bomb threat, the airline said. The threat against flight 826 from Cologne Bonn to Milan's Malpensa airport was received on Sunday evening. The tower in Cologne immediately alerted the pilot of the Airbus A320, which was taxiing toward the runway at the time, Germanwings said. Scroll down for video . The threat against flight 826 from Cologne Bonn to Milan's Malpensa airport was received on Sunday evening. The tower in Cologne immediately alerted the pilot of the Airbus A320 (file picture of Germanwings plane) The threat was emailed to the airport 15 minutes before the plane's scheduled departure, prompting police to set the necessary measures in motion. Instead of taking off the pilot steered the plane to a different part of the airport where passengers and crew were evacuated. A total of 132 people were aboard the plane, including 126 passengers and six crew members, Spiegel-Online reported. A thorough search was carried out and federal police said sniffer dogs found no sign of explosives, news agency DPA reported. The threat was received just as the pilot was taxiing along the runway at Cologne Bonn Airport (pictured) An examination of the baggage and the aircraft itself also yielded no results Germanwings said in a separate statement later on Sunday evening. Germanwings said passengers flew to Milan on a different aircraft on Sunday night while the searched plane has now been cleared for air traffic. Germanwings, a budget unit of German airline Lufthansa, has been in the spotlight since one of its planes was deliberately crashed into a mountain in the French Alps last month, killing all 144 people on board. Germanwings has been in the spotlight since one of its planes was deliberately crashed into a mountain in the French Alps last month, killing everyone on board - a monument has been set up at the crash site . Lufthansa has faced questions about its pilot screening process since the March 24 crash which appears to have been caused by the plane's co-pilot who deliberately steered the plane into a mountain. The Airbus A320 went down in a remote region of the French Alps en route to Dusseldorf from Barcelona. Recordings from the flight data recorder suggest co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit before 'deliberately' crashing the jet. It emerged today Lufthansa may face corporate manslaughter charges for allowing Lubitz to fly after he suffered a bout of depression.

"The man accused of killing a gay community college worker said the motorcycle he used to get away broke down along Interstate 95 and he walked 30 miles before a woman headed to Florida gave him a ride, according to a police report released on Wednesday. The woman picked up the 20-year-old Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, whose face and neck are covered in dark, self-administered tattoos, some with neo-Nazi symbolism. The woman didn't know he was armed with a knife and had almost $500, the report by Volusia County Beach Safety officers said. Scroll down for video . Would you slow down for this man? Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, managed to hitch a ride from a woman to Florida after his motorbike broke down, police said on Wednesday. Among his self-administered tattoos are the word 'brotherhood' on his neck and the number '88' on his left cheek which is linked to neo-Nazis . Stancil pictured with his mother Debbie at his graduation. She said he is 'rattled and confused and needs mental help'. The mother also claimed that the victim had made sexually laced comments to her son . The driver was headed to Key West, Florida, but dropped Stancil off in Daytona Beach, where he was found sleeping on the beach on Tuesday morning. When officers approached him, he pulled the knife but dropped it when an officer drew his gun. He was arrested without incident, the police report said. Stancil is awaiting extradition back to North Carolina, where he is accused of fatally shooting 44-year-old Ron Lane, a print shop director at Wayne Community College. On Tuesday, he appeared relaxed in the courtroom and, despite the judge advising him he had the right to remain silent, he admitted to the killing, WRAL reported. He confessed to the shooting in an obscenity-laced statement, saying he 'ridded one last child molester from the Earth', according to the station. He said Lane, who had been his supervisor at the college's print shop until Stancil was fired last month, had been 'messing with' one of Stancil's family members. Lane was gay, and authorities said they are investigating a possible hate crime. They haven't released a motive for the shooting, but Stancil was dismissed from a work study program at the print shop last month. An extradition hearing was scheduled for Wednesday to send him back to North Carolina to face a charge of open murder. The police report said Stancil voluntarily gave police a statement, which authorities did not release. During his first court appearance on Tuesday in Daytona Beach, Florida, Stancil indicated he killed Lane because his former supervisor molested a relative. Nothing in police records substantiated the allegations. The suspect's mother, Debbie Stancil, said she knows the relative was not sexually abused by Lane, as Kenneth Stancil claimed in court, because the relative and Lane had never met. She believes Kenneth Stancil is making the accusations because he is 'rattled and confused'. Stancil, left, shot dead his former work-study supervisor Ron Lane (pictured) 'He just snapped. That is not my son,' Debbie Stancil, said. 'He's probably out of his mind. I think he needs mental help.' Debbie Stancil said her son was angry over being dismissed from his work-study job for excessive absenteeism. She also said Lane made sexually laced comments to her son. 'He was verbally inappropriate with Morgan at school. Very much verbally inappropriate,' she said. 'He would tell him to stop and he kept on.' Lane's brother and sister declined to comment. College spokeswoman Tara Humphries said she did not know whether any complaints had been lodged against Lane. Lane and Stancil started working together in August. Stancil was dismissed in early March. He had been enrolled in a three-semester welding course. Lane and Stancil were linked - whether they knew it or not - by the suicides of people very close to them. Lane's partner of 12 years killed himself last year. Stancil's mother says her son never recovered after finding his father in the backyard after he had killed himself in 2009. Stancil gave himself a facial tattoo last weekend that included the number '88' on his left cheek. Experts who track hate groups said the number is a neo-Nazi code for praising Adolf Hitler. Neo-Nazis have often been accused of attacking gays, said Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Police have not said whether Stancil held white supremacist beliefs or what hate crime they are investigating. Stancil's mother said the tattoo marked a wannabe rather than someone with neo-Nazi beliefs. Stancil, pictured in court on Tuesday, is awaiting extradition back to North Carolina, where he is accused of fatally shooting 44-year-old Ron Lane, a print shop director at Wayne Community College .","Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, whose face and neck are covered in dark, self-administered tattoos managed to hitch a ride with a woman to Florida .

"Six Minnesota men have been charged with terrorism in a criminal complaint unsealed Monday, the latest Westerners accused of traveling or attempting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group. The six, whom authorities described as friends who met secretly to plan their travels, are accused of conspiracy to provide material support and attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The complaint says the men planned to reach Syria by flying to nearby countries from Minneapolis, San Diego or New York City, and lied to federal investigators when they were stopped. Scroll down for video . Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, and Adnan Abdihamid Farah, both 19, and their four co-accused have been described as close friends who met secretly to plan their travel to Syria . Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19, and the five other men arrested have been accused of being 'intent' on joining ISIS . Charged are Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, 21; Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19; Abdurahman Yasin Daud, 21; Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19; and Guled Ali Omar, 20. 'These were focused men who were intent on joining a terrorist organization,' Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said at a news conference Monday. The six were arrested Sunday in Minneapolis and San Diego and are scheduled to make initial appearances in federal court on Monday. They are the latest people from Minnesota to be charged in an investigation stretching back months into the recruitment of Westerners by IS. Authorities said earlier that a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to fight with militants in the past year, and at least one has died. Three of those charged in the newest complaint - Mohamed Farah, Abdurahman and Musse - were stopped at a New York City airport in November along with 19-year-old Hamza Ahmed, but they were not charged until now. Ahmed was indicted on charges of lying to the FBI during a terrorism investigation, conspiring to provide material support to IS, and attempting to provide material support. He has pleaded not guilty. On Monday, the FBI announced the arrest of six Somali-American men from Minnesota, accused of trying to join ISIS. Above, FBI Special Agent Richard R Thornton details the arrests at a press conference, with U.S. Attorney Andrew M Luger to the left . Despite being stopped already, Luger said, the three others continued to try to get to Syria to join IS 'by any means possible.' The complaint describes several interactions some of the men had with Abdi Nur, a Minnesota man charged previously with conspiracy to provide support to a terror organization. The complaint says Nur, 'from his locale in Syria, recruits individuals and provides assistance to those who want to leave Minnesota to fight abroad.' The complaint relies in part on material from a confidential informant who had himself conspired to join IS before he changed his mind and went to authorities. Some of the informant's conversations with the six men were recorded. The Minneapolis area is home to the largest concentration of Somali immigrants in the U.S. Since 2007, more than 22 young Somali men have also traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to join the militant group al-Shabab. Omar's older brother, Ahmed Ali Omar, was among those who joined al-Shabab, leaving Minnesota in December 2007, according to the complaint. Ahmed Omar remains a fugitive. It also said when agents went to the younger Omar's house after he was stopped in San Diego in November, another brother, Mohamed Ali Omar, threatened them.","The six Minnesota men were arrested Sunday on terrorism charges .

"A jealous husband who fatally stabbed his ex-wife in the heart after discovering she had been using dating websites has been found guilty of murder. Lorna McCarthy feared for her life in the hours leading up to her death at the hands of Barry McCarthy, the man she had spent 25 years with before their separation four months earlier. Mrs McCarthy, 50, sent a series of messages to friends and family on September 27, including one to her daughter saying she didn't know 'what he is capable of these days'. She urged her daughter to call the police if she did not hear from her the next day - but it was never received. Lorna McCarthy (left) was stabbed through the heart by her husband Barry McCarthy (right) last September . The couple, who were still sharing a home in Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk, but sleeping in separate bedrooms, had had an argument. McCarthy, 51, had previously found out his wife was using dating websites. But she had agreed to take her profile down after he confronted her, Norfolk Police said. But in the early hours of September 28, Mrs McCarthy revealed she did not want to try to save the relationship, Norwich Crown Court heard. A little later, he entered her bedroom and stabbed her 13 times, according to the Eastern Daily Press. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had died from a stab wound to the heart. McCarthy then handed himself into police, telling them he had killed his wife, the court heard. When officers went to their home, they found Mrs McCarthy - who her daughter described to the BBC as a 'very colourful' and 'well-known' - in the back bedroom. McCarthy will be sentenced on May 1, after being found guilty of murder at Norwich Crown Court . McCarthy pleaded not guilty to murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. But a jury today found him guilty of murder following a eight-day trial. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Durham said: 'This was a horrific and brutal attack on a woman in her own home by a man she had spent 25 years of her life with. 'My thoughts go out to Lorna's family and friends, and I hope today's verdict will help bring them some comfort as they still try to come to terms with her tragic death.' McCarthy is due to be sentenced on May 1.","Lorna McCarthy was fatally stabbed through the heart  last September .

"For the parents of children living with cancer, there is often so little hope. And for those facing the bleakest of prognoses – that, barring a miracle, the disease will cut short their young lives – the agony is almost indescribable. So the decision to enrol such a child on to a trial for largely untested treatments that may save them, but may make them suffer far more, is another kind of mental anguish altogether. Now, a ground-breaking television documentary filmed over two years follows three children and their families through such a situation. Battler: Chloe Ballouqui during her treatment. She is one of three children featured in a ground-breaking TV documentary . In the film they reveal with heroic honesty why they are willing to risk their lives as they become the first children in the world to go through a pioneering treatment called immunotherapy. Shocking as it might seem, this kind of ‘experimentation’ happens in Britain. And it is a necessary part of the process that discovers new treatments that ultimately offer hope to other young cancer patients. Sophie Ryan-Palmer, 12, Fabian Bates, nine, and Chloe Balloqui, three, are patients at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, the leading British centre for treatment of child cancers, and are the youngsters featured in the documentary. Tragically, although for one of them, treatment is successful, two do not survive the radical procedure. Immunotherapy involves powerful drugs being given to kill off all a patient’s cancer cells and destroy their bone marrow. Loving life: Sophie Ryan-Palmer enjoying a party. The 12-year-old was two when she was diagnosed with leukaemia and entered the immunotherapy trial after her fourth relapse . This allows a transplant of new bone marrow containing immune system cells, harvested either from the patient or a donor. These cells are genetically modified in a laboratory so they are better at attacking cancer. Similar treatments have been carried out in America, and although the early results look hopeful, the risks are huge and many of the terminally ill young patients die from complications. The toxicity of the immunotherapy means children often have to be sedated and given strong painkillers such as morphine, to cope with the treatment, and many end up in intensive care. When presented with these facts, some parents decide the risks are simply to great, yet others choose to go ahead. Fabian’s father, Darrell, describes the anger and devastation after being told of his son’s diagnosis but also the optimism they had about the outcome of the trial. Chloe, pictured with her mother Karen Kallaste, has neuroblastoma . He says: ‘There were no patients who had gone through it, no evidence it would work, which was a little bit frightening. You tend to grab these things as a ray of hope.’ Some 30 children a week are diagnosed with cancer – that’s more than 1,500 a year – and 250 of them will die every year. Child leukaemia has a high survival rate, with four out of five youngsters being cured completely. But for some, standard treatment doesn’t work and the cancer comes back, which is why clinical trials such as the one for immunotherapy can be a lifeline – they offer families their last hope. Kate Law, director of clinical trials at Cancer Research UK, says they are an essential way forward. ‘There is strict regulation and a child would have undergone three or four lines of treatment such as chemotherapy before being considered for a trial,’ she explains. ‘The child has to have a life expectancy of at least six months and they have to undergo extensive clinical tests to be certain their bodies can cope with any potential treatment. ‘There is a real balance between whether we are doing more harm than good, and it is therefore essential that the doctor and the parents weigh up what their options are and whether a clinical trial is something they should pursue.’ Another parent in the documentary, Richard Balloqui, knows this dilemma all too well. His daughter Chloe has neuroblastoma, one of the most deadly of all childhood cancers, with only two in five of those diagnosed at her age surviving. As well as having a tumour on her adrenal gland, Chloe’s cancer had spread throughout her bones. During filming, the toddler has surgery to remove the tumour as well as chemotherapy so strong it could kill an adult, in preparation for the immunotherapy. At one stage her liver becomes dangerously swollen, a potential fatal side effect of the treatment. Her father admits the pain of ‘seeing your child in discomfort, seeing the side effects of what we are doing here to try to kill the cancer’. He adds: ‘You are filling them full of toxicity and you do see the effects of that, and it hits you that your child is going through something you could never imagine.’ Fabian Bates chats to the Duchess of Cambridge during a hospital visit. The child was given modified cells taken from his 14-year-old sister Cassia to battle his cancer . Sophie, the third child, was two when she was diagnosed with leukaemia and entered the immunotherapy trial after her fourth relapse. Her mother, Debbie, says: ‘When I told Sophie [the cancer] was back again, she was totally devastated and just said, ‘‘I don’t want to die, mummy, I don’t want to die.’’ ’ The youngster had two options: take drugs to fight the pain, and allow the cancer to progress to its inevitable end; or take part in the trial. ‘Straight away, without any thought about it at all, she said she wanted to go on the trial. She is a fighter,’ Debbie says. Of her relapse, Sophie says: ‘When I was told, I thought, “Not again.” But I dealt with it like I have all the other times. Of course I was upset but there is something we can do, so do it. ‘Mum said it was a clinical trial and stuff like that but I didn’t want to read the information, I just wanted to go ahead with it. It will make me better, hopefully.’ There are currently 36 child cancer medical trials open in the UK – 22 of which are funded by charity Cancer Research UK. Some 15 of these are studies into new treatments for relapse patients such as those highlighted in the documentary. Earlier this year The Mail on Sunday reported that cancer experts had hit out at EU red tape that is denying hundreds of terminally ill children cancer drugs – because a legal loophole means pharmaceutical companies have to test new treatments on adults only. If firms opt out of testing new treatments on under-18s during clinical trials, doctors are then barred from using them on youngsters because they are cleared for adult use only. Only half of 28 cancer drugs trialled between July 2007 and June 2012 were tested on children. Kate Law, of Cancer Research, says: ‘From a drug company point of view, they are in business for profit. They have to answer to their shareholders and they are therefore risk-averse to trials with children, so child cancer trials have to be funded independently through organisations like us.’ There are 21 specialist centres treating childhood cancer in the UK and every child with cancer will be seen at one of them. About 70 per cent of newly diagnosed children will be offered the chance to trial a new drug, a figure higher than that in the rest of Europe and the US. At one point during treatment, Sophie is confined to an isolation ward for eight weeks to prevent any risk of infection which her weakened immune system would be unable to fight. Her room is decorated in One Direction posters and she tells the film crew she copes with her situation due to her motto of ‘Happy, happy, happy, fun, fun, fun’. Sadly, Sophie’s tiny body was unable to withstand the first stages of the treatment, and she died in July 2013. The ITV film captures the poignant moment her pink coffin leaves the family home near Heathrow. Debbie says: ‘She always wanted to help other children so I have no regrets about her going on the trial, it was Sophie’s choice. ‘Unfortunately the bone marrow transplant never worked so she never had the chance to have the modified cells. ‘After what she had gone through for ten years of her life, her body just couldn’t do it any more. She was such a brave little girl and I was proud to be called her mummy’. Like Sophie, Fabian, who received letters from the Duchess of Cambridge after meeting her in hospital in 2011, was determined to look to the future and was given modified cells taken from his 14-year-old sister Cassia. He says: ‘The good cells fight the bad cells and destroy them, and as soon as they are destroyed I won’t be ill any more, which is a good thing because I want to stay well, not in a coffin and then, like dead. That would be horrible.’ Fabian dreamed of one day having a wife, a house and a car. Tragically, his new cells stopped working and he died at his home in London last November. The Duchess’s letters were laid to rest with him. Despite these tragedies, clinical trials have transformed outcomes for cancer patients and particularly in children, as three-quarters of those with cancer are now cured compared with about a quarter in the late 1960s. For Chloe, the fight goes on. Parents Karen and Richard found an American drug trial which aimed to prevent neuroblastoma coming back after immunotherapy. In a whirlwind six-week campaign, an appeal raised more than £100,000 to pay for further experimental treatment scheduled to begin early this year. Cruelly, final tests before travelling to the US showed that Chloe’s cancer had returned, although not in her bones this time, indicating the relapse had fortunately been caught early. Specialists at Great Ormond Street are now discussing the best ways to get the disease back into remission. Richard says: ‘We remain positive that this has been caught early and we can treat it.’","Ground-breaking TV documentary followed three children in medical trials .

"A shocking video has been released showing four tourists they catching a bronzer shark in New Zealand, dragging the thrashing creature in to shore and then pose for photos with the creature. Andreas Rasmussen, Christian Boyum Johansen and Johan Berg are filmed by Emil Fogh, standing just centimetres away from the shark they've captured in an activity that is terrifying but completely legal in New Zealand, to the point it has become a competitive sport. One of the man stands at the water's edge with a fishing line in his hands and the waves lapping at his feet when suddenly he launches forward, dragged by the great weight of the creature who has attached itself to his fishing line. The first fisherman is dragged deep into the water from the water's edge within seconds when the mighty shark takes hold of the end of his line . Once captured, one person brazenly opens the sharks mouth whilst the other removes the hook . The fisherman and his friends whoop with excitement, certain they have achieved their goal: to catch a shark. The line spins rapidly as their catch continues to swim around and the fisherman is pulled deeper and deeper into the water at an alarming rate. The fisherman's friend grabs hold of his shoulders and together they pull against the shark on the end of the line, determined to bring it into shore. As one person holds onto the line, a massive shark leaps out of the water less than two metres away, thrashing violently to try release itself from the hook. The three men in the video cheer excitedly, without a hint of apprehension. The shark is then pulled into shore, its huge teeth less than a metre away from the feet of the man who brazenly jerks it in to land. As the fisherman is dragged after the shark, his friend grabs hold of his shoulder and they forcefully pull the shark closer in to shore . The video then cuts to a few moments later, as the shark, now inexplicably still and unresponsive, is pulled in to the sand by its tail. The three men on-camera comfortably stand next to the shark, centimetres away from its face and grab it by the head to release the hook. A man in shorts kneels next to the two metre shark in the water, holding it up by its fin and tail. The shark is then pushed back into water by its tail. For a moment the bronzer shark snaps its head around as if to attack, but it proceeds to swim back into deep waters. As it is legal to fish for sharks in New Zealand, it has become a sport known as 'big game fishing' in which 'shark anglers' catch and release the creatures. One of the men stands just a metre away from the thrashing shark to pull it onto the sand . However, it crucial that the 'sport' is only attempted by those that know the techniques which are safe for both the participant and the shark – to ensure everyone involved remains alive. For many New Zealanders it has become a business to allow people, particularly tourists, to take part in the land-based shark fishing catch and release experience. Companies promise that participants can expect to 'catch fish such as large tiger sharks and hammerheads' in places such as New Zealand's Tauranaga Harbour. Shark fisherman focus on using peep release techniques 'to send sharks happily on their way after gaining 'biggest-catch' bragging rights.' 'The 'catch and release' philosophy is in keeping with New Zealand's dedication to conservation and sustainable fishing,' according to the New Zealand Tourism Guide website. 'Even in non-release areas, many anglers adopt the catch and release principle, or simply bag only their last catch of the day to take home for eating.' For the sea creature to survive, it is crucial that people engaging in big-game fishing handle their catch minimally. The fisherman whoop and cheer with delight as the bronzer shark desperately tries to escape . 'When using the catch and release method, anglers should realise that prolonged handling decreases the fish's chances of survival,' the website says. New Zealanders even compete in big game finishing tournaments, including the 'SSI Sharkin Catch and Release Tournament', which will be held from May 1 and offers prize money for the biggest catch. There are about 113 species of shark in New Zealand waters and of these more than 70 species are caught by fishers. In October 2014 New Zealand finally banned the practice of shark finning, a move that was seen as finally diminishing a primitive practice and 'bringing the country in line with other developed nations'. New Zealand's Conservation Minister Nick Smith said the move reinforced the country's reputation for sustainability and environmental protection. A man grins widely as he holds the shark near the water's edge with a hand on its tail and another on its fin - but the shark does not turn around to snap at its captor . The new rules made it illegal to remove fins from dead sharks and dump the carcasses at sea. It was already illegal in New Zealand to remove fins from live sharks. Shark fin soup is considered a delicacy by some in China. But the practice of shark finning has been condemned by many environmentalists as inhumane and wasteful. Pew Charitable Trusts estimates at least 100 million sharks are caught commercially each year, threatening the survival of some species. New Zealand officials estimate that commercial fishers catch about 20,000 tons of sharks annually and export about 121 tons of shark fins. Imogen Zethoven, director of Pew's global shark conservation campaign, said in an email the ban was an important first step, although was unlikely to reduce the numbers of sharks caught in New Zealand. She said Pew would like to see nations impose complete bans on catching shark species threatened with extinction, and sustainable catch limits placed on other species. The shark is then released back into the ocean and it quickly swims back into deep waters .","Tourists posted a video of themselves dragging a shark onto shore .

"U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson and his wife have agreed to annul their 24-year marriage as they continued talks on a settlement, ending an acrimonious divorce process that had included allegations of bigamy, financial abandonment and battery. The agreement was announced on Tuesday by a judge in an Orlando, Florida courtroom at the start of a hearing that had been scheduled to determine whether their marriage should be voided because Lolita Grayson was married to another man when they wed. That bigamy hearing was put on hold with the annulment announcement. U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson (right) and his wife Lolita (left, in an undated picture) agreed to annul their 24-year marriage in Florida on Tuesday . Lolita Grayson's attorney refused to comment after the hearing. She had claimed in court papers that she was divorced from her first husband when she married the congressman in 1990. They have five children. The Democrat and highly successful trial lawyer, said his wife's marriage to Robert Carson was not dissolved until 1994 in Broward County, Florida. However, Mrs Grayson claimed she divorced Carson in Guam in 1981, and she also disputes that she was divorced in Broward County. Alan Grayson's attorney said they were close to reaching a settlement. 'It means there was never a legal marriage. It basically invalidates it,' said Mark NeJame, Grayson's attorney. 'There was a ceremony, but it turns out you can't be married to two people at the same time.' Besides bigamy allegations, there were mutual allegations of battery, accusations by Lolita Grayson of financial abandonment by the congressman and a trial delay caused by Lolita Grayson's leaking breast implants. Lolita Grayson is a stay-at-home mother. Court papers put Alan Grayson's worth at $31 million. He was an attorney before going to Congress. Last year, Lolita Grayson was granted a restraining order against the congressman after she alleged that Alan Grayson, 56, pushed her against the front door of their home when he stopped by the house. The Orange County Sheriff's Office investigated the claim but decided there was not enough evidence to file charges. Alan Grayson pictured with his wife Lolita and their daughter in happier times. The family is posed up alongside disgraced U.S. senator John Edwards (left) A video of the encounter taken by a Grayson staffer shows the Lolita Grayson pushing her tall husband. Lolita Grayson also accused her husband of cutting off her financial resources during the divorce process and refusing to pay for repairs to the home she shared with their four children. Grayson said he was providing for his family, spending more than $10,000 a month on the home's mortgage, child support, utilities and household expenses. Besides the four younger children living at home, the couple has an adult child in school and he is paying the tuition, he said. U.S. Rep.

"Politicians are criss-crossing the country wooing voters ahead of the election in 27 days’ time. But in more than half of seats the result is already known, according to new analysis of safe seats. More than 25million live in constituencies where the result can already be predicted, because one party is so far ahead. There are 650 seats up for grabs on May 7, with Labour and the Tories needing more than half to secure a majority. However, the Electoral Reform Society claims the result in 364 seats can be called now, based on current polls and how ‘safe’ they were in 2010. Scroll down for video . Some 70 per cent of seats in the East of England are considered safe, compared to 10 per cent in Scotland, where the SNP is expected to make sweeping gains . Of 303 Tory seats, 186 are considered safe while 151 of Labour’s 257 constituencies are not expected to change hands. The Lib Dems are defending 56 seats, of which only seven are considered safe, after a dramatic collapse in their poll ratings since joining the coalition with the Tories. Some parts of the country are more likely to play a role in deciding the outcome of the election than others. For example, 70 per cent of seats in the East of England are considered safe, compared to 10 per cent in Scotland, where the SNP is expected to make sweeping gains. The ERS has produced a new online tool for voters to see if they live in an area where the election result will be decided. It is campaigning for a change to the voting system, arguing that First Past The Post, where the winning candidate just needs to get the most votes, fails to take account of the changing face of British politics. Of 303 Tory seats, 186 are considered safe while 151 of Labour’s 257 constituencies are not expected to change hands.The Lib Dems are defending 56 seats, of which only seven are considered safe, after a dramatic collapse in their poll ratings since joining the coalition with the Tories . Based on the 2010 election result, David Cameron needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the Commons, while Ed Miliband needs at least  70. Nick Clegg is defending 56 seats, but is braced for heavy losses . The Tories need to win only 23 more seats to obtain a majority in the Commons, while Labour need 70. The polls suggests it could take three or more parties to form a majority, including the SNP, Lib Dems, DUP, Greens and Ukip. Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: ‘The fact that we can firmly predict the outcome of over half of the seats being contested this May is a sorry indictment of our outdated voting system. “The average constituency hasn’t changed hands since the 1960s, and some have been under the same party’s control since the reign of Queen Victoria. This is a huge disincentive for people to get out there and vote, and for other parties to challenge incumbents. We have a system which actively discourages voters and parties from taking part. “We urgently need a fairer electoral system to give voice to the many millions of people in safe seats who are not being heard. “Predicting the winners in a majority of seats shouldn’t be possible in a truly dynamic and modern democracy. But sadly that’s exactly what we’ve been able to do. The UK needs a fair voting system to bring our politics into the 21st century and give us a Parliament that actually reflects people’s wishes.” As part of the 2010 coalition agreement, the Lib Dems and Tories held a referendum on changing the voting system to the Alternative Vote, which allows voters to give their first and second choice of candidate. The winner is the first candidate to get over 50 per cent of the vote. However, in the referendum in 2011 it was roundly defeated when 67.9 per cent voted against it.","650 seats up for grabs on May 7 but more than half will not change hands because one party is so far ahead .

"Malaysia has passed a controversial terror law aimed at tackling growing support for Islamic State extremists in the country in a move opponents denounced as a harsh blow for civil rights. The Prevention of Terrorism Act - passed in the capital Kuala Lumpur yesterday - officially enables authorities to detain suspected terrorists for two years without charge or trial. But it also allows for the authorities to apply for unlimited extensions after those two years expire - something that will be decided by a government-appointed terrorism board, not a judge and jury. The bill effectively reintroduces the controversial prospect of indefinite detention without trial in Malaysia - something Prime Minister Najib Razak originally repealed in 2012. Rise: Malaysian police said in January they had arrested a total of 120 people with suspected links or sympathies to the Islamic State terror group (pictured), or who had sought to travel to war-torn Syria or Iraq . Razak's political opponents and human rights groups had urged for the bill to be withdrawn, claiming it is 'open to abuse and is a grievous blow to democracy'. Human Rights Watch described it as 'a giant step backwards for human rights'. The legislation was passed after midnight, following 15 hours of debate, according to media reports. Its passage was not in doubt due to the ruling regime's majority in parliament. Authorities have expressed increasing alarm in the wake of ISIS' bloody jihad in Syria, which police say has drawn dozens of recruits from traditionally moderate, Muslim-majority Malaysia. Yesterday police said 17 people, including two who recently returned from Syria, had been arrested on suspicion of plotting terror attacks in  Kuala Lumpur. No further details were given. International: Malaysian authorities have expressed increasing alarm in the wake of ISIS' bloody jihad in Syria, which police say has drawn dozens of recruits from traditionally moderate, Muslim-majority Malaysia . Police said in January they had arrested a total of 120 people with suspected Islamic State links or sympathies, or who had sought to travel to Syria or Iraq. They also said 67 Malaysians were known at the time to have gone abroad to join IS jihadists, and that five had died fighting for the movement. The terrorism act has heightened worries in Malaysia over a deepening crackdown on civil liberties launched by the government in the wake of a 2013 election setback. The ruling United Malays National Organisation has been in charge since 1957, but faces possible defeat at the hands of an opposition that has campaigned against government corruption and alleged abuse of power. Dozens of government critics, including opposition politicians, academics, activists, and journalists, have been hit with sedition or other charges after criticising the regime. Leader: The bill effectively reintroduces the controversial prospect of indefinite detention without trial in Malaysia - something Prime Minister Najib Razak (pictured) originally repealed in 2012 . In particular, the terror legislation has revived concerns of a return to a previous draconian Internal Security Act that allowed detention without trial and was repeatedly used against opposition politicians. The ISA was scrapped in 2012 amid public pressure for political reform. 'The passage of this law is a giant step backwards for human rights in Malaysia that fundamentally calls into question the government's commitment to basic rights that are critical to the rule of law in a functioning democracy,' Human Rights Watch's deputy Asia director Phil Robertson said. 'Passage of this legislation raises serious concerns that Malaysia will return to practices of the past when government agents frequently used fear of indefinite detention to intimidate and silence outspoken critics.' The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has said previously the law would not be used against anyone over their 'political' views.","Law allows police to hold suspects for two years without charge or trial .

"Roaming. The word suggests travelling with a worry-free, devil-may-care attitude. But in the world of mobile phones, where roaming means using your device abroad, that approach is unwise. Making calls, downloading emails and browsing the internet when in another country can result in very large bills. So how can you keep roaming costs down? The best option is to be with mobile operator Three. Its customers can call and text UK numbers and use data in some countries at no extra cost to their UK price plans. Three is the only operator to offer this arrangement, which it calls Feel At Home. Three's Feel at Home covers 18 destinations in Europe, Australia, the United States, Asia and the Middle East . In September 2013, when Three introduced Feel At Home, it covered seven destinations. I said then that to be a game-changer it needed to expand the service to more countries – and it has. With Spain and New Zealand added earlier this month, it now applies in 18 countries. In Europe, the deal also covers France, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Elsewhere, it covers Australia, the United States, Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Israel. Given that Spain, France, Italy and the US are among the most popular destinations for Britons, Three claims that about two-thirds of its customers’ overseas trips are now covered by Feel At Home. A word of warning. Three publicises Feel At Home by saying that it enables you to ‘use your phone abroad at no extra cost’. But to call or text non-UK numbers – imagine you are in Spain and you phone a restaurant in Barcelona – you will be charged extra, at roaming rates. However, these are much lower than other operators’ standard rates in some countries – for example, 15.6p per minute to call local numbers in the US, Australia and New Zealand. There are some other caveats, too – one being you can’t ‘tether’ (use your phone to connect another device to the internet). Check all details on three.co.uk/feelathome. Nonetheless, if you’re travelling to a Feel At Home country, using Three is the most preferable option. When travelling, operators’ bundles/ add-ons usually offer better value than their standard rates . Take roaming in New Zealand. On their standard rates for pay-monthly customers, rival operators charge up to £1.50 a minute for making and receiving calls, 35p to 50p for sending a text, and up to £8 per megabyte of data usage. In EU countries, roaming charges are much lower as they are capped. On operators’ standard rates, you’ll pay about 18p or 19p per minute to make a call, 5p per minute to receive a call, 5p to 6p to send a text and 20p per megabyte of data. If you’re not with Three and are heading to a Feel At Home destination, operators’ bundles/ add-ons usually offer better value than their standard rates – though it depends on your usage levels. To give one example, Vodafone lets you use your UK’s plan allowance for calls, texts and data for £3 a day in Europe, and £5 a day in some countries further afield. However, you will need to actively sign up to get this deal. If you have an unlocked handset, you might consider investing in a local, country-specific SIM card: see 0044.co.uk, uk2abroad.com or dataroam.co.uk for details. Otherwise, stick to using free wi-fi in, for example, hotels and cafes, which will also enable you to chat for free if you have a Skype or Viber account.

"David Cameron today boasted that 2million people have found work since 2010, as new employment figures showed the UK workforce is at another record high. Unemployment has continued to fall and a record 31 million people are in work, the last jobless figures before the general election have shown. The Prime Minister used the data to warn that the recovery would be 'put at risk' by a 'stitch-up' between Labour and the SNP, after Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon clashed in a TV debate last night. The Office for National Statistics said more than 31 million people were in work after an increase of more than half a million in the past year . David Cameron today warned the recovery would be put at risk by a Labour-SNP 'stitch-up' after the election on May 7 . The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that more than 31 million people were in work after an increase of more than half a million in the past year, the biggest total since records began in 1971. The figure is up from 29million in spring 2010, before the Tories and Lib Dems went into coalition. At the same time the jobless total fell by 76,000 to 1.84 million in the quarter to February, the lowest for almost seven years. Mr Cameron said: 'There are now 2 million more people in work than in 2010 – that's more families with the stability and security of a regular pay packet. 'This is thanks to the hard work and the determination of the British people, and the Conservatives' strong leadership and clear economic plan. 'It would all be put at risk with the chaos of a Miliband-SNP stitch-up, hiking borrowing, hurting the economy, and costing jobs – and it'll be hardworking taxpayers who'll pay.' He used a speech today to warn that a Labour government would put 1million jobs at risk. Claiming Mr Miliband represents a threat to jobs, the Tory leader said: 'You know what makes me really angry? It's when our opponents still go on about 'you Tories – the party for the few and not the many…' Excuse me? 'This is the party that's taken three million of the lowest-paid workers out of income tax altogether; that's cut the taxes of 26million working people; that's seen 1,000 jobs created every day – jobs that are giving families security, putting food on tables, helping people out of poverty. 'Under the last five years of Labour, unemployment went up by 600 people a day. 'So if Ed Miliband repeated the economic mistakes of the last Labour government – that he was a part of – he risks a million more people joining the dole queues.' The UK's unemployment rate is now 5.6 per cent, a fall of 1.3 per cent since a year ago. The rate was 7.9 per cent in May 2010, when the last general election was held . In a live TV debate last night between opposition leaders, Ms Sturgeon warned Mr Miliband is not 'strong enough' to win the election alone and urged him to ditch austerity to kick the Tories out. The Labour leader rejected the offer of a post-election deal, telling Ms Sturgeon: ''It's a 'no', I'm afraid. 'You want to gamble on getting rid of a Tory government; I can guarantee that we get rid of a Tory government if you vote Labour.' But polls suggest the SNP is set to make huge gains in Scotland, depriving Labour of hopes of securing an overall majority. The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance fell by 20,700 in March to 772,400, the 29th consecutive monthly cut. The UK's unemployment rate is now 5.6 per cent, a fall of 1.3 per cent since a year ago. The rate was 7.9 per cent in May 2010, when the last general election was held. Around 1.3 million people were in part-time jobs when they wanted full-time work, up by 29,000 in the latest quarter, while self-employment was little changed at 4.5 million. In a live TV debate last night between opposition leaders, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon warned Labour's Ed Miliband is not 'strong enough' to win the election alone and urged him to ditch austerity to kick the Tories out . The number of people classed as economically inactive, including those looking after a relative, on long-term sick leave or who have given up looking for work, fell by 104,000 to just under nine million. Average earnings increased by 1.7 per cent in the year to February, 0.2 per cent down on the previous month. Long-term unemployment has also fallen, down by 188,000 to 623,000 for those out of work for at least a year. Youth unemployment - 16 to 24-year-olds - fell by 22,000 in the three months to February to 742,000. The ONS also reported that 107,000 people were made redundant over the latest three months, little changed on the end of last year, but more than 200,000 fewer than the record peak of 311,000 in early 2009. There were 743,000 job vacancies across the country in January to March, 124,000 more than a year ago and the highest since records began in 2001. Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'Britain is the job creation powerhouse of the western economies. With record numbers of people in work and the highest employment rate ever, people can see the difference Lib Dems have made in government. 'The balance, common sense, fairness and financial discipline praised by the IMF today are the things we have brought to government.' Rachel Reeves, shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'Today's fall in overall unemployment is welcome, but with working people earning on average GBP1,600 less a year since 2010 and the biggest fall in wages over a parliament since 1874, it's clear the Tory plan is failing. Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said: 'The quarterly increase of 248,000 in the number of people in work in the UK is remarkably strong. With two-thirds of these additional people employed full-time and almost all employees in permanent jobs this surge indicates real momentum in the ongoing jobs recovery. 'Together with zero price inflation, the jobs boom is helping improve real incomes despite the fact that wage pressure remains subdued. However, the rise in employment and real wages continues to mask severe underlying weakness in labour productivity. This will have to improve markedly if the current recovery in living standards is to be sustained into the medium and long-term.'","Employment surges as the number in work hits a record 31million .

His extravagant purchase was met with surprise by one of his fellow fighters, Abou Shaheed al-Muhajir. Unwilling to reveal the cost of his furry investment, the fighter did confirm that he had bought the tiger cub from a small village, near the Syrian city of Aleppo, where he has recently been based. The news comes just a month after the 28-year-old revealed on social media that he was looking to buy an exotic pet to keep him company. Photos of three potential pets were tweeted by Ahmed Shaheed, starting with a sad leopard sitting in a dirty cage. He commented: 'I just made the zoo keeper an offer for this, he said no to start off but the dollar goes a long way.' The wealthy gunslinger also tweeted a picture of a little owl. Possibly due to its three year life expectancy, the grumpy looking owl didn't seem to particularly interest the rebel. The surprising news comes just a month after the 28-year-old revealed on social media that he was looking to buy an exotic pet to keep him company. A sad leopard sitting in a dirty cage, was the first possible animal that took the fighter's interest. Shaheed preferred the tiger despite it costing more money. Possibly due to its short life expectancy, the grumpy looking owl didn't seem to particularly interest the rebel. Unwilling to reveal the cost of his furry investment, the fighter only confirmed that he had bought the tiger cub from a small village, near the Syrian city of Aleppo. Keen to get opinions on the owl, Shaheed wrote: 'Or should I buy this one and teach it to send messages.' However it was the tiger that really appeared to attract the Aussie fighter's attention. Sitting alone in his den, the beautiful large tiger is pictured sitting proudly in the shade. Unusually it wasn't just the tiger cub that seemed to be the big talking point from new photo. A few social media users appear to be more concerned by the fighter's apparent lack of facial hair in the photo. Despite claiming to have been fighting in Syria for well over a year, the Aussie fighter's neck and chin area appear to be cleanly shaved. Keen to hide his identity, the former Bond university student posted an obscured photo of himself stroking a four month old lion. The fighter recently showed off his war booty of $525 and a Kalashnikov rifle, possibly explaining how he managed to pay for the tiger cub. One user cheekily wrote on Shaheed's Ask.Fm page: 'Is that u holding the tiger? Cause the beard should be longer to appear for someone who been there more than year and a half lol' With his ego bruised, the 28-year-old militant swiftly replied back, insisting he was looking up at the sky for any potential incoming fire from jets. 'I'm looking up at the sky in that pic thought i heard a jet. Is this advice on my beard coming from someone still chilling in darul kufr (land of the disbelievers) while jihad is fard ayn (obligatory)?' Shaheed is not the first fighter to purchase a pet tiger. Deputy commander of rebel group Jaish al-Mujahideen wal-Ansar, Abdul Karim Krymsky, was pictured holding a young tiger last month. Shaheed is not the first fighter to show off a pet tiger, colossal Chechen fighter Abdul Karim Krymsky posed with another tiger. Ahmed Shaheed is believed to be a former Bond University student, who reportedly left his home in Sydney and traveled to Syria to join the Al Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra. According to his Ask.Fm page, Ahmed became disillusioned with Jabhat al-Nusra and left the group. When asked who he is fighting for now, he wrote he was 'doing my own thing.' It is possible that Ahmed Shaheed has joined another rebel group in the Aleppo Liberation,based around the broken city of Aleppo. Asked why he chose not to join ISIS, Shaheed was clear: 'Dawla (ISIS) seems to be only involved in the infighting in Sham (Syria) and restricted to a few cities in sham. I want to travel the whole of syria fighting Bashar (al-Assad) and his allies, staying away from any group involved in infighting.' Shaheed posted a picture of his fellow fighter, Abu Baraa, in Doureen, near the Alawite dominated port city of Latakia. Keen to document his travels whilst fighting around Syria, Ahmed posted a picture of a well preserved Roman ruins in Hama province.","The photo shows a beautiful young tiger cub in the hands of a rebel fighter, known as Ahmed Shaheed .

"One New York-based teacher has found an incredibly fashionable and glamorous way to supplement his public school income, working as a model for some of the world’s top designers. Sam Pearce, 24, of Milton, Massachusetts, initially came to New York City to peruse a career in education, and soon after arriving in the Big Apple he landed a job teaching English to eighth graders in Brooklyn, New York. But just a few months after landing the job, the six-foot, green-eyed Brown University graduate was 'discovered' on the subway by another model, who promptly asked whether he could send Mr. Pearce’s picture to his own modeling agency in the hopes of getting him signed up. Model behavior: New York teacher Sam Pearce, 24, was discovered on the F train in New York City and now juggles his career as an eighth-grade English teacher with a side job modelling for top designers . 'I was taken aback and flattered, but also kind of incredulous,' he told Racked of the encounter, which took place on the F train. 'He was just like, ""Hey, you're a model, right?"" I said, ""Noooo, I'm a teacher, dude.""' Soon after, Mr. Pearce, who was at the time teaching a summer school course and standing to earn $45,530 in the coming school year, signed a modelling contract with RED NYC and started posing for designer lookbooks and walking in fashion shows in London and Milan under the name Sam Worthen, a pseudonym taken from his mother's maiden name. But the hunky instructor insists that he doesn't let his side job posing for Alexander McQueen, Diesel Black Gold, and DKNY interfere with his responsibility to his students. Classroom to catwalk: Mr. Pearce says his two jobs are similar in that they are both hectic and he needs to keep a straight face during each of them . Renaissance man: Besides teaching and modelling, Mr. Pearce also speaks French, Spanish, and Italian and composes his own music . 'My agents have been pretty great about understanding that teaching is my priority, and they've gotten me jobs that require me to miss little or no school,' he said. 'I did the Alexander McQueen show — that was my first real show — over a weekend. I flew out to London on Saturday evening, did the show, and then flew home immediately after; so I was in London for 12 hours.' He also managed to fit walking in New York Fashion Week this February into his teaching schedule, modelling in shows during New York City public schools' week-long winter break. In fact, Mr. Pearce managed to maintain the secret of his second identity until very recently, and even then, he admits he only revealed himself because he thought the publicity could benefit his kids. Male model: Mr. Pearce knows there's more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking; he also places a lot of importance on getting his English students to read . 'I thought if people take interest in my story I could convert that interest into resources for my students,' he told Fox CT. Mr. Pearce launched a Go-Fund-Me campaign called The Right Book to raise funds to buy all 67 of his students new books, and the attention his plea received helped him quickly surpass his goal of $3,000 in donations. He is now urging would-be donors to help more teachers and students through fundraising website DonorsChoose.org. 'I definitely think of myself as a teacher who happens to model, rather than a model who happens to teach,' he told People, adding that it is clear to him that models are replaceable but teachers are not.","Sam Pearce goes by the name Sam Worthen when he works as a model .

"Google claims to have cracked a problem that has flummoxed anyone who has tried to read a doctor's note - how to read anyone's handwriting. The firm claims the latest update to its Android handsets can under 82 languages in 20 distinct scripts, and works with both printed and cursive writing input with or without a stylus. It even allows users to simply draw emoji they want to send. Scroll down for video . The California search giant claims the latest update to its Android handsets can understand handwriting in 82 languages in 20 distinct scripts. Google says its handwriting recognition works by 'building on large-scale language modeling, robust multi-language OCR, and incorporating large-scale neural-networks and approximate nearest neighbour search for character classification.' 'Entering text on mobile devices is still considered inconvenient by many; touchscreen keyboards, although much improved over the years, require a lot of attention to hit the right buttons,' Google said. 'Voice input is an option, but there are situations where it is not feasible, such as in a noisy environment or during a meeting. 'Using handwriting as an input method can allow for natural and intuitive input method for text entry which complements typing and speech input methods.' Google Handwriting Input is now available on Android phones, and the firm said it took 'many years' to perfect. 'Google Handwriting Input is the result of many years of research at Google.

"Aeroplanes are infamous as breeding grounds for bacteria, with tray tables, seats and blankets singled out as the worst offenders on board. But an entrepreneurial team are hoping their new invention will revolutionise the cleaning of aircraft and help airlines win the battle against bacteria . Arthur and Mo Kreitenberg have created a robot, called the Germfalcon, which uses ultra violet light to kill bacteria throughout the cabin. Scroll down for video . A father and son team have created a robot, called the Germfalcon, which uses ultra violet light to kill bacteria throughout the cabin . The seats, tray tables and blankets on an aeroplane are breeding ground for bacteria including E.coli . According to the businessmen, germs such as E.coli and MRSA can linger for up to a week on suraces within an aircraft and there are no clear rules on how often aeroplanes should be cleaned. But the family team has developed the unusual new robot as a way to counter issues with cleaning the interior of a plane - which currently only takes place a few times a year. When the plane is parked and empty, the device, which is the size of a drinks cart, patrols the aisles using motion sensors to navigate itself. As it does, it spreads its two 'wings' over the seats on either side. Those wings contain UV-C lamps, which are the same type used for disinfection in places like hospitals and water treatment plants. It also has UV-C lamps on its top and sides. Arthur and Mo Kreitenberg, from Los Angeles, said the 3.5billion people expected to fly this year risk falling ill due to poor plane hygiene. Writing on their Kickstarter page to raise money for their project, Mo  said: 'Germs will survive on aeroplane surfaces sometimes for as long as seven days. 'There are no regulations or cleanliness standards for the passenger cabins of airplanes. Aeroplane travelers are at heightened risk of catching the common cold, flu, or more serious infections.' They said their device could spare passengers from catching illnesses when flying and give airlines a competitive edge. Last year a study from the Auburn University in Alabama discovered disease-causing bacteria can survive for up to a week inside plane cabins, on surfaces such as seat pockets, tray tables, window shades and armrests. When the plane is parked and empty, the device, which is the size of a drinks cart, patrols the aisles using motion sensors to navigate itself. As it does, it spreads its two 'wings' over the seats on either side . Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a bacteria that could cause infections, skin disease, pneumonia and sepsis, lived the longest (168 hours). Escherichia coli (E. coli), which can cause urinary tract infection, respiratory illness and diarrhoea, was found to survive for 96 hours. Mo added: 'The industry is growing aggressively. Implementing daily, routine airplane sanitization could disrupt or limit the rate bacteria and viruses spread, as the industry grows. 'We have created an efficient and practical way for airlines to sanitize the interiors of commercial planes between passenger loads. Its wings contain UV-C lamps, which are the same type used for disinfection in places like hospitals and water treatment plants. It also has UV-C lamps on its top and sides . Using UV-C light they have have proven a 99.99 per cent germ-kill rate in under 10 minutes with no damage or reaction from any cabin materials . 'Using UV-C light, we have proven a 99.99 per cent germ-kill rate in under 10 minutes with no damage or reaction from any cabin materials. The Germfalcon is programmed to reach the most commonly touched passenger surfaces and kill all germs that are exposed to the robot's sanitising lights.' The robot, which contains settings for sanitising toilets and galleys, also comes with fans and filters to clean the air and suck in dust particles. The Kreitenburgs, who have been working on the robot for several years, are about to start work on their fourth and final prototype before going into commercial production. They are currently seeking sponsorship via Kickstarter and are offering backers the chance to fly on the first completely clean flight.","Kickstarter campaign claims to have developed way to sterilise planes .
