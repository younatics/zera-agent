"Neil Redfearn is considering his position as manager of Leeds United after the club suspended his assistant Steve Thompson on Thursday. Leeds took two months to appoint Thompson but he was told in a letter from director of football Nicola Salerno yesterday morning that he was be suspended until the end of the season effectively ending his time at Elland Road after 105 days. Thompson is understood to have been told that he will be suspended until his contract expires at the end of the season. He has also been informed that an option to renew his deal will not be taken up by the club. Leeds United assistant manager Steve Thompson (left) has been suspended by the club . Thompson's suspension has left manager Neil Redfearn considering his future at Elland Road . A club statement read: 'The director of football Nicola Salerno, has today (April 2) suspended the assistant coach Steve Thompson from his duties at the club. This is an internal matter and the club will make no further comment on this internal issue.' Redfearn, the club's third coach of the season, took training before attending a delayed press conference and said: 'It’s become difficult for me. It’s not ideal timing. It’s not helped. I’ve got to have a good think about my future now. It undermines everything. We have put things together me and Steve. Before it was a no brainer for me to stay on, not so much now. 'I love this club, I was brought up on Leeds United but this situation is a difficult one for me . 'Thommo was informed this morning through a letter. He’s been suspended - for what, I don’t know. You’d have to find that out from the club. I don’t understand why he has been suspended. I’m bitterly disappointed. It’s a difficult one for me to take, I can’t think for one minute why someone who has been part of this success has been sacked. 'Me and Steve were the ideal partnership, he’s been great for me and I’m bitterly disappointed that he’s not here.' Redfearn’s contract is also up at the end of the season and club president Massimo Cellino is suspended until May 3. Sol Bamba heads home in a recent win for the Whites at Fulham's Craven Cottage . Leeds sit 13th in the Championship table but were unbeaten in March and take on Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. It is also understood that Redfearn is under pressure not to select top scorer Mirco Antenucci who will trigger a bonus clause in his contract should he score two more goals. Thompson is taking advice from the LMA while Salerno's own position is thought to be open to review at the end of the season.","Steve Thompson suspended by Leeds just 19 games in to No 2 role .

"John Carver says he will use a whip if he has to in a bid to motivate his Newcastle players ahead of Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby at the Stadium of Light. The Magpies have lost the last four matches against their North-East rivals and head coach Carver – who was assistant to Alan Pardew during that wretched run – admits that Sunderland wanted victory more than United on those occasions. ‘In the last four games Sunderland have out-worked us - and that's not a good stat to have,’ he said. John Carver says he will 'whip' his players to make sure they're motivated to beat Sunderland on Sunday . Dick Advocaat will take charge of his second game as boss and will want to keep Sunderland's record going . ‘I'll be making sure that doesn't happen again and I'll be using a whip to make sure we don't get out-worked.’ There is a suggestion that Newcastle will struggle for motivation given the comfort of their mid-table position compared to the Black Cats, who are fighting for Premier League survival. But Carver said: ‘I disagree, we’ve got everything to play for. That’s not just because of our respective league positions, we've lost the last four derbies and drawn the previous one. Moussa Sissoko (left) will captain Newcastle but he's been poor in his previous appearances in the derby . Newcastle players warm up during a training session at St. James' Park as they prepare for Sunderland . ‘We've got an awful lot to prove. I shouldn't have to motivate players to play in a Premier League match. This is a big occasion.' He added: ‘A lot of people out there say that because we've got a lot of foreign players they don't know what the game means, but that's an easy excuse. ‘With the staff we've got here we drum it into them every single day. You have to cope with the heat of the derby, it can make you or break you.’ Massadio Haidara's knee injury will keep him out of action for the rest of the Premier League campaign .

There's one or two lads in that dressing room who need a good game in the derby because they've not done in the past. ‘If we get enough payers imposing themselves on the game then we have a good chance of winning it.’ Meanwhile, Carver confirmed that defender Massadio Haidara will miss the rest of the season following knee surgery but Mehdi Abeid is expected to be in the squad.

"David Templeton has delivered a damning critique of the training-ground methods deployed at Rangers by Ally McCoist and Kenny McDowall. The Ibrox winger claimed Stuart McCall had brought a brand of coaching and tactical preparation he felt was lacking under the previous management. Templeton praised the impact the former Motherwell boss has made since his arrival on a short-term deal last month, with back-to-back wins having revived confidence ahead of Saturday's home meeting with Championship title-winners Hearts. Rangers winger David Templeton is full of praise for the impact of new boss Stuart McCall . Templeton says that McCall's training ground methods are superior to the previous management's . 'For me, it's a coaching thing,' said Templeton, assessing the changes under the new leadership. 'We're being coached more and, building up to games, we're working on different formations, which players are going to play, movements, all different stuff, like most teams probably do. 'For me, it has been great, every boy going into a game knows what they have to do, basically. 'The tempo of training, the intensity, everything has been right up and it has been really enjoyable actually, but tough. That's what we needed.' Asked if that was not the case beforehand, Templeton simply replied: 'No.' Pressed to expand, he added: 'I don't think we were being coached the right way. We weren't going into games working on the stuff I think we should have been working on, which we are doing now and that is showing with the results. 'We should probably still have won games that we didn't. But going into games knowing what you have to do does definitely help and I think that showed in the Hibs game two weeks ago. 'We changed the formation and shut out their midfield, their most creative part, and that showed with the result. They didn't create any chances - I don't think Cammy (Bell) had a save to make. That was just through working on things during the week.' Former boss McCoist was placed on garden leave last December with assistant McDowall becoming caretaker manager. He then stepped down when McCall and Kenny Black arrived. Despite his unflattering assessment, Templeton insisted he was not attacking the qualities of McCoist or McDowall. 'It's not that I think it's better coaching,' said Templeton. 'Every coach has a different style. 'The way we were going, we needed to work on things to get back to playing well and defending well. 'We were gifting too many goals and I think that was just through not working on the back four or back three, whatever we were playing. I don't think that he' s a bad coach or anything, just that since the manager has come in we've worked on stuff we had to work on.' Templeton has singled out the change in formation and new-found intensity as behind the improvement .","Rangers winger David Templeton is full of praise for the impact of new boss Stuart McCall .

"Celta Vigo forward Nolito has declared that Lionel Messi should hit the Spanish coast on Sunday instead of risking his foot injury during their La Liga clash. The Barcelona forward has been training following a minor problem, and is set to recover in time for the trip to Celta, but 28-year-old Nolito has urged the Argentine to stay away. 'I guess he'll come, but he can spend the day at the beach as far as I'm concerned,' Nolito told Marca. 'I'll give his dad a ring in a minute.' Lionel Messi should be fit to face Celta Vigo for Barcelona after recovering from a foot injury . Barcelona forward trains alongside team-mate Javier Mascherano (centre) on Thursday .

"Robbie Neilson insists the likes of captain Danny Wilson will only leave Hearts if he is satisfied it's right for the club. As Sportsmail revealed this week, Celtic have placed former Rangers defender Wilson on a list of potential summer recruits. Speaking ahead of Sunday's Championship clash with the Ibrox club, Neilson admitted external interest in his promoted players is inevitable. Hearts manager Robbie Neilson will not sell his players unless it is the right move for the club . Echoing the view of owner Ann Budge, however, the Tynecastle coach says departures will only happen on his say-so if the price is right. 'If you do really well in the Championship and the players excel then there is going to be interest,' admitted Neilson. 'That is football. 'There has been interest in a lot of my players and we have a few boys out of contract, who we are negotiating with at the moment. 'I would like to try to keep my best players but there is a realisation that bigger clubs can come in and take them. 'What I would say is: I wouldn't expect to lose anyone that I don't want to lose. If there are people I want to keep, I expect to keep them. Hearts have already secured promotion to the Scottish Premiership under Neilson's stewardship . 'If teams come in with an offer that is acceptable to us, then I'll expect to lose them. 'What I don't expect to happen is someone moves on and we are not happy about it. If someone leaves the club then it will be on terms that are acceptable to the club and the player.' Parkhead coach Ronny Deila admitted Wilson, a one-time £2million signing for Liverpool, is on his list of potential replacements for Jason Denayer and Virgil van Dijk, linked with Sunderland and Southampton. With a shrug of resignation, Neilson added: 'People talk about how comments from other managers can unsettle you. I think it gives you a boost, because you realise that teams admire you and are interested in you. 'When no team is interested in you... that is what unsettles you. You start worrying when nobody is talking about you. If there is interest in players then it just shows that they are doing really well. 'Big clubs talk, but I would like to think the majority of players have enjoyed their season here and would like to have a good crack at the top league. This is a great place to play and, if they do leave, then they must be really careful about where they go.' Owner Ann Budge has set Neilson and his players the target of a top-six finish in the top flight next season . Neilson, alongside director of football Craig Levein, is more focused on bringing new players into Hearts than losing the ones he has. Defender Adam Eckersley is out of contract, with talks to keep him ongoing. 'It is a case of getting things ironed out, really,' continued Neilson. 'There are also players I want to bring in who I am in talks with. The squad needs to change. 'I can't keep the same squad and expect to have the same impact at a higher level. Players will come in, players will go out and things will continue to evolve. Hopefully at the end of it we have a better team than we do now.' With six games of the Championship season to go and promotion already secured, Neilson already knows his targets for his second season as a manager. Speaking at the announcement of a ground-breaking sponsorship deal with charity Save the Children, Budge set her sights on a top-six finish in the Premiership. Captain Danny Wilson has been linked with Celtic, but won't be sold unless it is the right move for Hearts . Accepting the challenge, Neilson said: 'That is a target and life is all about setting yourself targets. I think getting into the top six is a reasonable aim. 'We have good players here already and we will be recruiting again over the summer to get better players in again. 'We have bags of confidence and a massive fanbase, which has backed us to the hilt. We have to aim for the top six. 'That is just the nature of the beast as head coach of a big football club - you need to meet the standards. To be honest, a top-six finish for a club like Hearts - if they had not been in the Championship - would be the bare minimum which should be acceptable.' To that end, there has been no let-up since securing promotion. Hearts players were shocked to be saddled with a triple training session this week despite securing their promotion goal with something to spare. The former Rangers defender (right, pictured against his former club) could join Celtic in the summer . Unbeaten away from home this season, Neilson wants that record to continue at Ibrox, where his side laid down a marker on the first day of the season. 'We had a triple session and, although we weren't out for too long, we were working hard for Sunday,' he revealed. 'We can't just think that we can down tools because we have won the league. 'We have six games and you simply have to win games at Hearts. 'We are not going to take our foot off the gas. It would be easy to just play games in training and say: ""Let's have a jolly up for the week"". 'When you do that, you lose focus and lose sight of what a big game Sunday is. It is a chance to go to Ibrox as champions and hopefully get a result.' Ironically, a third victory of the season over a Rangers side showing signs of improvement under Stuart McCall would benefit arch city rivals Hibernian the most. Of the view Hearts must win games for themselves rather than others, however, Neilson insisted: 'We don't owe that to any other teams - we owe it to ourselves and the fans, for our own personal pride. We have sold out our allocation on Sunday and everyone is paying good money to come and watch us. We need to give everything. It is not fair if we don't perform.'","Hearts have already secured promotion to the Scottish top flight .

"Sam Allardyce has warned Brendan Rodgers that putting Raheem Sterling on a bumper new contract could cause a ripple effect across the rest of the Liverpool squad. The West Ham manager feels paying Sterling more than the £100,000-per-week deal he was already offered would lead to the 20-year-old's team-mates demanding more. Yet Allardyce does not blame Sterling, currently on £35,000 a week at Liverpool, for trying to get as much as possible. Big Sam feels there are so few talented youngsters emerging that clubs are willing to pay extraordinary wages to sign any available. Liverpool and England star Raheem Sterling has stalled over signing a new contract at the Anfield club . Sam Allardyce believes that giving Sterling a bumper deal could risk unsettling the other Liverpool players . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (right) is extremely keen to keep hold of one of the club's best players . 'When the supply is far less than the demand, then you've got very big demands from the youngster, who is a very talented youngster because there are not enough about,' Allardyce said. 'Not just in the country but in Europe in general, if not in the world. 'The demand is out there. The supply is minimal. A lot less than we want it to be. Hence that gives it a value. When that comes around it's very difficult for a football club not to pay that level of finance that they then demand. 'It reflects down the way from there on in, by the fact that the more the money goes up at the top end the more everybody else wants going down below that.' Allardyce feels if a club were to buy the England international, who currently has two years left on his contract at Liverpool, then they would not only be getting a player, but a brand. 'If a player is in his position like Raheem Sterling, then you're going to look at his value,' Allardyce added. 'Not just his value on the pitch but his value in branding. 'You have to remember that we're hitting 950 million viewers every weekend. The agents and his advisers look at the value of that to the football club, and the value of that to him and their brand, and they ask for that sort of money.' Sterling drags the ball back ahead of the oncoming challenge from Lithuania's Georgas Freidgeimas (left) Sterling scored his first goal for England during the 4-0 win in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania . Big Sam was speaking ahead of West Ham's match with the Barclays Premier League's bottom-club Leicester City on Saturday. The game will see Allardyce reunited with Leicester manager Nigel Pearson after they worked together at Newcastle United in 2007. Pearson has been involved in several controversial incidents this season, including grabbing Crystal Palace's James McArthur by the throat and losing his cool with a reporter during a press conference. It added to speculation Pearson will be sacked but Allardyce defended the man that was once a coach under him at St James' Park. 'Nigel was there (at Newcastle) when I arrived and we worked very well together in that short period of time,' Allardyce said. 'I always thought he was management material and I think he left just after I left, then moved into management and has been very successful. 'I suppose in the end Nigel is a very, very, very, very honest man. He says it how it is. Perhaps that's sometimes the wrong thing to do publicly, but he knows who he is. He knows what he wants. He knows how to try to achieve it.'

The Baggies almost got relegated under Alan Irvine (above) last season before Pulis arrived to save the day . 'We will talk about it (summer transfer market) once we have achieved our goals - which is to stay up. We are still points away from that,' said Pulis. 'Once that is achieved we will sit down and talk to the chairman. It is a good football club, everything is in place. 'It has gone a little bit off the rails in the last two or three years.

"Arsenal legend Ian Wright would be disappointed to see Theo Walcott leave north London, and believes his troubled times at the club are down to Arsene Wenger's refusal to play him as a striker. Walcott has made just five starts for Arsenal this season since returning from a serious knee injury after seven months on the sidelines. And with Arsenal pursuing Raheem Sterling and Walcott's contract set to run out next summer, Wright is worried that the Gunners could stand to lose a valuable player. Theo Walcott could be on the way out of Arsenal, and Gunners legend Ian Wright says that would be 'a shame' Wright enjoys Walcott as a player and hinted that he would like to see the winger stay at the club . Walcott started up front for England against Italy on Tuesday but his appearances have been limited this year . 'It's a shame for him, and the fact that people are talking about him maybe moving on if someone else comes in makes me quite sad,' he said. 'I really like him at Arsenal but he's got massive decisions to make in the next few months.' Wright also believes the England wideman, who was played in a central role for his country in Italy on Tuesday night, should have been moved into a similar position for his Arsenal. Walcott's pace had seen him likened to the Gunners' record goalscorer Thierry Henry, who made a similar positional switch during his time in north London, but manager Wenger has only briefly experimented with Walcott as a striker.

I'm not saying he's the same kind of player as Thierry Henry by any stretch, but I thought Arsene would move him inside. 'I think that's been to his detriment, because he would have learned a lot more about the game and runs he'd have to make.

"Roberto  Martinez is backing Ross Barkley to become an even more influential player for Everton and England after negotiating second-season syndrome at Goodison Park. Barkley has had an indifferent campaign for the Toffees on the back of his inclusion in last summer’s England World Cup party and a knee operation which disrupted his return to domestic duty. But England coach Roy Hodgson has kept faith with the 21-year-old and Martinez believes his two substitute appearances for England against Lithuania and Italy over the past week have shown that the midfielder is ready to kick on again. Roberto Martinez is backing Ross Barkley to become an even more influential player for Everton and England . Barkley impressed after coming off the substitutes bench during England's 1-1 draw in Turin . Martinez said: 'Ross is a young man but he is used to having to deal with extremes. When he plays well he is probably the best footballer England has. When he has a bad game it’s the end of the world. 'He has achieved an incredible level of maturity this season. 'He had to go through a period of difficulty the same way we have as a team and I think he has learned a lot.

"England will not be playing in the Under 19 European Championships this summer after losing 2-1 to France in their decisive final qualifier. Having beaten Denmark and Azerbaijan in their opening Elite Round qualifiers, the Young Lions had to beat France in Saint-Lo to advance to July's finals in Greece . But goals from Sehrou Guirassy and Gnaly Cornet put the hosts in command and a late response from Fulham's Patrick Roberts wasn't enough to rescue Sean O'Driscoll's team. Patrick Roberts was on target for England's Young Lions against France but it wasn't enough to qualify . Boosted by the return of Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Harry Winks from suspension, O'Driscoll reverted to the line-up that had beaten Denmark 3-2 late last week. A swirling wind in Normandy made playing conditions difficult, with any long balls ineffective, and consequently the first period saw very few chances. France managed to take one of theirs, however, just after the half-hour mark. Neal Maupay fired the ball into a crowded penalty area and Guirassy had the presence of mind to divert it past England goalkeeper Angus Gunn. Chelsea' Izzy Brown came close to equalising shortly before half-time but sent Demarai Gray's cross over the bar inside the six-yard box. Sean O'Driscoll's team have missed out on this summer's European Championship finals in Greece . France's second goal, five minutes into the second half, left England with a mountain to climb. Maupay again provided the assist, passing to Cornet to drill the ball in off the near post. The home side were almost over the finish line but there was a flicker of hope for England when Roberts halved the deficit from a Ruben Loftus-Cheek cross 11 minutes from time. But England required a further two goals because of their inferior goal difference in the group and there was to be no late drama as their Euro ambitions faded.

"Newcastle midfielder Jonas Gutierrez is hoping to celebrate his return to first-team action with a much-needed derby victory over struggling Sunderland. The 31-year-old Argentinian has appeared as a substitute in each of the Magpies' last three games following his return from testicular cancer, and has been welcomed warmly back into the fold on and off the pitch.

"NRL referees and officials have been struck with projectiles by angry supporters after a tight contest between South Sydney and Canterbury ended in controversy. Rabbitohs sealed a final minute 18-17 victory over the Bulldogs in an absorbing encounter at ANZ Stadium in Sydney during the Good Friday showdown. But fans turned on referee Gerard Sutton and his colleagues after they penalised Bulldogs captain James Graham in the final minute, effectively handing the Rabbitohs the win. As referees, officials and players made their way off the field and towards the tunnel after full time, a section of the crowd started hurling  plastic water bottles and abuse at them. Sideline interchange official Darren Alchin has been taken to hospital with a suspected broken shoulder after he slipped to avoid being hit with bottles as he fell to the ground.

He was assisted to his feet and moved to the officials room after he managed to escape with no injuries. A NSW police spokeswoman has confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that two people have been formally identified for allegedly throwing bottles as they continue to investigate the incident. 'Police will be taking legal action against them while inquiries to identify others involved are continuing,' a police statement said. Canterbury coach Des Hasler has apologised on behalf of his club over the actions of some fans after objects were thrown. 'I just want to offer an apology on behalf of the club,' Hasler said. 'I've been to see the refereeing official who was I think struck by a projectile he's ok but that is not us, that is not what this club is about and it's not what sport in this country is about. 'Unfortunately the behaviour of a few can kind of ruin it and spoil it for everybody. 'On behalf of all the officials and the players and everybody involved with the club, our sincerest apologies for what appeared and it won't happen again.' A Bulldogs supporter gestures at the end of the match after a controversial penalty was awarded to Souths . Canterbury chief executive Raelene Castle said the incident will be investigated and the club has called for a life ban on fans who were involved in the attack .

Bulldogs fans were incensed when the Rabbitohs were awarded a kick right in front of the posts, after a late tackle on Reynolds as he attempted a field goal. Sutton then invoked the NRL rulebook which states that if a player impedes an opponent when attempting a field goal the penalty will be taken from 10 metres out. Graham was furious at the decision and he and fellow prop David Klemmer surrounded Sutton with Klemmer sin-binned for yelling: 'You're off your f******g face,' in the face of the lead official.

"Former England captain Kevin Sinfield has been warned he will be a 'target' when he makes the switch to rugby union at the end of the season. Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league on Tuesday with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season . Castleford head coach Daryl Powell, the man who made Sinfield captain at the age of 22, trod the same path, although in a coaching capacity after losing the Rhinos top job in 2003, and has a word of warning for his former team-mate. 'It surprised me a little bit,' Powell said. 'It will be interesting to see if he can make a success of it but he's been an outstanding player and captain within the sport and you wouldn't back against him. I think he's been unbelievable in his career. 'He won't need my advice. He knows what he's doing. I'm sure he will have done all his homework. Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012 . 'It's certainly a challenge. You look at Sam Burgess and what he's going through, and Iestyn Harris - it's tough. It's not an easy thing to do. 'The one thing you do have is a bit of a sign on you, on your head. You're a bit of a target. 'It's a completely different sport. It will be interesting to see what position he's going to play, but I wish him all the best.' Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year . Sinfield, who has guided the Rhinos to six Super League titles, three World Club Challenges and the Challenge Cup in 2014 at the expense of Powell's Castleford, will be the second high-profile departure from Headingley at the end of the year following Jamie Peacock's appointment as Hull KR's new football manager. The former Golden Boot winner is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, but Powell believes his old club have a ready-made replacement in 20-year-old Liam Sutcliffe, who has deputised for an injured Sinfield in the last two matches. 'They've got some really good young players,' Powell said. 'Liam Sutcllife has slotted in there and seems to be doing a good job. He looks like a mature young player who can handle things pretty much the way Kevin did when he was a young fella. Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final . 'I was obviously at the back end of my career when Kevin started and it looked like he was going to be an outstanding player. But I don't think anyone could have foreseen how good he was going to be and how many things he would win and how much he would grow as a leader in the game. He's been awesome.' Sinfield has been named in Leeds' 19-man squad for Friday's derby at Castleford, but coach Brian McDermott will not rush his skipper back. 'I'm not sure if he's going to be fit for Friday,' McDermott said. 'What we have got to make sure when Kev does come back into the team is that he's 100 per cent fit. 'Sutcliffe's played really well in these last couple of games. He's held his own and in some parts of the games has played really well. 'It's good to know that while Kevin's in recovery, Sutty is doing a good job and getting more experience.'","Kevin Sinfield has announced he is leaving Leeds at the end of the season .

"A new video that shows homeless people reading out cruel tweets that have been written about them is guaranteed to form a lump in your throat. The clip, which was filmed by the creative agency Leo Burnett Toronto for the homeless charity Humans For Humans, is designed to make people think twice about the way that they look at people who sleep rough.

This couple read out the message: 'I hate the homeless, I don’t feel sorry for you. If you want change let me through it at you as hard as I can at your dirty face' A member of the team who made the video said: 'We set out to give the homeless a voice and put a human face to the individuals so often get mistaken for stereotypes. 'Their reactions will remind you the conversation around the issue needs to change. All humans should work together.' In the video, we see a couple called Tristan and Robyn have been homeless for 10 years read out the message: 'I hate the homeless, I don’t feel sorry for you. If you want change let me through it at you as hard as I can at your dirty face.' A young man called Jesse, who has been homeless for three years, said: 'I hate when it gets cold out because then all of the homeless people get on the bus.' Paul  reads out the tweet: 'I hate seeing homeless people standing in the cold shivering. Be glad when the light turns green' Several of the men and women, who all live in Toronto, break down in tears as they read the hurtful comments. Peter has been homeless for eight year and wells up as he reads out the tweet: 'I wonder if homeless people go to heaven.' Cheryl, who has been without a home for seven years cries as she reads: 'If home is where the heart is then are homeless people heartless? In a separate video, the men and women respond to common misconceptions about people who sleep on the streets. Peter  reads out the tweet: 'I wonder if homeless people go to heaven' Kim, who has been homeless for three years, cries after reading out the message: 'Never understand why homeless people smell of p**s when you can literally p**s anywhere.' Melissa, who has been homeless for 10 years, ended up homeless because she endured an abusive childhood that saw her put into care. She said: 'My biological mother was very problematic she was abusive towards my siblings and I, she set the house on fire and left my sisters and I in the house. 'We were returned to her care and then she wasn’t taking proper care of her us I was taken back into care. 'I ended up in a group home in Toronto where I ran away when I was 17 and I [have been] on my own since.' She reads out the message: 'I was enjoying a latte when I saw a hobo girl across the street. I almost vomited. 'Get back on your side of the bridge, no one likes you.'

I almost vomited.'Get back on your side of the bridge, no one likes you' Cheryl breaks down as she reads: 'If home is where the heart is then are homeless people heartless?' Another man called Kim ended up homeless after struggling to cope with the deaths of both his partner and his parents. He said: 'How my journey to homeless really began was through the death of my partner. 'Then dealing with my mother and father’s death kept compounding the grief until it became so heavy that it crushed me. 'There was nothing of any value left. I couldn’t pay the rent and got evicted. I took what clothes I could and I donated all of his clothes to a shelter. 'I took all of the suitcases I had and locked them in the bus terminal lockers and went and sat in City Hall at the fountain and that’s when I spent my first night there.' He cries after reading out the tweet: 'Never understand why homeless people smell of p**s when you can literally p**s anywhere.' Kubby reads out the message: 'Maybe if homeless people took care of themselves and looked pretty we would want to help them but I don’t help yellow teeth' Jesse reads out the tweet: 'I hate when it gets cold out because then all of the homeless people get on the bus' While all of the people in the video have been homeless for a considerable amount of time, a man called Kubby has spent the most amount of time sleeping rough - 47 years. He addresses the allegation that most people who are homeless are alcoholics or drug addicts, telling the cameras: 'People state that if you’re homeless you’re an alcoholic or drug user. 'I was drinking before I was born because my mum was an alcoholic and she drank during the pregnancy, it created health problems for myself and an infant and growing up. 'We’re not all bad people, we’ve got feelings, we’re caring, we have friendships, just give us a chance.' Jesse backs the wish for people to see through the fact that they are homeless and to recognise that they are human beings, just like everyone else. He said: 'Let’s stand together as people, why do we have to always begrudge other people just because of the way they look, the way they sound, the way they smell. 'That is still a person, they’re still drawing breath and they still have a heartbeat, they still love and have sadness, they’re still people.'","A short film highlights the nasty things people say about the homeless .

"Things haven't been going well for Manchester United flop Anderson since he left Old Trafford to return to Brazil, but at least on Wednesday his own errors were outshone by the stupidity of a team-mate. The Brazilian midfielder was sent off for Internacional after a first-half off-the-ball shove on Ypiranga Erechim striker Otacilio Neto that also saw his opponent sent off for retaliating with an elbow.

"Jose Mourinho could one day make a shock return to manage Real Madrid even after his high-profile and acrimonious exit, according to Real defender Alvaro Arbeloa. The Chelsea manager ended his three-year spell in Madrid to rejoin his current club in 2013, leaving the Spanish capital amid rumours of bust-ups with senior players, including club captain Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos and Pepe. But right back Arbeloa, who has made 25 first-team appearances this season, says Real's door will never be closed to bringing the combustible Portuguese coach back as boss.

'Yes there is a possibility of Jose returning to Madrid,' Arbeloa said. 'Why not? Madrid's door is not closed for a great coach. 'Mourinho has many fond memories of Real Madrid. For La Decima, we have to credit Ancelotti but Jose planted the foundations.' Mourinho left Madrid and rejoined Chelsea in 2013 and has since led his team to the brink of another title . The Special One endured a trophyless campaign in his last year with Real which he said was his worst season . Arbeloa was said to be one of Mourinho's main 'disciples' in the dressing room, and he admits he has spoken with the Chelsea manager as recently as last week. He also said that despite the talk of unrest in the camp at Real, the Special One left on good terms before joining Chelsea, particularly with expected summer transfer target Raphael Varane.

"A period of striving came to an end for Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers at the Emirates on Saturday. Hope expired. The manager's 15-minute press conference, where he conceded that his team's chances of qualifying for the Champions League were over, was a requiem for lost opportunities. Rodgers did his best to stay upbeat. The Liverpool manager does not do disconsolate. But he did not pretend that this has not been a difficult season. After their heroic tilt at the title last year, Liverpool have slipped out of contention. It is a bitter pill to swallow for a club that had scented a return to glory. It still feels as if Liverpool are moving forward under Rodgers. It still feels as if he has the confidence, the ability and the strategy to take them back to the top. But there is no disguising the fact that this is an uncomfortable, uncertain time for the manager and his players. Brendan Rodgers admitted Liverpool are unlikely to reach the top four after losing to Arsenal 4-1 on Saturday . Right back Hector Bellerin gave Arsenal the lead as the Gunners went on to win 4-1 at the Emirates . Just four minutes later, Mesut Ozil had doubled the lead for the home side with this brilliant free kick . Alexis Sanchez got in on the goalscoring act just before half-time to give Arsenal an unassailable lead . When they went on a run in which they lost only once in 17 league games from mid-November through to mid-March, it seemed like last season's magic was coming back. But when that 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United was followed by a crushing 4-1 loss to Arsenal, the perspective changed. Suddenly, the troubles are crowding in on Rodgers. He spent much of his press conference answering questions about Raheem Sterling's refusal to sign the new contract he has been offered. It also became clear there was a new controversy involving Mario Balotelli. When asked why Balotelli was not in the squad, Rodgers found it hard to disguise his frustration. 'He took a slight knock to his knee and he deemed it not able to travel with the team,' Rodgers said. 'He felt it was too sore to travel. The medical staff have looked at it but it was just something that he, himself, did not feel comfortable enough to travel with.' The problems with Balotelli, his failure to settle into Rodgers's system, are symbols of the difficulties the club has faced in a season dominated by trying to adapt to life after Luis Suarez and by the long, melancholy farewell to Steven Gerrard, and it has not been easy. Liverpool missed the suspended Gerrard. They missed Martin Skrtel even more. At times, their defending was shambolic. Rodgers spent most of his press conference fielding questions about contract rebel Raheem Sterling . Mario Balotelli was not included in the Liverpool squad to face Arsenal after picking up a slight knock . Rodgers revealed that Balotelli withdrew himself from the squad and did not travel to London . Daniel Sturridge is still feeling his way back from injury and he has not yet rediscovered his confidence. His injury problems added to the sense of loss brought by the transfer of Suarez to Barcelona. Then there is the fact that several of their close-season buys, notably Dejan Lovren, Balotelli and Adam Lallana, have not come close to fulfilling expectations. Emre Can has been a success, Jordan Henderson has had a fine season and Philippe Coutinho has emerged as an outstanding midfielder but nevertheless, failure to make the top four will bring about new problems. Rodgers admitted that the lack of Champions League football would make it harder for the club to hang on to their best players. Wednesday's FA Cup quarter-final replay against Blackburn had now become 'very, very important,' Rodgers admitted. 'The summer was very difficult with losing Luis,' Rodgers said. 'Daniel [Sturridge] was injured from the beginning of the season and the whole integration of new players was an issue. It was like starting again. It was like my first six months. Daniel Sturridge, a second-half substitute at the Emirates, has spent most of the season out injured . It was difficult viewing for Liverpool manager Rodgers as his side imploded in the first half against Arsenal . Long-serving captain Steven Gerrard will leave the cub at the end of the season and join LA Galaxy . 'Up to the defeat against Manchester United we were the form team and playing very, very well. We have been dealt two big blows in these last two games. I very much doubt we will be in the top four now. There is too much ground to make up. That is the realistic view from me. 'Now we must really focus on the FA Cup and that is going to be very, very important for us. There has been a lot of learning that has taken place this year. Young players have improved as the season has gone on and hopefully now we can finish strongly. We need to go into next year and make a really bright start in the opening eight games.' Change is coming. Gerrard, a club icon for nearly 20 years, will be playing in Los Angeles by the time the new season begins. His departure will draw a line under an era at Anfield. Saturday's defeat means that Liverpool's new age will dawn with a team that, once again, has much to prove.","Liverpool were beaten 4-1 by Arsenal at the Emirates on Saturday .

"Two goals inside the last four minutes saw the Yorkshire derby clash between Sheffield Wednesday and Huddersfield end in a 1-1 draw. Wednesday substitute Sergiu Bus opened the scoring in the 86th minute and Ishmael Miller, also on as a substitute, secured a point for his side with an equaliser just a minute from time. The result leaves Huddersfield without a win in their last seven games and 18th in the table, six places and nine points behind Wednesday.

Huddersfield's Marnick Vermijl sent in an early low cross which evaded everyone, and Wednesday striker Caolan Lavery fired in a fierce angled shot which went over. The hosts had another chance when Lewis McGugan tried a shot from the edge of the area that went wide. Huddersfield responded with Joel Lynch firing in a shot on the turn which forced a near-post save from Keiren Westwood. Just a few minutes before the break, the visitors carved out another good opening when, following a scramble, David Edgar got in a shot which was cleared off the line by Vermijl. Six minutes after the restart, Wednesday's Atdhe Nuhiu looked certain to score. He received the ball from Kieran Lee, rounded keeper Alex Smithies and rolled the ball towards the unguarded net, only to see Lynch race back to clear off the line. Wednesday were down to 10 men for a spell when Joe Mattock went off injured. After receiving some lengthy treatment, the defender returned to the field with his head bandaged. Lavery put a shot off-target after losing his balance and then went down inside the area with Reece James in close attention, but referee Mark Haywood was unimpressed. Wednesday head coach Stuart Gray made a double substitution just after the hour mark with strike duo Stevie May and Bus replacing Lee and Nuhiu. Huddersfield manager Chris Powell also made an attacking change shortly after, sending on Ishmael Miller in place of Nahki Wells.

Miller was soon involved, making a promising run into the area before having a shot, which was blocked, when he could have passed to a team-mate. Wednesday substitute Bus also had a chance to make a quick impact when he had time inside the area, but his low shot lacked the necessary power to test Smithies who gathered easily. Miller made another good run into the area and made an unsuccessful appeal for a penalty when he went down under a challenge. Wednesday substitute Chris Maguire's free-kick was on target but failed to cause a problem for Smithies. Bus scored to put the hosts in front, following up to turn the ball home from close range after his initial effort was kept out. But with just a minute to go in normal time, Miller scored the equaliser after finding himself in space inside the area.","Substitute Ishmael Miller scores 89th-minute equaliser for Huddersfield .

"Stuart Dallas has come a long way since Mark Warburton plucked him from a glorified park and £70-a-week. The 23-year-old, who impressed for Northern Ireland in the week, scored two quite stunning goals as Brentford demolished Fulham 4-1 on Good Friday. They go into Monday's game against Nottingham Forest eyeing more than just a play-off spot. It was three years ago when Dallas was spotted by Warburton playing part-time on a mud bath for Crusaders back home. Stuart Dallas celebrates the second of his two excellent goals against Fulham on good Friday . Dallas has been a revelation this season as he helps Brentford push towards the Premier League . There were those who felt he wasn’t cut out for League One last season, but a three-month loan at Northampton has turned the winger into an integral figure as Brentford hunt Premier League promotion. ‘When I signed Stuart he was training once a week. He’s getting better and better - there’s more to come,’ Warburton said, before vouching for the maligned loan system. ‘Look at Alex Pritchard, on loan from Tottenham. Get the loan right, where all three parties benefit. The 23-year-old starred for Northern Ireland last week, and his manager says it is down to his loan spell . Dallas spent three months at Northampton and has returned to prove himself back at Brentford . ‘Toumani Diagouraga went to Portsmouth [this season], played seven games and was made captain, came back and hasn’t looked back. Likewise with Stuart. They have to go out and get the right loan - it’s a big part of their development.’ Warburton has been doing the sums as Brentford face six games which could end-up being historic. ‘If a team puts a run together they’ll go clear with 90-odd points,’ he added. ‘If they do that, with the nature of the fixtures, teams will drop points. The average for the play-offs has been 72 for the last five years - I think you’ll need 75 minimum. If that’s the case we need two more wins.’","Stuart Dallas, 23, was playing for Crusaders just three years ago .

He said: 'When I first arrived here — Magnolia Lane, is that it? — I thought that it was a pretty short drive. 'From what everyone says, it’s majestic and a long drive, you can’t believe it, and this, that and the other.' Tiger played 18 holes at the course on Tuesday and insiders from the Golf Channel say he has now returned to the venue for a practice session. Woods did not play last year's Masters following back surgery - the first time he had missed the event since he first played it in 1995. On Monday, Woods dropped out of the top 100 in the world rankings for the first time in almost 19 years. The 14-time major winner did not record a top-10 finish in nine starts in 2014, and has missed three cuts and withdrawn twice in his last six Tour starts. Woods' last title came at the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational in August 2013. Woods, pictured driving off the 10th tee in April 1995, made his Masters debut 20 years ago . Woods has won the Masters on four separate occasions with his last win coming in 2005 .","Tiger Woods increased speculation regarding possible Major comeback .

"The BBC has come under fire for spending thousands of pounds of licence fee payers' money on a guide teaching its staff the correct way to use emojis. The 44-page document was commissioned by executives at the BBC who then hired an agency to research how smiley faces could be used in news stories and on social media. Emoji designers were also told to make graphics for the faces of popular stars such as Gary Lineker and Graham Norton. The BBC spent licence fee payers' money on a 44-page guide on how to use emojis before using a 'sad face' emoticon to describe the death of the world's oldest woman . The 44-page document was commissioned by executives at the BBC who then hired an agency to research how smiley faces could be used in news stories and on social media . Bosses at Radio 1 and Radio 1 Extra were sent the emoticon guide earlier this week, The Sun reported. A source told the newspaper: 'We're used to ridiculous BBC schemes but this is the worst yet. Top brass whinge about budget cuts, then they OK this. It beggars belief.' Emojis, which were first created in Japan, are small digital images used to express an emotion, such as happiness or anger, used by millions of people on social media sites like Facebook and WhatsApp. The corporation used them during an 'Emoji Budget' article following George Osborne's statement last month. The news piece used an emoji of two pint glasses clinking together to show that beer duty had been cut by 1p. The BBC also used a 'sad face' emoji to describe the death of the world's oldest woman, Misao Okawa, 117, from Japan this week.

"One of the world’s leading distance runners and a regular training partner of Mo Farah’s claims to be living in fear of his life after raising allegations with the authorities in his native Uganda that a coach has been sexually abusing female runners; some as young as 15. Moses Kipsiro, who successfully defended his Commonwealth Games 10,000m title in Glasgow last year, told Sportsmail this week of the day five female runners came to him for help; and the death threats he says he has subsequently received after reporting the allegations to his national federation and the police. Only on Monday Kipsiro passed details of the death threats – sent anonymously via text messages – to police officers in Kampala, Uganda. But he told me he will have to leave Uganda with his wife and three children if the police fail to investigate his claims. ‘I will have to protect my family,’ he said. Moses Kipsiro raised allegations that a coach has been abusing female athletes, some as young as 15 . Kipsiro is a regular training partner of British long-distance running legend Mo Farah (above) The story was first brought to the attention of Sportsmail by Pace Sports Management, who also represent double Olympic champion Farah. Speaking this week, 28-year-old Kipsiro said he was approached last year by five female athletes at a training camp for the African Cross-Country Championships. Kipsiro says they went to him as the senior athlete and captain of the team – he holds national records and has won medals at world level as well as three Commonwealth golds – and complained a coach had been raping them. ‘According to the girls he would tell them he wanted to get them pregnant and then have an abortion, because by doing that it would widen their private parts and enable them to run like Kenyans,’ Kipsiro told me. ‘I went to the federation and I went to the police. But so far nothing has happened. Apart from the fact that I have received these death threats. My brother has also been threatened and arrested. And I have been dropped from the team. I did not run in the World Cross Country Championships in China last weekend because of this.’ Officials at the Ugandan Athletics Federation deny the allegations but details of the story have appeared in a Ugandan newspaper, which reportedly interviewed three of the female runners who had spent a month at the training camp in Kapchorwa in March last year. Kipsiro (right) is the 10,000m Commonwealth champion after defending his title in Glasgow last summer . Kipsiro beat Kenya's Josphat Kipkoech Bett (left) and Canadian Cameron Levins at Hampden Park . ‘He would wake up in the middle of the night and come to our room,’ one athlete is reported to have told the Daily Monitor. ‘He threatened to chase us from camp if we ever said anything or turned him down. We didn’t have any female coach to run to. It was horrible. On some days, he would call one or two of us to his nearby house. If you refused to do what he wanted, he would beat you up.’ In the same article team captain Kipsiro is quoted. ‘I confronted him but that resulted in a big wrangle,’ he said. ‘What I discovered after engaging the girls was so shocking. One day he gathered the junior women’s team in a secret place and told them that to run well, they must have sex or give birth. His theory was that if a woman’s private parts are wide, their legs move easily. I was so shocked to hear such silly talk. Unfortunately some people believe he is a good coach. They continue to defend him.’ UAF general secretary Beatrice Ayikoru is quoted in the same story denying the allegations. ‘Those accusations against the coach are false,’ she said. ‘I met the athletes in Kampala and no one mentioned such a thing.’ Kipsiro, pictured here at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, says he may have to leave Uganda . It is understood a letter has been sent by the runners to both the UAF and officers at the Central Police Station making the allegations. According to Pace Sports Management, who were in contact with the UAF this week about the issue, the allegations were investigated by officials as well as the police but as yet the result of the investigation has not been released. In an email to Sportsmail this week Ayikoru once again rejected the claims as did a spokeswoman for the UAF. ‘The sexual allegations were levied last year,’ she said. ‘The federation contacted police. As a control method, it also established an independent commission formed of people who have ever handled cases of abuse (three out of four were women). ‘The allegations were investigated by both police and the team established by the federation. There was no evidence of any sexual misconduct.’ Sportsmail responded by asking if Kipsiro has been disciplined and if the UAF had published their report into the allegations. Ayikoru did not respond. Kipsiro, meanwhile, says he was not only prevented from participating in last weekend’s World Cross Country Championships but was also dropped for last year’s World Half Marathon Championship. Police officers attempted to arrest Kipsiro’s brother at the Ugandan Cross Country Championships, only for Kipsiro and other athletes to intervene and stop Simon Ayeko Nawari being led away. There have also been claims of shots being fired at Kipsiro’s brother, and another athlete being murdered. On Monday, Ayeko Nawari was taken into custody, with Kipsiro’s allies claiming he is simply a victim of harassment. ‘When those five girls came to me I had to do something,’ Kipsiro said this week. ‘And I went to the Central Police Station after receiving the death threats on my phone last week. They were anonymous messages but the police believe they can trace the number. We will see. If something does not happen I will have to leave Uganda.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Moses Kipsiro says five female athletes came to him for help .

"The 18-year-old student who was filmed biting the head off a live hamster has been expelled from his fraternity, withdrawn from college and submitted for mental assessment. DailyMail.com last weekend exposed Brady Eaves, the privately-educated stepson of a former Mississippi governor candidate, as the teenager who shrieked with laughter as he murdered the small animal in a video from a drunken Spring Break party. The footage, allegedly filmed in Florida, could see Eaves charged with felony animal cruelty charges, which carry a maximum jail term of five years and $5,000 in fines. In a statement branding his actions 'disturbing' and 'disappointing', Eaves' stepfather and mother revealed he has been withdrawn from the University of Mississippi, where he was on a scholarship, and submitted for mental health tests. It comes after Phi Delta Theta openly condemned Eaves' actions and expelled him from the fraternity. Pictured: This is Brady Eaves (right), the privately-educated fraternity brother, described by friends as an 'animal lover', who was filmed biting the head off a live hamster during a drunken spring break party . Horrific: This video shows University of Mississippi student Brady Eaves, 18, biting the head off a live hamster at a spring break party in Florida. The stunt could see him charged with felony animal cruelty . A censored picture of the hamster's head and front arms shared exclusively with DailyMail.com via Snapchat . Elite family: His stepfather is John Arthur Eaves Jr, pictured with his mother Angel Eaves, during the 2007 campaign for governor of Mississippi. Eaves Jr, the Democratic candidate, lost and is now a pro-life lawyer . His stepfather John Arthur Eaves Jr, who was the Democratic candidate in Mississippi's 2007 gubernatorial elections, and mother Angel Eaves told the press: 'Let everyone please be assured that we do not take the subject of animal cruelty lightly, nor do we in any way condone the behavior displayed in the recent video of our son that has gone viral on the internet. 'The actions that appear in the video go against everything that our son has been taught, and we can assure everyone that his actions are not what he believes in his heart, nor are true to his character.' They added: 'As parents we are obviously and very seriously concerned about the well-being of our son. We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again.' Sources close to Eaves told DailyMail.com he was top of his class at private Jackson Preparatory School, and described him as an 'animal lover' whose numerous pets include a raccoon and a parrot. However, last weekend the teenager from Madison, MS, swept the internet in a video that showed him pull a hamster from a cage, bite off its head, and hurl its body into the distance. He is a star soccer player with a scholarship at the University of Mississippi where he is a Phi Delt brother . Eaves (circled) is pictured at Jackson Preparatory School after winning his scholarship to college . Graphic: He bites, spits, then throws the rest of the animal over a fence.

Beaming: Eaves, and other party-goers, shriek with laughter and beam gleefully into the camera. Sources told DailyMail.com the students force-fed the hamster vodka and 'hot-boxed' its cage with marijuana . According to sources connected to the incident, the party of college students force-fed the hamster vodka and 'hot-boxed' its cage with marijuana before the sickening stunt. His stepfather John Arthur Eaves Jr, a born-again Christian who was slammed for blaming unemployment on the state's Hispanic population during his 2007 election campaign, did not respond to DailyMail.com's request for a comment last week before releasing a statement a day later. Now CEO of Eaves Law Firm in Jackson, Mississippi, Eaves Jr has unsuccessfully run for state governor and U.S. Congress. He lost to the Republican incumbent Haley Barbour, winning 42 per cent of the vote, following controversial claims about the state's growing Latino population. His clients today include victims of the Costa Concordia cruise boat crash. He has three sons from his first marriage, and a young daughter with Brady's mother, advertising executive Angel Eaves, in leafy Madison, MS. In the video, his stepson Brady is surrounded by friends in beachwear who shriek with laughter as he pulls the animal from a blue cage. The footage starts with the voice of one party-goer balking: 'Oh my f***ing God! No way!' Screaming: Eaves bellows a yell and smiles into the camera as party-goers look on open-mouthed . Others can be heard jeering: 'So good! So good!' Hurling the hamster over a fence, Eaves bellows a yell as others are seen grinning and laughing behind him. The video was uploaded to YouTube on Friday night under the name 'psycho drunk spring breaker bites head off of hamster'. Within minutes, it was removed from the video-sharing site for violating its codes of conduct. Caching the video, animal rights group PETA launched a manhunt to track Eaves down. Stephanie Bell, PETA's Cruelty Casework Director, told DailyMail.com they plan to press charges. 'It is horrific,' Bell said. 'Animal abuse is a community concern. People who abuse animals rarely do so only once and almost never stop there. 'The link between cruelty to animals and inter-personal violence is undeniable. Many of our nation's serial killers and most school shooters share a history of animal abuse. 'Often, humans and animals are abused at the same time. For example, the guy who kicks the family dog is likely abusing his spouse and children too. Cruelty to animals is always a red flag.' First, as the parents of Brady Eaves, let everyone please be assured that we do not take the subject of animal cruelty lightly, nor do we in any way condone the behavior displayed in the recent video of our son that has gone viral on the internet. The actions that appear in the video go against everything that our son has been taught, and we can assure everyone that his actions are not what he believes in his heart, nor are true to his character. While we are extremely disappointed and greatly disturbed by his actions, as his parents, we know Brady to be a very bright and talented young man with a huge heart. As parents we are obviously and very seriously concerned about the well-being of our son. We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again. Raising teenagers in today’s world, as most caring and loving parents realize, can challenge the best of us. We will continue to love our son with all of our hearts and be right there by his side as our family addresses this situation. We would sincerely appreciate that all parents who have gone through similar incidents with their children, and the entire community please keep us in their thoughts and prayers. Thank you, .

"Chris Ramsey has hailed Tony Pulis as one of the best British coaches in the country, but insists he doesn’t need to take any tactical tips from the experienced relegation dodger. Ramsey’s QPR, who face Pulis’s West Brom at the Hawthorns on Saturday, are 19th in the Barclay’s Premier League table – four points adrift of Sunderland in 17th. The R’s have taken just four points since the turn of the year and could do with a season climax reminiscent of Pulis’s 2013-14 campaign with Crystal Palace, in which they took 17 points from their final eight games to avoid the drop. Chris Ramsey praised Tony Pulis ahead of his sides crucial clash with West Brom in the Premier League . Indeed, Pulis was linked with the vacant QPR managerial post after Harry Redknapp’s departure in February, but many of the Loftus Road faithful turned their noses up at his perceived long-ball tactics. ‘I think Tony Pulis would be a good fit anywhere because he is a quality coach,’ Ramsey said when asked about the speculation. ‘He maximises what he does with his players so he would be a good fit anywhere. Not just here, at any club. ‘I think Tony gets a very bad reputation for the way he plays. What he does is he goes into places, assesses what the players need and gets the best out of them. I would say he is one of the top British coaches in the country.’ Ramsey claims Pulis 'is one of the best coaches in Britain,' but says that he won't be asking for his advice . While Ramsey admits he is encouraged by the likes of Pulis, he firmly believes his own tactical acumen is the reason he was entrusted with keeping QPR in the top flight. ‘I take inspiration from Tony because I respect him as a man and as a coach and as a manager,’ Ramsey continued. ‘I’ll take any advice from any coach in any league, because I realise how tough the job is. ‘As far as tactics are concerned, I don’t think I’d be looking at anybody else and asking for any advice. I’ve been put in the job for a reason, the reason being that the people who’ve put me in think I know what I’m doing. ‘Apart from a dodgy 20 minutes at Crystal Palace, I think we’ve been in every game, especially against the top teams. We were extremely disappointed we didn’t get anything against Everton. But ultimately it’s about the money ends of the ground, isn’t it? And we haven’t been good enough at both ends when it really counted.’ The Queens Park Rangers boss knows that his side can't afford to slip up anymore if they want to stay up .","Chris Ramsey praises Tony Pulis as one of the best coaches in Britain .

"Ibrox has been a happy hunting ground for the Edinburgh clubs this season. Three league visits have been made. Three defeats inflicted on Rangers. Stuart McCall believes his side now owe it to their fans to amend that record in their final chance of the regular season when Hearts come calling on Sunday. The Tynecastle side won 2-1 on their previous trip to Govan last August, while Hibernian have racked up 3-1 and 2-0 victories. Rangers boss Stuart McCall wants to win one visit from an Edinburgh club at Ibrox this season . However, a 2-0 success at Easter Road 12 days ago could have marked a turning point for Rangers in their previously flagging push for promotion. And McCall believes a significant home victory over the Championship title winners would be the ideal confidence boost for his play-off hopefuls. ‘There will be a big crowd there on Sunday and we owe the fans a real morale-boosting victory, we got that at Easter Road and it would be nice to turn over Hearts as well,’ he told the Rangers website. ‘I want to see a good energetic confident performance and to go toe-to-toe with a very good side. But I believe we are a very good side when we play our best. ‘I will have a few headaches running up to Sunday regarding team selection, people seem to think there will be three at the back the same as at Hibs, but Hearts are a very different side. Danny Wilson scores the opening goal as Hearts beat Rangers at Ibrox back in August . ‘This game isn’t how people thought it would be at the beginning of the season and if you look at the consistency they’ve shown then it is full credit to them. ‘They will have had all the plaudits and rightly so, but it’s all about us on Sunday and we have a long way to go this season. ‘We want to keep the momentum going and keep the belief in each other. It’s about looking around the dressing room now and knowing you can trust your team-mates, knowing that he is going to go to the end for you and get that ball for you. ‘There if one thing every successful side needs and it is togetherness and a good work ethic – hopefully we are getting that and added to that is confidence and good quality players. ‘We aren’t getting carried away and I am sure there will be one or two ups and downs towards the end of the season. ‘But it’s what happens at the end of the season and Sunday will be a big stepping stone for us.’ Kenny Miller celebrates after scoring against Edinburgh club Hibernian at Easter Road . McCall views Hearts’ 2-0 win over Rangers at Tynecastle in November – when Steven Smith was sent off during the first half – as a pivotal moment in the season. ‘Hearts are incredible, they’ve got 81 points out of 90 and everyone knows how well they’ve done,’ added McCall, who took over from Kenny McDowall last month. ‘They have been playing at such a high level all season - their consistency levels, the amount of goals they’ve scored and their fitness levels. ‘I certainly thought it was a turning point in November when we went there; we were the better side for half an hour and then a sending off changed the game. ‘It went from us being three points behind to nine points and gave them that confidence and knocked us out of our stride a little bit and they have just gone from strength to strength.’","Rangers have been beaten three times by Edinburgh clubs at Ibrox thisseason .

"For those who like their plot lines thick and brimming with intrigue, steering clear of Paisley last night seemed the judicious option. A Celtic side with the scent of the Treble in their nostrils facing a St Mirren outfit badly in danger of entering free-fall scarcely looked like a recipe for a Friday-night thriller. And yet, for all Ronny Deila’s side prevailed in the end, this scrap provided compelling evidence that they won’t simply be given a free ride towards a fourth successive title in the coming weeks. Celtic winger Kris Commons (right) has a shot on goal during the SPL match against St Mirren on Friday . St Mirren's Jim Goodwin slides in with a challenge on Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen at St Mirren Park . St Mirren (4-4-2): Ridgers, Naismith, McAusland, Genev, Tesselaar, Goodwin, Dayton (Thompson 78), Mallan (Sonupe 77), McGinn, Sadlier (Morgan 73), Arquin . Subs not used: Kelly, Gow, Reilly, Wilks . Booked: Goodwin, Genev . Celtic (4-4-2): Gordon, Matthews (Ambrose Emuobo 65), Van Dijk, Denayer, Izaguirre, Brown, Johansen, Forrest, Commons (Mackay-Steven 72), Armstrong (Bitton 66), Stokes . Subs not used: Guidetti, Zaluska, Griffiths, McGregor . Scorers: Forrest 64 . Referee: Alan Muir . St Mirren may be at the bottom of the Premiership table and still four points from even a play-off spot but, on this showing, they aren’t out of it yet. They frustrated Celtic for the most part here, their energy and belief taking them so far — but not far enough. James Forrest was the man whose intervention broke Gary Teale’s heart with a second half tap-in while any realistic chance of an unlikely comeback was killed off when Stefan Johansen later converted from the penalty spot. Now eight points clear of Aberdeen, however, Deila’s misgivings about a far from perfect display will be tempered with a realisation that the title is edging ever closer to his grasp. The Celtic boss made four changes from the side which won the last of the four game-series with Dundee United before the international break. St Mirren goalkeeper Mark Ridgers (centre) comes out to punch the ball clear of the head of Jason Denayer . Commons (right) and Ste Mirren's John McGinn (left) tussle for the ball during the SPL match on Friday . St Mirren's Jason Naismtih (right) battles with Stuart Armstrong (left) during the SPL match in Paisley . Out went Efe Ambrose, Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and John Guidetti with Adam Matthews, Anthony Stokes, Kris Commons and Forrest the beneficiaries. Surprisingly, given the poverty of his side’s display in the defeat to St Johnstone, Teale made only three alterations with Kieran Sadlier, Marc McAusland and Yoann Arquin restored to the side. St Mirren’s attempts to address the obvious quality gap with guts and industry bore early fruit. With next to no time on the ball, Celtic were unable to find their rhythm let alone a killer pass. Commons, typically, was the man who found the space others couldn’t in order to fashion the first chance. Dropping into a pocket of space behind the Saints defence, he gathered Scott Brown’s incisive pass then shaped as if to cross. His attempt to beat Mark Ridgers at his near post was audacious but unsuccessful as the goalkeeper turned the ball around the post. Now playing without the burden of international football, Commons looked better for the break. When Johansen picked him out 30 yards from goal, he glided away from three challenges before lashing a shot into the side-netting. Largely written off as relegation certainties after their last dire outing in Perth, no one could accuse St Mirren of not giving it their all as they sought to claim an unlikely bonus point to help their plight. Celtic's James Forrest (left) tussles for the ball with St Mirren's Jeroen Tesselaar (right) on Friday night . St Mirren' s Yoann Arquin (left) has a shot at goal but it is saved by Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon (centre) Celtic really ought to have taken the lead in 26 minutes. Stuart Armstrong had started the game with a couple of heavy touches but his pass to Commons was perfectly weighted. Commons took one touch to control and a second to blast the ball towards Ridgers’ goal. The keeper blocked smartly, though. St Mirren then finally worried Craig Gordon. Sadlier danced away from Matthews on the flank and found the space between Celtic’s central defenders where Stephen Mallan was lurking. His header floated towards the keeper’s top corner but never with the required velocity to beat him. Ridgers was earning his corn. When Commons turned provider for Forrest, the winger looked to have picked his spot in the bottom corner with a side-foot only for the keeper’s agility to leave the Celtic star with his head buried in his hands. It served to embolden the home side. Armstrong’s tackle on Sadlier inadvertently set up Arquin but the striker seemed spooked by the chance and fired weakly into Gordon’s arms. Deila isn’t renowned for endangering crockery collections at half-time in dressing rooms up and down the land but it can safely be assumed he had a few choice words for a Celtic side that been some way short of sparkling in the first period. Celtic manager Rory Deila (left) gives instructions to his captain Scott Brown (right) against St Mirren . Forrest slides on his knees to celebrate scoring Celtic's opening goal against St Mirren on Friday night . Armstrong’s dipping shot from 20 yards was a yard shy of changing the narrative of the night within 60 seconds of the restart before Stokes’ snap-shot was easily claimed by Ridgers. When Jeroen Tesselaar needlessly conceded a corner, he was grateful to the goalkeeper for punching Jason Denayer’s header off his line. Commons smashed the spoils low into the side-net. Mallan issued a timely reminder that St Mirren were still very much in the game with a strike that had Gordon scrambling. The Saints midfielder sprawled to the turf after a foot sprint with Brown on the counter-attack but ref Alan Muir wasn’t interested. Just as the Buddies looked to have the measure of the league leaders — so much so that Deila was looking to his bench — one moment of slackness cost them dear. Brown was the catalyst with a supreme pass in behind Tesselaar, taking the Dutchman out of the game and holding up perfectly for Matthews. Celtic midfielder Johansen slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side's 2-0 victory at St Mirren . The Welshman’s low cross was accurate and turned home with a flash of Forrest’s boot at the far post — his second goal in three games. With that, Matthews and Armstrong departed to be replaced by Bitton and Ambrose before Mackay-Steven came on for Commons. Saints, to their huge credit, stuck to their task with Jim Goodwin, who had been harshly booked in the first half, seemingly at the heart of everything. Some 11 minutes from time, the result was put beyond all reasonable doubt. Forrest’s shot did strike Viktor Genev on the arm but there seemed a case to be made in mitigation that it was not deliberate. The Bulgarian was booked for squabbling with Muir’s decision but the delay didn’t perturb Johansen who calmly sent Ridgers the wrong way from 12 yards.","Celtic extend their lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership table .

"Swansea manager Garry Monk is out to claim a season-first against Hull on Saturday - pick up some points after an international break.

'A lot of the players come back later on in the week and you might get only two or three days preparation with some of them. 'But these are the decisions you have to make, you assess them when they come back and see where they are physically and mentally.

'I watched their last game against Chelsea and thought they performed extremely well and were unlucky to lose,' Monk said. 'We've always had close games with Hull. It's a tough physical game with them but they have got quality to hurt us if we're not on our game. 'This is it, the business end of the season and everyone's fighting for their own reasons.

North has been knocked unconscious three times in recent months, including in last Friday's 52-30 win over Wasps, and was on Wednesday being assessed by a neurologist. 'We won't play him at the weekend,' Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder said. George North lies motionless on the Franklin's Gardens turf after being knocked out against Wasps . 'Clearly he had a nasty knock. He did get knocked unconscious for a very short period of time. Thankfully he was well looked after, he came round very quickly and has had no real bad adverse after-effects. But even so, we won't play him this weekend. 'He's making good progress. He's improving and down there at the moment going to see a neurologist and we'll wait to see what the experts say. 'We've got to make sure the medical experts are happy and satisfied that he is fit to return to play and as soon as they say he is, then we'll be happy to pick him again.' North left the field unconscious after scoring the second of two tries in Saints' win, with Wasps forward Nathan Hughes sent off for dangerous play as the Wales wing touched down. Hughes protested his innocence but on Tuesday was banned for three weeks. North also suffered blows to the head on Wales duty in the autumn and during the RBS 6 Nations when twice he had head knocks in the opener against England, controversially continuing before being stood down for the Scotland clash. Former World Rugby medical adviser Dr Barry O'Driscoll says North - the top try-scorer in the competition with seven this season - should not play again this term. Nathan Hughes arrives late as North touches down - moments later his leg connected with the wing's head . Mallinder is not unduly concerned but will await medical opinion. 'There's been lots of opinion over the last few days in particular,' Mallinder said. 'We've got to be careful that we don't blow anything out of proportion. 'It's a tough game. George has said that himself. People who play the game understand that there are inherent dangers, I suppose, of playing. 'We're always going to have incidents but player welfare will always come first. We will make sure we follow all protocols.' North might have been eligible for Saturday's match, had he passed the return to play concussion protocols. Mallinder added: 'If it was his first one (concussion) then we would be considering him, if he passed all the protocols that he had to and was available. 'Seeing as it's not his first then it's the sensible thing to take specialist opinion.' Mallinder was reluctant to comment on Hughes' three-week ban - a punishment which left his Wasps team-mate James Haskell to tweet 'astounded would be an understatement' - but insisted he did not want to see the incident repeated. The Welshman receives medical treatment on the pitch before being taken off on a stretcher . Mallinder said: 'I said at the time I think it was a red card offence. I still do. The disciplinary process has taken place and that's what he's got. 'You've got to be very, very careful. George North scored a try and therefore there wasn't much anybody could do about that. 'You've got to make as much effort as you can to get away from that incident. We don't want that happening again.' The English champions will, without North, bid to end Clermont's 22-game unbeaten run in European competition at Stade Marcel-Michelin. Two previous meetings have been won by the Frenchmen, who have never lost a home quarter-final in the competition. Mallinder said: 'It is going to be a massive challenge but we have had a few of these challenges over the years. 'I know when we have got a big game because you see in training when the intensity goes up. 'We have got a lot of players used to playing in big games. We are looking forward to it.' North is congratulated after scoring the first of his two tries against Wasps on Friday night .","George North knocked out after scoring against Wasps on Friday .

"Cesar Azpilicueta is counting down the games until Chelsea win the Barclays Premier League title, and he thinks they have shown their strength by staying top of the table since 'day one'. The Spanish defender and his club team-mates sit top of the table ahead of facing Stoke City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, six points clear of nearest rivals Manchester City with a game in hand. The Blues have long been considered title favourites and Azpilicueta puts that down to the lightning start they made back in August, winning seven of their first eight games to take up first place early on. Cesar Azpilicueta (centre) is counting down the games until Chelsea win the Barclays Premier League title . Azpilicueta's Chelsea sit top of the table ahead of facing Stoke City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday at 3pm . In fact, Jose Mourinho's men have only briefly relinquished the title lead, on goal difference, since their impressive 3-1 win over Burnley at Turf Moor in their season opener back on August 18. Their form has dipped at points since, most notably in defeats to Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, but Azpilicueta is confident that Chelsea have been able to get through their bad moments unscathed. 'We have been top of the table since day one,' he said. 'We kept that position obviously and had very good moments, as well as some less good moments, but we were there still top of the table and this is the strength of the team. 'You can be up and down, but you have to be focused on the target and I think now we are in a very good position.' Jose Mourinho's men have only briefly relinquished the title lead since their opening 3-1 win over Burnley . Diego Costa scored in the opening weekend win at Turf Moor and has scored 18 more in Chelsea's title bid . Chelsea signed Atletico Madrid left back for £16million in the summer, but he has been largely kept out of the team by Azpilicueta who has consistently played in his less-natural position rather than at right back. Unsurprisingly, the 25-year-old Spaniard - who has had two weeks off after not being selected for his national team - is pleased to have kept his place under new competition within the Chelsea squad this season as they go in search of a league and Capital One Cup double. Filipe Luis (right) arrived for £16million at Chelsea in the summer but has been kept out by Azpilicueta . 'If you ask every player in every team, they are going to say they want to play and when you do not play, obviously you are not as happy as when you do play,' Azpilicueta told Sky Sports. 'I have to go out on the pitch and give everything, to try to fight for every ball, to play and be useful for the team. And obviously when I finish the game and I feel I have given everything and we win, I am happy. 'There are individual battles in the game that you have to win. And after, if we win every one then I think the team will also win.'","Chelsea are six points clear with a game in hand in the Premier League .

"Mohamed Diame will make his long-awaited return for Hull when the Tigers travel to Swansea on Saturday. Hull boss Steve Bruce has confirmed that the Sengalese midfielder, signed for £3.5million from West Ham in the summer but who has been out for more than four months with a knee injury, will be involved at some stage of the match. Bruce said: 'He will be involved. Physically he's immense, he's terrific, but he has been out for four months with a horrible injury. Mohamed Diame is set to return from injury for Hull City's visit to Swansea City on Saturday . The return of the £3.5m Senegalese midfielder is a boost for Hull as they face a relegation battle .

Let's hope he stays injury-free because he had a wonderful start with us here - four goals in seven games. 'He has trained and he has done everything he can physically in training. I would have loved to have had him back before but it was not possible.' The 27-year-old French-born midfielder's return could not be more timely for Hull as they look to secure their Premier League status for another season, and defender James Chester is also available again after a dislocated shoulder. Bruce admitted that Hull, currently 15th in the table, have a tough run-in - what he referred to as 'the tickly bit' of the season - but insists the side are in good form. He added: 'In the last few weeks we have played well but we have not got the results we hoped for. Now we have to make sure we turn those performances into points.' Manager Steve Bruce is pleased to have Diame back as Hull enter the 'tricky bit of the season' Owner Assem Allam has again applied to the Football Associations that the team's name become Hull Tigers . Bruce added that he hoped the ongoing debate over the proposed name change for the club can be put to one side for the rest of the season - an arbitration panel has ruled that owner Assem Allam can make another application to change the name to Hull Tigers after it was initially refused by the FA council who took into account opposition from fans' groups. 'For what he has done for the club, putting it on the map and putting in his hard-earned money, the owner is entitled to have an opinion,' said Bruce. 'Hopefully there's a middle ground but at the moment I hope it can be put to one side and we make sure that Hull City/Hull Tigers are in the Premier League next season and we can have that debate in the summer.'","Hull City travel to Swansea City in Premier League on Saturday .

"Toby Alderweireld will return to Atletico Madrid when his season-long loan finishes at Southampton, according to the Spanish club's sporting director Jose Luis Perez Caminero. The Belgian defender, 26, has impressed this season on the South Coast, and has hinted in the past that he would like to remain permanently in the Premier League, with Tottenham also believed to be admirers. But Atletico say they are counting on Aldeirwereld to return to La Liga, as well as Oliver Torres who has been plying his trade in Portugal with Porto. Toby Alderweireld will return to Atletico Madrid once his loan spell ends at Southampton . 'Our coaches follow a detailed monitoring of all the players that are loaned to other teams,' Caminero told Atletico's official website. 'We are very pleased with their performance and growth in general. Oliver [Torres] and Alderweireld, for example, are finishing a very good season with Porto and Southampton and we are counting on them for the next campaign.' Alderweireld contract expires in June 2017, and has been a key part of a defence with Southampton that has seen Ronald Koeman's side challenge for the Champions League places.

'The problem was I started to train again after the Shakhtar match too soon; that was a mistake. There are many important matches coming and I hope I can help the team.'

"Bayern Munich captain Philipp Lahm could make his first Bundesliga start since returning from an ankle injury by appearing against Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. Midfielders Franck Ribery (ankle), Arjen Robben (stomach) and Javi Martinez (knee), and defender David Alaba (knee) are all out, coach Pep Guardiola added on Friday. He was not yet sure about defender Holger Badstuber (hip), while midfielder Thiago Alcantara could play 'maybe a few minutes' as he recovers from long-standing knee injuries. Bayern Munich captain Philipp Lahm has made a full recovery from a broken ankle . Pep Guardiola will be without a number of his first-team stars for his side's match against Dortmund . Lahm has made only two substitute appearances for Bayern since breaking his ankle in training on November 18, and Guardiola attempted to take some pressure off his captain by warning that the whole team has to work together to compensate for missing players. 'Robben is great in one on ones, also coming in, scoring goals from the side. Ribery too. Without them, we don't have players for one on ones, so we have to pass the ball,' Guardiola said. 'The players have to know, we need more, more, more. We need 100 per cent.' Alaba became the latest on Bayern's injury list when he tore a left knee ligament while on duty for Austria. The left back is expected to miss the rest of the season. 'It's not good news for anyone,' said Guardiola. 'Up to now, we've coped, and carried on. And we have to do that now.' Arjen Robben (centre) and Franck Ribery (right) have been ruled out of Bayern's upcoming match . David Alaba is likely to be out for the rest of the season after sustaining a knee injury . While at pains to state the injuries were not an excuse, he pointed out that they were mounting at a crucial point of the season with Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League games coming up. Bayern has seven games in the next 22 days. 'The squad Bayern have put together is there to fight for all the titles. No excuses. If we don't win, it's our fault,' Guardiola said. 'We're happy to play in April with all the (title) possibilities still open. Now every game is a final. Earlier in the season if you don't win you carry on. Now if you lose, that's it. We don't want any more injuries.' When asked if this was the most difficult time he had faced in his second season at Bayern, Guardiola replied, 'Yes, definitely.' He was nonetheless looking forward to Saturday's visit to Dortmund, which has struggled this season and was bottom at the beginning of February. 'The quality of the side, the coach, the team, is higher than (indicated) by their table position. The quality is still there,' Guardiola said. 'The game is like a final. It's not a final, but we're fighting to defend our title, and Dortmund are fighting for the Champions League or Europa League.' He added: 'My experience with Dortmund and (coach Jurgen) Klopp is of their pressing, their attacking game. It's good that way. It will be a super, super game.'","Philipp Lahm is expected to start against Dortmund at the weekend .

"Veteran Burnley defender Michael Duff believes manager Sean Dyche could one day take charge of England. Dyche, 43, has a growing reputation having overseen a remarkable transformation of fortunes since arriving at Turf Moor in October 2012. The former Chesterfield defender made a nonsense of the relegation favourites' tag to lead the Clarets to an unlikely promotion from the Championship to the top flight last season. Burnley veteran defender Michael Duff is preparing to take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday . Duff has backed his manager Sean Dyche to one day take charge of the England team . The 37-year-old has played in eight different divisions before finding himself taking on the likes of United . This term they are attempting to defy the odds again and with eight games remaining they have a fighting chance of survival in the Barclays Premier League. Burnley are next in action on Sunday when they host Tottenham. Duff, 37, said: 'He has been first class. I've learned a lot from him, little things he does, and I think he will go on to be a top manager. 'Hopefully he will stay here a bit longer and (Burnley will) achieve some more with him. I cannot see why somebody will not give him an opportunity from what he has done here.' Asked if he would be surprised if former Watford boss Dyche ever managed England, Duff said: 'No, in a word, having worked with him and the way he gets the best out of players. 'Most of our players have played the majority of their careers in the Championship or lower than that and we are competing against multi, multi-million pound squads and we are alive and kicking. 'So, he has managed to get the best out of us. If he can do that at a higher level, why not?' Duff has hopes of following Dyche into management himself after retirement. The former Northern Ireland international still intends to prolong a career that has seen him play in the country's top-eight tiers with Cheltenham and Burnley, but he has firm plans for life beyond it. He said: 'I've done my Pro Licence and I want to stay in football after I've finished playing. 'I have no plans to stop playing at the minute. I still love getting up for training in the morning. It's not a bad job running around chasing after a football. 'But you look at the game differently when you get to my age. The Pro Licence is nearly all based on management, so you look at sessions differently, look at the manager's presentations - and this one isn't a bad manager to learn from.' Dyche has improved Burnley's fortunes since he took over at Turf Moor in October 2012 . The high point of Burnley's season, so far, is the 1-0 defeat of defending champions Manchester City .","The veteran Burnley defender believes Dyche could manage Three Lions .

"Alvaro Morata wants to continue his development at Juventus and has no interest in rejoining Real Madrid, according to his agent Beppe Bozzo. The 22-year-old joined the Italian giants for £15.8million last summer after failing to break into the Real first-team on a regular basis. Morata signed a five-year deal at the Juventus Stadium after starting just three games in La Liga for Real during the 20113-14 campaign. Alvaro Morata is happy at Juventus and has no interest in joining Real Madrid, according to his agent . And the Spain international has impressed since moving to Turin - having netted seven goals in 22 Serie A matches so far this season. Madrid have a buy back option on the forward but Bozzo insists Morata is keen to fulfill his five-year deal at the Juventus Stadium and develop as a player. 'The situation just now is very favourable for Juve. When it comes to important players like him, we almost always have the last word, regardless of clubs or clauses,' Bozzo told Tuttosport. 'Morata is fine at Juve, he is not thinking about anything else. It all depends on what the player wants, just as it was when he decided to leave Madrid a year ago. Morata (left) started just three La Liga games for Real last season - in a season of limited opportunities . 'Alvaro is not a hypocrite, he says what he thinks. He will not have a foot in both camps. A few days ago he said that Juve is fine and that he isn't thinking of returning to Madrid; he wants continue to grow with Juve. Even to me he has always expressed the same idea.

"Hundreds of thousands of football fans are facing travel misery this weekend because of the Easter rail shut down. Despite more than 30 Premiership and Championship games scheduled for the long weekend, large parts of the rail network are set to be closed for repair works. More than half the games are set to be affected by delays and disruption, forcing fans onto the roads. This weekend's crunch Premiership fixture, Arsenal versus Liverpool in London, will be hit by the rail chaos . Labour has accused the Government of failing to learn from the Boxing Day chaos, when nearly a million football fans faced nightmare journeys to follow their team. Ministers were warned of the potential problems in advance Labour has claimed – but they failed to scrutinise the planned level of maintenance work. Every single major artery on Britain's railways was shut down. No trains ran between England and Scotland or Wales on the East Coast, West Coast or Great Western mainlines. The Midland, Cross Country and East Anglia were also shut. Despite the chaos the Government has refused to step in this weekend to stop large parts of the rail network shutting down again. The planned engineering works over the Easter weekend will hit all routes to and from London Euston – hitting the busy west coast services between the capital and Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool. There will be no mainline trains at all from Paddington out towards Swindon, Bristol and Cardiff and further disruptions on lines from London Bridge. All trains out of London Euston - serving the main west coast rail line between the capital and Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool - have been hit . Trains between Milton Keynes Central and Clapham Junction are also affected as well as those traveling on the line between London Paddington and Greenford, Slough and Windsor & Eton Central, Maidenhead and Marlow, Twyford and Henley-on-Thames . All routes to and from Reading are also hit, with Charing Cross trains to Kent and routes to East Anglia from London Liverpool Street also affected. It means there will no trains for fans wanting to travel to the Reading versus Cardiff City match in Berkshire – forcing supporters onto the roads on replacement bus services instead. There will also be no trains available for the thousands of Liverpool fans wanting to get home after the Arsenal versus Liverpool match on Saturday. Michael Dugher, the Shadow Transport Secretary, said accused ministers or being too 'out of touch' with ordinary football fans to understand the chaos the rail shutdown will cause. Shadow transport minister Michael Dugher said the Government had not learned from past mistakes . He said: 'Just like on Boxing Day, hundreds of thousands of people will want to travel to see family and also to follow their football team on one of the busiest fixture lists of the season. 'Ministers were asleep on the job over the Christmas period and there is little to suggest they have learnt from their mistakes. 'We have seen no evidence that Ministers have adequately scrutinised the level of planned engineering works or ensured that the necessary contingency plans are in place. 'As usual, it will be hard-pressed passengers - who've already seen their fares go up by more than 20 per cent on average since 2010 - who will suffer.' Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has admitted there will be 'frustrations' on rail services this weekend and urged people to 'think twice' before travelling. Mr McLoughlin said: 'There will be alternatives and we've lifted almost all motorway roadworks to help. 'But if you are travelling between Friday and Monday night please check your journey first, it may be that you'll think twice about how you travel. 'I'm sorry if it is more difficult - but my promise is that the work is essential and when it's done the benefits will be worthwhile.' A spokesman for Network Rail said over the past three months they have contacted both the FA and every individual Premiership club to ensure they’re aware about the disruption. A Conservative spokesman said the Easter weekend was a 'sensible' time to carry out the repair work. He said: 'Thanks to this government's successful management of our economy we have been able to commit £38billion to upgrading our national rail infrastructure, after 13 years of Labour neglect. 'The £100million of upgrades this Easter is the biggest set of works ever carried out over a long weekend. With passenger numbers down 40 per cent it is a sensible time to do these works, they will unblock current bottlenecks and deliver a better railway for passengers. 'Labour need to get real, they can either support the long overdue upgrade of our national rail network or plunge it back into long term decline. 'On the 7th of May voters will have a clear choice between the Conservative Party securing our country's long term future or a Labour party that will bring chaos.'","Over 30 Premiership and Championship games scheduled this weekend .

"Brentford manager Mark Warburton was delighted to see his side triumph 4-1 against Fulham in a hard-fought west London derby at Craven Cottage. Stuart Dallas fired home two superb strikes while a sublime free-kick from second-half substitute Alan Judge and a late fourth from Jota ensured all three points. Brentford moved to fifth in the table on 69 points with six games left to play and remain firmly in play-off contention. Brentford boss Mark Warburton was delighted with his Brentford side's win over local rivals Fulham . Stuart Dallas scored twice to put the Bees in a commanding lead at Craven Cottage on Saturday afternoon . Warburton said: 'I'm really pleased. The first 10-15 minutes we were, not slow but it was a big local derby, the atmosphere was electric, but after that 15-minute spell I thought we were very good. 'I like the way we moved the ball and maintained pace and we were good for our lead at half-time. They were great strikes from Stuart Dallas but what disappointed me was their penalty, I thought it was as soft as they come and it changed the game. 'For the next 10 minutes the Fulham crowd were up and their players were naturally up as well and we had to defend stoutly. 'But then Judgey hit a tremendous free-kick and Jota got an outstanding fourth goal. It keeps us going. We are in contention, be that for top or the play-offs, we are still in with a chance. Brentford players celebrate after Jota put the result beyond doubt in injury time to make it 1-4 . Alan Judge scored Brentford's third goal, helping the Bees move up to fifth in the Championship . 'We can't worry about what other teams do. I don't know how many points we will need. We can only worry about ourselves and make sure we do all the things we need to do.' Striker Ross McCormack fired home a 67th-minute penalty for Fulham, who remain 20th - seven points above the drop zone. Fulham manager Kit Symons added: 'It is a little bit of a recurring theme which is very frustrating. We are playing good football, creating chances, we are on top in games but are not making it count. 'When you get those situations in football you need to make it count, you need to get a goal. A lot of the time we are chasing at the moment. You saw it at the Leeds game. Brentford goalkeeper David Button lifts his arms to the sky in celebration at his side's fourth goal . Fulham boss Kit Symons admits his team aren't yet safe from relegation in the Championship . 'Ultimately people just look at the score line at the end of the game and 4-1 looks like a hammering but the actual fact of the matter is that it wasn't. 'We were well in the game but obviously we didn't get anything out of it. We shot ourselves in the foot for the first two goals. 'You need to get and press the ball, by being goal side you think you are protecting the goal. They were a couple of great strikes from them for a few of the goals but we didn't get out and press the ball. 'We are not out of it (relegation trouble), we have work to do, especially with Millwall winning today.'","Brentford beat local rivals Fulham 4-1 in the Championship .

"Somersaulting high in the skies with dizzying abandon, it is hard to imagine that this U.S. fighter jet is some 70 years old - and reconstructed from more than 200 parts. The Quick Silver P-51D Mustang has been painstakingly restored by father-and-son team Bill and Scooter Yoak as a tribute to American servicemen who have died in combat. And as this stunning on-board video shows, they have done their countrymen proud. Stunning video shows an American P-51D Mustang fighter jet taking to skies after a painstaking restoration . The fighter jet is some 70 years old and was reconstructed from more than 200 parts by a father-and-son team . The P-51, nicknamed The Resurrected Veteran, was pieced together by Bill Yoak, who did all the metal work by hand, and is flown by Scooter at air shows around the country. Originally built in 1945, it was among scores of long-range, single-seat bombers rolled out during World War Two and later used in the Korean War before being retired in the 1980s. The Yoaks say their aircraft was a 'celebration of our nation's armed forces', adding: 'Every aspect of the paint represents those who have served and those who gave the ultimate sacrifice.' Writing on their website Quick Silver Mustang, they said: 'The black cape covering the front of the aircraft represents the veil of protection that our armed forces give us. 'That veil is one of the reasons why we have what we have today - freedom.' Dizzying: Bill and Scooter Yoak restored the plane as a tribute to U.S. servicemen who have died in combat . Vertigo-inducing flight: The Yoaks say their aircraft is a 'celebration of our nation's armed forces' The cape extends to the back of the canopy, spreading out and dividing into feathers, which they say 'symbolises the eagle that has flown with every aviator since the birth of aviation in 1903.' They add: 'The black paint has tiny sparkling stars in it, each sparkle represents an American Veteran that served our great country; the unsung stars in our lives. 'These veterans are the glimmering star in a mother’s eye, a wife or husband’s heart, a son or daughter’s hope for the future. 'As this silver bird quickly streaks across the sky, let us not forget those who served, sacrificed, and gave their all. God Bless America!'

"Brazil's World Cup stadium in Natal is up for sale as the company that owns it is suffering from cash flow problems following a corruption scandal. Natal's Dunas Arena is being sold by owner Grupo OAS, with the company also trying to sell the 50 percent share it owns of the Fonte Nova arena in Salvador. The company has struggled for months with the impact of a corruption investigation at state-controlled oil company Petrobras, which undercut the builder's access to financing. A general view of Natal's Dunas Arena during the World Cup match between Italy and Uruguay last year . An economic downturn, government austerity and a slumping currency has also taken its toll, leading to Grupo OAS to announce it is selling its stakes in the stadiums and other businesses to focus on the core construction business. OAS spent 591 million reais (around £126 million) on completely rebuilding the old Fonte Nova arena in Salvador and 423 million reais (£90 million) on the new Dunas area. The Fonte Nova hosted six games in the 2014 tournament and the Dunas Arena four. The announcement was the latest in a string of bad news for Brazilian football post-World Cup. Holland take on Costa Rica in a World Cup quarter-final at Salvador's Fonte Nova arena last July . Earlier this week Esporte Club Bahia, one of the biggest clubs in Salvador, said they were abandoning plans to use the Fonte Nova because they felt the owners did not respect their fans. Several other stadiums have seen bigger crowds for concerts and religious events than for football and the ground in Cuiaba was closed because of structural problems.","Natal's Dunas Arena, which held four World Cup matches, is up for sale .

"A group of U.S. senators has written to football's world governing body FIFA, calling for Russia to be removed as host of the 2018 World Cup because of its role in the Ukraine crisis and occupation of Crimea. In a letter dated Tuesday and released on Wednesday, the 13 Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers said they 'strongly encourage' FIFA to move the global competition. 'Allowing Russia to host the World Cup inappropriately bolsters the prestige of the (Russian President Vladimir) Putin regime at a time when it should be condemned and provides economic relief at a time when much of the international community is imposing economic sanctions,' the senators wrote to FIFA President Sepp Blatter.

Meanwhile, England are interested in bidding for Euro 2028 but are very unlikely to bid for the 2026 World Cup, FA chairman Greg Dyke has revealed. FIFA announced last week that the decision on the 2026 tournament will be made in 2017 - when Blatter is still likely to be FIFA president.

"Jos Hooiveld's late strike earned Millwall a crucial 2-1 victory over south London rivals Charlton on Good Friday - the Lions' first win at The Den since October. Hooiveld prodded home Magaye Gueye's low drive in the 87th minute, after Gueye had cancelled out Alou Diarra's strike for the Addicks. Charlton had skipper Chris Solly dismissed midway through the first half for deliberate handball in the box, but Stephen Henderson saved Lee Gregory's resulting penalty.

Booked: Hooiveld, Williams, Woolford . Scorers: Gueye 79', Hooiveld 87' Charlton: Henderson, Solly, Gomez, Johnson, Fox, Gudmundsson, Diarra, Cousins, Eagles (Bikey), Vetokele (Bulot), Watt (Church).

The result moved Millwall up to 22nd in the Sky Bet Championship table, just four points behind Rotherham, while Charlton remained 11th and without a win over the Lions since 1996. Millwall boss Neil Harris named an unchanged line-up from the 2-2 draw at Brentford last time out and his side had the best of the early exchanges. The hosts almost went ahead on four minutes, but Ed Upson's brilliant ball over the top narrowly evaded the outstretched leg of Gregory. Solly found his name in the book after just 10 minutes after a coming-together with Gregory, as the visitors struggled to get a foothold in the game. Upson should have put the home side ahead on 18 minutes, but the unmarked midfielder headed just over from Dan Harding's dangerous cross from the left. But the Addicks almost took the lead against the run of play when Chris Eagles prodded narrowly wide from close range after Johann Berg Gudmundsson's chipped ball forward.

The game changed just short of the half-hour mark when Solly was given his marching orders for deliberately handling Aiden O'Brien's effort in the box, gifting Millwall a penalty. Gregory stepped up, but the striker's effort was well saved by Henderson low to his right to keep the scores level. Charlton switched to a 4-3-2 formation, with Andre Bikey replacing Eagles, but Millwall continued to dominate and Henderson produced another spectacular save to deny Upson five minutes before half-time. The Lions dominated the possession after the break, but the Addicks arguably looked more comfortable after going down to 10 men. And Guy Luzon's side almost took the lead on 52 minutes after a swift counter-attack, but Gudmundsson's left-footed shot curled just wide of the top corner. Addicks manager Guy Luzon screams instructions to his players from the sidelines . Millwall fans grew increasingly frustrated as the Lions struggled to break through Charlton's dogged defence, but Shaun Williams had Henderson at full stretch again on the hour mark after a drive from distance. But the Addicks took the lead on 67 minutes, when Diarra ghosted into the box to flick home Morgan Fox's cross from the left - the former West Ham midfielder's first goal for the club. Millwall hit back and substitute Gueye levelled 11 minutes from time with a low drive from a tight angle. And Hooiveld stole all three points for the hosts three minutes from the end when he turned home Gueye's shot.

"It may not be as fast as a Ferrari or as regal as a Rolls Royce but the most popular type of car in the world is 50 years old this year as the humble hatchback hits its half century. The car shape originally designed to help French farmers transport their sheep to market now accounts for a staggering two in every three cars sold in the UK. And it is just as popular across the world from Munich to Mexico City thanks to its practical design, economy and comfort. The model credited with being the world’s first ever hatchback was the Renault 16 unveiled in April 1965 . The Renault 4: the forerunner to the Renault 16 was first designed to allow French farmers to transport sheep . The model credited with being the world’s first ever hatchback was unveiled to the public with the launch of France’s Renault 16 in April 1965. Now it accounts for a staggering two thirds of all new cars sold in Britain and a majority of those sold in most other markets from Europe to Japan and, increasingly, the US too. In the UK, seven of the top ten sellers last year - including the top five - are classed as hatchbacks. This is defined as a car which has a boot that lifts up from the roof but the outline of the car is no bigger than if it were a standard saloon (so estate cars and 4x4s are not classed as hatchbacks for instance.) Yet when the first one went on sale in 1965, the name hatchback did not even exist. It only came into use in the 70s as an alternative to the American term ‘liftback’ for such cars. The Renault 16 was the first mass produced hatchback in the world. It was described by then Renault president Pierre Dreyfus as a ‘voiture a vivre’ - a car for every aspect of life. Britain’s answer to the pioneering Renault  was the very similar looking, but poorly built, Austin Maxi (pictured) The very popular Austin Mini Metro by Austin Rover was launched in 1980 and then relaunched in 1995 . Like the earlier Renault 4, the boot was hinged to the roof but unlike the R4, the chassis had not been extended to facilitate this. There had been clique luxury cars with a similar boot but the R16 was revolutionary for a mass produced car with a hatch at the back and seats which folded down. And it became the first time cars were called either ‘three door’ or ‘five door.’ The Ford focus the world's best selling nameplate . Not only is the Ford Focus the word's best selling hatchback but also the best selling automobile nameplate in the world. Ford began sales of the Focus to Europe in July 1998 and in North America during 1999. In 2010 Ford decided to reunite both international and North American models by releasing the international Mk3 worldwide. The previous North American version was discontinued, and the new model was launched simultaneously in North America and Europe in early 2011. As of the first half of 2012, the Focus surpassed the Toyota Camri as the world's best-seller . Renault celebrated the car’s 50th anniversary with a retrospective exhibition in Paris this week. It said: “The goal was to design a high-end mid-sized car that would set itself completely apart from the opposition: a family car adapted to every aspect of modern life, boasting the functionality and versatility of an estate while delivering the comfort and elegance of a saloon car.” The car was a critical and commercial success leading to generations of copycat rivals. Better rivals came from Japan - the Nissan Sunny (pictured) along with the Honda Civic and the Toyota Camry . Britain’s answer to it was the very similar looking, but poorly built, Austin Maxi. It was so poor that even the factory workers at the time were reluctant to use their company discount to own one. Better rivals came from Japan - the Nissan Sunny, Honda Civic and the Toyota Camry which became one of the world’s best selling cars of the 70s. The Germans followed with the Opel Kadett, which later became the Vauxhall Astra and the early VW Passat, a forerunner to the massively successful VW Golf. The VW Golf GTI and the Ford Escort XR3i from the golden age of the hatchback as a cult car . Ford brought out its own bestseller, the Fiesta and Fiat launched the Uno. European motorists snapped up hatchbacks by the million. America took longer to get the hatchback bug. Cheap petrol and a love of gas guzzling motors and pick ups meant they were reluctant to change at first. Gradually throughout the 1970s, most major manufacturers began to bring out hatchback versions of existing saloons, like the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Cavalier. The Americans finally followed suit with hatchback versions of their most popular cars including the Mustang and Chevette. Italian manufacturere Fiat launched its hatchback the Uno to challenge European rivals in 1983 . Then in the 80s came the Mini Metro and perhaps the most popular hatchback of all time, the Volkswagen Golf, which is still made to this day. This was also the decade which saw the arrival of the ‘Hot Hatch’ - souped up GTi versions of popular hatchback models including the Golf and Peugeot 205, which became synonymous with yuppies and so-called ‘boy racers.’ Now, hatchbacks are both popular and highly rated. The What Car? Car of the Year for 2015 was a hatchback, the new Skoda Fabia. The Nano: Designed to be the world's cheapest car . Made and Sold in India by Tata the Nano was designed to be the world's cheapest car and released at a price of US$1,600. Tata Motors began development of an affordable car that would appeal to the many Indians who ride motorcycles. The purchase price of the car was brought down by dispensing with most nonessential features. Hatchbacks are incredibly popular in popular in India. The nation's Maruti 800 has sold 2.66 million since 1983. What Car? editor, Jim Holder, said: “At What Car?, we see every day how the popularity of the hatchback both endures and increases. “For a vast majority of buyers the added practicality offered by a hatchback is a necessity, and despite the rise in sales of supposedly more upmarket saloons we see no reason for that trend to change.” Of 2.26 million cars sold in the UK last year, 1.5 million were hatchbacks. Of the top ten best sellers, the top five were hatchbacks - the Fiesta and Focus from Ford, the Corsa and Astra by Vauxhall and the VW Golf. The VW Polo is seventh in the table and the Audi A3 is eighth. The What Car?

"Venezuela captain Juan Arango has apologised to a rival player after biting him on the shoulder at the end of a tempestuous Mexican league match.

Suarez was given a nine-game suspension from international matches and a four-month ban from league action. The referee in Sunday's Mexican league game ended the game seconds after the bite and did not take action against Arango. The league's disciplinary commission could still punish him.

"Reports of Cristiano Ronaldo's decline have been greatly exaggerated: The Real Madrid forward scored five goals against Granada, taking his tally in La Liga to 36 for the season - more than half of Europe's top teams. Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 at the Bernabeu, and their Portuguese talisman managed the first five-goal haul of his career. His record of 36 league goals for the season overtook Lionel Messi's 32 strikes, and put him in the incredible position of having scored more goals than 53 of the 98 teams in Europe's top five leagues this season. Cristiano Ronaldo scored an incredible five goals against Granada to lift his tally for the season to 36 . Granada were torn to shreds by Ronaldo and his Real team-mates as the European champions won 9-1 . The Portuguese star now has more goals than 53 teams in Europe's top leagues, including nine in England . There are nine teams in the Barclays Premier League who have managed fewer goals in the league than Cristiano Ronaldo has this season. They are: . Stoke City, Newcastle United, West Bromwich Albion, Hull City, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley and Leicester City. Ronaldo took some flak last month after a series of poor performances for Real, but his goalscoring has never waivered and even through a difficult period he managed six goals in 10 games, the sort of record most strikers can only dream of. And his displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Newcastle United, Malaga, Borussia Dortmund, Torino and Lille. The first three of his five goals against Granada marked the quickest hat-trick of his career, coming in just eight first half minutes. Another followed 16 minutes later, and his last came 35 minutes after that. Ronaldo's displays across the season have brought more goals than the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Lille . It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he spoke of his delight afterwards . Lionel Messi and Barcelona came out on top in El Clasico but he has fewer league goals than Ronaldo . Borussia Dortmund, who can boast Marco Reus among their ranks, have fewer goals than the Real talisman . While Ronaldo overtook Messi on the goalscoring charts, the hat-trick - which could have been doubled - levelled the Argentine's record of 24 La Liga trebles. He almost matched Real legend Alfredo Di Stefano's 28 hat-tricks for Los Blancos in what was their biggest league win in 48-and-a-half years. It all adds up to a brilliant Easter Sunday for the world's best player, and he posted on Twitter after the game, saying: 'Happy to have scored 5 goals with this excellent team work. Thank you for all your support.' If the critics still see Ronaldo as greedy, it certainly paid off at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.

"England may be well on course to sealing their spot at Euro 2016 but it appears as if manager Roy Hodgson still does not know his best XI. Sportsmail's top team of reporters have submitted their starting line-ups for the finals in France, assuming everyone is fit of course. Let us know your England XIs by posting them in the comments section below. England manager Roy Hodgson pictured at the Juventus Stadium during Tuesday's friendly against Italy . MATT LAWTON . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Henderson, Wilshere; Welbeck, Rooney, Sterling; Kane . Not perfect by any means but I think it’s important to keep Rooney in a more central position, in the No 10 role he is most comfortable in, behind the best striker at this moment in time. Right now it’s Kane but Sturridge and Welbeck certainly offer good alternatives. There’s pace in that team as well. No natural holding player? I’m not convinced Carrick is the way forward. Get the best players on the pitch. England captain Wayne Rooney (centre) looks to get a shot in at the Italian goal on Tuesday . IAN LADYMAN . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Henderson, Wilshere; Welbeck, Rooney, Sterling; Sturridge . England’s defensive options remain their big problem so this is a team set up to score goals and win games by playing on the front foot. Luke Shaw hasn’t done enough yet to displace Baines while Henderson and Wilshere represent a holding duo at the base of the midfield that should provide security bit also the ability to get the team moving forwards when appropriate. Rooney is picked in this team in a central role while Sturridge gets the nod ahead of young pretenders such as Harry Kane simply on the back of experience. This is the first game of a major tournament after all. Daniel Sturridge (left) charges forward with the ball during last September's friendly against Norway . ROB DRAPER . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jones, Gibbs; Carrick; Henderson, Wilshere; Sterling, Rooney, Welbeck . No place for Daniel Sturridge at present and you might have to re-think if he's clear of injuries - but for the moment Rooney has to play up front. If England need a more attacking shape, Rooney can drop in and Sturridge come on for Wilshere or Henderson, but I'd be wary of starting that way, as England couldn't defend properly with two midfielders in Brazil. The back four doesn't convince but Jagielka and Baines struggled at the World Cup and Johnson is now out of the reckoning. England's Jordan Henderson in action against Italy at the Juventus Stadium on Tuesday night . MATT BARLOW . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jones, Baines; Henderson, Carrick, Milner; Sterling; Rooney, Welbeck . Not far off the team Hodgson picked against Lithuania on Friday. It's as good as we get at the moment. Wish it was stronger at the back, where perhaps Smalling and Bertrand can apply pressure. No place for Wilshere in a three-man midfield. Need mileage and ball-winning abilities to offset the luxury of Carrick in as a playmaker. Rooney and Welbeck on the basis they have delivered in international football but much will depend on Kane's second season and the fitness of Sturridge. Gary Cahill (left) tackles Lithuania's Saulius Mikoliunas during last Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier . SAMI MOKBEL . Hart; Clyne; Cahill, Jones, Gibbs; Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Welbeck, Rooney, Sterling; Kane . The two biggest calls here are Gibbs over Baines and Chamberlain instead of Wilshere. For me, the two selected will add more athleticism to the side without the loss of quality. There's certainly goals in this team, as well as pace. Europe beware! England left-back Kieran Gibbs (right) looks to run past Italian Alessandro Florenzi . JOE BERNSTEIN . Hart; Walker, Jones, Stones, Shaw; Carrick, Henderson; Sterling, Rooney, Young; Sturridge . It's ridiculous that Michael Carrick is only now getting the international recognition he deserves. He should have been a regular in the last two World Cups and will only be 34 at Euro 2016. With him and Rooney in the middle and lots of legs and energy around them, England should be able to play the quick and accurate tempo displayed by Liverpool in the last couple of years. Personally, I think that's the way to go rather than try and hit a big centre-forward like Harry Kane. Youngsters like John Stones and Luke Shaw will really emerge over the next 12 months. Michael Carrick (right) controls the ball as Roberto Soriano looks to make a challenge in Turin . RIATH AL-SAMARRAI . Hart; Clyne, Smalling, Cahill, Baines; Carrick, Wilshere; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Rooney, Sterling; Kane . The big unknown is Harry Kane's progress and whether he will do it all again next season. It's perhaps harsh on Daniel Sturridge, who has proven his effectiveness over greater time, but how can anyone currently bet against Kane? The big weakness remains at centre-half - neither man truly looks the part at the international level but Smalling has improved this season. At 25 he needs to improve further still. If Sterling's ego can process being on the left, where he has shown himself to be more than capable, then this could be a delightful attack. England's Harry Kane (right) leaves Italy's Giorgio Chiellini face down on the pitch during the friendly . MIKE KEEGAN . Hart; Clyne, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Henderson, Carrick, Barkley; Sterling, Rooney, Welbeck . Welbeck just gets the nod over Kane primarily for his pace and movement which is vital to England attacking at pace. If there is any chance John Terry can be lured back he walks in at the expense of Jagielka. Carrick must start and Barkley must cut down on giving the ball away in dangerous positions but offers more going forward than Fabian Delph. Baines gets one last chance to deliver on the international stage, ahead of Kieran Gibbs.

"Hull bounced back from Thursday's derby defeat to Hull KR to snatch a surprise 28-20 victory at Langtree Park, condemning St Helens to a third straight defeat. A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play.","Weakened St Helens suffer another defeat against strong Hull side .

"As England’s supporters settled in for a few pints at the Huntsman pub in the centre of Turin on Tuesday afternoon, a sizeable number spilled on to the street outside to sing the latest anti-IRA song. ‘**** the IRA,’ it goes — and it really does go on, and on and on. Inside the Juventus Stadium, with 2,000 travelling England fans seated in the curva at the north west area, there was more of the same. England fans sang anti-IRA songs during Tuesday's friendly draw with Italy at the Juventus Stadium - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants . Michael Carrick (centre) and the rest of the England squad applaud the travelling support in Turin on Tuesday . Frankly, it is embarrassing to listen to - a stain on our usually good-natured and good-humoured travelling supporters as we look ahead to June’s friendly with the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. It also places a strain on the FA. What can they do when thousands of travelling fans are singing: ‘Where were you in World War Two,’ or the German bomber song that has been heard for many years on our overseas trips? Toe-curling stuff. As for the IRA songs, many of the younger fans who join in with these chants cannot know or understand the significance of the Irish political situation and how it affected Britain through the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties. In Dublin there will be the issue of provocation, the potential to engage with a city that has traditionally been a political hotspot.There is barely time to catch our breath before England’s 3,000 supporters head to the Aviva Stadium for the first fixture against the Republic of Ireland since 1995. It was at Lansdowne Road on February 15 that year when rioting England fans - many of them associated with the neo-Nazi group Combat 18 - caused the fixture with Jack Charlton’s side to be abandoned. England supporters throw missiles at Landsdowne Road 20 years ago, causing the fixture to be abandoned . In the intervening years there have been various conversations between the FA and the FA of Ireland about a fixture between the teams, but it is only now they can agree that the time is right. Let’s not spoil it. The fixture with Martin O’Neill’s labouring team on June 7 is a bookend to the season ahead of the final chapter in Slovenia seven days later. Roy Hodgson is a football man and you can tell by his pained expression at the end of every post-match briefing that he would rather not be answering questions about fans’ behaviour. ‘We can only hope that in some way we put that right before we go to Ireland because the last thing we want is anything (other) than a very good football match,’ he said after the 1-1 draw with Italy. This is an awkward situation for the FA and yesterday they were reluctant to release another statement condemning the anti-IRA chanting as there is no evidence that it has had a positive effect. It seems by Roy Hodgson's pained expression at the end of post-match briefings that the England boss would rather not be ansering questions about fans' behaviour . The first audible chants of this latest song can be traced back to Celtic Park in November, when England emerged with an uplifting 3-1 victory over Scotland. Life felt good. That was until Hodgson, underprepared for a question about the nature of the chants, answered one with some assistance from a diplomatic member of the FA’s communications team. The FA attempted to defuse the situation by releasing a statement the following day apologising for the behaviour of ‘a section of the England support’. It read: ‘We have consistently urged supporters to show respect and not to chant songs that could be regarded as insulting to others - particularly from a religious or political perspective.’ The songs were sung in England's win against Scotland and the FA wanted to make sure they stopped in Turin - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants . The FA are in a tricky position because they are getting hammered by the travelling fans at every away game for the ‘two caps for Wembley’ loyalty scheme. Previously, those who travelled to watch England were rewarded with double the ‘caps’, giving greater access to restricted-allocation European Championship and World Cup tickets. Now, fans who attend home games get twice the points instead. The FA would do well to take a closer look at this policy in an effort to placate the supporters. Is it a fair trade? Probably not, but then it isn’t equitable to inflict anti-IRA songs on the people of Ireland the day before kick-off at the Aviva Stadium, either.","England fans sang anti-IRA songs during Tuesday's draw with Italy .

"Ben Jones-Bishop scored a spectacular solo try as the Salford Red Devils ended a run of 17 defeats in a row by Wigan after a thrilling 24-18 contest which saw both players finish with 12 men. Jones-Bishop, snapped up from Leeds Rhinos in the close-season, extended his lead as Salford's leading scorer with his seventh of the campaign. The Red Devils were hanging onto a 12-8 interval lead when Jones-Bishop struck on the hour to help his club leapfrog the Warriors into third place in the table. Both sides ended the match with 12 men as tempers flared during the Super League match . But Salford forward Weller Hauraki, already facing a ban after an incident at Huddersfield in Friday, and John Bateman were sent off two minutes from time for trading punches after the pair had already been sin binned following an earlier flare up. Salford's last win against Wigan was a 16-4 Challenge Cup fifth-round victory at the Willows in 2006. The long-awaited victory was particularly sweet for the the three former Wigan players in the Red Devils ranks - Scott Taylor, skipper Harrison Hansen and try scorer Michael Dobson. Dobson was outstanding and also helped set up two tries for full-back Niall Evalds. Salford brought in Evalds to replace full-back Kevin Locke who was concussed at Huddersfield. Wigan again left out Matty Bowen with Ryan Hampshire continuing at full-back and Lewis Tierney replacing Dom Manfredi on the wing. Conor Farrell, younger brother of second row Liam, also stepped into the squad with Joel Tomkins missing. Wigan Warriors' Michael McIlorum is tackled by Salford Red Devils's Liam Hood  and Weller Hauraki . Salford organised a reunion of their 1996 side, which famously ended Wigan's record-breaking Challenge Cup run, with the players and then coach Andy Gregory introduced to the fans before the kick-off. But the kick-off was delayed 15 minutes due to crowd congestion outside the AJ Bell Stadium. Wigan would have snatched an early lead had Tierney not slipped when Jones-Bishop spilled a George Williams kick. Salford's relief was short-lived when their defence failed to deal with another towering Matty Smith kick and Larne Patrick picked up the loose ball to stroll over for his first try for the club since his move from Huddersfield. Hampshire tagged on the conversion with the Red Devils forced to make an early substitution when Tommy Lee hobbled off after 11 minutes to be replaced by Liam Hood. A storming break by Josh Griffin put Wigan under pressure for the first time with Joe Burgess forced to make a try-saving tackle on Rangi Chase. But Salford suffered another injury blow midway through the first half when Cory Paterson was helped off with a knee problem. Wigan increased the lead to 8-0 with a Hampshire penalty after Weller Hauraki was caught offside from a Smith kick. The Red Devils hit back with Dobson and Chase combining for Evalds to dart over with Josh Griffin adding the conversion. Wigan lost Tony Clubb with a thigh injury before Salford took the lead for the first time with a sizzling try from Dobson against his old club. Josh Griffin broke clear from inside his own half for the supporting Dobson to notch his first try for the club with Griffin tagging on the goal to make it 12-8. The bumper crowd generated a tremendous atmosphere and the Red Devils fans were cheering again with a blistering burst from his own line by Evalds after gathering a Williams kick. Then Jones-Bishop grabbed a superb solo try on the hour to fire his side into an 18-8 lead. There appeared to be no danger to Wigan when Jones-Bishop took the ball 45 metres out. But he burst through two tackles and then rounded Hampshire in style to notch his seventh try of the season with Griffin converting. The hard-fought contest erupted 15 minutes from time with referee Richard Silverwood sin-binning Hauraki and Bateman after a melee. Hampshire put Wigan right back in the thrilling match with a fine try after 68 minutes and also added the goal to cut the gap to 18-14. Salford sealed the win when Dobson's perfect pass sent Evalds over for his second try four minutes from time with Griffin booting his fourth goal from four attempts. Another flare up two minutes from time saw Bateman and Hauraki red carded before Burgess went over 39 seconds from time.","Ben Jones-Bishop impressed by scoring solo try against the Warriors .

"It is little over a year since Alan Pardew became involved in a rather ugly touchline confrontation with Manuel Pellegrini while managing Newcastle. Pardew was warned about his behaviour by the FA and wrote to Pellegrini to apologise for the offensive name he called him. On Monday at Selhurst Park, Pardew, now manager of Crystal Palace, meets Pellegrini and Manchester City again having taken steps to change a pattern of behaviour he feared was becoming destructive. After taking advice from the League Managers’ Association, the 53-year-old has benefited from sessions with former international cricketer Jeremy Snape, now a sports psychologist. Alan Pardew called Manuel Pellegrini a 'f***ing old c**t' during Premier League encounter back in . The touchline spat occurred during a Premier League match between Newcastle and Man City in January 2014 . ‘My natural instinct is to be aggressive in the way my teams play,’ Pardew told the BBC. ‘But I have had to learn from my own experiences and not get too involved in that myself. Jeremy has helped me on the sidelines in terms of focusing on what I can control. ‘All the times I have been in trouble (I have reacted) when I felt an injustice so when those issues arise now, I know not to react and that is when I switch the off button.’ Pellegrini’s team are under a little pressure. Now trailing neighbours Manchester United ahead of Sunday’s derby at Old Trafford, Pellegrini knows he must lift his side from a run of results that has seen them lose touch with leaders Chelsea. Crystal Palace boss Pardew believes he has the ability to manage one of England's top sides . Pardew feels he would make a decent job of managing a top-four team if given the chance. ‘I look at the top teams and feel I could do that job better than I’m seeing it being done. But if I work in this part of the league for the rest of my career I will be extremely happy,’ he said. Pellegrini said recently he felt his City squad lacked one really big player. This week, he explained: ‘Well, it is just the way of thinking, that big teams need to sign a big player. It is very difficult to do it every year — but every two years you must do it.’","Alan Pardew was warned about his behaviour following touchline spat .

"The title race may be over in the minds of some, but Joe Hart is irrepressibly optimistic. Of course, he is paid to believe but there is some logic to his positivity when you consider how Manchester City won the league in 2012 and 2014 with late dramatic runs. ‘It’s kind of how we do it,’ said Hart, when asked about City’s need to overcome a nine-point deficit. ‘We like to do it a different way. We’ve not necessarily reached the standard week-in, week-out that we wanted to, but the beauty of football is that you get another chance and that starts on Monday at Crystal Palace. ‘We’ve got some massive games; eight big games to reach a level that we need to reach. We’ve not necessarily done that all season but we feel we are in the right place now. We have a lot of rest time and there are no excuses. Everyone is fit and ready to go. We will never give up.’ Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart insists his side are still capable of winning the Premier League title . Chelsea are nine points clear of Manchester City with both teams having eight games left to play . Chelsea are nine points clear of Manchester City . Hart is a good cheerleader. Last week he won his 50th cap at the age of 27 and was immensely proud of his achievement. And his club may need his leadership now. At the Etihad Stadium two weeks ago there was a distinct lack of fervour despite the 3-0 win over West Brom, as though a certain kind of resignation has set in regarding Manchester City’s trajectory but Hart does not accept that. ‘We’ve proved it and the fans have proved it – we never give up,’ he said. ‘That is one thing that is part of Manchester City that we’ve taken with us from the olden days. We’ll never give up while anything is possible. We’ll go for it. ‘We have definitely moved on as a team since we first won the league in 2012. That was a massive achievement but now we expect it of ourselves. We have been disappointed at certain times this season but there are eight games to go and we’ll give it all we’ve got.’ Hart himself is a good example of the adage that one should never give in. Dropped last season by Manuel Pellegrini and threatened this season by the £6million signing of Willy Caballero, Hart is playing as well as ever, his penalty save against Lionel Messi and the subsequent performance at the Nou Camp a product of a long period of good form. Hart has proven his class after being dropped last season following a handful of mistakes . ‘I feel pushed,’ said Hart. ‘I have personal pride. I push myself personally. I think the world of Willy. I think he is a fantastic goalkeeper and I know full well that if my standards drop, Willy will be in goal. That is how it is at Manchester City. That is how it is with England. I know it is the same thing here. I need to be on my toes and performing at a high level otherwise someone takes your spot.’ And Hart is not content with game, striving to better himself. ‘I can improve everything, management of the game. But I want to improve on everything and don't just say that lightly. I look at everything I do. You don’t set limits. I want to keep going and keep pushing and keep my place in the two teams I’m with – Manchester City and England. I hope the best is to come. That is what I’ll be pushing to do. ‘Every game is a rescheduled goal for me. It genuinely is. I’ve enjoyed the two games with England but I turn my head to Palace now. That is the next game for me and the one I’m looking forward to.’ Hart labelled Buffon, who won his 147th cap against England on Tuesday night, a 'legend of the game' And if he needed any inspiration in that quarter, a look across to his opposite number on Tuesday night at the Juventus Stadium would have provided it. As Hart won that 50th cap for England, Gianluigi Buffon was winning his 147th at the age of 37 and proving as sharp as ever. The England goalkeeper is a fan. ‘It’s hard to look past Buffon. He’s absolutely amazing. What a keeper – 147 caps, countless titles, the World Cup, European trophies. What a goalkeeper and what a gentleman. He’s real idol of mine and it’s a real privilege to share a pitch with him. ‘I’ve got a long way to go. But to see people like that at the top level is a real good feeling. I like him. I’ve watched his career and how he is around people. It’s a small amount of time you spend with people when you are in the tunnel with them but he oozes class. 'He is a classy guy and it’s great to have an icon like that. Fraser Forster played against Juventus a few times and said the same thing.’ Only in one area will Hart not be emulating Buffon. With his designer stubble, flowing hair, and his silk waist coat and designer shirt, Buffon looked a little more like a successful artist or film-maker than a footballer as he left the Juventus stadium. ‘He does look cool,’ said Hart, with a degree of self deprecation. ‘I’ll never try to be him. With my mousey blonde hair, it wouldn’t really work.’","Manchester City are currently nine points behind league leaders Chelsea .

"Confidence in the QPR camp is high heading into Tuesday's crucial Barclays Premier League match at Aston Villa. QPR had lost 13 of 14 league away games before Saturday's vital 4-1 victory at West Brom. The win also saw the west London club to end a five-game losing run, while they remain in 19th place just three points adrift of safety. Chris Ramsey urges his players to calm down during the 4-1 win against West Brom on Saturday . Eduardo Vargas (centre) celebrates with his QPR team-mates after opening the scoring  against West Brom . 'It's a fantastic victory for us,' QPR coach Chris Ramsey said in Monday's press conference. 'The morale has been good, very professional. 'The players have this belief.' QPR want to build on that success in Tuesday's game at Villa Park. 'We are going to approach the game in the same way as we have done in the past,' Ramsey said. Ramsey believes QPR could have won previous games but lacked a finishing touch and also had shaky moments in defence. 'We are hoping that we can be as clinical as we were on Saturday,' he said. QPR were not able to profit from their latest win with an improved league position, but have revealed themselves to be a combative team that have a fighting chance of survival. Bobby Zamora scored QPR's third goal with an astounding lob from a narrow angle against West Brom . Ramsey issues instructions from the touchline as QPR boosted their survival hopes with a vital win . 'We want to put pressure on the teams around us,' Ramsey said. 'Everybody seems to be responding to what others are doing. 'The pressure is equal.' Villa currently hold the last position of safety but have lost their last two league games, including a 3-1 defeat at Manchester United at the weekend. 'I would rather be going into the game with the advantage they have rather than us,' Ramsey said. 'We have more pressure.' Even so, Ramsey knows Tim Sherwood's Villa side are feeling the heat. 'Villa are close to us and they are going to want three points to climb further up above the line,' Ramsey said. Ramsey will be coming up against friend and former colleague Tottenham Tim Sherwood on Tuesday . QPR have a sense of urgency to win at Villa and will have the same mindset when they host Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday. Ramsey believes his players can get a good result in both games. 'The Premier League is a league that things happen that you can't expect,' he said. Villa are not going to be at full strength, but Ramsey said: 'I'm sure that they will be able to fill those positions adequately, it's not going to be an advantage.' As for his friend Sherwood, who was put in charge of Villa in February, Ramsey said: 'I'm happy for him that he has gone to a big club like Aston Villa and wish him the best.'","QPR beat West Brom 4-1 away from home on Saturday in bid to beat drop .

"Arsene Wenger has yet to decide whether to offer Abou Diaby a new contract but has hinted that the injury-prone midfielder could have a future at Arsenal beyond this summer. Diaby made his latest comeback from injury in a practice game on Wednesday but has made just 22 appearances in the last five seasons at the Emirates Stadium with extended spells on the sidelines. Arsenal face Liverpool in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off and while Wenger is unlikely to throw Diaby straight into a vital game in both clubs' seasons, he did suggest the French midfielder could earn a new deal, potentially on a pay-as-you-play deal. Arsene Wenger has yet to decide whether to offer Abou Diaby a new contract despite his injury troubles . Diaby made his latest comeback from injury in a practice game on Wednesday and could have a future . Wenger said he has made it clear how he envisages the future for Diaby at the north London club . Diaby has featured just once this season, playing for 67 minutes in the Capital One Cup defeat by Southampton in September but could get his chance in the Barclays Premier League run-in. 'I had a chat with him (Diaby) and told him how I can envisage the future,' Wenger said. 'He has to make a decision. 'Of course he understands completely that he has to perform and to show that he can be present on a consistent way. I will see where we go from there. Diaby has suffered 42 injuries during his Arsenal career, keeping him out of action for a total of 226 weeks . Wenger also hopes to find a positive solution to tie Tomas Rosicky down to a contract extension at Arsenal . Club captain Mikel Arteta (right) has also been out with injury and is another to secure to a contract extension . 'I wouldn't like to go into details, we have to meet again to see where we go from what I told him. It has to be linked a little bit with his presence.' Wenger also indicated he hoped to secure contract extensions for club captain Mikel Arteta and long-serving midfielder Tomas Rosicky. 2014 . Calf Muscle Strain, November 24 . Calf/Shin, October 14 .

"No Tiger Woods and no Rory McIlroy in the field is proving no problem in Houston, where record numbers have descended on the small suburb of Humble for the Shell Houston Open. The last tournament before the Masters is proving quite a show-stopper itself thanks to the crowd-pleasing antics of the popular Phil Mickelson and local boy Jordan Spieth. It’s 18 months now since Spieth attracted criticism for giving up on university and joining the PGA Tour as the 809th ranked player in the world. Spieth, only 21, has since risen to number four in the world. Funnily enough, no-one’s criticising him anymore. Spectators have flocked to see Texas local boy Jordan Spieth in action at the Shell Houston Open . Spieth's fellow American Phil Mickelson has also impressed in the run up to the Masters . In seven starts this season Spieth, who finished runner-up on his Masters debut last year, has finished outside the top seven only twice, and here a second-round 66 lifted him to within three shots of the leader, Andrew Putnam. As for Mickelson, he’d hardly played a decent shot this year before posting rounds of 66 and 67 to be one stroke behind at halfway. The stage was set beautifully, therefore, for the two Americans at opposite ends of their careers. Englishmen Justin Rose and Paul Casey were also going well at five shots off the pace.","Record numbers have flocked to see local boy Jordan Spieth in action .

"Tiger Woods is in it to win it — but it would be a ‘disaster for everyone’ if he limps out of the Masters this week. That is the view of Colin Montgomerie after Woods confirmed his return to competitive golf for the first time since early February, when he withdrew with a back injury in the first round of the Farmers Insurance Open. Having plummeted to 104 in the world rankings and with no kind of competitive action under his belt, beyond the rounds he has amassed in practice in Florida and at Augusta during the past few days, his form is a mystery. Former world No 1 Tiger Woods confirmed earlier this week that he will play at the Masters . Woods has dropped out of the world's top 100 for the first time in almost 19 years . Watch live coverage of all four days of The Masters only on Sky Sports (from 7pm) and from Friday on BBC2 (7pm). But Montgomerie, who will be at the Masters in Augusta commentating for Sky Sports, the only place to watch all four days live, said: ‘He hasn’t entered to make up the numbers, I can guarantee that. Imagine Tiger coming here to the Masters and scoring 69 or 68 in the first day? Suddenly the whole place is alive. It’s a buzz. ‘If Rory McIlroy starts with a 69, 68, so does Tiger, marvellous. ‘It would be fantastic, it would be a buzz around the place, some sort of electricity that we have missed without him. ‘Whether he can win again, who knows? Hey, never mind a major, can he win another event ever again? But let’s hope that it’s not one of these 75, 76, I’ve hurt my back, and goes home. That would be a disaster for everybody.’ Woods has won the Masters on four separate occasions with his last win coming in 2005 . Colin Montgomerie has said it would be fantastic to see a fully fit Woods go up against Rory McIlroy . McIlroy can match Woods in winning the grand slam if he wins the Masters. But 51-year-old Montgomerie believes the man from Northern Ireland will never hold the same dominance over golf that Woods achieved in his prime in 2000. He said: ‘I don’t think we’ll ever see the dominance that Tiger had in that year,’ he said. ‘The golf that was played and the way that it was done, in winning majors by eight and 15 shots, it was just incredible stuff. ‘At this moment in time, the competition is now so severe that any lapse at all, and there is someone willing to take up that baton. ‘And that wasn’t the case with Tiger. Tiger had this dominance that Rory hasn’t got yet.’","Tiger Woods has confirmed he will compete in the upcoming Masters .

"Twelve months ago, Liverpool were a free-flowing, potent attacking force with the SS (Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge) firing on all cylinders - the pair would eventually end up scoring 52 of Liverpool's 101 goals in the Premier League.This season, however, the goals have dried up. Replacing Suarez was always going to be a near-impossible task, but Liverpool fans would have started the season quietly confident that the quality was there to collectively make up for the Uruguayan's absence. Unfortunately for Brendan Rodgers, things in the final third have not quite clicked in the final third in the way they did last season. Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge (right) scored 52 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season . Raheem Sterling has struggled in front of goal this season, scoring only scored six Premier League goals . Jordan Henderson (centre) celebrates scoring sixth goal of the season, a penalty against Arsenal on Saturday . With just seven games of the season left Liverpool have scored just 45 goals - compared to 84 at the same stage last season - and their top scorers - Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Steven Gerrard - have scored six goals each. To put that into context, only Crystal Palace (Dwight Gayle and Mile Jedinak - four) and Sunderland (Adam Johnson and Steven Fletcher - four) have top scorers with fewer Premier League goals than Liverpool. while Aston Villa's top scorers Christian Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor have also only managed six each. What the stats clearly show is that Liverpool have not filled the void left by Suarez, they are missing a Harry Kane (19 goals), a Diego Costa (also 19), a Sergio Aguero (17), even a Charlie Austin (16 goals) - and it has cost them dearly. Harry Kane (centre) didn't score against Burnley on Sunday, but has 19 Premier League goals this season . Diego Costa is the joint top scorer in the Premier League with 19 goals in his first season in England . Liverpool fans would argue that in Sturridge, who scored 21 league goals last term, they do have a player capable of scoring 20+ goals a season - and they are right. The England striker has had a frustrating season due to various injuries, and that is unfortunate, but Liverpool's others goal threats - Raheem Sterling, Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert - simply haven't met the standards set by the SS last season. Some may also argue that while Liverpool lack a single focal point in attack, the group as a whole have picked up the slack. That may be true to an extent but Kane and Costa have scored more than Sterling, Henderson and Gerrard combined. And there can be little doubt that had Sturridge remained fit all season he would have more than six Premier League goals by this stage of the season. The are mitigating circumstances for Liverpool, no doubt, but the stats don't lie and the fact that no one person has grabbed the mantle left by Suarez or Sturridge has proven costly for Liverpool - and may be a crucial reason why they miss out on Champions League football next season. Only Sunderland and Crystal Palace have top scorers with fewer Premier League goals than Liverpool this season. ARSENAL - Alexis Sánchez, Olivier Giroud. 14.

"Andy Murray has a fairly simple message for any of his fellow British tennis players who might be agitated about the imminent arrival of Aljaz Bedene into the home ranks: don’t complain. Instead the British No 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world No 83, originally from Slovenia, as motivation to better themselves. At present any grumbles are happening in private, and Bedene’s present ineligibility for the Davis Cup team has made it less of an issue, although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the International Tennis Federation. Aljaz Bedene is pictured at his British citizenship ceremony in Hatfield on Tuesday morning . Andy Murray says British players anyone questioning the move should work on their world ranking . Bedene poses for a picture with friends and family outside the petty sessional court building in Hatfield . Last year, when Bedene stated he intended to try to make the switch, the then British No 3 Dan Evans expressed some doubts about its legitimacy, wondering why he would wish to do it. But Murray thinks anyone questioning the move, now it has become official, would be better working on getting their ranking closer to his. ‘If he was 500 in the world they wouldn’t be that fussed about it but obviously he threatens their position a bit,’ said the 27-year-old Scot. ‘And he’s obviously the British No 2, comfortably. ‘So they can complain but the best thing to do is use it in the right way and accept it for what it is, and try to use it as motivation whether they agree with it or not. He’s British now so they’ve just got to deal with it. ‘I would hope that all the guys who are below him now, like James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady, will use it as motivation. If he becomes eligible for Davis Cup ties then those guys are going to have to prove themselves. ‘He’s a good player but so are James and Kyle, and Liam has improved. Aljaz is there, he’s on the tour every week, the other guys aren’t quite there yet.’ Murray admits Bedene's stance threatens certain players position as he is on tour every week . James Ward (left) and Kyle Edmund should try to use Bedene as motivation to get better as a player . Bedene (right) with girlfriend Kimalie, who is a pop singer in her native land of Slovenia . For the first time, Murray, who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the top 100, gave his opinion of Bedene: ‘He’s a good player with a very good serve. He’s a legitimate top-100 player, when he plays challengers he’s there or thereabouts, when he plays on the main tour he wins matches, it’s not like he turns up and always loses in the first round. ‘He had a bad (wrist) injury last year but has recovered well. I would imagine he would keep moving up the rankings, although I don’t know exactly how high he can go. I’ve practised with him a couple of times, I haven’t seen him play loads, but when you serve as well as he does it helps. I would imagine he’s going to be comfortably in the top 70 or 80 in the world for a while.’ Bedene can individually represent any country he wants where he holds a passport. The Davis Cup is a greyer area as from January 1 playing for two countries in a career was outlawed and he was picked for the Slovenian squad three times — but he will argue his intentions were clear before then and his citizenship was being held up by bureaucratic process. It is understood the Lawn Tennis Association will give support to his case but have made it clear that the onus is on him to lead the way. An official statement said: ‘To have another player in the men’s top 100 is clearly a positive thing and so we very much welcome Aljaz’s change in citizenship.’ Murray says Bedene is a great server who could possibly move up the rankings . Murray gets pumped up on his way to victory over Kevin Anderson at the Miami Open . Murray proudly poses with a cake, saying 'It's an amazing feeling' after winning his 500th game . Switching nationalities is always a contentious issue in any sport and Evans’s questions have some pertinence to them. There is a recent precedent, however. Two years ago Australian Brydan Klein switched to represent GB by virtue of his mother originally being from Manchester. He subsequently struggled but his form has picked up and he is now ranked 210 in the world to make himself the national No 5. Last year that would have guaranteed a Wimbledon wildcard worth, minimally, a staggering £27,000. However, there is now no automatic recommendation for a Championships wildcard for Brits ranked inside the top 250. The last comparable switch came twenty years ago when Greg Rusedski arrived from Canada. It was by no means universally popular but, like Bedene, he pledged that he was in for the long haul and, in fairness to him, he proved true to his word.

"South Korea's Kim Sei-young spectacularly eagled the par-five 18th to surge into a two-shot lead in the second round of the ANA Inspiration on Friday as Lydia Ko's record-equalling run came to an end. The 22-year-old Kim, who won her maiden LPGA Tour title at the Pure Silk-Bahamas LPGA Classic in February, struck a superb second shot to six feet on her final hole and knocked in the putt to card a seven-under-par 65 at Mission Hills Country Club. That left the Korean at seven-under 137 in the first women's major of the season, two ahead of overnight leader Morgan Pressel, who followed her opening 67 with a 72. Lydia Ko looks for her ball in the water on the 18th hole during the second round . Long-hitting American Brittany Lincicome, the 2009 champion at Mission Hills, fired a 68 to finish at four under, level with Korean Jenny Shin (69) and Scotland's Catriona Matthew (69). Kim, who had returned a 72 in the first round, birdied four of her first nine holes to claw her way up the leaderboard. She picked up further shots at the 11th and 15th before making her only bogey of the day at the 16th, then ended her round in eagle style. 'I really hit the ball good and putted really good,' said Kim, who is playing in only her third major championship. 'I'm very happy. 'Yesterday I adjust a little bit my putting ... now I see the line better.' Ko missed out on recording her 30th successive under-par round . Pressel, who at 18 became the youngest winner of a women's major at the 2007 Kraft Nabisco Championship held at Mission Hills, was a frustrated figure after shooting a level-par 72. 'I had to fight a little bit harder today,' said the 26-year-old American. 'My swing wasn't quite as sharp as it was yesterday. I made some sloppy bogeys and some really good pars. But I give myself a chance for the weekend.' Ko's record-equalling run of 29 consecutive rounds under par on the LPGA Tour came to end when the world No 1 bogeyed two of her last four holes for a 73 and a level-par total of 144. The 17-year-old, who has already won six LPGA titles, had a chance to dip under par after hitting a perfect tee shot down the 18th but her attempt to lay up with a six-iron failed as her ball ran through the fairway into a pond in front of the green. Sei Young Kim of South Korea has a two-shot lead at the halfway point . Penalised a stroke, she hit her fourth shot to 12 feet above the hole from where she two-putted for a bogey six. 'It was 169 (yards) to the end of the fairway and it was still 20 yards after that with the rough so I thought a six-iron would be okay, even it flew out of there,' Ko told Golf Channel. 'Obviously it wasn't the right club. I would love to have had a birdie opportunity there.' However, Ko was happy enough to have matched Hall of Famer Annika Sorenstam's record run of 29 consecutive sub-par rounds. 'You just go out there, try and have fun, try to shoot the lowest you can,' said the pony-tailed New Zealander. 'Now it's over but 29 is not too bad.'","Lydia Ko is seven shots behind leader Kim Sei-young .

"Nick Scholfield is lined up to ride Spring Heeled in the Grand National at Aintree on April 11 . Nick Scholfield has been lined up to ride Jim Culloty’s Spring Heeled in the Crabbie’s Grand National at Aintree on Saturday week. Scholfield had been expected to partner Paul Nicholls-trained Sam Winner, who was pulled up in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, in the £1million race. But the champion trainer  said on Wednesday it was unfair to tie Scholfield down to a gelding which is far from certain to run when the mount on another leading definite contender is being offered. Scholfield, who has ridden in six Nationals and finished third in 2013 on Teaforthree, will travel to Ireland to sit on Spring Heeled at Culloty’s County Cork stable on Friday. Nicholls said: ‘I have not made up my mind if I am going to run Sam Winner yet and Nick needed a decision. ‘I did not want to get into a situation next week when I had to say ""sorry mate, he is not running"" and did not want to stop him getting a good ride. ‘I have not pressed any buttons on any of the horses who ran at Cheltenham. That will happen over the weekend and early next week. I don’t want to run unless I am really happy. ‘I have plenty of other lads who could ride Sam Winner if he runs and would not be afraid to use Will Biddick or Harry Skelton.’ Spring Heeled (right) wins the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at Cheltenham last year . Spring Heeled, winner of Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup at last season’s Cheltenham Festival, has been given a National preparation. The eight-year-old has run only once since finishing fourth to Road To Riches in the Galway Plate in July when he was fourth of five in the Bobbyjo Chase at Fairyhouse in February. Racemail revealed on Wednesday that Culloty would have two runners in the National. Robbie McNamara will ride his 2014 Gold Cup winner Lord Windermere. Scholfield rides Teaforthree (front) as the horse jumps the last fence at Aintree in the 2013 Grand National . McNamara said: ‘It's a great ride to get and I'm looking forward to it. I've ridden him before in a Grade One in Leopardstown and I was supposed to ride him in the Hennessy there as well, but I broke my collarbone the day before. I'm delighted to get back on him.’ With Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained Double Ross another confirmed non runner, David Pipe’s well supported Soll appears guaranteed a run at the bottom of the weights. Luke Morris became the first jockey to ride 100 winners during an All Weather Flat racing season when a double at Chelmsford on Wednesday aboard Giantouch and Middle East Pearl carried him to 101 successes for the campaign.","Nick Scholfield is lined up to ride Spring Heeled in the Grand National .

"Reigning champion Novak Djokovic dug deep to avoid a shock exit at the hands of Alexandr Dolgopolov before powering into the quarter-finals of the Miami Open. The unseeded Dolgopolov - ranked 65th in the world, 64 places behind Djokovic - surprised the Serbian by winning a first-set tie-break and building a quick 4-2 lead in the second set. But Djokovic steeled himself and rallied to force a decider, which he wrapped up without much resistance from his deflated Ukrainian opponent.

"Newport Gwent Dragons reached the European Challenge Cup semi-finals with a thrilling 25-21 victory over Cardiff Blues. Tries from wing Hallam Amos, replacement Nic Cudd, a penalty try plus penalties from Tom Prydie and Dorian Jones and two Prydie conversions brought the Dragons back from a big deficit to victory. Scrum-half Lloyd Williams, fly-half Gareth Anscombe and number eight Josh Navidi crossed for the Blues, while Anscombe added three conversions. Dragons replacement Nic Cudd powers over for try against Cardiff at Rodney Parade . The draw could not have set-up a more mouth-watering Welsh clash than this encounter between the old rivals, with an away trip to either London Irish or Edinburgh the reward for the victors. Cardiff held the upper hand historically, having won the Challenge Cup in 2010 when beating French outfit Toulon 28-21, while the furthest the Dragons had gone in Europe's second tournament was the semi-final stage. The Blues fielded a lot of their big guns, including Wales captain Sam Warburton, while the home region curiously left star British Lions number eight Taulupe Faletau on the bench. The visitors came out of the blocks with a blast, forcing the Dragons onto the defensive over their own line. From the attacking scrum five, the ball found its way to Williams to cross by the post and make Anscombe's conversion easy. Cardiff Blues scrum half Lloyd Williams crashes over for a Blues try in the first half . Prydie reduced the arrears when landing a long-range penalty but the Dragons suffered the loss of international ace Andrew Coombs with a bad leg injury, bringing Faletau into the fray to the loud cheers of the crowd. It was a real cut and thrust affair but the Blues played with far more cohesion and they came up trumps again when, again from a scrum five, the ball went to Anscombe who drove through weak tackling to the line and again converted. The Dragons did themselves no favours with an average kicking game as the Blues found the spaces and pushed them back. The Dragons sqaud are overjoyed after they were awarded a penalty try . But the home side pulled themselves back to within four points of the Blues at half-time when Amos was put away by scrum-half Jonathan Evans under the posts, with Prydie converting. A thorn in the Dragons side was opposition wing Alex Cuthbert, who forced the home defence into multiple tackles - including one from full-back Jason Tovey, whose thumping hit prevented a possible runaway touchdown. The Dragons took it to the Blues after the break as an attacking line-out set up a series of thrusts to the visiting line before Cudd saw a gap and went over just seconds after coming on for flanker James Thomas. Cardiff players Sam Warburton (left),  Matthew Rees (cebtre) and Josh Turnbull walk off the pitch at full-time . Prydie's conversion hit the post but the home side were on top and went in front for the first time when a clearance attempt a few metres from his line by Lloyd Williams was charged down and, as it crossed the line, a try was infringed. Referee JP Doyle had no hesitation in running under the posts for a penalty try, easily converted by Prydie - with Williams earning 10 minutes in the bin. A penalty from Dorian Jones further increased the Dragons' lead - but the vsitors would not give up. From a series of scrums on the home line, Navidi picked up and went by the posts with Anscombe's conversion reducing the deficit to four points. However, the Dragons survived an onslaught in the dying minutes to hold on for the victory.","Newport Gwent Dragons scored tries through Hallam Amos and Nic Cudd along with a penalty try .

The Spaniard won the last two games however to continue an impressive season that has seen her reach two other semi-finals and make the last eight at Indian Wells for the first time. 'It was a crazy match, crazy first two sets. Venus was unbelievable at the beginning.

"Bath will look to their England contingent to lead the charge against Leinster in Dublin as they attempt to make amends for their Six Nations defeat at the Aviva Stadium last month. George Ford, Dave Attwood, Jonathan Joseph and Anthony Watson all return to the scene of the 19-9 defeat by Ireland which halted another Grand Slam crusade, and their club’s head coach feels that setback could prove beneficial in their Champions Cup quarter-final. Jonathan Joseph will be among Bath's England contingent in Dublin on Saturday . Bath centre Joseph has a point to prove after England’s Six Nations defeat in Dublin . ‘George, Anthony, JJ and Dave have been telling the rest of the squad what the Aviva is going to be like,’ said Bath head coach Mike Ford. ‘Their experience of that is valuable for us. ‘In the long run, these players come back better experienced and the fact they’ve done what they’ve done with England this season means they are not going to have any fear of going back to the Aviva.’ The leading quartet have points to prove in the Irish capital… . Dave Attwood . The lock produced an energetic performance for England but the line-out he was running crucially malfunctioned twice and he needlessly conceded a penalty. He will be determined to deliver a dominant carrying, aerial and defensive performance. George Ford . As the national team’s playmaker, he was pressured by the intensity of the Irish defence and kicking game — which he didn’t manage to match — in an otherwise superb championship campaign. He will crave the platform to run the show with typical authority. Fly-half George Ford will seek to run the show for Bath in Champions Cup quarter-final . Jonathan Joseph . Bath’s electric centre was a deadly presence in England’s midfield in other games but in Dublin he was not given the ammunition to fire. If he is presented with enough ball then he has the individual talent to shred the home defence. Leinster have been studying him carefully. Anthony Watson . On the wing for England, the outing at the Aviva Stadium was not his finest, as he struggled to handle the barrage from the air. On Saturday, he will be positioned at full back for his club so he must be much more assured under the high ball and use his license to counter-attack from deep to full effect. And here are four of the Ireland players in Leinster colours aiming to sink English hopes again… . Cian Healy . The Lions prop had a limited impact on Ireland’s Six Nations title success as he was eased back into action after injury. However, he starts today for the Blues and will be fired up to demonstrate his clout as a strong carrier who can also more than hold his own in the scrum battle. Leinster's Rob Kearney (right) is a real threat as a strike runner . Jamie Heaslip . The experienced No 8 missed the visit of England after suffering fractured vertebrae in his back caused by the knee of France lock Pascal Pape. These are the days — the big occasions — when he raises his game: strutting, charging and hitting rucks. Rob Kearney . The Ireland full back is imperious under the high ball so the Test encounter with England last month suited him perfectly. He will be keen to provide a reminder of his threat as a strike runner but he also provides a crucial kicking outlet if the hosts are pinned down. Sean O’Brien . He’s known as the ‘Tullow Tank’ and it is easy to understand how he came by that nickname. The Lions flanker is an imposing force of nature at full throttle. He will blast holes in the best defences and commit body and soul to every collision with a madcap, reckless intensity.","Bath's England contingent return for Champions Cup quarter-final .

"Andy Murray  came close to giving himself some extra preparation time for his wedding next week before ensuring that he still has unfinished tennis business to attend to. The world No 4 is into the semi-finals of the Miami Open, but not before getting a scare from 21 year-old Austrian Dominic Thiem, who pushed him to 4-4 in the second set before going down 3-6 6-4, 6-1 in an hour and three quarters. Murray was awaiting the winner from the last eight match between Tomas Berdych and Argentina's Juan Monaco. Prior to this tournament Thiem lost in the second round of a Challenger event to soon-to-be new Brit Aljaz Bedene. Andy Murray pumps his first after defeating Dominic Thiem to reach the Miami Open semi finals . Muray throws his sweatband into the crowd after completing a 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory in Florida . Murray shakes hands with Thiem who he described as a 'strong guy' after the game . And Murray has a fairly simple message for any of his fellow British tennis players who might be agitated about his imminent arrival into the home ranks: don't complain. Instead the British No 1 believes his colleagues should use the assimilation of the world number 83, originally from Slovenia, as motivation to better themselves. At present any grumbles are happening in private, and Bedene's present ineligibility for the Davis Cup team has made it less of an issue, although that could change if his appeal to play is allowed by the International Tennis Federation. Murray thinks anyone questioning the move, now it has become official, would be better working on getting their ranking closer to his. 'If he was 500 in the world they wouldn't be that fussed about it but obviously he threatens their position a bit,' said the 27 year-old Scot. ' and he's obviously the British number two, comfortably. 'So they can complain but the best thing to do is use it in the right way and accept it for what it is, and try to use it as motivation whether they agree with it or not. He's British now so they've just got to deal with it. Murray stretches for a return after starting his quarter final match slowly on the show court . Thiem held nothing back as he raced through the opening set, winning it 6-3 with a single break . The young Austrian is considered to be one of the hottest prospects on the ATP Tour . 'I would hope that all the guys who are below him now like James (Ward) , Kyle (Edmund) , Liam (Broady) they will use it as motivation. If he becomes eligible for Davis Cup then those guys are going to have to prove themselves. 'It can only be seen as a positive for those guys using it to try to get better. He's a good player but so are James and Kyle and Liam has improved. Aljaz is there, he's on the tour every week, the other guys aren't quite there yet.' For the first time Murray, who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the top 100, gave his opinion of Bedene: 'He's a good player with a very good serve. He's a legitimate top 100 player, when he plays Challengers he's there or thereabouts, when he plays on the main tour he wins matches, it's not like he turns up and always loses in the first round. Murray's fiancee was once again watching from the stands shaded by a huge brimmed hat . Kim Sears flashes her enormous diamond engagement ring while watching her beau on court . 'He had a bad injury last year (wrist) but has recovered well. I would imagine he would keep moving up the rankings although I don't know exactly how high he can go. I've practised with him a couple of times, I haven't seen him play loads, but when you serve as well as he does it helps. I would imagine he' s going to be comfortably in the top 70 or 80 in the world for a while.' It is understood the Lawn Tennis Association will give background support to his case regarding the Davis Cup but have made it clear that the onus is on him to lead the way. An official statement said: 'To have another player in the men's top 100 is clearly a positive thing for British tennis and so we very much welcome Aljaz's change in citizenship.' The last comparable switch came twenty years ago when Greg Rusedski arrived from Canada. It was by no means universally popular but, like Bedene, he pledged that he was in for the long haul and, in fairness to him, he proved true to his word. Loising the first set shocked Murray into life as he raced to a commanding lead in the second . The No 3 seed sent over a few glaring looks towards his team before winning the second set . Murray had to put such matters aside as he tackled the unusually talented Thiem, a delight to watch. Coached by Boris Becker's veteran mentor Gunter Bresnik, he slightly resembles Andy Roddick and hits with similar power but more elegance. His single handed backhand is a thing of rare beauty. However, he has had a mediocre season coming into this event and there was little to forewarn of his glorious shotmaking that seemed to catch Murray unawares early on. The world No 4 looked to have worked him out in the second, but then suffered one of his periopdic mental lapses and let him back in from 4-1 before closing it out with a break. After breaking him for 3-1 in the decider the Austrian whirlwind burnt itself out. 'He's a strong guy who hits the ball hard and it became a very physical match,' said Murray. Murray was presented with a celebratory cake after winning his 500th match in the previous round .","British No 1 defeated Dominic Thiem in Miami Open quarter finals .

"Rangers boss Stuart McCall has been reassured that the decision to remove the club off the London Stock Exchange will not affect his squad's promotion push. The Ibrox faithful were rocked by Thursday's news that the club had been de-listed from the AIM after chairman-in-waiting Dave King failed to find a new nominated advisor. Interim chairman Paul Murray put the blame for AIM's decision at the door of the club's previous board but tried to play down fears by revealing the new regime in charge is now considering a switch to the ISDX market. Stuart McCall oversees his Rangers players during a training session on Good Friday . There is also the possibility of legal action from former football board chairman Sandy Easdale. But whatever the outcome, McCall does not expect it to derail his charge for the play-offs. The Gers manager said: 'I had a quick chat with [director] John Gilligan and read an email that had gone round the club saying: ""Don't panic, don't worry"". 'I'm a football guy, I don't know what's going on in the stock markets. 'But apparently [the board is] not concerned in any way. The funding and the plans for the club will remain the same. Rangers have been de-listed from the AIM after Dave King (centre) failed to find a new nominated advisor . 'Do I expect it to negatively impact me or the players? No. I hope not and I wouldn't expect it to.' Rangers also this week announced six-month losses of £2.6million for the second half of last year. Among the report's details was the surprise that Rangers will have to hand Newcastle United £500,000 if they win promotion to the Premiership as part of the deal which saw them take five Magpies youngsters on loan in January. It is the type of bill the cash-strapped Light Blues could do without but McCall - who still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the summer - is refusing to worry about it too much right now. Rangers this week announced six-month losses of £2.6million for the second half of last year . 'I was really surprised,' said McCall after being asked for his reaction to loan-deal agreement. 'I was gobsmacked if I'm being honest. 'I was driving in the car when I heard it on the radio and I just thought: ""Woof"". But if that's the deal, that's the deal. 'But I've got enough on just concentrating on what's happening on the training ground and the pitch. 'I've not even given [whether that fee will impinge on me if I'm here next season] a thought. My main concern is the game on Sunday. 'I know you have got to be prepared and be organised but I'm not a three-year or five-year plan guy. I try to do my best here and now and if it's good enough to get us up then great.' McCall admits he was gobsmacked at the news Rangers will have to pay Newcastle £500,000 if promoted . Rangers welcome newly-crowned Scottish Championship winners Hearts to Ibrox on Sunday. It should have been a crucial clash in the race for the title but the Light Blues' mid-season collapse means it only has significance for the hosts as they look to over-take Hibernian in second place. But McCall confirmed his side will pay tribute to the league leaders. 'We will be giving the Hearts lads a guard of honour,' he said. 'It's not something you do week after week but this is their first away game and it's something we will be doing. 'Hearts have won 26 games out of 30 and nine on the bounce. That's incredible. 'Our players might look on a bit enviously and think they'd have liked that to be us who were running out as champions. 'Hopefully they will see it that the season can still be a success, we can still get promoted.'","Stuart McCall is trying to lead Rangers to Championship promotion .

"Moeen Ali is planning to join England for the latter stages of their Test tour of the West Indies, as his side injury continues to improve. The off-spinning all-rounder hurt himself during England's failed World Cup campaign, and was therefore not available when the selectors chose the Caribbean squad. Moeen Ali trudges off after being dismissed against New Zealand during the World Cup . Moeen enjoyed a successful introduction to Test cricket last summer, picking up 22 wickets in seven Tests . They nonetheless left open from the outset the possibility of Moeen joining up later in the month-long trip, for which James Tredwell and the uncapped Adil Rashid are instead the initial frontline spin options. As England prepared to fly west on Thursday, Moeen revealed he expects to be fit again in time for Worcestershire's first LV= County Championship match at home to title-holders Yorkshire on April 12. He told Cricinfo: 'I'm hoping to play that game against Yorkshire, prove my fitness and fly immediately afterwards.'

"Manager Arsene Wenger is convinced something is finally happening at Arsenal again - and everyone can 'smell' it. The Gunners romped to a 4-1 win over Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off, which was a seventh successive Barclays Premier League victory and moved them up into second place. While Manchester City could reclaim second by beating Crystal Palace on Monday and the title looks out of reach as Chelsea remain seven points ahead with a match in hand, there is no doubt when Wenger has all of his squad available Arsenal are capable of giving anyone a run for their money. Right back Hector Bellerin gave Arsenal the lead with a superb left-foot curling into the corner to get things going at the Emirates Stadium . Bellerin broke the Emirates deadlock for Arsenal, cutting in from his native right-hand side and curling a left-foot strike into the corner . Although there was disappointment at failure to progress in Europe following elimination by Monaco, the prospect of an improved league finish and successful FA Cup defence remains very much on the agenda. Wenger, who was often criticised over the direction of his team following almost a decade without a trophy, feels finally things are starting to come together. 'We have a good mentality and good cohesion in the team,' he said. 'There is something happening, that shows you that they are ready to fight for each other. Mesut Ozil is congratulated by his team-mates after his magnificent free-kick on the half hour mark put Arsenal fully in control of the game . 'You can see that, you can't cheat on that, people smell that. 'It of course is a good basis, and defensively we are getting better.' Following a poor start to the campaign, Arsenal were expected to struggle to sustain a place in the top four. Wenger, though, will not get complacent. 'I am old enough to know that things are never as comfortable as they look, but what is true is that it's in our hands. How well we deal with the situation now will be important,' he said. Alexis Sanchez celebrates with Olivier Giroud after his stunning strike from just outside the penalty area made it 3-0 to Arsenal in the first half . Wenger has his sights set on getting as close to Chelsea as possible, with the leaders set to come to the Emirates Stadium on April 26. 'I am a competitor and what that means is you have to go as high and as far as you can. When you go home if somebody was better than us, then 'well done', but we have to have given our best until the end and that is what I would like to do,' he said. 'Let's give everything to do it and see what happens. But Olivier Giroud ended any hopes of a Liverpool comeback by smashing in a fantastic fourth for Arsenal in stoppage time . 'We are in a good position, with four games at home and only three away. 'We are on a good run, so I would say that it will be down to how we can maintain that focus and level of urgency between now and the end of the season.' After failing to make the most of their positive start on Saturday, Arsenal had to soak up some pressure from Liverpool, with Raheem Sterling failing to capitalise when put in on goal. A huge flag is waved as Nacho Monreal and Giroud are among the first team-mates to congratulate the unlikely opening goalscorer . The Gunners finally broke the deadlock through the unlikely source of full-back Hector Bellerin, who slotted home a fine left-foot curling effort on 37 minutes. It proved the catalyst for an onslaught, with Mesut Ozil's free-kick and a rocket by Alexis Sanchez on the stroke of half-time effectively ending the contest. After Arsenal's tempo dropped, Liverpool reduced the arrears with a penalty from Jordan Henderson, but following the dismissal of Emre Can for a second yellow card, Olivier Giroud cracked home a late fourth to cap a memorable afternoon's work. Sanchez got in on the goalscoring act just before half-time, finding space outside the box to smash a drive over the head of keeper Mignolet . Wenger admits he has been impressed by the work-rate of both Bellerin and defensive midfielder Francis Coquelin, who were each drafted into the first-team as cover for injury, but are now an integral part of the side. Asked if either man was in his thoughts at the start of the season, Wenger said: 'Honestly, no. But my job is to remain open-minded and make decisions when you have to. '(I picked Bellerin against Liverpool) because of his pace. 'I thought (Daniel) Sturridge would play and then Sterling would have gone on the flank. Francis Coquelin challenges Daniel Sturridge During the Barclays Premier League match  at Emirates Stadium . 'Because of his low centre of gravity, Sterling changes direction very quickly and Hector is short as well.' Wenger added: 'I think you also have to give credit to players who get less, such as Coquelin. 'In the first half he broke up many attacks in a convincing way. 'But honestly I couldn't say that in my head (at the start of the season) Coquelin was one of the first-choice players.'","Arsenal maintained they superb run of form by thumping Liverpool .

"Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is in no doubt goalkeeper Michel Vorm has the strength of character to put his Capital One Cup final disappointment behind him and again prove an able deputy for  Hugo Lloris at Burnley on Sunday. With France international Lloris sidelined by a knee injury, Dutchman Vorm will stand in at Turf Moor. The 31-year-old, signed from Swansea in the summer, had to watch on from the bench at Wembley against Chelsea in last month's League Cup final defeat, despite having featured in the earlier rounds. Michel Vorm is set to deputise in place of Hugo Lloris when Tottenham play Burnley on Sunday . Lloris sustained a knee injury in Tottenham's 4-3 victory over Leicester in the Premier League . Mauricio Pochettino has praised Vorm's attitude despite being behind Lloris in the pecking order . Pochettino, however, has every confidence Vorm can produced the required performance when thrown back into the action against the Clarets. 'Michel took it very well. I have no worries about him. He is a good professional and he is fine,' the Argentinian said. 'It is always it is difficult and it was the same with the other players who were left out. 'I was sorry for him, but also for the players who were on the bench or out of the squad. It is always difficult when you play a final and you have to choose the starting 11.' Pochettino has been impressed by Vorm's mentality, having left a regular starting place at Swansea to play back-up to Lloris. 'When I spoke with him about signing, he knew - I never lied to him. I told him our proposal and were very clear,' the Spurs boss said. Vorm (centre) played in all of the Capital One Cup games for Tottenham except the final . Pochettino (left) will again take on Burnley manager Sean Dyche at Turf Moor on Sunday . Tottenham head to Burnley in some positive form, having lost just once in the last four Barclays Premier League matches before the international break - and that at Manchester United. Pochettino, though, knows a solid collective defensive performance will be key against a side battling for their top-flight survival. 'We need to concede fewer chances and goals, but this is not about the keeper or the centre-back or the full-back or the holding midfielder - this is about the balance of the team,' he said.","Michel Vorm's Tottenham chances have been few since Swansea transfer .

"With the confirmation of Danilo's summer switch to Real Madrid, Porto have now received a whopping £440million from player sales in the last 11 years. Since winning the Champions League under Jose Mourinho in 2004 the Portuguese champions have made a habit of selling on players for huge profits. Aided by lenient work permit laws in Portugal owing to the country's close relationship with Brazil the majority of these deals have involved South Americans. Porto and Brazil right back Danilo will join Real Madrid in the summer in a deal worth £23million . Jose Mourinho celebrates winning the 2004 Champions League with the Portuguese club . Nineteen of the 29 players featured in the table below have South American backgrounds such as now-Real Madrid superstar James Rodriguez. In a deal typical of how Porto operate, Rodriguez was signed for a small sum from Argentinian side Banfield before being sold on to wealthy Europeans Monaco three years later for nearly eight times the price. It is a sustainable model which clearly works. Real Madrid superstar James Rodriguez is another player off the Porto production line . James scores against Manchester City playing for Porto at the Etihad Stadium in 2012 .

"Lionel Messi's foot swelling is still a concern for Barcelona after the Argentine star missed both games for his country during the international break, and he now faces tests to determine whether he will be fit to tackle Celta Vigo on Sunday. The worries about Messi's fitness make the front cover of Spanish paper SPORT, who say that the four-time Ballon d'Or winner wants to play as his side look to close in on the La Liga title. However, those hopes could be curtailed by tests on Thursday. Team-mate Gerard Pique had spoken of his optimism regarding Messi's chances of playing on Saturday but it seems far from certain with AS labelling him a 'doubt'. SPORT's front page says Lionel Messi wants to play at the weekend and AS' front page reads: 'Next is Gaya' Messi was left out of both of Argentina's games during the international break with his swollen foot problem . While Messi wants to play, the problem continues and he faces tests on Thursday to decide if he can play . Marca talk about Danilo and Real Madrid's new transfer policy while Mundo Deportivo look at Felipe Anderson . 'In the end it is up to how he feels during the rest of the week,' Pique said. 'The medical staff are those who should decide. My feeling is that he will play.' ESPN have claimed that Messi's injury, which has been shrouded in mystery, was the result of a tackle by Martin Demichelis during Manchester City's Champions League exit against Barca last month. 'Messi broke down the right hoping to put the ball into the area for (Luis) Suarez or Neymar,' ESPN reported. ESPN have claimed that Messi's injury was the result of a tackle by Manchester City's Martin Demichelis . The La Liga top scorer did manage to play in El Clasico against Real Madrid, but his impact was limited . 'At that moment Demichelis savagely brought him down and sent him crashing into the advertising hoardings. Messi did not get up and when he finally moved grabbed his right foot with both hands, visibly concerned.' While the La Liga top scorer did manage to play in El Clasico against Real Madrid, his impact was limited and the problem has since become more troublesome. AS also focus on the interest of England's top two clubs in bringing a young Spanish talent to the Barclays Premier League. Jose Luis Gaya is a 19-year-old left back playing for Valencia as part of the defence with the second-best record in La Liga this season. Manchester City and Chelsea target Jose Luis Gaya shields the ball from Fernando Torres for Valencia . Mundo Deportivo say Felipe Anderson is a target for Barcelona having also been linked to Manchester City . Gaya's rumoured £13.1million release clause could tempt Chelsea and Manchester City, who AS say are ready to bring in one of the up-and-coming stars of Spanish football although they face competition from Real Madrid. Mundo Deportivo also touch on Messi's late medical tests but their main story is on how Barcelona are keeping tabs on the top talent coming out of Serie A, with a particular focus on Lazio midfielder Felipe Anderson. The Barca-based paper say the La Liga leaders have been spying on Anderson's progress of late, while Manchester City are also known to hold an interest.

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has revealed how rejection as a young player has inspired him to give the likes of Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe their break in the first team. Rodgers failed to make it as a professional footballer despite leaving Northern Ireland for England at the age of 16 and training with the Reading youth team.

That hit me probably harder than it should have done. 'I felt that from that moment that I was probably never going to get the chance.'

"At last, some good news for Sunderland and Newcastle United — apparently form goes out of the window in a derby. Now isn’t that a relief? On Sunday afternoon, both sets of supporters will have the chance to suspend the depressing reality of their current plight. Over the course of their last six matches — 12 in total — the pair have amassed a not-so-mighty six points. During that same period — 18 hours of football, no less — they have scored four times between them, conceding 22 along the way. It is little wonder they have billed this one ‘The Desperation Derby’. Perhaps ‘The Donkey Derby’ would be more apt. John Carver issues instructions to his players during training on Friday ahead of Sunday's derby . Carver put his Newcastle players through their paces during the session at St James' Park . Dick Advocaat wraps up warm as he prepares his Sunderland side for Sunday's crunch clash . Sunderland are the country’s most out-of-form side and, unless new boss Dick Advocaat can reverse what is a sorry slide towards the bottom three, they will be back in the Championship come August. Newcastle won’t be, but therein lies the problem. It is job done on Tyneside. The Magpie mandate is survival and little more, a dispiriting acceptance of mediocrity which has permeated a squad in desperate need of overhaul, both in terms of quality and character. The same can be said of a Sunderland side who have won just four times all season. If it wasn’t for the history and intensity of the rivalry, this would have all the appeal of The Dog and Duck versus The Red Lion. Perhaps that is being disrespectful to pub teams, however. But, amid all of the gloom, the stakes remain sky high, albeit for different reasons. For Sunderland, it is about survival. Forget their bid for a record-making five straight victories over the enemy. Forget, even, bragging rights. Carver is fighting to secure his future as Newcastle manager beyond the end of this season . Advocaat was all smiles as he attempts to steer Sunderland clear of Premier League relegation . With trips to Arsenal and Chelsea to sign off their dismal season, this is one of six winnable matches which will determine their fate. Advocaat knows as much and hinted on Friday that he is working on a six-game rescue plan. Their last six have yielded just two points and one goal. Should that sad sequence persist then it will end in a future-defining demotion to the second tier. For never has relegation come at such a cost given the fulsome flow of the Premier League cash-cow. For Newcastle head coach John Carver, it’s about making a point. The outcome of this game will shape his future also. Lose, and the chances of him landing the job beyond the end of the season will take a serious hit. ‘I have stopped thinking about getting the job on a permanent basis, I really have, because if I keep worrying about everything that’s going on, if I keep worrying about everybody who has been linked with the job, then I won’t be giving this my 100 per cent, so I don’t even think about “permanent”,’ said Carver. ‘In my eyes, I am permanent. In the contract I signed there was nothing about “short term”, there was nothing about “interim”. I am the permanent manager and that’s my mindset on this, so I don’t even think about the summer.’ Newcastle are not in danger of relegation but their season has faded away in recent months . Jermain Defoe, who has scored twice since his return to England, trains with team-mates on Friday . Advocaat, meanwhile, will be gone come June, regardless of which division he leaves Sunderland in. To that end, his reputation is on the line. ‘If I didn’t think I could do it then I would have said “no”,’ said the 67-year-old, who has never been relegated, as a player or manager. ‘I need to give the players confidence. I need to be a little bit softer because of the position we’re in, but if they don’t do what I want then they won’t play. ‘The game against Aston Villa [4-0 home defeat] shows you that something is wrong. They will not play like that under me.’ History is at least on Advocaat’s side. By a quirk of footballing fate, his predecessors — Paolo di Canio and Gus Poyet — both won derbies in their second match in charge. ‘The pressure is on then, yes?’ laughed Advocaat. He may joke and dismiss such coincidence, but those victories both played a part in Sunderland avoiding relegation. Gabriel Obertan (left) closes in on Mehdi Abeid during Friday's training session at St James' Park . Tim Krul works on his handling as he prepares to keep Sunderland out in the Tyne-Weir derby on Sunday . And that is a recurring theme on Wearside — a tedious tale of an annual battle against the drop. At least that, however, offers some perverse excitement for supporters. Up the road at Newcastle, the club who returned profits of £18.7million last week are in debt to a fanbase which, mystifyingly, still exceeds 50,000 on a fortnightly basis. Anger has made way for apathy at Gallowgate, for fans have accepted that, as long as Mike Ashley remains in power, their lucrative existence — at least that is for the owner — resides somewhere between 17th and 10th. For the Toon Army, it is ‘The Derby of Disillusion’. Indeed, many supporters resent their own club as much as they do their rivals across the river. Throw in Jack Colback returning to the Stadium of Light for the first time since his defection to Newcastle, Sunderland’s Adam Johnson playing at home for the first time since his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl, as well as a ludicrous 4pm kick-off in the middle of a Bank Holiday weekend, and you feel that a potentially poisonous atmosphere awaits. But the good news is that form goes out of the window. We can only hope that much is true.","Newcastle travel to the Stadium of Light to face Sunderland  on Sunday .

"Former Huddersfield centre Josh Griffin scored a try and kicked three goals as improving Salford secured back-to-back Super League wins with an 18-12 triumph at the John Smith's Stadium. Griffin and Ben Jones-Bishop scored tries in the first half, although Jack Hughes gave the Giants hope. Carl Forster's try and Griffin's penalty made the game safe, though, despite the prolific Aaron Murphy's try setting up a tense finish. Salford Red Devils secured a second win in a row with a 18-12 victory at Huddersfield . Salford made a fast start and Cory Paterson had a try ruled out on 18 minutes. A Rangi Chase kick-through was fumbled by a Giants player in the in-goal area and Paterson pounced but referee James Child had already ruled it a knock-on and given the Red Devils a drop out. The game was twice delayed early on when Kevin Locke for Salford and Huddersfield's Brett Ferres were carried off injured. Griffin opened the scoring on 21 minutes when he pounced on a mistake by Huddersfield's Jermaine McGillvary. The winger seemed set to grab a grubber kick into the left corner by Jones-Bishop - but when he slipped in the in-goal area Griffin was there to score. He failed to convert but was on target 10 minutes later after Jones-Bishop took advantage of more slack defending. Rangi Chase kicked through straight from a scrum and Jones-Bishop got to the ball first despite several Giants players being better placed. Lacklustre Huddersfield, seeking a fifth straight win, woke up after that and were back in the contest on 38 minutes. On-loan Wigan forward Hughes went over from Jamie Ellis' pass after good work by Eorl Crabtree. There was a flare-up on half-time when Crabtree and Weller Hauraki came to blows after the Kiwi made a heavy tackle on the England international. Salford extended their 10-6 half-time lead on 55 minutes when Forster grabbed his first try of the season. Griffin, the older brother of fellow former Huddersfield player Darrell, who was on the bench for this match, converted. Hauraki was put on report on 62 minutes for a bad tackle which left Giants full-back Scott Grix needing treatment. Murphy then went over in the right corner on 76 minutes for his fourth try in as many games. Brough added the extras to leave the home side a converted try away from a late victory. But soon after they were punished for interfering with play and Griffin kicked the resulting penalty. Solid defending, including forcing Huddersfield to play out a set of six around their own 10-metre line, helped Salford see the game out.","Salford sealed consecutive Super League wins with victory at Huddersfield .

"Salford half-back Rangi Chase faces the threat of a four to eight-match ban after he was charged with making a Grade E dangerous throw on Good Friday. The Red Devils went on to beat Huddersfield 18-12 to continue their recent good form, but they could now be without their mercurial stand-off for a lengthy period. The Rugby Football League's match-review panel viewed Chase's tackle on Brett Ferres in the 15th minute of the match at the John Smith's Stadium as dangerous and he has been asked to appear before an independent disciplinary tribunal on Wednesday evening. Salford's Rangi Chase could face a ban of up to eight matches following a dangerous tackle . Chase will be joined at Red Hall by Salford team-mate Weller Hauraki, Widnes' Danny Tickle and Hull KR prop Mitch Allgood, who face Grade C, B and A charges respectively. Four other players - Widnes hooker Lloyd White, Warrington prop Anthony England, Hull KR back-rower Maurice Blair and Hull FC utility back Jordan Rankin - were also charged for offences in round eight and have until 11am on Wednesday to submit early-guilty pleas.

"Does any player fluctuate between world-beater and under-achiever more than Andros Townsend? Currently on a high after his stunning equaliser for England against Italy in Turin on Tuesday night, the 23-year-old Tottenham winger has already had more ups and downs than most players experience in their careers. On his day, Townsend stands in comparison with the very best. He terrifies defenders with his speed and directness – a trait he also possesses off the pitch judging by his 'told you so' tweet to a critical Paul Merson this week. That ability was first noticed two years ago when he single-handedly tried to save QPR from relegation with a string of virtuoso performances. Later in 2013, he turned in two of the great international displays of recent years when he destroyed Montenegro and Poland at Wembley to book England's place at the World Cup. Andros Townsend unleashes an unstoppable right-footed strike from 20 yards to score England's equaliser . The Tottenham and England winger celebrates his goal against Italy, which was his third for his country . His strike in Turin, measured at 77.2mph, was further evidence he belongs on the top table. 'We are indebted to Andros – he is a game-changer,' said England manager Roy Hodgson. And yet... How can a player with Townsend's obvious ability be sent out to nine different clubs on loan by Spurs. Why has he still not played a full 90 minutes for his club in the Premier League this season? How come in the autumn it was Townsend rather than Aaron Lennon who was seen as surplus to requirements at White Hart Lane? He has scored as many goals for England as he has done in the Premier League for Spurs. Wingers are by nature of their position more inconsistent than other players. If they are starved of service, they can appear ineffectual. And if they try too hard when they do get the ball, they can squander possession. And even by wingers' standards, Townsend is a risk-taker. It can make him look unstoppable at times and a waste of time at others. Hodgson admitted agonising about giving him a debut ahead of James Milner and Jack Wilshere against Montenegro 18 months ago, but he was man of the match and scored the important third goal in a 4-1 England victory. Townsend celebrates scoring England's third goal against Montenegro in a World Cup qualifier . Townsend as a pundit for ITV during the World Cup . Articulate and bright – his father Troy is a leading figure in football's anti-racism body Kick It Out – he was comfortable in the television studio as a pundit at last summer's World Cup when an ankle injury ruled him out of Hodgson's squad. Sometimes intelligence also means a determination to play the game your way, not always appreciated by managers obsessed by tactics. Townsend thrived with Harry Redknapp at QPR but it didn't look as if he fitted in under Mauricio Pochettino at Spurs. He started the season being used for Capital One Cup and Europa League games rather than the important Premier League stuff. Even now, if things aren't going well, the chances are Townsend will be sacrificed. At Old Trafford he was taken off after half an hour when Spurs were being beaten 2-0 by Manchester United. But he is starting games now ahead of £25million Erik Lamela with another rival, Lennon, loaned out to Everton. For his club, he has hit some rarefied heights, most notably a European game against Dynamo Tbilisi when he scored a goal and made two others. When Hodgson's squad was announced for the recent double-header against Lithuania and Italy, Merson claimed Townsend shouldn't have been included. The player had scored for The Three Lions against San Marino this season but missed the Slovenia and Scotland games with another ankle injury, another reason for his inconsistency. Following his equaliser, Townsend tweeted in response: 'Not bad for a player who should be 'nowhere near the squad''. He later added he hoped he had silenced his critics. Townsend looks dejected after his first-half substitution during Tottenham's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United . The truth is Townsend's style may be best suited to international football which after all is cup knockout when you get to the big tournaments. For the grind of a full Premier League season, you can't afford to have one thrilling moment followed by wasting possession or a wayward shot. The statistics back that up. He has scored three goals in seven games for England compared with three in 21 Premier League starts for Spurs. He will have to try to improve on that ratio when he dons his club shirt again at Burnley on Sunday. In that sense, you can understand why Hodgson will continue to pick him regardless of club form. He is, in the manger's words, a game-changer. Tottenham will be hoping that Townsend can replicate his international form for his club .","Andros Townsend scored England's equaliser against Italy on Tuesday .

"Warrington crashed to a third straight Super League defeat and could be in trouble with the Rugby Football League following crowd trouble in the Cheshire derby. The game was stopped for eight minutes after a flare was thrown from the stand housing visiting fans but Widnes maintained their focus to run out 30-10 winners and maintain their impressive form at the Select Security Stadium, where they have taken seven points out of a possible 10 this year. Warrington's losing run is their worst since 2009 and their misery was compounded by the loss of winger Matty Russell with a leg injury. Following a delay caused by a flare, Widnes condemned Warrington to a third defeat in a row . Widnes, hammered by Salford in their previous outing, were boosted by the return of influential captain Kevin Brown from a three-match absence with a hamstring injury and the Wolves had no answer to his half-back partnership with Joe Mellor. Yet Warrington could hardly have made a better start, with England forward Ben Westwood collecting a rebound from Gareth O'Brien's high kick to score the opening try after only five minutes. It was eight minutes before O'Brien could add the goal as the game was stopped to enable stewards to clear the flare from the pitch and remove the offenders. Once back under way, the game flowed from end to end but, while Widnes scrambled superbly to keep their line intact, the visitors' defence cracked three times as the Vikings found some real potency in their attack. Dangerous full-back Rhys Hanbury got centre Cameron Phelps through a gap for the first try on 10 minutes and, after Russell had hobbled off, his opposite number Stefan Marsh gathered Brown's pinpoint kick for the first of his brace of scores to give his side a lead they never looked like relinquishing. Widnes lost Phelps to injury on 29 minutes, which paved the way for 19-year-old Matt Whitley to make his debut, but they struck again three minutes before the break when Mellor's cut-out gave Marsh a clear run for his second try. Jack Owens managed just one conversion and also missed a long-range penalty attempt on the stroke of half-time but Widnes took only five minutes of the second half to extend their lead. A touchline dash from Owens created the position for hooker Lloyd White to burrow his way over from dummy half for the softest of tries. It went from bad to worse for the visitors when Westwood was sin-binned following the concession of three consecutive penalties by his team and the Vikings immediately took advantage of the extra man when Brown went through a gap for a fifth try. Owens converted both tries to make it 26-6 but Warrington pulled a try back on 64 minutes through makeshift centre Ben Currie after the home side were down to 12 men with Danny Tickle in the sin-bin for a foul on Daryl Clark. Widnes fittingly had the final say when Owens went over three minutes from the end for his side's sixth try.","Warrington slipped to their third straight defeat in the Super League .

"Wigan climbed up to third place in the First Utility Super League after exacting sweet revenge on arch-rivals St Helens for October's Grand-Final defeat. The Warriors came out on top 12-4 in a brutal, no-holds-barred contest in front of a spellbound capacity 24,054 crowd at the DW Stadium which contained just three tries but countless examples of rugby league at its finest. Defences reigned supreme and both sets of players were out on their feet long before the end of an absorbing Good Friday duel as the ferocious exchanges, on a glue-pot pitch, began to takes its toll. Wigan Warriors' Dom Manfredi (centre) celebrates with his team-mates after he scores his side's first try. It took a try from Sydney-bound winger Joe Burgess 10 minutes from the end to finally break the champions' resistance. It was a second successive defeat for Saints, who began the season under Keiron Cunningham with six wins in a row, but there was no shame in this loss. Cunningham was forced to turn to a new half-back pairing in Jordan Turner and Lance Hohaia after skipper Jon Wilkin joined Travis Burns on the injury list by pulling a hamstring in training while Paul Wellens, restored to the captaincy, limped off four minutes into the second half to prompt another re-shuffle, . Wigan could hardly have made a better start, with winger Dom Manfredi charging over for a try after just 52 seconds, reclaiming possession after Turner's attempted clearance kick was charged down by prop Lee Mossop. Wigan Warriors' Manfredi went over for the first try as his side exacted revenge over St Helens . Matty Smith kicked the goal to make it 6-0 and Saints had to scramble to prevent Manfredi and his centre Anthony Gelling adding to the Warriors' lead. Wigan were indebted to a terrific last-ditch by George Williams that brought down centre Josh Jones in full flight and, as the momentum shifted towards the visitors, it was no surprise when impressive forward Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook charged over for a try on 15 minutes. Tom Makinson, third choice marskman in the absence of Mark Percival and Burns, was unable to add the goal and Saints suffered a blow when boom second rower Joe Greenwood, just back from an elbow injury, limped off with an ankle problem. As the conditions deteriorated and fatigue set in, the game developed into a war of attrition in the second half with chances few and far between. Wigan Warriors' Manfredi (centre) is tackled by St Helens' Josh Jones (left) and James Roby . The impressive Manfredi was hauled down just short of the line while Saints loose forward Luke Thompson went close for the visitors. The key moment came 10 minutes from the end when Saints turned the ball over 20 metres out from their own line after being penned back by Wigan's tigerish tackling. Wigan substitute prop Ryan Sutton was held up on the line in the next set but the breakthrough came moments later when Burgess won the race to George Williams' grubber kick, touching the ball down with inches to spare. Ryan Hampshire kicked the conversion to put his side two scores in front and that completed the scoring in a pulsating encounter.","Wigan exact revenge on St Helens in Super League Grand-Final rematch .

"Reigning Man of Steel Daryl Clark will be aiming to sink his home-town club when Castleford visit struggling Warrington as part of a full First Utility Super League programme on Easter Monday. The England hooker left the Tigers at the end of last season and, despite the switch, he has kept a close eye on events at his old club. 'It was the only team I played for coming through as a youngster so it'll feel a bit different being on the other side,' said Clark, who is expected to recover from a busted nose sustained in Thursday's defeat at Widnes to maintain his ever-present record for the Wolves. 'I still look out for their results to see how they're going and I hope they do well. Daryl Clark is ready to take on his former team-mates at Castleford Tigers, his boyhood club . 'I've seen their games and highlights on TV and they're probably a bit like us. They've put a few good performances together and got some good wins but they've been poor in other games. 'I'm not too sure what the reception for me will be, I'll have to wait and see.' Warrington coach Tony Smith, who persuaded owner Simon Moran to fork out Â£185,000 to buy the hooker out of his contract with the Tigers last summer, believes the player deserves a good reception from the visiting fans. 'He was super for them, he gave everything he had,' Smith said. 'I don't think there should be any resentment towards him. 'He was going to be lost to that club any way and the coffers that were earned from him has probably allowed them to survive a bit longer and in a much better state than they would have been otherwise. Reigning Man of Steel Clark will lead the way for Warrington Wolves as they try to end a three game losing run . 'So they should be very grateful for his talent and hope that one day he comes home to them at the end of his career. But in the meantime I think he's got a bright future with us.' Warrington have won their last five home games against Castleford but they have dropped to seventh place after suffering a third consecutive defeat at Widnes, who have drawn the short straw over Easter with a trip to Perpignan as they seek a their first-ever win over Catalans Dragons. Vikings coach Denis Betts has made no apology for ringing the changes, as he rests a host of regulars, including skipper Kevin Brown, his half-back partner Joe Mellor and full-back Rhys Hanbury. 'It will be a completely different side,' Betts said. 'Three games in eight days is atrocious when you look at what we've gone through. What happens over this Easter period could affect us for 10 weeks. Flashback: Clark says he still keenly follows the fortunes of the Tigers and hopes they do well . 'I've got to use the squad and give others opportunities. Danny Craven and Tom Gilmore will play and Grant Gore will come into the side. It gives them an opportunity to show what they can do. 'We'll go over there with a load of desire and purpose. Those lads have known all week they're going to play.' Champions St Helens will also be much changed as they look to avoid a third successive defeat when Hull visit Langtree Park for the Steve Prescott Cup. Saints coach Keiron Cunningham has called up youngsters Jack Ashworth, Ricky Bailey, Olly Davies and Lewis Charnock after Paul Wellens and Joe Greenwood joined his side's lengthening injury list following the defeat at Wigan. Former Bradford full-back Curtis Naughton earns his first call-up for Hull, who also have former St Helens hooker Stuart Howarth in their squad. It is fourth against third at the AJ Bell Stadium where Salford will aim to continue their impressive run against a Wigan side on a high from their derby triumph over Saints. Salford, who are aiming to halt a 17-match losing run against the Warriors, are without full-back Kevin Locke after he was concussed in the win at Huddersfield, while Wigan coach Shaun Wane rests Joel Tomkins and Dom Manfredi and recalls Matty Bowen at full-back. Leeds expect to have skipper Kevin Sinfield back from a three-game absence in the top-versus- bottom clash against Wakefield, who are struggling to raise a team, according to coach James Webster. The Wildcats, who have not won at Headingley since 2007, were without 12 senior players for their recent game at Wigan and, although three returned for Thursday's home defeat by Catalans Dragons, their injury worries worsened, with centre Dean Collis among the latest casualties after undergoing emergency surgery for a ruptured testicle. 'We picked up another three or four injuries,' Webster said. 'Has a club ever not fielded a team? We're close to that situation. Monday's going to be a hard job for us, mentally and physically.' In Monday's other game, Hull KR hooker Shaun Lunt will face his parent club after Huddersfield raised no objections following his loan move to Craven Park.","Warrington Wolves host Castleford Tigers on Easter Monday .

"Brendan Rodgers has insisted that Raheem Sterling will be going nowhere this summer and that he is 'relaxed' about the star's stalled contract talks. The Liverpool manager was reacting after the 20-year-old admitted in a television interview that he is not yet ready to sign the new £100,000-a-week contract tabled by the club, fuelling speculation that he could leave Anfield this summer. But although Rodgers admitted the interview was conducted without the club's consent and 'surprised us all', he said Sterling was still young and 'sometimes makes mistakes'. He added that Liverpool were a 'superpower' in world football and didn't have to sell their star assets before saying that Sterling just has to 'concentrate on his football'.

And in his press briefing ahead of the Arsenal match, Rodgers said: 'The concentration a few weeks back was to purely focus on his football, and help him continue with his development at the place he’s made great strides over last couple of years. 'The last time we sat down with the player and his representatives that was the intention. 'Raheem has come out and made his feelings clear on that, and hopefully will continue to focus on his football until the end of the season. 'What he said absolutely underpins everything we’re trying to achieve here. Raheem says his ambition is to win trophies, and that’s perfectly aligned with what we’re trying to do.' Rodgers added: 'This is Liverpool, one of the great clubs of the football world. It is an honour for him to play at a club like Liverpool and he understands that.

Sterling trains alongside Brazilian Philippe Coutinho as the Liverpool team get ready for Saturday's match . 'I'm quite relaxed on it. It's part of the modern game. People who look after players have different ways of working. 'The focus is purely on the football.

'He's got a lot of improvement to do and this is the best place for him to do it. 'He's not going anywhere in the summer. The focus on trying to make him the best player we can.' When asked whether money talked in situations like this, Rodgers replied: 'This club has shown that’s not the case. Liverpool is one of the superpowers of football and the owners have made it clear and we’ve seen it before that money doesn’t come into it. 'If the club doesn’t want to sell it won’t sell. That’s that case with any player, Raheem or anybody else. 'It’s about continuing to nurture a young player so he can be consistently playing at the top if his game.

Rodgers did concede that the interview was carried out without the club's permission: 'There was no permission by the club, it was something that surprised us all.

Despite turning down the six-figure contract, described by Rodgers a few weeks ago as an 'incredible offer', Sterling insisted he is not a money-grabber. 'It's not about the money at all,' Sterling said. 'It's never been about money. I talk about winning trophies throughout my career. That's all I talk about. 'I don't talk about how many cars I'm going to drive, how many houses I've got. I just purely want to be the best I can be. Sterling denied he was a 'money-grabber' in the interview, saying he was only concerned about football . 'I don't want to be perceived as a money-grabbing 20-year-old. 'I try to kill it off, but I don't think the public can see it that way. 'I think they just see it as this 20-year-old boy being greedy. 'I just want to take the time to think about what I've achieved in my career so far, where I need to go and what I need to do to get better as a player. 'Everyone's dream growing up is seeing themselves in an away kit somewhere in a sunny country. But, in reality, I'm happy to be playing for Liverpool and trying to win trophies.'

"England ace Joe Hart labelled fellow goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon a 'legend of the game' after seeing the Italian veteran claim his 147th cap. Hart, who passed an impressive milestone of his own by representing his country for the 50th time on Tuesday night, said after the 1-1 draw with Italy that Buffon was an inspiration. Speaking to FA TV, Hart said: 'I’m still learning my game and I’m still watching the likes of Buffon and the way he goes about his business at 37 years old.

"The goals may have dried up at club level for Graziano Pelle but the Southampton striker repaid Italy coach Antonio Conte's faith by scoring against England. Having arrived from Feyenoord at a reported cost of £9million, the 29-year-old seamlessly slotted in at St Mary's, netting nine goals in his first 12 matches.

"Five staff members sustained serious injuries after taking a joy ride down 'the Super Slide' at the Sydney Royal Easter Show on Saturday night, despite the slide being closed after heavy rain made it too dangerous. It is understood a group of eight contracted workers broke into the 52-metre slide after it was closed earlier in the night due to fears the heavy rain would make the slide particularly slippery. Scroll down for video . Five staff members left the Royal Easter Show with serious injuries after taking a joy ride on the closed Super Slide . The Easter Show's chief operating officer Michael Collins told Fairfax the slide 'runs way too fast in the wet' and that's why it was closed as soon as the weather turned. It is reported the group were travelling at such great speeds that they were unable to stop and broke through the barricade at the bottom of the ride. A 22-year-old woman broke both her legs, a 60-year-old man suffered broken ribs and internal bleeding while a 23-year-old woman also broke her leg and a 33-year-old man possibly broke his arm. Three of the contractors escaped without injury. Officials closed the ride earlier that night after deciding heavy rain made the ride particularly dangerous . The 22-year old woman and the 60-year-old man required emergency medical treatment and were taken to Westmead Hospital, while the others sought treatment at Concord Hospital. The slide underwent a safety check Sunday morning and was cleared for use, as long as there wasn't another downpour. The thrill seekers were travelling at such great speeds they were unable to stop eventually running into a barricade at the bottom of the slide . Mr Collins said although he hopes the employees have a quick recovery, it was their disregard for safety instructions that got themselves into this situation. 'I want to reinforce the message that you should be abiding by directions, if the train station is closed, you don't climb over onto railway tracks, It is a shame that people have taken it upon themselves to do so on this occasion.'","Five staff members sustained injuries after breaking into the Super Slide .

"The Champions of England were smashed into submission at Stade Marcel Michelin on Saturday night, to further expose the vast gulf in clout between the Aviva Premiership clubs and their rich French rivals. This was a brutal mismatch and a shattering result, not just for the ambitious Saints but for the English game as a whole. Jim Mallinder’s men are imperious in domestic rugby — leading the league by 10 points — but they were simply obliterated by the formidable Top 14 giants. Clermont are nigh-on invincible at home and Northampton could do absolutely nothing to even fleetingly threaten their dominance in this raucous arena. Even in the brief moments when the Saints had the temerity to work up a head of steam and go through the phases, they were pounded back in the tackle and turned over time and time again. Clermont winger Noa Nakaitaci (right) scores his second try against Northampton . What unfolded was one-way carnage. France wing Noa Nakaitaci scoring two tries before half-time and Nick Abendanon, the ex-Bath and England full-back, capped a masterful display with a break-away try from 90 metres out. All the while, Brock James kept cranking up the points tally with supreme goal-kicking. Aside from the misery of being dumped out of the Champions Cup in such emphatic fashion, the concern for the Saints will be that this grim rout critically damages their confidence at a key stage of the season. For Northampton and England, there may also be worries over two leading forwards, as Courtney Lawes failed to reappear after half-time and Alex Corbisiero went off, apparently suffering pain in his right knee. Nick Abendanon of Clermont dives over to score a try at the Stade Marcel-Michelin . It was over as a contest long before half-time. There was a pronounced intensity deficit between the sides from the off, with Northampton losing the collisions and appearing somewhat sluggish in contrast to their fired up and energetic opponents. The procession began in the fifth minute when the Saints conceded an early scrum penalty. James landed his first shot at goal and the hosts were on their way. There was so much pressure from Clermont that it was just a matter of time before the Northampton defence was breached. Sure enough, the first try came in the 13th minute, as Fritz Lee blasted clear from a lineout on the right and he released Wesley Fofana. Abendanon cast his magic over the saints defence to inspire comprehensive victory . The France centre was tackled in the 22 by Lee Dickson, but the attack continued at a furious tempo and, when Nakaitaci carved inside off his left foot, he was half stopped, but managed to climb up off the turf, stretch and touch down. The try was confirmed by the TMO and converted by James. It didn’t help the Saints’ already bleak cause that they missed their first scoring chance. After Courtney Lawes had pinched a Clermont lineout throw, the visitors won a penalty but Stephen Myler was off target with the kick. James landed another penalty, then came the two-try barrage which buried Northampton’s hopes of a famous result. At the heart of the onslaught was Abendanon. First, his break laid the platform for Fofana to burst deep into enemy territory and after Napolioni Nalaga was tackled short of the line, the ball was switched right and James’ lofted pass sent Nakaitaci over for his second try. Northampton captain Dylan Hartley leads his team off the pitch after crushing defeat . James converted from a wide angle then two minutes before the break, the blitz continued. Jonathan Davies made ground in the centre, Fofana picked out Abendanon and he raced into space, drew the last defender and passed back inside for the home No 12 to charge clear and touch down. Once again, James added the extras and the Saints were sunk. After the break, James struck another penalty before Abendanon made his long-range dash to the line in the 55th minute, for another converted try. Eventually, with Julien Bonnaire in the sin-bin, Alex Waller crashed over to give Northampton something to show for all their desperate toil, but it was far too little, far too late. The horse had bolted. The game was up.","Northampton were 27-0 down at the break at the Stade Marcel-Michelin .

"She's a professional equestrienne and was happy to have a go at wheelchair rugby, a sport nicknamed 'murder ball', during last September's Invictus Games. Now Zara Tindall, 33, has turned her hand to barrel-pulling - and laughingly pretended to pull her 16st 6ft rugby player husband Mike along while striking a pose for the cameras. The moment came during a charity event to mark the end of personal trainer Rob Edmond's marathon barrel-roll from Perthshire to Wiltshire. Taking the strain: Zara straps herself into Mr Edmond's barrel-pulling harness . Pull! Zara pretends to move off while husband Mike beams from his perch on the barrel . Edmond, who set off nine days and 517 miles ago, rolled the whisky barrel for 12 hours a day, only stopping to sleep and take part in comedy gigs at pubs along the way. The Bell's Barrel of Laughs trek also saw Edmond, who was the personal trainer on ITV's The Biggest Loser, joined by comedians including Fred MacAulay, Mark Dolan and Rufus Hound. Actress Joanna Lumley launched the challenge at the Blair Athol Distillery last week, while Zara was at the finish line at the Tedworth House Help for Heroes recovery centre. Tindall, meanwhile, joined Edmond for the final leg of the challenge - running with the personal trainer as he approached the finish line. 'It was good,' said the 36-year-old afterwards. 'I would like to say that I did all the hard work but I just got the glory run in with him. All smiles: Zara, who gave Mr Edmond a hug as he arrived (right), certainly appeared to enjoy the experience . Good effort: Mr Edmond, centre, rolled the barrel 517 miles from Perthshire to Wiltshire . Joking around: Zara, who is working towards 2016's Olympic Games, struck a series of poses in the harness . Support: Zara had turned out to watch Mr Edmond and husband Mike cross the finish line . 'I think the most impressive thing about him is that he is just a bit of a joker and he was telling stories about putting deep heat on people's hats to make their eyes water. 'He was talking about keeping his mind entertained and having a laugh. The one thing you see with people who have been around the military is that when they are in adversity or a tough place they always know how to have a laugh and how to make time pass.' Edmond, whose fundraising drive was also supported by Marston's Pubs, added: 'It's been a monumental challenge but we've made it and the support has been fantastic. 'We can't thank the British public enough.' Tindall, who recently appeared in the Bear Grylls endurance show Mission Survive, praised the work of Help for Heroes, which is set to benefit from Edmond's feat. 'Tedworth House is a pretty impressive place and looks the bees knees, and it is great to see how the money helps,' he said. He also revealed that he hopes to take on some charity challenges of his own. 'I am always quite keen to do any sort of charity challenges now that I am retired,' he said. 'I am doing a quadrathlon later this year, which I am a little bit worried about. I have always enjoyed this type of challenge, so you never know.' Achievement: Mr Edmond, who managed to cover 60 miles a day, completed the feat in just nine days . Heavy: Mr Edmond ran the entire way and rolled the whisky barrel for up to 12 hours a day . Helping out: Mike Tindall ran the final few miles alongside Mr Edmond . Beneficiary: The money raised by Mr Edmond will be donated to Help for Heroes .","Zara and Mike Tindall were at a Help for Heroes event in Wiltshire .

"Manchester  City manager Manuel Pellegrini has admitted his club will have to buy young talent because the Academy's youngsters are not ready for first-team action. Liverpool star Raheem Sterling has already had his name linked with the defending Premier League champions after his contract stalemate at Anfield. Part of the pressure on City to land fresh young talent comes from FA chairman Greg Dyke's proposal to increase the quota of homegrown players to 12 in Premier League squads. Manuel Pellegrini doesn't believe his current crop of Academy players are up to joining Yaya Toure and Co . Manchester City keeper Joe Hart makes a save during training on Wednesday . Wilfried Bony is more likely to be joined by a young star such as Raheem Sterling than an Academy player . And, with the Blues having failed to produce any regular homegrown first team squad members since Micah Richards and Dedryck Boyata, Pellegrini admits the short-term answer to the need for the new talent does not lie within the squad. Pellegrini said: 'I think about the Academy, we must be patient. This club build all these things because young players are important. 'Maybe it's not so easy for young players, especially at big clubs, to play in the first team, with the professional squad. 'I'm sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the Academy, they will be part of the squad. 'But it's important to be patient, important to have years of working the same way. But you never know. Maybe some talented young players can do it before.' Pellegrini says he is sure the Academy will produce players worthy of his side but urges patience for now . Sterling (here with Brendan Rodgers) would fit the bill for City if his impasse with Liverpool isn't resolved . Sterling would obviously fit the bill and qualify as one of Dyke's homegrown quota if his impasse at Liverpool proves unsolvable. Pellegrini refused to comment directly about the Liverpool and England forward. But he said: 'I think it's important for big clubs to bring in the best players, that's the most important thing. 'If they're all good players, of course I agree with the quota. All the big leagues - especially the Premier League - need the best players to play.' City's need to add 'homegrown' or 'English' players to their squad has seen them linked with a host of top stars, including Arsenal's Jack Wilshere and Ross Barkley of Everton. Arsenal's Jack Wilshere, who's coming back from injury through the reserves, has attracted City's interest . Everton and England midfielder Ross Barkley is another 'homegrown' player to have caught their eye . The City manager is not in action until Monday when he takes his team to Crystal Palace and with Chelsea in an apparently commanding lead at the top, Pellegrini admits his side faces eight cup finals. He said: 'I hope we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end. We will see the way we play. I hope the way we finish against West Brom is the way we must continue. 'It is not easy to make a clear analysis because they play with one player less. I hope in these eight games we continue playing that way.'","Manuel Pellegrini said Man City's Academy players aren't up to standard .

"Pupils could face disruption to classes as teachers prepare to vote on a national walkout over pay and conditions. Tens of thousands of teachers could strike in the autumn, potentially causing temporary school closures. The National Union of Teachers is expected to call for a vote on industrial action this weekend over the prospect of looming funding cuts. Strike threat: Members of the National Union of Teachers is expected to call for a vote on industrial action this weekend, like the strike here in 2013 . The ballot of its 300,000 members would take place after the election, with strikes possible from September. The last time teachers across the country went on strike was in July, when 21 per cent of schools were forced to close – leaving parents having to pay for childcare or take a day off work. A motion to hold a ballot on strike action was announced yesterday at the NUT annual conference in Harrogate, with a debate expected tomorrow. Disruption: Tens of thousands of teachers could strike in the autumn, potentially causing temporary school closures . Members will be asked to consider funding shortages in schools, which the union said would lead to redundancies. NUT deputy general secretary Kevin Courtney said education will face a ‘terrible set of cuts’ if action is not taken. Last month, the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested schools could see cuts of up to 12 per cent over the next parliament.","National Union of Teachers expected to call for a vote on industrial action .

"Borussia Dortmund's Nuri Sahin claims Arsenal tried to lure him from the Bundesliga with a 'great bid' but the Turkey international didn't go because his family wanted to stay in Germany. The former Real Madrid and Liverpool midfielder, now back at Dortmund, attracted interest from the Gunners back in 2005 when he was playing in the under 17s. 'Arsenal wanted to sign me with a great bid. My family didn't want me to go England,' he told Ntvspor.

"Former Leeds and England coach Tony Smith admits he was shocked by Kevin Sinfield's decision to switch codes but, on reflection, believes it could be an inspired decision. Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Sinfield, who is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, told a news conference at Headingley he did not want to play against Rhinos and that the opportunity to spearhead Carnegie's bid for a Premiership return was too good to resist. Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season . Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012 . Warrington coach Tony Smith (left) speaks with fellow coaches Tony Rea and Brian McDermott . Smith, who was in charge of the Rhinos when Sinfield lifted the first of their six Super League titles in 2003, says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes. 'I was a bit shocked,' Smith said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to think about it. He's a champion player, he's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years. 'I'm sad to lose him to that other code. However, I could understand the rationale. If it's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - I can see why he's made that change. 'I think he'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club. It's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues. 'He'll still have his bumps and bruises, but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it, I can't blame him.' Sinfield, whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as England captain Jamie Peacock revealed he would be leaving Leeds at the end of the season to become football manager at Hull KR, has missed Leeds' last two games through injury and, according to Smith, is probably stepping down at the right time. Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final . Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year . 'I think it's fantastic to make that decision to bow out of Super League probably at the right time,' Smith added. 'You can't keep playing forever and, when those young guys come snapping at your heels, it's hard to keep them at bay at some stage. 'You have to bite the bullet and step aside and I'd say the time is probably right. I'm no expert on when other people should retire but I'm pleased for Kevin and he'll certainly give everything he's got to his new employers. 'That's how he's been in rugby league and I've got no reason to think it'll be any different.' Sinfield has never played rugby union but already identified a role for himself in his new sport as he follows in the footsteps of Jason Robinson, Andy Farrell and Sam Burgess. 'Ideally I'd like to play fly-half,' Sinfield said. 'It's the position that suits the skill set I have the best. Sinfield and his Leeds team-mates celebrate after beating Melbourne Storm in the 2008 World Club Challenge . 'I understand the challenge that's in front of me and the difficulties rugby league players have faced crossing over. That's why I think I'm in the best possible place to help with that transition. 'Playing union is something I've always wanted to do. I didn't want to end my career and have regrets about missed opportunities. When this opportunity came up I knew it was the right thing. 'I'm excited by it. I know the potential at the club and it's something I'd like to be a part of. 'I'm very respectful of the game and I like watching it. I think a lot of rugby league people look down on rugby union, and I think a lot of rugby union people look down on rugby league. But I like both games. As a sportsman, to get the opportunity to play another professional sport is something that really appeals to me.'","Kevin Sinfield has announced he is leaving Leeds at the end of the season .

"An unknown man's theft of a Texas neighborhood's wild peacock was caught on camera by surveillance video as he roughly handled the beautiful bird. Residents of Beckley Club Estates in Dallas, Texas, say that they saw a man approach a male peacock, who was in the middle of its mating ritual and had unfurled its full plumage, before quickly snatching him up on Saturday. Footage from the home of Lisa Solis shows the thief grab the animal by both its claws before shoving him in his black SUV around 7pm. Residents of a Dallas neighborhood saw a man approach a male peacock, who was in the middle of its mating ritual and had unfurled its full plumage, before quickly snatching him up on Saturday . The man is seen bending down and picking up the bird by its claws before shoving it into his black Chevy Tahoe with its feathers sticking out of the door . Solis's neighbor Tisha Crear said she saw the event, and rushed out of the house and yelled at the man, but could only watch as he drove off with half of the peacock's feathers hanging out of the door. Ms Crear said that she had heard peahens screaming before the incident when the bird, the largest and oldest male peacock of those that live in the subdivision, was stolen, according to NBC Dallas. Ms Solid called the theft and aggressive treatment of the bird animal cruelty. 'Do I need to sit on the porch with a shotgun or what do I have to do? Because we are going to protect the peacocks,' Ms Crear said, holding a feather from the stolen bird. Residents of the neighborhood, where peacocks have lived for the past 20 years, filed a report to the police about the missing animal . Surveillance video also shows the black Chevy Tahoe driver stalking the birds for 20 minutes before he grabbed his target. The suspect is described as a Hispanic man who was wearing shorts, a white shirt and a baseball cap. Peacocks have lived in the neighborhood for 20 years, according to the Dallas Morning News. Residents, who have reported the incident to police, are also worried about the birds' long term survival if the peacock patriarch is not able to return and fertilize eggs. Neighbors have previously organized to protect the animals following one resident's complaint.","Residents of  Beckley Club Estates  saw man steal bird on Saturday .

"These hilarious images show the moment a frisky tortoise scupper his chances while trying to mate with a female. Clearly in the mood for love, the aroused reptile is seen beginning its painstakingly slow ascent on to the back of a female's shell. But instead of getting lucky, the blundering tortoise somehow manages to lose its balance, sending it toppling over onto its back. The moment things go south: The loved up male tortoise is seen here teetering before he falls on the ground . Shell we just leave it then? He gets no second chances and after failing to impress his mate and she leaves . Talk about lying down on the job -the poor fella looked positively 'shell-shocked' as it found itself on its back unable to get up. The amusing moment was caught on camera, by Ukranian photographer, Vadym Shevchenko, 34, at Kiev Zoo. And it seems the female tortoise wasn't willing to wait around as she was pictured leaving the clumsy Casanova on its back, in the mud. And to add insult to injury, he then had to spend a whole fifteen minutes desperately crawling across the grass of its enclosure before finally getting up. Vadym said: 'The tortoise seemed very eager to make his way over to the female, he was still incredibly slow but it was clear he had a purpose. 'Watching the tortoise attempt to mount the female was almost painful to watch, it took him so long, but we were all sort of curious to see what would happen. The tortoise casanovca made painfully slow progress in getting into position with his mate in the first place . Photographer Vadym Shevchenko said the tortoise seemed very determined even if he was unsuccessful . 'It looked about ready to start but then lost its balance when the female moved, which sent it it rolling onto its back, it really was very funny. 'It landed in a patch of mud behind him and its arms and legs were kicking quite frantically.

Videoed enjoying the sunshine outside, the lamb named Winter stands very still with its head lowered towards the baby duck. Walking around to the front of the lamb, the duck begins pecking away at the lamb's head and neck as if grooming its woollen coat.

However, the building fell into disrepair in the years following the end of the Cold War, but now it has been converted into a contemporary luxury home, complete with a swimming pool, a stunning atrium and a magnificent glass staircase. The property, known as the Glass House, has now been put on the market for £3.5million and also boasts five bedrooms, a stylish kitchen, games room and outside roof terrace.

"Comments: Veteran broadcaster Peter Alliss has sparked controversy by claiming gender equality laws have backfired and ‘b*****ed up the game’ Veteran broadcaster Peter Alliss has sparked controversy by claiming gender equality laws have backfired and ‘b*****ed up the game’. Alliss, 84, has said that legislation designed to stop golf clubs from discriminating against female members has instead prompted a decline in women’s membership. Some clubs had previously only allowed female members if they played at restricted times in return for a discounted membership fee. But the Equality Act 2010, drafted by the previous Labour government, ruled that this was illegal discrimination, which means that women must now have equal access to the course – and pay the same membership rates as men. Mr Alliss, a former professional who is one of the game’s most decorated players, claimed that tens of thousands of members of the Ladies’ Golf Union have deserted the organisation since the rules came into force. ‘I’m told the Ladies’ Golf Union has lost 150,000 members since equality for women came in,’ Mr Alliss told the Radio Times. ‘Hundreds of women have left golf clubs because they’ve gone from paying half fare to full fare. It’s caused mayhem.’ He added: ‘Equality for women: A few people battled away to get it, they got it, and they have buggered up the game for a lot of people.’ But Sam Burton, finance director at the Ladies’ Golf Union, said there has only been a decline of 30,000 women since the law came into force, taking membership down to 159,000 by last year. Mrs Burton said: ‘It’s not good that ladies golf is declining and we have to look at it, but I don’t think it’s the equalities legislation that is to blame. Golf has been dominated by men and we are always going to be the minority in any club that is mixed. But on the whole golf is becoming much more equal.’ Rant: He added: ‘Equality for women: A few people battled away to get it, they got it, and they have buggered up the game for a lot of people.’ She suggested that possible reasons why golf was not as popular among women included the fact that it was quite an expensive activity and that other sports such as cycling ‘have been marketed more successfully at women’. She added: ‘In 2015 we have to encourage equality and I certainly wouldn’t be a member at a club where I was treated differently just because I was a woman. ‘I think a lot of ladies would feel the same in this day and age.’ However, Tory MP Philip Davies said he agreed with Mr Alliss, adding: ‘This is the consequence of all the legislation. The equality fanatics can’t pick and choose – they either want full equality or they don’t. If they want full equality then they are going to have to pay the same price as everybody else. ‘I don’t suppose [Mr Alliss’s] view is outdated. His view is a factual view to be perfectly honest. He is looking at the practicalities of it.’ The Equality Act applies to clubs with mixed memberships. Male-only golf clubs are still legal. Mr Alliss became a professional golfer in 1947, represented Britain in the Ryder Cup eight times and won 21 tournaments in his career. He began working for the BBC in 1961.","Peter Alliss says anti-discrimination laws have caused membership fall .

"Winning the league championship used to be the ultimate achievement for any manager and make him bombproof for many years to come. That's not the case today. Incredibly, the last four mangers to have won the Premier League have all left their jobs by the following year – three sacked and one retired. And on the latest evidence, it will be no surprise if Manuel Pellegrini becomes number five this summer. A dejected Manuel Pellegrini following Manchester City's 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday night . Pellegrini guided City to their second Premier League title in three seasons back in May . But Pellegrini's City side were humbled at Selhurst Park on Monday to kill off any remaining title hopes . City sit fourth after the defeat, nine points adrift of leaders Chelsea, who retain a game in hand . WIN THE LEAGUE..AND THEN OUT . JOSE MOURINHO (CHELSEA) Won Premier League in 2006; sacked 2007 . Jose Mourinho ended Chelsea's 50-year wait to be champions by winning the Premier League in his first season 2004/05, and then retained the trophy the following season. But as his reputation soared, his relationship with owner Roman Abramovich soured and he left in September 2007 despite having three years left on his contract. Despite domestic success, Abramovich craved the Champions League and had become frustrated with the team's defensive style. For his part, Mourinho felt belittled by having players signed on Abramovich's say-so, most notably Andriy Shevchenko who was a declining force. Mourinho celebrates winning back-to-back Premier League titles with Chelsea in 2006 . Mourinho departed Stamford Bridge the following year, despite having three years left on his contract . CARLO ANCELOTTI (CHELSEA) Won PL in 2010; sacked 2011 . Carlo Ancelotti led Chelsea to their first league and FA Cup Double in his first season, scoring a record number of goals that still stands today. However, he failed to win a trophy in his second season and that was enough for Abramovich to pull the trigger despite finishing second in the table. Ancelotti knew the game was up as he puffed on a cigarette and chatted to David Moyes after Chelsea had lost the final game of the season 1-0 at Everton. The Italian bounced back to win the Champions League with Real Madrid last season and will be among the contenders for the City job should Pellegrini leave. Carlo Ancelotti celebrates with the Premier League trophy after Chelsea secured the title in 2010 . Ancelotti departed Stamford Bridge a year later after failing to win silverware in his second season . ROBERTO MANCINI (MANCHESTER CITY) Won PL in 2012; sacked 2013 . Mancini ended City's 44-year wait for the league title when Sergio Aguero scored against QPR on the final minute of the final day of the season. Yet his controversial approach led to him falling out with Carlos Tevez and Mario Balotelli, and criticising Adam Johnson and Joe Hart, and when City failed to win a trophy the following season and failed in the Champions League, the Italian was out. His demise was widely reported on the morning of the FA Cup Final against Wigan Athletic. City fans chanted Mancini's name but they lost the final and he was dismissed the following week.

Ferguson won a record 13th title and walked away into the sunset after the final game of the season, a remarkable 5-5 draw at West Brom. The United boss said later he had wanted to retire the previous season but City's title win persuaded him to carry on for another year and wrestle the trophy back – which he did. Ferguson helped pick David Moyes as his successor but he grew disillusioned with his fellow Scot after Moyes got rid of his assistant Mike Phelan and built a team around Wayne Rooney.

MailOnline ran a story on April Fools' Day stating that prior to Arsenal's clash with Liverpool at the Emirates, both pre-match teamtalks by captains Per Mertesacker and Jordan Henderson would be streamed live to the world. The story was of course a hoax but it still managed to create plenty of confusion for Wenger and the assembled press at Thursday's media gathering.

Wenger turns to an Arsenal official off camera after he is quizzed about Per Mertesacker's 'live' team talk . Wenger is informed that the story was an April Fools' joke and no basis of truth to it . The Gunners boss and the assembled media break into a fit of laughter following the revelation . 'Per Mertsacker this week is going to give a team talk live around the world,' asked the journalist. 'Is that not the case now before this game?' The bewildered Gunners boss then turns to his press officer off camera who tells Wenger: 'I think that's an April Fools' joke'. 'Ah, I do apologise,' the journalist replies prompting Wenger and the assembled press to collapse into a fit of laughter.

The 51-year-old also revealed he was considering staging an open forum for the club's supporters. 'I might get 50 supporters to come down, have an open forum and through (club chairman) Andrew Jenkins they can have half an hour with the players.

"A football fan is facing a three-year ban after running topless onto a pitch and performing a series of somersaults during his first ever game at the stadium. Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion at Reading's Madejski Stadium during the team's FA Cup quarter final replay with Bradford City last month. The Reading supporter, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch, landing on his back each time, before being tackled by stewards. Charlie Sumner, 20, staged a one-man pitch invasion at Reading's Madejski Stadium during their quarter final replay with Bradford City last month (pictured) The Reading supporter, whose team were 3-0 up at the time, did four front flips on the pitch, landing on his back each time . Sumner - who said going to his first game was a 'brilliant experience' - is now facing a potential three-year ban for carrying out the stunt. The order, due to be decided on April 30, would stop him going to all Reading's future home and away matches. Sumner, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said he has no regrets about the incident, saying that he had done it for 'laugh' and that his family had 'seen the funny side'. Speaking outside court, he said: 'After doing it and seeing good comments and messages, even from the away fans, I don't look back and regret it. 'Obviously I wouldn't inform other people to do it. It was just spur of the moment. It's good to see good feedback and not negative feedback. 'I'd had a few drinks, I was happy and Reading were winning and I just went for it and had a laugh. It was brilliant.' Asked whether he goes to many Reading matches, he added: 'That was my first game actually. It was a good experience. Obviously being there on the first game - not after what I've done, but standing in the stadium, watching the game from the stadium - it's a brilliant experience. 'Obviously with the ban, I wouldn't be able to experience that experience again.' Charlie Sumner, pictured outside Reading Magistrates' Court. He is facing a potential banning order . After running onto the pitch, Sumner was tackled by stewards. The footage of Sumner's antics went viral . The incident took place on March 16, when the match was being broadcast live to millions of viewers on BBC One. Afterwards, footage of Sumner's antics also went viral on the internet. Sumner, who went to the match with a group of eight friends, said he talked with his friends in a taxi on the way to the match about potentially running on to the pitch. 'I did say no at first. Then Reading were winning and I got a bit excited,' he said. 'I went to rave on Friday and there's another video on Facebook and I'm doing flips there. I've had a few selfies, a few drinks bought for me.' Sumner said he spoke to friends on the way to the stadium about carrying out the stunt. He said he had no regrets and that his family had seen 'the funny side' But Sumner, who works as a dry liner fixing ceilings, said he thought a potential football banning order 'seemed a bit much.' 'I don't want a three year ban because obviously it's quite a bit,' he said. 'I'm not encouraging people do it and if I go to another game, I'm not going to do it again.' At today's hearing, Sumner's solicitor entered a guilty plea on his client's behalf to one count of going on to a playing area at a football match under the Football Offences Act 1991. Sumner, who was at court but missed his hearing after leaving the building briefly, was released on bail with conditions that he does not attend Reading's home or away matches. He will appear at Reading Magistrates' Court on April 30 when a decision will be made on whether he receives a football banning order.","Charlie Sumner, 20, invaded pitch at Reading's Madejski Stadium in March .

'There are a lot of what we call 'English weeks' in Germany - where you play twice, and there's no winter break either,' he said. 'It's demanding because you don't have many breaks to recover, but as a footballer it's great to have so many games and I'm the sort of player who prefers playing in many matches - that's why I fit perfectly here.'

"Lionel Messi should be fit to play in Barcelona's La Liga game at Celta Vigo on Sunday despite a scare over a possible foot injury, centre back Gerard Pique said on Wednesday. Messi, the top scorer in La Liga, did not feature in either of Argentina's friendlies during the international break after sustaining a blow to his right foot in last month's 'Clasico' against Real Madrid. 'I am optimistic about Messi, I have spoken to him,' Pique told reporters at a promotional event. Lionel Messi (right) should be available for Barcelona's trip to Celta Vigo, according to Gerard Pique . 'I think that he can play at Balaidos (Celta's stadium),' added the Spain international, who came through Barca's youth academy with Messi. 'In the end it is up to how he feels during the rest of the week. The medical staff are those who should decide. My feeling is that he will play.' Barca's 2-1 win at home to Real stretched their lead over their arch rivals at the top of La Liga to four points with 10 games left. Second-placed Real, who host Granada on Sunday, have stuttered in recent weeks and the 2-1 defeat at the Nou Camp was their third loss in their last four outings in all competitions. Messi (left) is slightly doubtful after suffering a foot injury in Barcelona's 2-1 win over Real Madrid last month . Barca, by contrast, are on a seven-match winning run and in with a chance of repeating 2009's unprecedented treble of Champions League and Spanish league and Cup after failing to secure major silverware last term for the first time in six years. They play Paris Saint-Germain in the quarter-finals of Europe's elite club competition and are through to May's King's Cup final against Athletic Bilbao. 'We know it is going to be very hard and we will have to be at a high level if we want to win the titles,' Pique said. 'We have the team and we have demonstrated an improvement over the past year, the level has been rising and has given us a lot of confidence.' The forward didn't feature in either of Argentina's recent friendlies against El Salvador or Ecuador .","Lionel Messi didn't feature in either of Argentina's recent friendlies .

"FIFA has announced that Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has returned a £16,000 watch he was given as a gift. Dyke was given one of a limited edition of Parmigiani watches by the Brazilian FA during a FIFA Congress meeting in Sao Paulo during the World Cup - with 65 handed out in goodie bags totalling more than £1million. When the watches were recalled, Dyke initially refused to hand his back having promised to donate it to the FA's official charity partner, Breast Cancer Care, so that it could be auctioned.

But, with the threat of sanctions if he did not return the watch, FIFA's ethics committee has confirmed receipt of the item and has now closed proceedings on the matter. 'Mr Greg Dyke has returned the CBF Parmigiani watch. As a consequence, the adjudicatory chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee has decided to close the proceedings in respect of a possible breach of the FIFA Code of Ethics,' the FIFA statement, issued on Tuesday afternoon, read. Dyke insisted he was unaware of the value of the gift when he first received it and, once made aware, said he would allow it to be auctioned for Breast Cancer Care, the official charity partner of the FA - who are looking to raise £500,000 for their cause before next summer. After six months of legal wrangling Dyke has now relented and the item has been returned, whilst it is understood all of the watches will now be auctioned for a Brazilian charity and that Dyke will make a personal donation to Breast Cancer Care.

"Tyler Walker is a player who could form Nottingham Forest’s attack for years to come, according to manager Dougie Freedman. The 18-year-old striker came off the bench to score an impressive first goal of his senior career at Brentford on East Monday. It took him level with a Forest legend of the same surname: his dad Des, a scorer just once in 408 games for the club. Tyler Walker celebrates after scoring his first senior goal for Nottingham Forest away to Brentford . A source of mirth around the dinner table? Quite probably, although the younger Walker still has some way to go to match his father’s feats. He has managed just 56 minutes in his fledgling career so far, a distance from the 858 senior games, including 59 England caps, of Des. Still, the game is about goals… . True, and Walker Junior’s was a peach, controlling a high ball in an instant, shimmying past a defender, and rifling a left-foot shot into the net. It was curiously similar to his old man’s only goal, coming on New Year’s Day 1992 against Luton. He too smashed in an angled shot with his left. The younger Walker could already have passed his tally had he done better than skew wide a glorious chance at Griffin Park. The 18-year-old attacker is son of former England and Nottingham Forest defender Des Walker . He seems the real deal though, not just daddy’s boy made good through connections? That paternal link may have helped initially but since entering the Forest academy Tyler has proved his pedigree. He began the season in Jack Lester's Under-18 squad, and made a sizeable impression in January by firing a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion in the FA Youth Cup fourth round. He progressed to Forest’s Under-21s and scored seven goals in 13 starts, leading Freedman to take notice and offer a chance following injuries to Britt Assombalonga, Matty Fryatt and Dexter Blackstock. Walker made his debut in the final minute of Forest’s 2-0 win over Rotherham on March 18, at the same age his dad did under Brian Clough 31 years earlier. Walker scored a goal of the highest quality as he twisted and turned before firing past David Button . Freedman presumably knows a good striker when he finds one… . The Forest manager is a huge fan of the teenager, hyping him up rather than playing things down. ‘I believe he can play for the club for a very long time and make the striker's role his in the very near future,’ Freedman said after the draw against Brentford. ‘I am pleased to stand here and say, “You have a wonderful young asset at the football club who is only going to get better”. ‘The biggest advantage is that he is a very well-rounded, level-headed boy that turns up every day and works hard. If he has that mindset then you have a chance.’ What are his attributes? As displayed by his goal, Walker is two-footed and possesses good balance. He is quick, an intelligent runner, and a smart finisher. He also has a striker’s mentality. As part of the FA Youth Cup hat-trick he won an argument with team-mate Gerry McDonagh over who would take a penalty, going on to score. The youngest is highly thought of by Forest boss Dougie Freedman, who believes he has a big future .","Tyler Walker came off the bench to score his first goal against Brentford .

"Veteran BBC commentator Peter Alliss has said that the corporation should have tried harder to win the rights to the Open Championship and that attempts to give women equal rights in golf have 'caused mayhem'. Recent legislation has given women more rights in golf clubs, while St Andrews and Royal St George's have both voted to admit female members for the first time. But Alliss told the Radio Times magazine that equality for women had 'b******* up the game for a lot of people'. Veteran broadcaster Peter Alliss (second right) claimed gender equality laws have ‘b*****ed up the game’ The commentator also claimed the BBC should have done more to secure the Open coverage . 'There's been a hell of a row because four golf courses that hold the Open Championship didn't have women members,' he said. 'I'm told the Ladies Golf Union has lost 150,000 members since equality for women came in. Hundreds of women have left golf clubs because they've gone from paying half fare to full fare. It's caused mayhem. 'All of the wives of members at these clubs could have used the facilities for free. When I was at Muirfield a couple of years ago talking to a few of the lady members, I said, ""What about this equality? You must be happy about that?"" ""God no,"" they said. ""We can come here and do what we like, we can play golf and don't pay anything"".' He added: 'The equality thing is a great part of golf. Equality for women: a few people battled away to get it, they got it, and they have b******* up the game for a lot of people.' Alliss' comments come as the 2016 Open Championship will be the last to be broadcast live on the BBC before Sky Sports takes over. The former professional golfer, 84, told the magazine: 'I very much regret that the BBC has lost the Open Championship, but I said it might do 10 years ago.' He admitted that the BBC could not compete with Sky's deep pockets but added: 'I don't think there were enough people at the BBC dealing with the negotiations who cared enough. 'I can think of a couple of heads of sport from years ago who would have battled harder. But, having said that, when people get used to it I think the highlights will be wonderfully supported.' Alliss defended his style from critics, saying: 'I think they just don't like my delivery. They either think I waffle on, or don't know enough about the young players coming up. '""You're living in the past! You're one of the old Colonel Blimp school: must wear a tie to go and have a pee in the clubhouse."" That sort of thing. 'I think I've moved very well with the times. But there are certain standards in golf that have been there forever.' The Broadcaster insisted he could not work for Sky . He said that he could not imagine working for Sky. 'They never asked me. I was a BBC man through-and-through and they paid me well enough,' he said. 'I think Sky is magnificent and if you like golf it's amazing, but they do it differently. The presenters look different. If I went to Sky the best I could do is sit in the studio or have a pre-tournament ramble about the players.' Alliss added: 'I was watching golf from Dubai a couple of weeks ago. It is a masterpiece, one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World. Every skyscraper is different. And in the middle of the desert they have created a golfing oasis. 'Not once in over four hours did the commentator say, 'What an amazing place this is'. You hoped the camera would pan round, lift up from the course. I would have said something daft like, 'If you've got very good eyesight, you might just see Lawrence of Arabia over that hill'.' He said that he had 'thought about leaving' the BBC. 'I've got problems getting about but the brain is still sharp enough,' he added. 'When I don't think it's sharp enough, I shall say I'm off. The BBC keep saying to me, 'Stay as long as you like.' 'It's lovely nonsense. What if I live to be 105? They'll only keep me as long as I'm all right, and I'll only stay as long as I'm all right,' he said.","BBC commentator Peter Alliss hits out at new equality rules .

"David Luiz could be a doubt for Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League clash with Barcelona after picking up a hamstring injury on Sunday. The Brazilian defender went off after 35 minutes of PSG's 3-2 win over Marseille after suffering an injjury to his left leg. Shortly after his side had fallen behind in their top of the table clash,the Brazilian was running away from a Marseille player, before being caught by a stray leg. David Luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays, but one such run led to his injury . The Brazilian defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced . The former-Chelsea defender attempted to continue breaking forward, but pulled up sharply holding his hamstring a couple of yards later. The club's official English Twitter account confirmed it was a muscle pull, tweeting: '@DavidLuiz_4 crumples to the floor with a hamstring pull #OMPSG' Reports suggest the 27-year-old will have scans on Monday to assess the extent of the injury. If it is serious as suggested then Luiz will surely be a doubt for PSG's upcoming games with Saint-Etienne, Bastia and Barcelona, whom the French side face in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on April 15. in his absence the French champions looked less than assured, conceding a second poor goal just a few minutes after Luiz departed, but they rallied to win the game and return to the top of the table with a better second-half display. Luiz limped off, and could now be a doubt for the Champions league quarter-final against Barcelona .

But on Tuesday evening his brother Tobias received a call from John saying he had would be visiting in the coming weeks, reports Stuff NZ. John Daniel Tohill, 37, made contact with his family this week for the first time since 2005 . Over the years his family has hired investigators and police, but because he was an adult and had disappeared without notice before there was little incentive for police to appeal to the public for information. The family learned that John had never left the country, had no savings and did not possess a driver's licence. But after a call out for public sightings of him, John called his brother on Tuesday. 'It's pretty amazing,' Tobias said. 'He wanted to keep to himself all this time.' He was reportedly alerted to the search by a colleague who showed him the story on Stuff NZ. Tobias said his brother offered little explanation to his disappearance. John's brother Tobias (pictured) received a call from John saying he had would be visiting them in coming weeks . 'He is happy. He sounds well. He sounds like his is in a good way. We were very happy to hear from him.'

"A photographer has described the horror of being left almost completely blind in one eye by her contact lens. Lucy Garrod, now 27, developed an ulcer known as a corneal abrasion, caused by a bacterial infection which grew under her right lens. Miss Garrod had been wearing contact lenses since she was 15 with no problems, but woke up one day with an itchy and irritable right eye. Lucy Garrod, 27, was left partially blind in her right eye after bacteria began growing underneath her contact lens, causing an ulcer known as a corneal abrasion . Miss Garrod had worn contact lenses for 12 years with no problem, but woke up one morning feeling as though her eye was 'the size of a golf ball' Miss Garrod feared she would not be able to carry on with her photography degree due to going partially blind in one eye. But she learned to take photographs with her left eye and passed with first class honours . She said it felt like it had swollen to the size of a golf ball, and rushed to see her GP, who prescribed drops. A few days later her eye was still swollen and bloodshot so she went to hospital, where tests revealed the corneal abrasion. Doctors said the ulcer was growing on the surface of her eye, millimetres away from permanently blinding her. She spent a week in hospital, where medics broke the news that she was still partially blind. As a result, she feared she would not be able to complete the last year of her photography degree. Determined not to give up, she taught herself how to take photographs with her left eye, and passed her degree with first class honours. Fortunately, laser eye surgery was later able to restore her sight. Miss Garrod, a freelance photographer living in London, said: 'That day I'd put my lenses in late that morning, but by 4pm my eye was aching. 'It was itchy and usually if you rub it, it was okay. 'But that day I had a sharp shooting pain, the worst I'd ever experienced. 'Two hours later I took my lenses out and removed my make-up, thinking it might be irritating my eye, but there was no relief. Corneal abrasions are a small scratch on the cornea, the clear window at the front of the eye. They are generally a result of injury to the surface of the eye. Common causes include a fingernail scratching the eye, walking into something, and getting grit in the eye, particularly if the eye is then rubbed. It can also be caused by certain eye conditions, including trachoma, a bacterial infection. Injuries can also be caused by contact lens being put in and removed from the eye. Abrasions are very painful because there are many nerves that supply the cornea. The pain gets better as your eye heals, but this can take between 24 and 48 hours. If the abrasion involves the central part of your cornea, your vision could also be temporarily affected. Apart from the pain, your eye might be watery, red and sensitive to light. If your eye becomes increasingly red or painful after treatment or your sight becomes much more blurred, see an eye doctor again or contact the hospital. Source: Moorfields Eye Hospital . 'I could close my eye and thought that might take the pain away but it didn't and straining gave me a headache. 'I was awake most of the night.' The next morning Miss Garrod, who is originally from Jersey, looked in the mirror and found her eye was swollen. She said: 'It felt like size of a golf ball. 'My GP said I could have conjunctivitis but I'd had it before. 'It made my eye itchy but this felt worse, painful.' She was given eye drops, which she used for a couple of days until the pain got worse and she went to Beckenham Hospital, where she was given cream to soothe her eyes. However, just two days later her eye was so bloodshot she went back to hospital. Tests showed she had a corneal abrasion, an ulcer on her eye, caused by bacteria getting under her lens. Because her eye was so sensitive she spent a week in a dark room, a nurse coming in every half an hour, 24 hours a day, to give her eyes drops. 'The pain was under control but I was so bored,' she recalled. Next, doctors broke the news that she had lost sight in her right eye, due to the ulcer's position. She said: 'The good news was if the ulcer had been millimetres over I would have lost my sight completely. 'As it was slightly off centre, I would be left partially sighted in that eye. 'But I'd got used to that. My vision had been blurred since my eye first itched.' Miss Garrod was terrified she might not be able to complete the second and third years of her photography degree at Bournemouth University. After she was discharged from hospital she had to learn to use her left eye to take pictures. Previously she had used her right eye to do this, but she couldn't now she was partially sighted in that eye. She was told she would not be able to have laser surgery to fix it as it required cutting a flap in the lens, which was not strong enough for the procedure and would tear. Miss Garrod was forced to spend a week in hospital where nurses put drops in her eye every half an hour for 24 hours. Fortunately, years later she had laser eye surgery to restore the sight in her eye . Miss Garrod struggled with her photography course as she was partially blinded in one eye. She says her friend Bex (left) helped he take notes and assisted her on shoots . A specialist then suggested she could 'piggy back' her lenses, to improve her sight in that eye. It meant wearing a hard lens directly on her eye as a softer one would sink in to the ulcer, then putting a soft lens on top of that. Miss Garrod said: 'I'd have to get used to wearing two lenses so I said, ""I'll just wear glasses."" For the next month Miss Garrod continued to use the drops and creams she had been given, to help her eye heal. She said: 'My eye was uncomfortable and still watering. 'I struggled with my uni course and had to teach myself how to use my left eye to take photos as my right one was blurry. 'My tutor said I should take a year out but I refused and stuck it out. 'My best friend, who was on my course, helped me take notes and assisted me with photo shoots. Without her I wouldn't have got through it. 'Then my dad found a specialist who suggested a stronger hard lens to improve my sight.' It meant Miss Garrod could complete her degree and gain a first class honours. She wore the hard lenses for the next few years. However the sight in her right eye was still limited and the lenses started to become irritating and uncomfortable. Then, she was referred to the private London Vision Clinic, and told that in fact she could have laser surgery to renew and improve her sight in both eyes. She said: 'As I'd been told before I wouldn't be able to have laser treatment, I thought they wouldn't be able to help.' But Miss Garrod had surgery on both eyes, to improve her left eye so she wouldn't have to wear glasses or lenses. Miss Garrod wore glasses as a young girl (pictured) but had worn contact lenses ever since she was 15 with no problems, until she developed the corneal abrasion that left her partially blind . Next, ultrasound was used to guide a laser to remove the scarred area of her right eye, while preserving the clear tissue underneath, restoring her sight in that eye. She said: 'The surgery was painless and took only a few days to heal. I was nervous but it was over in a minute and I didn't feel a thing. 'Having an infection was rubbish. 'You don't want these things to happen. 'But if it hadn't, there's no way I would have got to the clinic, where the staff were great. 'After I took out my lenses that day I threw them away but if I'd kept them I could have sent them off to find out what the bacteria was and how it caused my infection. 'I find it hard to understand how a contact lens could have damaged my eye so badly. 'I did everything right but still almost lost my sight.' Rising numbers of young people are suffering potentially devastating eye infections due to a lack of knowledge of the risks of contact lenses, say experts.

"Dogs are usually maestros when it comes to games of throw and catch - especially when there's food involved. But Fritz the Golden Retriever from California appears to lack any eye-mouth co-ordination skills, as a new video shows. The pooch was filmed wearing bunny ears this Easter trying - and miserably failing - to catch a hard-boiled egg between his teeth. Slow-motion footage shows him licking his lips and enthusiastically leaping up to catch the treat.

"A holidaymaker was left stranded in Tenerife after thieves stole her passport ID during a family holiday - and Ryanair staff refused to let her fly home over fears she was an illegal immigrant. Loushanna and Shawn Craig from Erdington, Birmingham, had gone away to the island for a three-day break, marking her birthday and the couple's anniversary. But, despite having flown to Tenerife from East Midlands airport, Mrs Craig was marooned on the island for up to two weeks after her biometric ID card was stolen. Loushanna Craig, from Erdington in Birmingham, had gone to Tenerife with her husband for three-day holiday but was refused to fly home over fears she was an illegal immigrant . The couple were on a trip to the volcanoes when Mr Craig had his wallet stolen, which had her biometric ID, as well as their bank cards inside. The 37-year-old was meant to return to the UK on March 9, but she only arrived back on March 24 - having spent more than three times what she had planned. The mother-of-four, who has a Jamaican passport, has now placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of Ryanair. She claims that she has the right documentation to prove she was allowed to return to the UK, but that the budget airline refused to fly her home anyway. She said: 'The whole experience has been humiliating. I will never use Ryanair again.' Mrs Craig, who moved to Birmingham from the West Indies 14 years ago, does not have a full UK passport because she has not yet been given permission to live here permanently. Mrs Craig, with her husband Shawn, who had her biometric ID card stolen while on holiday . Instead, she has the 'right to remain' status, a Government stamp which shows she resides in the UK. That stamp recently ran out, she said. But she has a biometric ID card, given to her by the UK Border Force, which, when used in conjunction with her passport, proves she has the right to reside in this country. She has previously used it as a passport in EU countries. Prior to the holiday, Mrs Craig had also obtained a visa from the Spanish Embassy in London, allowing her to travel out of the country. After the card was stolen, Mrs Craig travelled to Madrid where she was given documentation to prove that her card had been stolen. But when she tried to return home, she was stopped at the Tenerife South boarding desk and the police were called. She was led away, under suspicion of being an illegal immigrant. 'They just didn't want to know,' she said. 'They weren't interested in seeing the papers. I was led away like a crook. I also had a driving licence and bank cards which proved I was from the UK.' Mrs Craig, who was carrying other cards like her driving licence and National Insurance card, then got paperwork from the British Consulate in Tenerife, which also verified that her card had been stolen. But when Mrs Craig attempted to get home, she was turned back again. She alleges that a Ryanair representative at Tenerife South Airport told her: 'We send you Africans to Britain and they just send you back and fine us 6,000 euros.' She said: 'I was left feeling like a criminal.' Mrs Craig was told her Jamaican passport would have to be surrendered and re-stamped before she could return, a process that would have taken at least three weeks. But Desmond Jaddoo, a community activist, then intervened, speeding up the process, meaning she returned home earlier than expected. He described the saga as 'totally unsatisfactory in its entirety'. He said: 'Ryanair failed to take into account her circumstances, they failed to show any form of compassion and the fact that they stereotyped her is of great concern.' Mrs Craig travelled to Madrid where she was given documentation to prove that her card had been stolen but at the aiport she was stopped at the boarding desk and the police were called . A Home Office spokesman said the airline were right not to accept the ID card as a passport substitute . But a Home Office spokesman said the airline were right not to accept the ID card as a passport substitute. The spokesperson said: 'The biometric residence permit is proof of the holder's right to stay, work or study in the United Kingdom. It can also be used as a form of identification. The holder is not required to carry their permit at all times, but they must show it at the border, together with their passport, when travelling outside of, and when returning to, the United Kingdom.' A Ryanair spokesman said: 'While we apologise for any inconvenience caused, it is each passenger's responsibility to carry travel documentation which meets the requirements of Ryanair, immigration and other authorities.'","Loushanna and Shawn Craig were on three-day holiday on island in March .

"A pair of childhood friends who played football together as boys are set to marry years as man and wife after reuniting when one of them underwent gender reassignment surgery. Christopher Dodd, 24, and Fay Purdham, 27, are now a couple, with the latter transitioning to become a woman at the age of 23. The pair, who now live in South Bank, Middlesbrough, grew up together as boys before losing touch as teenagers. Fay Purdham and Christopher Dodd are to marry after reuniting years after Miss Purdham underwent surgery to become a woman. The pair grew up together as boys, playing football and Playstation for endless hours . Miss Purdham, who was born Kevin, (left), began her transition after Christopher (right) move away from the area where they both lived as children . Soon after they parted ways Fay, who was born Kevin, started her transition to becoming a woman by taking hormones. They reunited at a party years later and are now planning their dream wedding. 'When I saw Fay again, I was gob smacked by how beautiful she was and I fell for her immediately,' said Mr Dodd, who is studying chemistry at Middlesbrough University. 'It took me some time to get my head around the fact that she used to be my best friend Kevin but I have never looked at her in any other way other than the fact she is a gorgeous woman.' The pair were inseparable as children and spent endless hours playing football. Christopher was my best friend in the world when I younger. 'We used to be together all the time from when I was about nine going on 10 – he was a close family friend – and we spent hours together playing 'boy' games when I was Kevin,' Miss Purdham said. The couple now live together and are planning their family, with Miss Purdham having frozen her sperm before changing gender . But even as a young boy she said she knew she was slightly different. 'I used to play with cars and guns and play sports like my friends, but I also loved playing with dolls.' Aged 12, she realised she was gay and came out to her family after spending years dressing up in her sister's clothes in wigs secretly. From then the youngster became increasingly feminine, saving up her pocket money to buy women's clothes and experimenting with make-up. Aged 16 she began taking hormones to begin her physical transformation, by which point Christopher had already moved away with his family. 'I had gradually stopped playing with Christopher and he had moved away anyway,' added Miss Purdham. 'It was sad and I missed him but I didn’t think him, being a boy, would understand what was going on. 'When I started to transition from about the age of 16, I lost touch with him and didn’t see him again for several years.' In fact the couple did not meet again until Mr Dodd's 21st birthday when Miss Purdham, who is unemployed, turned up with her sister. 'As soon as he saw me, he came over to me,' she recalled. 'He had heard through family that I’d had surgery to become a woman but the last time he’d seen me I was Kevin. 'His first words were: ""God you look different"" and we both burst out laughing. While Mr Dodd knew his girlfriend had changed genders through family friends, when the pair finally reunited at his 21st birthday party he said he was 'gobsmacked' by her beauty . Miss Purdham with her sister. While the 27-year-old's sibling and mother were accepting of her decision, she said she thinks her father found it more difficult to cope with . Miss Purdham had long been dressing up in her sister's clothes and wigs by the time she told her family she wanted to become a woman. She is pictured above left, as Kevin, and right, in a recent photograph . After coming out as gay and leaving school, Miss Purdham began experimenting more with women's clothes . Mr Dodd, who is a chemistry student in Middlesbrough, moved away with his family before Miss Purdham's transition . 'Now he had really grown into a handsome young man and I was very attracted to him right from the start – plus I had that feeling that he was also liking me too. “We sat talking for ages about the old days and then suddenly, he kissed me - and it felt like the right thing to do.' They began dating, with Mr Dodd eager to understand more about his new girlfriend's transformation. 'He was curious about it all of course and a little afraid, I think. It was all new to him and the fact that I had been a boy and we had been so close at one time was a little difficult to get his head around. 'But he never ever treats me little anything less than the woman I am and he’s very respectful of me.' They are now engaged and are planning a family, with Miss Purdham having frozen her sperm before undergoing gender reassignment surgery. 'We are so excited for our future. I still can’t believe that all this is happening – and that Christopher has fallen in love with me given our backgrounds. 'I feel very lucky that fate crossed our paths again. He’s definitely the man of my dreams – and I know I’m his girl.' The couple live together in South Bank, Middlesbrough. When they kissed for the first time, Miss Purdham said it felt 'right'","Christopher Dodd, 24, and Fay Purdham, 27, are planning their wedding .

"Sir Nick Faldo will now know for sure whether Rory McIlroy is bulking up too much after appearing to give the world No 1 a squeeze during Monday's practice round at Augusta National. After McIlroy was on the cover of Men's Health magazine and admitted he was 'obsessed with the gym', Faldo, a three-time Masters winner, voiced his concern that the 25-year-old was spending too much time on the weights. Faldo last week told the Daily Telegraph: 'Throwing 200lb and 300lb weights around is not going to be good for your golf swing. The heaviest weight I would ever lift was my body weight. You can play some pretty good golf when you have just got some decent shoulders on you and a strong neck and a strong pair of hands.' Sir Nick Faldo puts a hand on Rory McIlroy's shoulder during Monday's practice round ahead of the Masters . McIlroy and three-time Masters champion Faldo greeted each other with a handshake at Augusta National . McIlroy's fitness programme doesn't seem to be doing him too much harm. He goes into the year's first major as the bookies' favourite and looking to become just the sixth player in history to complete the career grand slam. He shook Faldo's hand on Monday and the Englishman, wearing a green jacket McIlroy would love to have in his collection, gave him a squeeze on the shoulder. As expected, McIlroy drew a huge crowd as patrons piled in to the famous Georgia course and Scottish amateur Bradley Neil had a taste of things to come as he practised with him. The patrons were also keen to get close to McIlroy as Masters week began with the Monday practice . McIlroy, preparing to tee off on the fourth, is bidding to win a fifth major and complete a career grand slam . World No 1 McIlroy made sure he put in a bit of work in the huge bunkers at the Georgia venue . Meanwhile, just 27 per cent of McIlroy's fellow professionals think he will complete the career grand slam by winning the Masters this week. But the good news for the 25-year-old is that he is far more popular than defending champion Bubba Watson, who cannot rely on too much support if he gets into a fight at Augusta National. Those were among the results gleaned by an ESPN.com survey of 103 tour professionals - 21 of whom were major champions - who anonymously answered questions on a wide range of topics. Asked if McIlroy would be wearing a green jacket on Sunday, 28 players said yes, 72 said no and three abstained. McIlroy will have caddie JP Fitzgerald on the bag to help him plot his way round the stunning course . The Northern Irishman had Scottish amateur Bradley Neil for company during Monday's practice . And McIlroy congratulated Neil after he chipped in at the second... save them for Thursday Bradley . Asked which player they would not help in a fight in the car park, Watson got double the number of responses (22.6 per cent) of second-place finisher Patrick Reed (11 per cent). Rory Sabbatini was third and Robert Allenby fourth. Other topics covered in the survey included slow play and recreational drugs - Kevin Na was judged in need of the first one-shot penalty in 20 years on the PGA Tour, narrowly ahead of Ben Crane, while 40 players felt the Tour should stop testing for marijuana. And on the subject of Tiger Woods, only seven per cent thought he would not win another major before the start of the season. However, after Woods missed the cut in Phoenix and withdrew from his next event after 11 holes, the numbers became 50/50.

"Three people are fortunate to be alive after a hot air balloon collided with a transmission tower and crashed to the ground during a training session in Russia. In the incident, which was captured on camera, the balloon catches the side of the tower and the basket, which carries three occupants, plummets to the ground. The instructor and two passengers were hospitalised with cuts and bruises but are all reported to be in a stable condition. The filmmaker captured the moment the balloon collides with the side of the transmission tower . The horrifying incident took place in the sky over Russia’s Dmitrov district. Recording from a car, the filmmaker follows three hot air balloons through the trees as they float in the sky. In the right hand corner of the screen a balloon can be seen edging closer to a transmission tower, but it seems it be moving in a controlled manner. Suddenly the balloon begins plummeting to the ground as the filmmaker continues to drive towards it . The balloon begins disintegrating and the basket, carrying three people, plummets towards the ground . Suddenly as the balloon passes by it collides with the tower, and despite the filmmaker’s distance from the accident, the tension on the balloon is visible. Continuing to drive closer to the balloon, the video maker captures it swaying in the wind – its tiny basket perched quite a distance above the ground. The car then makes its final approach towards it and suddenly the balloon begins plummeting as it starts to tear. The basket speeds up and hits the ground but luckily all of the passengers survive the accident . Within seconds the balloon appears to have disintegrated entirely and the basket begins to descend even quicker. Suddenly it crashes to the ground – and a scream can be heard from within side the filmmaker’s car. The video concludes with a number of people running over towards the fallen basket in an attempt to help the people on board as debris from the destroyed balloon rains down on them.

"Graeme McDowell admits he has sometimes needed to spend time in a padded room after failing to get to grips with the challenges posed by Augusta National. But the former US Open champion is optimistic he can improve on his Masters record this week after overcoming an ankle injury which forced him to withdraw from the Valero Texas Open last month. 'It was the third time in my career I've had to withdraw from a tournament and it's not something I enjoy doing,' McDowell said after a practice round at Augusta. 'I was not really sure the extent of how much I had hurt myself and nearly withdrew from the pro-am on Wednesday, and probably should have in hindsight. Graeme McDowell has vowed to play 'aggressive' golf to help improve his poor Masters record . 'It was a peroneal tendon strain and, with a big season ahead, I didn't want to force anything. This is the first 18 holes I have walked since, and I feel good, so we are actually in better shape than we expected.' McDowell has made the cut just twice in seven attempts in the Masters - although he finished 17th in 2009 and 12th in 2012 - and concedes the long course does not suit his game. But the 35-year-old Northern Irishman added: 'Despite the fact that my record round here is not great, I do love this golf course. I could easily play it every day and be very content. 'It's such a great golf course, you learn something about it every year. I was out there just picking up little nuances that I haven't perhaps noticed before and putting those in the memory bank and trying to apply your knowledge and experience and hope that some year I can come here and really compete. This could be the year. The golfer (left) took in a practice round with his coach Pete Cowen on the Augusta National course . 'I am excited. I am really focusing hard on my chipping and putting this year. I haven't putted well enough here and it seems like such an obvious key round here. 'Sometimes I have required a padded cell when I've walked off the 18th green because I have got frustrated, but I have learned to understand why the course frustrates you, because it makes you play with the handbrake on. You have to take it off sometimes and play aggressively to conservative targets. 'That's a sort of sports psychology thing, but it means you take shots on that you fancy and if you don't like it you have to play safe. Sometimes it can be dangerous to be playing extremely well coming in here because it gets you to take too much on. Sometimes when you are a tiny bit off and have to play a tiny bit safer and smarter, that can be a good recipe around here so it's getting that right balance.' McDowell chips towards the green as his caddie Ken Comboy looks on during a practice round at Augusta .","Graeme McDowell will play 'aggressive' golf to end his poor Masters record .

"Tiger Woods declared himself ready to compete for a fifth Masters title after completing 11 holes of practice at Augusta National on Monday. Woods has started just two events in 2015, shooting a career-worst score of 82 to miss the cut in the first of them and withdrawing through injury after just 11 holes of the second on February 5. That led to the 14-time major winner taking a break from competition to work on his game, during which time he dropped outside the world's top 100 for the first time since September 1996, a slide which continued on Monday as he fell from 104th to 111th. Tiger Woods returned to action as he warmed up at Augusta National Golf Club ahead of The Masters . The 39-year-old is returning from a self-imposed break from golf to recover from injuries and a dip in form . Woods was given a warm welcome by the crowd and stopped to sign several autographs at Augusta . Woods has not won a major since the 2008 US Open and the last of his four Masters wins was a decade ago, with the 39-year-old only confirming on Friday that he would compete at Augusta. However, after showing no sign of the chipping 'yips' which blighted his performance in Phoenix on the range, Woods produced some vintage shots as he completed the front nine alongside long-time friend Mark O'Meara before playing the 10th and 18th alone. 'I felt good. It was nice to get out here,' said Woods, who was two under after four holes despite a wayward drive on the first and three-putting the par-five second for a par. 'Chipping is fine. I wanted to test out some wedges out here. That was why I was chipping a little bit more. It came down to a couple of different bounce settings because it's different from Florida. We figured the right one out. 'It's been a process. But I'm on the good side now. It's progression. I felt like I had to get my game into a spot where I could compete to win a golf tournament and it's finally there.' Woods has not won a major since the US Open in 2008 and will be looking to get back to his best . Woods stopped to chat to Europe's Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke (right) at Augusta on Monday . O'Meara, who won the Masters and Open in 1998, said: 'The thing about the kid is that you can never underestimate Tiger Woods. I'm a huge fan, a friend and I care about him. 'It was good to be out there with him. I saw some good signs. His pitching looks a lot better. 'There's a lot of pressure on him but there is no reason why he should not have a good week this week. 'There are not many people that have played the game of golf like he has. The game of golf is better because of Tiger Woods. 'He is in a good place and I think he is fired up about it. He will be nervous on Thursday but I think he will be fine. He hit a couple of shots that were a little off but a lot of quality shots.' Earlier in the day, US Open champion Martin Kaymer said he still felt Woods was 'the man,' but added: 'Who really knows what is going on in his head? Woods looked confident and managed to pull off some impressive drives in front of the crowd . Woods hits a chip shot on to the green during the practice session ahead of the Masters 2015 . Woods smiles during the practice round prior to the tee off of the 2015 Masters on Thursday . 'I hope he's happy. I hope he's fine. I hope he will play well this week. But what would bother me a lot is all the speculation. You don't have a choice; you will read about it somewhere. You will hear about it because you socialise with people. 'So mentally it must be quite exhausting and we know how important the mental part is in golf. It's difficult and some things I don't find very fair. You know, you should just let him be. Let him play golf, what he likes to do. 'Sometimes I look at it and find it quite sad how people treat the whole subject. It shouldn't be like this in my opinion. But that's how it is unfortunately. That is how a lot of people make their money and some athletes, they suffer because of that. 'Hopefully he's strong enough, he has people to talk to, and he finds a way to compete as good as he can. Because we all know when he's around, somehow it does make us play better, as well. 'I never experienced someone who played better than him. In my era, I never played with Seve (Ballesteros) and I never played with Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, those guys. So for me, what I have seen and what I have experienced, he's the man.'","Tiger Woods has made his first public appearance for 60 days .

"Notts County have appointed Ricardo Moniz as their new manager just a week after the club announced that he was unable to commit to the role. The former Tottenham and Hamburg coach pulled out of the running due to 'family reasons' at the end of March but on Tuesday moved to Meadow Lane on a three-year deal. The 50-year-old Dutchman has six games to save his new side from relegation into Sky Bet League Two, with the Magpies currently one point from safety. Notts County have appointed former Tottenham and Hamburg coach Ricardo Moniz as their new manager . Moniz has six games to save Notts County from relegation to League Two with the club one point from safety . Notts County have been without a permanent manager since the departure of Shaun Derry on March 23, with Paul Hart and Mick Halsall taking caretaker charge of their recent games. But Moniz, who steered Red Bull Salzburg to Austrian league and cup glory in the 2011/12 campaign, will now take the reins. The club have confirmed that Dave Kevan will be Moniz's assistant, with strength and conditioning coach Mike Edwards and goalkeeping coach Kevin Pilkington remaining in their posts. The League One club have confirmed that Dave Kevan will be Moniz's assistant at Meadow Lane . Magpies chairman Ray Trew told the club's official website: 'As I have said previously, I set out on our search for a new manager with an open mind but with a determination to find someone who would be able to bring a new level of excitement to Notts County. 'I think in Ricardo we have found that because, having spoken to him at length, his footballing philosophy is one of structured attacking play, which I hope is something that our fans will buy into, because I know that when I come to Meadow Lane I want to be entertained, I want to be excited by what I see out there on the pitch. 'Results, of course, are the yardstick by which managers are ultimately judged, but if we can play the sort of football that gets people off their seats and instil in our players the desire to take games to our opponents, I think we can make a real impression in this division. Notts County have been without a permanent manager since the departure of Shaun Derry on March 23 . 'Ricardo has a fantastic reputation within the game, not only for the style of football that he plays, but also his ability to spot and nurture young talent, so I am confident that his appointment will be of benefit to all levels of the club. 'In Dave I have been able to bring in someone who knows this level of football and, perhaps equally importantly, knows this football club. He's a Notts County person and I am delighted that he agreed to return for what I feel is an exciting period ahead for the club. 'The new management team's immediate goal is clear, with survival in League One our short-term aim obviously, but work is already under way to ensure that we have the best possible squad available to make a real impression next season.'","Ricardo Moniz has six games to save Notts County from relegation .

"Dundee manager Paul Hartley is not reading too much into Dundee United's recent slide ahead of Wednesday night's Scottish Premiership derby at Dens Park. United have lost seven of their last nine matches in all competitions, drawing the other two, while their last league victory was way back on January 24 against Motherwell. However, Hartley is refusing to believe that will make his side's job any easier as they attempt to register their first win in a derby this season at the fourth attempt. Paul Hartley is not reading too much into Dundee United's recent slide ahead of Wednesday's  derby game . Hartley said: 'They've still got good players. 'We're under no illusion about the talent they have throughout the squad. 'We've seen it throughout the season - and in games against us, in particular. We know they've got players who can hurt you anywhere. We need to be focused on what we can do.' Dundee are without a win in three matches themselves, following up their defeat to Ross County with 1-1 draws against Aberdeen and Inverness. Dundee Utd's Nadir Ciftci scores his side's equalising goal from the penalty spot against Ross County . Callum Morris celebrates his goal during the Scottish League Cup match against Aberdeen . That has left them in seventh place in the table on 41 points, five behind fourth-placed United and two adrift of Hamilton in sixth. Hartley said: 'We're trying to look at getting as many points before the split, try to get into that top six. 'We're not far off but we know we need to win some games. 'If we get a result in the derby, it takes us a couple of points behind United, yes. But the main thing for us is trying to catch our nearest opponent.' Dundee Utd's John Souttar battles for the ball with Liam Boyce during their game at Tannadice . Despite not having won since February, Hartley believes his players can still take confidence into Wednesday's match after taking points off top-three sides Aberdeen and Inverness. He said: 'We're on a pretty good run. 'Our results recently have been decent against some good teams in the league. So all credit to the lads for that. We want to keep that going and derby games are always special. If you win, it can give everyone a great lift.

"Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood has vowed to give pal Chris Ramsey the red-button treatment if he tries calling him ahead of Tuesday's crunch six-pointer. Rangers will leapfrog Sherwood's side and plunge them back into the drop zone if they win at Villa Park in what represents a pivotal game for both sides. Ramsey, who was Sherwood's closest lieutenant at Tottenham last season, had at the weekend vowed to take the unusual step of trying to make contact with his opposing manager ahead of the game. Tim Sherwood  takes on his friend Chris Ramsey when Aston Villa play Queens Park Rangers . Ramsey (right) was Sherwood's ally when the the Villa man was at the helm of Tottenham last season . Sherwood's Villa team were swept aside by Manchester United on Saturday, losing 3-0 at Old Trafford . Yet Sherwood insists he will allow nothing to distract him from his primary focus of keeping Villa in the division. He said: 'I haven't spoke to Chris for a while. I keep red buttoning him! Have I text him to say well done (over the QPR result)? No. 'It's not changed. I hope he does well. I respect Chris as a coach and a manager . 'For someone to put is head on the block like he has, good luck to him, not tomorrow though. 'I hope we both survive. It's more likely we will than them because after Tuesday night we could be six points ahead. 'It's hard, what do you talk about? You can't share team notes. Only 'how's the family, are you alright? Ok, see you Tuesday.' 'He's a good pal of mine and very loyal friend but it's been put to one side.' Sherwood has guided Villa to an FA Cup semi-final, with Blackburn or Liverpool lying in wait on Sunday week. Yet he insists he will take no pleasure from their day out at Wembley if their they fail to get any more points on the board from their QPR showdown and Saturday's eagerly-anticipated return for the boss to White Hart Lane. Villa captain Fabian Delph looks dejected as Villa are beaten by United in the Premier League . Ramsey led QPR to a 4-1 victory at West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns on Saturday . Bobby Zamora scored a stunning goal in QPR's big win but Sherwood claims he saw 'chinks in the armoury' He continued: 'I'm not even considering Wembley, it's not an option. 'It won't be a good day out if we don't pick up any points before now and the semi final. It's all about Tuesday. This is huge for us.' Sherwood insists Villa, whose mini-revival has been halted by back-to-back defeats, should not fear QPR despite them winning 4-1 at West Brom on Saturday. He added: 'We saw they scored four goals, we know they have got threats and two goals were contenders for goal of season. 'We saw enough chinks in the armoury for a Villa side to play well and exploit. 'We can't rely on anyone else, we know what we need to do, we know we have to win a considerable amount of games between now and the end of the season to stay safe and, that's what we intend to do. 'It's a great opportunity for us to put some breathing space points between us and Chris' QPR. 'It's about those players when they cross the line, it's time for them to stand up and be counted, have they got what it takes to stay in Premier League? 'I believe they have, they need to believe it and we need to start showing it starting showing it from Tuesday.' The manager has bemoaned his team's crippling injury crisis with Ashley Westwood, Scott Sinclair and Alan Hutton all sidelined. Ali Cissokho, Tom Cleverley and Kieran Richardson are also doubtful, while Philippe Senderos and Libor Kozak have been long-term absentees. 'I've never seen an injury crisis like it,' Sherwood added. Sherwood admitted his concern at Villa's injury list as he looks to lead the club away from relegation . Scott Sinclair heads Villa's list of absentees, with Alan Hutton and Ashley Westwood also missing for QPR . 'I never thought I'd be one of those managers who moans about injuries. You get one back and lose another two. 'They're not trivial injuries, they're always two, three, four weeks. It is OK in September but not now. That's pretty much writing off the season. 'It's a case of seeing who can come in. A few are back from injury, medically rather than physically, but it's a need must situation. Some of them will be risked.'","Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey worked together at Tottenham last year .

"Exeter swept aside Newcastle 48-13 to set up a semi-final showdown with Gloucester in the inaugural European Challenge Cup. The Chiefs outscored their opponents six tries to one at Sandy Park, with a David Ewers score and a penalty try helping the home side into a 17-6 half-time lead. Exeter then added further tries through Thomas Waldrom, Byron McGuigan, Sam Hill and Dean Mumm after the break, with outclassed Newcastle only able to respond with a 68th-minute effort from Chris Harris and eight points from the boot of Tom Catterick. Carl Rimmer of Exeter Chiefs is tackled by Newcastle Falcons' Dom Barrow during match at Sandy Park . Exeter's Thomas Waldrom stretches over for a try during the European Rugby Challenge Cup match . The victory means Exeter will take on Gloucester at Kingsholm in two weeks' time for a place in the final against either Newport Gwent Dragons or the winner of Sunday's London Irish-Edinburgh encounter. The hosts made a number of changes from the side that lost 25-18 at Leicester in the Premiership last weekend with McGuigan, Ben Moon, Tomas Francis and Tom James being drafted in. The Chiefs were also forced into a late change with Damian Welch pulling-up in the warm-up so Ben White was promoted from the bench to play in the back row, skipper Mumm moved into the second row and Sam Skinner added to the replacements. Newcastle, who lost 46-17 to Exeter in the Premiership last month, started with two changes in the backs from the side that narrowly lost at London Irish with Juan Pablo Socino in the centre and Harris on the right wing. Both defences were tested in the opening 10 minutes but it was Exeter who made the first breakthrough just before the quarter-hour. Dave Ewers of Exeter Chiefs (centre) makes a break during his side's 48-13 victory against the Falcons . After the Falcons were forced to touch down over their own line, Exeter broke off the back of the five-metre scrum and Ewers barged over the line. Slade added the extras from out wide on the right and the Chiefs were under way. Exeter increased their advantage midway through the half when wing Matt Jess, who was on course to score from a loose ball, was pulled back twice off the ball by full-back Alex Tait. Referee Marius Mitrea had no hesitation in awarding a penalty try - which Slade converted - and Tait went to the sin-bin. Newcastle kept the Chiefs at bay while they were a man down and when they were back to full strength the visitors were awarded a penalty 12 metres out in front of the posts, which fly-half Catterick slotted over to get his side off the mark. Slade and Catterick then swapped penalties to leave Exeter with an 11-point lead at the interval. Dan Temm of Newcastle Falcons tackles Thomas Waldrom during the quarter-final encounter . That soon became 18 points as just 45 seconds after the restart Ewers broke from inside his own half, shrugged off a couple of half tackles, before offloading to number eight Waldrom to stretch for the line. Slade converted and, 12 minutes later, added his second penalty from 30 metres out to make it 27-6. The Chiefs' fourth try came just before the hour-mark when Will Chudley chipped over the head of the defence and into the arms of McGuigan to go over, with Slade again adding the conversion. The Falcons may have looked down and out but Harris rounded a couple of forwards to score a breakaway try under the posts with Catterick converting to cut the deficit to 34-13. However, the Chiefs replied immediately through Hill to help restore their advantage and then Hill turned provider for Mumm to score the Chiefs' sixth and final try, with replacement fly-half Gareth Steenson converting both to cap a one-sided triumph.","Exeter and Gloucester will go head-to-head for place in inaugural final .

"There was no special treatment for Lewis Ferguson at Paul Nicholls’ yard on Thursday morning. The 18-year-old was mucking out the stables as usual, just a cut on the nose to show for the fall which has made him an internet sensation. Ferguson, whose double somersault horror fall from the favourite Merrion Square in the 4.20pm at Wincanton on Wednesday has been watched hundreds of thousands of times online.

"Saracens chairman Nigel Wray has dismissed rugby’s salary caps rules as ‘a farce’ in financial documents seen by The Mail on Sunday that show his club’s wage bill soared by another £1million last season alone — even as they remain the subject of a salary cap investigation. A fortnight after the shock departure of chief executive Edward Griffiths and three months since the revelation that the north London club are being investigated by Premier Rugby for alleged salary cap breaches, The Mail on Sunday can reveal Saracens’ mounting debt has topped £40m — the most in rugby history. The rising costs facing the club are also a concern, with the wage bill leaping more than 50 per cent in three years. Saracens now owe £41.6m, according to new filings at Companies House, much of it funded by an unsecured loan from long-standing benefactor Wray and a consortium of South African business associates. Saracens chairman Nigel Wray has dismissed rugby’s salary caps rules as ‘a farce’ The employee wage bill ballooned to £9.1m last year and, with Wray admitting further losses lie ahead, there are growing concerns about the club’s financial health. A move by Saracens last December to scrap the salary cap — which is currently £5m but was £4.5m in the period covered by the new figures — drew no public support from other Premiership clubs. With discussions ongoing over the viability of ring-fencing the top flight, or at least restricting promotion and relegation, Wray has restated that the salary cap must be scrapped. ‘We need to change the farce whereby we are all operating under different rules,’ wrote Wray in a chairman’s statement in the club’s annual accounts seen by The Mail on Sunday. ‘We have one wage cap, the Irish provinces have no wage cap, the French clubs a wage cap twice ours, all of which makes no sense whatsoever. It needs to be changed. ‘In financial terms, it was another difficult year [2013-14]. Having been involved in professional rugby now for 20 years, I’m constantly amazed how hard it is to break into people’s culture. Documents show his club’s wage bill soared by another £1million last season alone despite investigation . ‘The big cities have that soccer culture but built over 100 years. Allianz Park [the purchase of] is a vast step forward and gives us a permanent home but we still have much to do. We could, of course, cut costs very considerably — for example a top French club has a medical staff of three, far smaller than ours. But we really don’t see how you can aspire to be one of the best club sides in Europe if you don’t have a fantastic support system for the players.’ The club have lost on average just over £5m per year over the past four years, more than doubling its debt burden in that period. Annual accounts for 2013-14 show the club’s parent company carry no legal obligation to service the debt, meaning they could technically walk away at any time and leave the club insolvent. Of most interest to their Premiership rivals will be the dramatic hike in salaries paid to employees, which rose from just over £8.1m to more than £9.1m last year . The Mail on Sunday can reveal Saracens’ mounting debt has topped £40m — the most in rugby history . The club took on 24 new staff in that time, nine of them players and coaches, but with the salary cap set at just £4.5m last season — not allowing for one ‘marquee player’ who theoretically could earn an unlimited salary but in reality will not get more than £500,000 — questions persist over the club’s salary structure. Even allowing for the unlikely scenario of a £1m budget for coaching staff, that would leave more than £3m in staff costs for 54 administrative staff — an average salary of more than £55,000. A Premier Rugby spokesman said: ‘Saracens have recently moved into a new purpose-built stadium, Allianz Park — which is a huge asset to the local community — with a number of new staff added. ‘The club are in an investment phase and, given the strength of the shareholding base, this is something they can manage.’","Documents show club’s wage bill soared by another £1million last season .

"Liam Plunkett has set his sights on the West Indies batting line-up and is ready to 'rough them up' with pace. The 29-year-old England seamer is back in Test contention in the Caribbean after his comeback last summer was cut short by injury. He managed 18 wickets in four Tests prior to that, playing a big part for an England side often criticised for going easy on the speed gun. Liam Plunkett wants to use his pace to lead England to victory in the Test series against West Indies . Plunkett returned to the England fold last summer in Test series against Sri Lanka and India . Plunkett has recovered from a minor ankle complaint in Yorkshire's pre-season trip to Abu Dhabi . A minor ankle complaint during Yorkshire's pre-season trip to Abu Dhabi proved to be nothing more than a brief setback and he is now looking to make a name for himself in a part of the world that is famous for its quick men. 'I'm trying to be the fastest (bowler on the pitch). I train hard at it and I feel that's why I stand out from the rest,' he said ahead of Monday's two-day warm-up against a St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI. 'I feel like I'm adaptable but you might need those little patches in the game - where it's a bit dead and there's good batters - to try and rough them up a bit. 'That's why I'm in the team, because I do bowl fast. 'I'm not a bowler who runs up and just hits line and length all day, I want to do something, I want to ruffle batsmen up. If that's what I'm asked to do, I'm happy to do that.' With James Anderson and Stuart Broad likely to retain new ball duties for the first Test in Antigua on April 13, Plunkett is fighting for a place with Barbados-born Chris Jordan and the uncapped Mark Wood. There is a case to be made for both his rivals, Jordan being more familiar with conditions in his homeland and Wood an unknown quantity to the opposition, but Plunkett relishes the scrap. 'It's a good unit, a good bunch of lads and we're all working hard. There's massive competition,' he said. 'It's up to me to bowl well in practice and in the warm-up games and get the chance to play in the first Test. 'You don't want to just get in easily. You want to feel like you've earned your place and outbowled the other guys. You want to be the best bowler.

"England have barely been in St Kitts a day but the early indications are they are ready to give Jonathan Trott the chance to reinvent himself as an international opener. Trott, England’s rock at No 3 for four years before his early return home from the 2013-14 Ashes series in Australia with a stress-related condition, was picked for this three-Test tour of the Caribbean after fighting his way back into contention. All the talk before the team’s departure may have been about Kevin Pietersen but the real focus of this tour is likely to fall on another South African-born batsman in Trott. Jonathan Trott during a nets session as he returned to the international scene and could be ready to play . The 33-year-old has been impressive in not only addressing the personal demons which led to his departure from Brisbane but also scoring the weight of runs needed to demand a recall. Alastair Cook knows the value an in-form Trott would bring to his side’s chances of recording a series win in the Caribbean that is vital not only for his own future as Test captain but that of coach Peter Moores, whose job security is at perilous levels. Cook admits England will not be totally sure if Trott can handle the mental demands of international cricket until he is pitched into the heat of battle again.But he is likely to be given the chance to re-establish himself in the team, this time as Cook’s opening partner, during the two warm-up matches against a St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI this week. Test captain Alastair Cook feels the batsman is ready for international cricket return . Trott (left) and Cook train together during a batting session at Warner Park, Basseterre, St Kitts & Nevis . The first of those two-day encounters starts here tomorrow and if Trott can show the same form he displayed during the England Lions tour of South Africa earlier this year then he looks certain to see off the challenge of Yorkshire opener Adam Lyth and make his 50th Test appearance in Antigua a week tomorrow. ‘I am confident he can handle it,’ Cook said. ‘You don’t know 100 per cent until he’s put out in the environment. There are a lot of things about selection that are unknown until you’re put into the pressure cooker of international cricket and make no mistake, it’s a high-intensity environment. ‘But what we do know is he’s a quality player.’ The Warwickshire batsman has been in fine form for them and rightly deserved his call-up .

"England Test captain Alastair Cook feared Jonathan Trott's international career was over 18 months ago, but feels he is now ready to face the 'pressure cooker' once again. Trott dramatically left the 2013/14 Ashes trip after just one match at the Gabba having struggled with what was initially labelled a 'stress-related condition' and later diagnosed as situational anxiety. Cook was concerned that would be the end of his Three Lions days but has watched the 33-year-old rebuild his career with typical focus and determination, first with Warwickshire then during a productive winter tour with England Lions. Jonathan Trott during a nets session as he returned to the international scene and could be ready to play . The pair are now heavy favourites to open the batting together in West Indies this month and should get a first chance against a St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI on Monday. Uncapped Yorkshireman Adam Lyth is the other top-order batsman on tour but Trott appears to have first claim after batting alongside the skipper in Saturday's centre-wicket practice session at Warner Park. 'He was in a bad place in Brisbane and at the time I would have been surprised that he'd come back, but it's a huge credit to the work he's done off the field and the effort he's put in,' said Cook. 'That obviously shows his desire to come back to play for England. Test captain Alastair Cook feels the batsman is ready for the 'pressure cooker' of international cricket . 'He has almost demanded selection with the runs he has scored for Warwickshire and it's great for me to see him back in an England shirt. He's a great guy and if he gets his chance he'll be desperate to do well.' Cook accepted there was no guarantee over how Trott would react to the glare of the international game, which remains several notches beyond anything he will have experienced on the county or Lions circuit. But with a CV boasting 49 Tests, 3,763 runs and nine centuries, Cook is delighted to have him back on board and nudging the selectors for a recall. 'I am (confident), but you don't know 100 per cent until he's put out in the environment - that is always unknown,' he said. Trott (left) and Cook train together during a batting session at Warner Park, Basseterre, St Kitts & Nevis . 'There's a lot of things about selection that are unknown until you're put into the pressure cooker of international cricket and, make no mistake, it's a high-intensity environment, there's no doubt about that. 'But Trotty's done everything we've asked of him. He feels confident in himself and he's just looking forward to taking that next step. 'What we do know is he's a quality player. You don't have his stats and that weight of runs behind you without being a quality player.' For his own part, Cook is in need of a successful series both as captain and run-scorer. The last of his 25 Test centuries came in May 2013 and he was stripped of the one-day captaincy on the eve of the World Cup, though in hindsight his absence from the tournament may have been a blessing given England's travails. The Warwickshire batsman has been in fine form for them and rightly deserved his call-up . Now, rested and recharged following his enforced spell at home, he is setting his sights on nothing short of victory in the three-Test series. 'It's been great to spend a bit of time at home, live a bit more of a normal life away from the travelling circuit of cricket,' he said. 'That's been great, at home with my family, but now it's the serious business of trying to win the series here. 'It's always important we win. When you play for England you carry the hopes and the pride of the nation on your shoulders. 'That hasn't changed since the day I started playing.'
