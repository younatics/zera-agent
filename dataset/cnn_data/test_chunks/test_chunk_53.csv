"A Florida postal carrier steered his small gyrocopter through protected Washington airspace for 30 miles to the U.S. Capitol, tracked by the nation's top security agencies, which feared harming tourists on the National Mall if they tried to shoot him down, senior lawmakers said Wednesday. Doug Hughes, 61, is 'lucky to be alive' and 'should have been blown out of the air,' Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight committee, told reporters just days after the incident that exposed a gap in the government's efforts to ensure the security of the White House, Capitol and other critical buildings in Washington. Senior officials from the Secret Service and Capitol Police briefed top House members behind closed doors. Scroll down for video . Press conference: Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, left, and ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummins, D-Md., speak with reporters on Wednesday . Pilot: The man who piloted the gyrocopter and landed on the West Lawn, 61-year-old Doug Hughes, is 'lucky to be alive' and 'should have been blown out of the air,' Chaffetz said . Campaign: Hughes' stunt was aimed at drawing attention to campaign finance reform . Chaffetz said security tracked Hughes as he approached the Capitol last week after taking off from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. A 'judgment call' was made not to shoot Hughes down, Chaffetz said. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said officials were concerned about injuring people on the ground if an attempt was made to shoot down Hughes. Chaffetz said a combination of 'lack of communication and some human error' by Capitol Police and other officials allowed Hughes to steer his tiny aircraft within a few hundred feet of the Capitol before landing on the West Lawn. Chaffetz said he was deeply concerned at 'a lack of coordination and communication' among law enforcement agencies charged with what he called 'a no-fail mission' to protect the Capitol and other important sites in Washington, including the White House. Cummings called the incident a 'wake-up call' to all law enforcement agencies involved. Capitol Police, the Secret Service and other agencies need 'to look very carefully at what happened here, dissect it, figure it out and use this to make things better,' Cummings said. Cummings and Chaffetz said they were outraged that members of Congress were not alerted to the potential security threat even as parts of the Capitol complex were placed under lockdown. 'That's inexcusable,' Chaffetz said. Chaffetz and Cummings said they will hold a hearing on the incident next week with representatives of six agencies: the Secret Service, Capitol Police, Congress' Sergeant at Arms, the Federal Aviation Administration, North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the U.S. Park Police. Three of the agencies - the FAA, NORAD and the park police - were no-shows at Wednesday's briefing, irking lawmakers. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said officials were concerned about injuring people on the ground if an attempt was made to shoot down Hughes . Security: Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said last week that Hughes 'literally flew under the radar' to the Capitol lawn, but added that it's too soon to say whether security changes are needed . Issues: Hughes was charged with two federal crimes, violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft. The crimes carry penalties of up to four years in prison and fines . 'They've got a lot of explaining to do' about why they did not attend the briefing, Chaffetz said. Lawmakers were told during the briefing that 'incursions' into the restricted air space around Washington occur nearly every day and are usually 'dealt with in a smooth and professional manner,' Chaffetz said, in stark contrast to the gyrocopter incident. Lawmakers raised alarms about security after Hughes' stunt, which was aimed at drawing attention to campaign finance reform. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said last week that Hughes 'literally flew under the radar' to the Capitol lawn, but added that it's too soon to say whether security changes are needed. 'We are a democracy. We don't have fences around our airspace, so we've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society, and security and the protection of federal buildings,' Johnson said. Chaffetz said there is a 'heightened awareness' about the risks of small aircraft in the wake of the gyrocopter stunt. Anyone who enters restricted airspace now will have 'a major problem,' Cummings said. Hughes was charged with two federal crimes, violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft. The crimes carry penalties of up to four years in prison and fines. Hughes' next court appearance is May 8.","Doug Hughes, 61, steered his small gyrocopter through protected Washington airspace for 30 miles to the U.S. Capitol .

"Ear biter: Kate Temple was jailed for 20 months after she admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm . A hairdresser who ripped another woman's ear off with her teeth during an argument at a hog roast party has been jailed. Kate Temple was called a 'homewrecker' by victim Shelley Williams who accused her of having an affair with her partner. Durham Crown Court heard how when Temple and her sister Louise Scollen went to leave the charity event at Dawdon Cricket Club in Seaham, County Durham the victim threw a drink over her. The three women got into a scuffle and Temple left the victim covered in blood after biting a chunk out of her ear. The 33-year-old carried out the attack before attempting to buy another drink from the bar where she was refused. Police found the missing portion of Miss Williams' ear the following day. Shaun Dryden, prosecuting, said: 'Shelley Williams believed that Kate Temple the defendant had been having some sort of relationship or affair with her partner. 'Miss Williams had found text messages on her partner's mobile phone earlier in the year. 'She recalls being in close proximity with the defendant and her sister. The next thing she can recall is being upset and covered in blood. 'The defendant and her sister approached the bar and she seems to have tried to buy another drink. 'By this time it became apparent the victim had a large portion of her left ear bitten off. 'Kate Temple and her sister were refused service. They left the marquee and went home.' Mr Dryden told the court how the victim has had to attend a number of hospital appointments and have reconstructive surgery on her ear. When the victim visited the hospital the following day the police became involved and Temple handed herself in to the police station. Temple initially told police she was not the person who bit the victim. She agreed to have a dental impression taken by police but later refused claiming she was acting on legal advice. The 33-year-old (pictured left) carried out the attack before attempting to buy another drink from the bar. She and her sister Louise Scollen had got into a scuffle with Shelley Williams, who had part of her ear bitten off . Dawdon Cricket Club in Seaham, County Durham, where the incident happened. A marquee had been erected at the club for a charity hog roast event. Police found the missing portion of Miss Williams' ear the next day . In a victim impact statement read to the court by Mr Dryden, Miss Williams said: . 'I have become very self conscious and it has affected my confidence. 'I struggle to leave the house as I feel everyone is looking at me. I went out for a family meal and a male said to me are you the one who had your ear bitten off. I was embarrassed by this male's comments. 'I booked a holiday and I was due to fly ten days after the assault took place. I was advised on medical grounds not to go because of risk of infection. I paid £1,500 for the holiday and as I didn't want to let my children down I paid another £400 for my parents to go with them. 'I have had to take a considerable amount of time off work. Working in a call centre I am unable to use my head set equipment. 'I am living in close proximity to Kate Temple and I regularly feel worried and start to panic. On one occasion I was with my daughter who said: ""Don't worry mam I close my eyes."" Sometimes when I wake up I get a severe shooting pain in my ear. 'I am ashamed to admit I sleep with a hockey stick under my bed. I feel really anxious and I have noticed I drink more because of it. 'I have spoken to the surgeon who has now told me he won't touch the ear because of how it had heeled. 'It's something I will have as a permanent reminder of what has happened.' When the prosecution could not prove who had carried out the attack both Temple and Scollen were charged and ordered to face trial. But Temple admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm and all charges were dropped against Scollen. Temple of St Johns Terrace, Seaham, pleaded guilty to inflicting GBH in the early hours of July 21 2013. Bob Spragg, defending, told the court how the victim had 'simply got the wrong end of the stick'. He said: 'Miss Williams had previously accused the defendant of inappropriate contact with her former partner when he went around to her house. 'This was entirely without foundation and streamed from the defendant being nice to her partner. 'The defendant's partner had gone to her house looking for some kind of comfort from her. 'Kate Temple was not prepared to let him in the house even though he was saying let's have a kiss and so forth. She was not at all interested in that taking place. 'Shelley Williams has seen the messages and got the wrong end of the stick which started this whole vendetta against her. It's ironic really that all of this started by her being a good friend to a man she has known since she was a child. 'In her own words her life has fallen apart. She's made decisions whilst in the depths of despair which she bitterly regrets and she will have to live with them consequences forever. 'She's clearly a low risk of ever being in trouble again. An immediate term of imprisonment would crush the defendant.' Judge Simon Hickey told Temple: 'She has been left feeling frightened and she has a permanent disability. She lost her confidence, she's had her career affected and her home life with her children has been affected. 'You admit in a letter to me you had her partner inside your house and had been kissing and cuddling him but no more. 'You do of course have a completely different character outside of this event. You have no previous convictions. This is a single bite. 'There is of course remorse although I take that as limited given the late plea and lack of cooperation during the case. 'You must have known what you had done on this night and you must have known what injury you had caused. 'It's a significant injury and it's caused by a weapon - teeth. 'I can't draw back from immediate sentence leaving someone disabled in this way.' Judge Hickey sentenced Temple to 20 months in prison. He told her: 'That is the lowest sentence I can pass given my public duty.'","Victim Shelley Williams accused attacker of having affair with her partner .

"In the end it took a searching ball from the cultured boot of Andrea Pirlo to settle this tie, a 70-yard pass that caught out Ricardo Carvalho for pace. This was far from a masterful performance by the Juventus midfielder, but he was entitled to ease himself in to this Champions League tie. Pirlo had, after all, been out for seven weeks with a calf injury before he was called upon to start this quarter-final tie. His 57th-minute pass, which sailed over the heads of the players in both teams towards the target of Alvaro Morata, led to the controversial moment when Czech referee Pavel Kralovec awarded a penalty. Carvalho, who had been immense alongside Aymen Abdennour in the heart of the Monaco defence, collided with the Juventus forward as he made his way towards goal.

Substitutes: Stekelenburg, Wallace, Germain, Elderson. Booked: Carvalho. Manager - Leonardo Jardim: 6.5 . Referee: Pavel Kralovec (Czech) 5 . Man of the match: Abdennour . Arturo Vidal settled it from the spot, putting Juve into a lead that they will need to defend when they travel to Stade Louis II for the second leg of this quarter-final next Wednesday. It is far from over. Juve’s coach Massimiliano Allegri knows that, saving the legs of Pirlo by replacing him with the defensive mind of Andrea Barzagli a few minutes after Vidal’s opener. This team, who have set the pace all season in Serie A and are 12 points clear of their nearest rivals Lazio, were a touch disappointing in this first leg. Carlos Tevez, who has scored six goals in the Champions League, dropped off in search of the ball in to feet from Pirlo, but this was not his night. Alongside him Roberto Pereyra faded after a bright opening and Morata’s contribition was the incident which led to Juventus being awarded their penalty. Before that Pirlo had patrolled the centre of Juve’s midfield with his usual classy touches, prodding around without being able to influence the tie in a way that he would have wanted. Even so they failed to score in the opening 45 minutes because Vidal, usually so dependable in this Juve team, could not find the target. Everything was wayward, earning a deserved rebuke from Tevez when he screwed wildly over the crossbar of Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic. Pirlo gave him the eyes after he missed another chance, streaking down the left before his right foot shot flew into the stands. In many way this was a subdued Juve performance, falling short of the standards they set when they beat Borussia Dortmund 5-1 on aggregate in the second round. Expectations have been raised. They would dearly love to reach another final, to win the Europen Cup for the third time in their history, but it will take something special to beat the best teams left in the tournament after the second legs are played next week. There is no guarantee they will survive the second leg because Leonardo Jardim’ s team are an adventurous bunch, playing without fear after their fine run in the competition. They had chances here, notably from Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco, the man who scored Monaco’s third goal at the Emirates on that memorable night in the previous round.

Ultimately this tie was decided from the penalty spot, a complex and strange decision that was made after a long pause by the Czech match official.

"This was tricky for Steve Cotterill. He did not want to do Bristol City down but at the same time felt the truth ought to be laid bare. The eight-second pause was revealing in its length as a delicate topic reared its head. Where exactly would this club — now on the brink of the Championship — be without their billionaire owner Steve Lansdown? Cotterill looked down at his feet, searching for the right answer. ‘I don’t quite know,’ he said, head shaking. It isn’t worth thinking about. He is aware that they’d be nowhere near a win away from League One promotion, potentially ending the season as champions and enjoying a spectacularly redeveloped Ashton Gate. Steve Cotteril has taken Bristol City to the brink of a Championship return after two seasons in League One . City have already won silverware this season in the shape of a Johnstone's Paint Trophy win last month . ‘There are a lot of big clubs in League One, Two and the Conference with good support. You only have to look at Bristol Rovers and the crowds they get in the Conference,’ Cotterill added after his side’s 1-1 draw at second-placed Preston. The inference was obvious. ‘We’re on the verge of the Championship and that’s only down to Steve and his investment and what he’s doing at the ground.’ Lansdown, who made his fortune from financial services, is a rare breed in English football, unwavering in ploughing his own fortune into the club through love and nothing else. It hasn’t always been rosy. That strategy was downright naive when they chased the Premier League dream and racked up astonishing debts in doing so. Dean Windass’s memorable winner for Hull City in the 2008 Championship play-off final might have cost Bristol City far more than just missing out on top-flight riches. If Lansdown hadn’t changed his approach they could have folded. Dean Windass hit the only goal of the game as Hull were promoted at the expense of the Robins . Those mistakes — over-paying for decent but not exceptional players — meant the owner had to write off an eye-watering £35million worth of debt last year. The age of Financial Fair Play dictates they must live within their means. Lansdown is far more pragmatic with money nowadays, even though Cotterill was allowed to spend £1.65m on four players last summer. They later sold striker Sam Baldock to Brighton for £2m and the squad is among the smallest in all four divisions. Quality, not quantity. ‘I ain’t quite sure we bought the division,’ Cotterill added. ‘We pay all these over a period of time, over a couple of years. ‘We will still potentially need to up our budget from where we are [next season]. I wouldn’t mind betting that Preston have got a bigger budget than us. I’m not saying that to put any pressure on anybody, all I’m saying is that their squad’s bigger than ours and I know their players. Probably Sheffield United as well.’ Aaron Wilbraham celebrates his goal at Preston which kept City's eight-point lead at the top of League One . Bristol City will become the first Football League club to clinch promotion this year should they beat Bradford at Valley Parade on Tuesday, in turn ending a two-year absence from the Championship. They have been staying in a Preston hotel ahead of the trip across the Pennines, training at Burnley today and utilising Cotterill’s contacts. ‘I was at Burnley for nearly four years,’ he added. ‘I should be allowed to train on the pitch that I built! We sold Robbie Blake [to Birmingham City for more than £1m in 2004] and built a new pitch. I will take credit for that.’ What he won’t take credit for is City’s rise back where they belong. That’s reserved for one fanatic with very deep pockets.

"Thousands of sobbing students and teachers prayed and comforted one another on Georgia Southern University's campus Thursday night during an emotional memorial service for five nursing students who were killed in a fiery crash. College juniors Emily Clark, 20, of Powder Springs, Morgan Bass, 20, of Leesburg, Abbie Deloach, 21, of Savannah, Catherine Pittman, 21, of Alpharetta and Caitlyn Baggett, 21, of Millen, perished early Wednesday morning on their way to school when a tractor-trailer plowed into traffic on Interstate 16, setting off a deadly chain reaction.

The driver of the tractor-trailer that caused the massive pileup reportedly said he wished he was also killed in the fiery wreck, but it was no consolation to the students' grief-stricken families, friends and classmates who converged on Sweetheart Circle on campus for a candlelight vigil. GSU nursing students were the first to arrive, wearing their signature white lab coats, reported Atlanta Journal Constitution. They were followed by members of sororities that had lost sisters in the wreck. University President Dr Brooks Keel fought back tears as he addressed the swelling crowd of mourners on a breezy Georgia evening. 'Eagle Nation is a family,' he said, imploring the audience to hold on to each other and the love they have for one another. The girls' friends in the nursing program shared their personal memories of the deceased, like Caitlyn's funny text messages, Morgan's penchant for pink outfits and Abbie's prowess on the basketball court. The touching memorial service lasted 45 minutes and included a reading of the Nightingale Pledge- a modified Hippocratic Oath named after Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing famed for her exploits in the Crimean War. The somber event concluded with a candle-lighting ceremony. As a thousand tiny flames danced in the evening breeze at sunset, a cello player performed a mournful piece of music by Bach. Authorities said the driver responsible for the collission, identified as 55-year-old John Wayne Johnston, of Total Transportation LLC, failed to slow down while traveling on Interstate 16 near Savannah and plowed into stop-and-go traffic. The tractor-trailer slammed into an SUV, then rolled over a small passenger car that burst into flames, said Sgt. 1st Class Chris Nease of the Georgia State Patrol.

'He said he wished he died too,' the witness told WSB-TV Thursday. St. Joseph's/ Candler Health System said the deceased students were commuting to St. Joseph's Hospital in Savannah for their last day of clinical training of the school year. 'The loss of any student, especially in a tragic way, is particularly painful,' Brooks Keel, president of Georgia Southern, said in a statement. 'Losing five students is almost incomprehensible.' The Georgia State Patrol said three people also were injured and seven vehicles were damaged. The crash occurred at about 6am in Bryan County, about 20 miles west of Savannah. Traffic was heavy at that hour because an unrelated wreck about a mile ahead that forced motorists to slow, Nease said. 'Traffic was sort of stop-and-go when the tractor-trailer came along and struck one of the passenger vehicles in the rear,' Nease said. 'We're still trying to piece it all together. It's a terrible day.' The university said the students were all Georgia residents in their junior year. Students weep and hold lit candles during the Memorial Service on Sweetheart Circle .

Fragrant tribute: Fellow nursing students and sorority sisters lay flowers in tribute to their deceased friends next to a poster board featuring the girls' photographs . Hospital officials said they were wrapping up clinical training for the year. 'You could tell they really loved what they did,' Sherry Danello, the hospital's chief nursing officer, said in a statement. 'They didn't just go through the task, they really connected to the patients.' The crash halted some motorists for more than six hours as road crews and tow trucks cleared the wreckage. Even when traffic began moving again, troopers kept a 6-mile stretch of eastbound I-16 closed as they investigated. Nease said the driver of the tractor-trailer, identified as John Johnson, from Shreveport, Louisiana, had not been cited as investigators worked to determine exactly what happened. Georgia authorities say it could take months before they decide whether to file criminal charges in the crash. Sgt. 1st Class Chris Nease, commander of the State Patrol Post investigating the crash, said Thursday he expects it will take several months for his team assigned to reconstruct the deadly crash to complete its report. Tom Durden, the district attorney for Bryan County where the collision occurred, said crash investigations can be complicated because it's not always obvious whether crimes were committed. 'There was no fog or smoke. It was clear as a bell,' said Sgt. Chris Rodewolt of the State Patrol. 'We did have heavy, heavy traffic.' Inferno: John Wayne Johnson's tractor-trailer plowed into traffic on Interstate 16, sparking a fiery pileup . Mangled: The five women, all of them juniors, were driving separately in two vehicles that were both mangled in the accident . Terrible accident: The Georgia State Patrol said three people also were injured and seven vehicles were damaged . WSB-TV reported that Johnson was employed by Total Transportation, a large trucking company based in Mississippi boasting 900 drivers and nearly 750 vehicles. US Department of Transportation safety records indicate that Total Transportation drivers have received 266 citations for driving violations and 600 maintenance violations over the past two years. During the same time period, company vehicles have been involved in 85 crashes leading to 27 injuries. Total Transportation CEO John Stomps issued a statement saying his company was cooperating with the investigation. Two mangled passenger vehicles rested Wednesday at the bottom of an embankment beside the interstate. In front of them, just off the highway, was a tractor-trailer with its cab smashed into the back of a tanker truck. Georgia Southern University flew flags at half-staff on campus Thursday morning, and a tear has been added to the school's eagle mascot in remembrance of the tragedy. The student leadership of the Student Nurses' Association, Kappa Delta Sorority, Alpha Delta Pi Sorority and Alpha Omicron Pi Sorority have invited the Georgia Southern community to a memorial that will be held Thursday at 7pm on campus on Sweetheart Circle. In mourning: Flags fly at half-staff at Georgia Southern University on Thursday, while senior Katie Pursley, 21, shows a drawing of the school mascot, an eagle, with a tear to symbolize the grief of the university . It is with a heavy heart that I inform you of a tragedy that took place this morning. Several Georgia Southern students died and two were injured in an early morning crash on I-16 eastbound near Savannah. We are unable to release the names of these students at this time because we are awaiting notification to families. Every one of our students contributes in no small measure, to the Eagle Nation. The loss of any student, especially in a tragic way, is particularly painful. Losing five students is almost incomprehensible. Our hearts go out to the families, friends and classmates of these students. The University flag will fly at half-staff Thursday in their memory. Memorial arrangements are pending. Let me urge those particularly touched by this tragedy to avail themselves of counseling services, and I urge all members of the University community to support each other during this time.

There was a bit of a fuss made of the move at the time, with brothers Jay, plus twins Cole and Rio, compared with the trio of Wallace siblings who created history when they played together in a first-team game for Southampton against Sheffield Wednesday on October 22, 1988. On Wednesday, Jay Dasilva, the eldest of the three children, who left Luton Town’s academy to make the 100-mile round trip, three or fours times a week, in their mum Alison’s Rover to Chelsea’s Cobham training base, turns 17. He is earmarked first team potential. Chelsea's kids have been buoyed by Jose Mourinho's insistence on promoting young players at the club . Dominic Solanke (right) celebrates scoring in the FA Youth Cup final first leg victory over Manchester City . In an environment where the competition is fierce and the temptation is to spend big in the transfer market, Jose Mourinho made the surprise announcement that he will promote one of Chelsea’s youngsters next season. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, a powerful, muscular presence in Chelsea’s development teams, will be with the first-team squad at the start of pre-season. Those with an intimate knowledge of Jay Dasilva’s progress at Chelsea over the past three seasons believe this first-year scholar is not far behind. A week ago Dasilva returned to the national conscience when Ian Wright claimed he was ‘better than any other Premier League left back’ after Chelsea became UEFA youth champions in Switzerland. Among a group of players that includes Leighton Baines, Kieran Gibbs and Luke Shaw, at England level alone, plus Chelsea’s first-choice left back Cesar Azpilicueta, it was certainly an audacious claim by the former Arsenal striker. John Terry is the last player to come through Chelsea's youth ranks and become a first-team regular . Terry broke into the Chelsea team in 1999, but the club has been unable to unearth a stellar talent since . He moved through the junior teams at pace, settling at left back after spells as a winger, and is one of the most level-headed young players at the club. At his old school in Luton, he was head boy. When he travelled to Paphos, Cyprus, for a European Championship qualifier with England last October, he revealed that one of his motivations was to stay ahead of his kid brothers in the family pecking order. ‘They keep me on my toes and they’re after me, so I need to keep working hard to stay ahead of them,’ he admitted. ‘It’s great to have all three of us at Chelsea. We have played together since we were young, so hopefully that will happen at senior level one day.’ They are a remarkable football family, with dad Trevor well known in the parks game in Luton. His eldest son Ryan was a professional with Luton. Jay Dasilva is a promising young player on the Blues' books, along with two of his brothers . The young left back is forging a bright reputation for himself and was recently hailed as a star by Ian Wright . Dasilva beats Norwich's Reece Hall-Johnson to the ball during a Premier League International Cup match . Last week he was in Nyon, Switzerland, joining in with his team-mates when they poured a bucket of ice over their coach Adrian Viveash as Chelsea’s Under 19 team celebrated becoming UEFA Youth League Champions. At the time of the final, which Chelsea won 3-2 against Shakhtar Donetsk, after beating Roma 4-0 in the semi-final, the defender was playing three years up on his age group. He is a big talent. On Monday evening he returned to Chelsea’s Under 18 side, playing left back as they won the first leg of the Youth Cup final against Manchester City at the Etihad Campus 3-1. Last year, when he had only just turned 16, the academy scholar scored in the thrilling 7-6 aggregate victory in the FA Youth Cup triumph over Fulham. Despite the progress of Dasilva, along with many other young players in Chelsea’s lavish academy system, there is a good deal of scepticism about their chances of making the first team. Two years ago Nathaniel Chalobah was regarded among the most talented teenagers in the country when he spent a season on loan with Watford in the Championship. Mourinho, who was about to quit Real Madrid to return to Chelsea, was compelled to make a flying visit to England to watch Chalobah in the Championship play-off final against Crystal Palace in 2013. Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been guaranteed a chance to make his mark in the Chelsea first-team squad . But Nathaniel Chalobah (centre) shows that Chelsea's young players must take their chance when it comes . Chalobah was the big hope at Chelsea's academy, but he did not shine when Mourinho made a special trip to watch him when he played for Watford in the Championship play-off final (right). Now he is on loan at Reading . On the big day Chalobah disappointed, missing an opportunity to make an impression on the incoming Chelsea manager before his return to English football had been officially confirmed. Chalobah had been the big hope in academy circles, the one player Chelsea’s academy director Neil Bath hoped could break the run, stretching back to 1999, since a youth-team graduate became a first-team regular. They need no reminders that man was captain John Terry. Still, it is also something of a myth that Mourinho will not give youth a chance because he won the 2004 Champions League final with Porto by playing three players from the club’s academy system. Goalkeeper Vitor Baia, central defender Ricardo Carvalho and his partner at the back Jorge Costa had all progressed through the youth ranks at Estadio do Dragao. The challenge for Dasilva next season, when he becomes a second-year scholar, is to prove to the manager that he can take his chance during impromptu training sessions with the first team. Azpilicueta and Filipe Luis are the established left backs in the squad, fighting it out for a starting position each week in Chelsea’s first team. As every player at Chelsea soon discovers, they cannot be around forever.","Jay Dasilva building a strong reputation in Chelsea's youth system .

"A few weeks ago, some members of Tottenham’s ground staff thought the club’s principal owner Joe Lewis had arrived for an impromptu visit to the training ground when a Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe pulled into the car park. Lewis is an infrequent visitor to England, exiled for tax and lifestyle purposes in the Bahamas, where he conducts much of his business on his enormous yacht. Results on the pitch had taken a bit of a downturn and there was an air of anticipation when the driver got out to open the door for his wealthy passenger. Emmanuel Adebayor pictured on his last start for Tottenham against Aston Villa back in early November . Adebayor travelled in style to training earlier this year in a Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe . AGE: 31 . NATIONALITY: Togo . CLUBS . Mets (2001-2003):  53 appearances, 19 goals . Monaco (2003-2006): 115 apps, 26 goals . Arsenal (2006-2009): 142 apps, 62 goals . Man City (2009-2012): 45 apps, 19 goals . Real Madrid (2011): 22 apps, 8 goals . Tottenham (2011-): 106 apps, 41 goals . HONOURS . Monaco - Champions League runner-up (2003-04) Real Madrid - Copa del Rey (2010-11) It was then that the grinning figure of Emmanuel Adebayor emerged, throwing sand in the face of his employers with another outlandish display of his extravagant lifestyle. He went on to train as normal with the first team, while his driver waited in the Rolls before returning the forward to his London home shortly after Mauricio Pochettino had finished the morning session. Since Adebayor’s last start in the Barclays Premier League for Tottenham, when he was dragged off the pitch after 58 minutes at Aston Villa on November 2, he has pocketed £3.4million in wages. It was that day at Villa Park when Harry Kane came on as a substitute, scoring his first Premier League goal of the season for Spurs and diving, Jurgen Klinsmann-style, in front of the travelling fans after he scored the winner. By then Adebayor had taken his seat on the bench after one of the most listless, lifeless displays of his entire career. That day he had just 32 touches of the ball and none of them were good. On the bad days at Spurs, when he is in a particularly confrontational mood, he tells people that he is only prepared to leave Tottenham if they can fix a move to Real Madrid or Chelsea. He played for Real once before, a short-term solution for Jose Mourinho during his spell at the Bernabeu, and he has always craved the chance to play for Chelsea. This has not been a good year. He has scored just twice - in the 4-0 victory over QPR on August 24 and the defeat by Newcastle on October 26 - under their new head coach. Adebayor has spent a large chunk of the campaign on the substitutes' bench for Tottenham . Adebayor's last goal was against Newcastle in October - one of only two scored this season . This is the final year that Manchester City will make a contribution to his salary, topping up his £100,000-a-week wages at White Hart Lane with another £70,000 each week as part of the deal that took him south. They, like Tottenham, did not get their money’s worth out of him either. His last appearance for Pochettino was as a substitute on March 15, sent on to the pitch at Old Trafford when the team were already 3-0 down against Manchester United. He has no future at Spurs. Last season, Tim Sherwood made a point of saying his job was ‘to manage men’ when Adebayor went through something of a renaissance under the former Tottenham head coach. Getting him off the wage bill this summer will be a problem, with Spurs in hock to him for one final year on £100,000 a week until his contract expires on June 30, 2016. Talks aimed at removing him from the list of players on the club’s wage bill are already underway, but Adebayor will not go easily. Naturally, like anyone else in his position, he will want his money. This could have been solved in February, when West Ham came to the table with an offer to take the forward on loan for the rest of the season. Darren Dein, son of former Arsenal vice president David, was brokering a deal that gave West Ham, Adebayor and Tottenham the option to make his move permanent. Throw in the £75,000 a week the Hammers were willing to contribute to his complicated salary and it looked like pretty good business for Tottenham . Adebayor did have something of a renaissance under former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood (right) Adebayor, pictured during a session, turned up at training in a Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe . Harry Kane (left) has 30 goals in all competitions for Tottenham this season . Daniel Levy’s intransigence on the issue is well known, highlighted by David Gold’s tweet - ‘no matter how hard you try there are some people out there that you just can’t do business with’ - when the deal collapsed. In recent weeks Adebayor has been named a substitute on occasion, making up the numbers on the bench because of an injury to another troubled forward, Roberto Soldado. The thing with Adebayor is that it is not all bad, despite goading his employers with pictures on his Instagram account when he is goofing around at home when his team are travelling for a Europa League tie. He is capable of extreme acts of generosity, such as the house he rented out in Rio de Janeiro for all his friends and their girlfriends last summer during the World Cup. Adebayor footed the bill for the lot. As ever, though, Adebayor’s clubs will continue to pay the biggest price.","Emmanuel Adebayor is behind Harry Kane and Roberto Soldado at Spurs .

"Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez has been moved to a new prison a week after he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life behind bars. A state prisons official says Hernandez, 25, was moved Wednesday to the maximum-security Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Massachusetts. Hernandez had been at Cedar Junction prison in Walpole since he was convicted April 15 of killing 27-year-old Odin Lloyd in 2013. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Scroll down for video . Aaron Hernandez, 25, was convicted on April 15 of killing 27-year-old Odin Lloyd (right) in 2013. He was sentenced to life in prison . Though Hernandez spent his first week after being convicted at Cedar Junction prison, he was moved on Wednesday to Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center (pictured) in Shirley, Massachusetts . Sousa-Baranowski Correctional Center is a maximum-security prison about 40 miles west of Boston, Massachusetts . Souza-Baranowski is the state Department of Correction's newest prison. It opened in 1998 and is about 40 miles west of Boston. It houses more than 1,000 inmates, many of whom are serving life sentences, and is named for two department employees killed during a failed escape attempt in 1972. Souza-Baranowski is considered the most advanced prison in the state by the state Department of Corrections, according to the Boston Herald. The facility has 366 cameras recording live 24 hours a day and a microwave detection perimeter with taut wire, according to CNN. Inmates in the prison are sent there because they 'present serious escape risks or pose serious threats to themselves, to other inmates, to staff, or the orderly running of the institution. Supervision of inmates is direct and constant'. Hernandez's new prison is about ten minues was from Fort Devens, where Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been held for the last two years . Hernandez will be Souza's most famous inmate. Larry Levine, a former federal inmate who now advises offenders heading to prison, said that some staff will treat him like anyone else, while some might ask Hernandez for his autograph . There are several placement options for an inmate at Souza: solitary confinement; a less harsh but still restricted block, general population; 'lifers block', for those serving life sentences; and the 'kitchen block', for those who work in the prison kitchen. It is unknown which area Hernandez will be put into. Hernandez will be Souza's most famous inmate yet, according to CNN. 'There will be a lot of staff that will treat him like an animal that he is, but there will be other staff that will want his autograph and treat him like a star,' said Larry Levine, a former federal inmate who spent 10 years in high- and minimum-security prisons and founded Wall Street Prison Consultants, which advises offenders and convicts heading to prison. It is unknown which cell block Hernandez will be placed in: solitary confinement; a less harsh but still restricted block, general population; 'lifers block', for those serving life sentences; and the 'kitchen block', for those who work in the prison kitchen . A corrections officer hands an inmate his meal through a small opening between the mess hall and the kitchen at Souza-Baranowski. This is how Hernandez will receive his meals . Ninety per cent of the inmates at the prison are locked in their cells, which include a bunk, toilet and sink combination, a small writing shelf, and a stool affixed to the floor, are locked in their cells for 19 hours a day. There is a shelf for a TV, which inmates can buy for about $200. The cells have two windows - one on the room's door that has slots for hand, middle and ankle cuffing, and a second that looks out to a wall, buildings or trees that is approximately 4in by 20in. On the same day as Hernandez's relocation, Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, said in a press conference that she will call Hernandez as a witness in the civil suit against him. In his new cell, Hernandez will be staying about ten minutes from Fort Devens, where for the last two years Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been held, according to WPRI. A corrections officer monitored the security camera system at Souza-Baranowski, where 366 cameras are used to monitor inmate activity . Electronics such as televisions, fans, and typewriters that can be purchased by inmates are clear so corrections officers know if they have been opened or tampered with .

"Hollywood star Robert Downey Jnr stormed out of a TV interview when asked about his history of drug abuse and time in prison. The actor was furious when the line of questioning suddenly got personal in a recorded chat with Channel 4 in  London to promote his new film Avengers: Age of Ultron. He had been on good form when the exchange started - in which, as arranged, he would discuss his experiences on the new blockbuster which premiered in Britain on Tuesday. But he could be seen getting visibly uncomfortable when interviewer Krishnan Guru-Murthy began asking about his long-conquered personal demons. Scroll down for video . Calling time: During an interview for Avengers: Age of Ultron, Robert Downey Jnr left mid-way through . He's off: When asked about his relationship with his father, Downey Jnr gets up and says: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out . 'It's all getting very Diane Sawyer in here': Robert clearly didn't appreciate the line of questioning . Didn't go according to plan, Krishnan? The Channel 4 news presenter was left visibly embarrassed . Specifically, the news anchor asked Downey Jr to explain a comment in a five year-old interview with the New York Times, in which he said: 'You can't go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal.' Responding, Downey Jr, 50, said: 'I could pick that apart for two hours and be no closer to the truth than giving you some half-arsed answer right now. I couldn't even tell you what a liberal is.' But, when asked about his relationship with his father, Downey Jnr gets up and says: 'I'm sorry, I really don't... what are we doing?' before walking out of the interview. Seemingly amused with the reaction, Guru-Murthy can be seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert's clip-on microphone. At that point he turns and says: 'It's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer [a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing].' Off to a good start: Downey Jr was charming as the exchange started - in which, as arranged, he would discuss his experiences on the new blockbuster, which premiered in London on Tuesday . Getting personal: But when Guru-Murthy asked questions about his long-conquered personal demons, the star could be seen getting visibly uncomfortable . Clearly wanting to keep a dignified silence on the matter, the veteran star - who originates from Manhattan and has battled both drug addiction and prison - resisted the temptation to make reference to the incident on Twitter. Unlike him, however, Krishnan twice shared details - captioning one video 'A steely moment from Ironman'. But viewers weren't impressed, with nearly three-hundred 'disliking' it within hours. Tellingly, the comments which followed shared a similar opinion. One wrote: 'God, Krish you can be an a--. When your interviewee is uncomfortable, don't keep pressing them. Props to RDJ for ending it.' Another simply said: 'No class at all.' Downey Jr had a period between 1996 and 2001 during which he was arrested multiple times - mostly for drug charges. Not happy: The 50 year-old actor remained professional, but was clearly upset by the random questions . This dark phase in his life culminated in 1999 when he was sentenced to three years in prison for repeatedly missing drug testing. He spent a year in California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison, before he was released in a surprise ruling. He had one other arrest in 2001 for drug possession, but has maintained a studiously clean life since then. He's mounted a massive career comeback, the crown jewel of which have been his massively successful role as egotistical billionaire superhero Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Over the course of four movies, he has grossed nearly $4billion in worldwide ticket sales. The fifth movie featuring Iron Man, Avengers: Age of Ultron, promises to be yet another box office smash. Forbes estimated that between June 2012 and June 2013 alone, he made more than $75million. Troubled: Between 1996 and 2001, Downey Jr. had multiple run-ins with the law and several arrests on drug-related charges. He was sentenced to three years of prison, but ended up spending on a year . 1971 - Robert Downey Sr starts supplying his six-year-old son with marijuana . 1991 - Breaks up with girlfriend Sarah Jessica Parker because of his drug issues . May 1992 - Marries actress/singer Deborah Falconer after 42-day courtship . September 1993 - Birth of Indio Downey . April 1996 - Arrested for possessing heroin, cocaine, and unloaded handgun while speeding down Sunset Boulevard . May 1996 - While on parole, a high Downey trespasses on neighbor's home and is found passed out in one of the beds. Sentenced to three years probation and compulsory drug testing. 1997 - Misses court-ordered drug test and spends four months in L.A. County jail . 1999 - Misses another court-ordered drug test and spends the next year in California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and state prison in Corcoran, California . 2000 - Released early from prison on $5,000 bail and goes on to secure celebrated role on Ally McBeal . Thanksgiving 2000 - Arrested at Palm Springs spa after police search his room and find Downey under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of cocaine and Valium . 2001 - Splits with Falconer, who gains custody of Indio . April 2001 - Officer finds Downey wandering barefoot in Culver City and arrests him on suspicion of being under the influence of drugs. Tests show he had cocaine in his system . July 2001 - Pleads no contest to Palm Springs charges, and avoids jail time. Is sent to rehab instead and put on three-year probation . January 2003 - Appears in film The Singing Detective, after friend Mel Gibson pays his insurance bond for the movie. July 2003 - Downey achieves sobriety . August 2005 - Marries film producer Susan Levin . February 2012 - Son Exton Elias Downey is born . October 2013 - Indio Downey sent to rehab for prescription drug abuse . Last June, a 20-year-old Indio (seen here in 2007) was arrested on drug charges. His father blamed the genetic predisposition to drug abuse that seems to run in the family . Classy: Wanting to keep a dignified silence on the matter, the star - who originates from Manhattan - resisted the temptation to make reference to it on Twitter . Fighting fit: Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Captain America, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk . Cast: Andy Serkis, Jeremy Renner, Paul Bettany, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Chris Evans, Elizabeth Olsen, Robert Downey Jr and Mark Ruffalo attend the European premiere . He has been praised by co-stars as a model of post-addiction focus and poise. In an interview to promote Sherlock Holmes, costar Rachel McAdams said that his efforts to stay clean are 'superheroic.' He maintains he's been entirely sober since July 2003. In interviews, he credits meditation, yoga, 12-step recovery programs and the support of his second wife, film producer Susan Downey. Last June, his son Indio was arrested on felony drug charges. When he bailed his son out of jail, Downey Jr. seemed to blame himself for his son's fall. 'Unfortunately there's a genetic component to addiction and Indio has likely inherited it.,' he said. Quentin Tarantino . Robert Downey Jr is not the first Hollywood star to be upset by Krishnan Guru-Murthy's interview technique - last year director Quentin Tarantino also objected to his line of questioning. The Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction director launched an extraordinary tirade after refusing to answer questions about movie violence. He said: 'I'm not your slave and you are not my master. You can't make me dance to your tune. I'm not a monkey.' Towards the end of the interview he rebuffed further questions on the topic, telling Guru-Murthy: 'I'm shutting your butt down.' Joan Rivers . Actress and comedienne Joan Rivers stormed off the set of a CNN interview in July last year. Rivers contended that she was there to discuss to her new book, Diary Of A Mad Diva, but was instead accused of coming across as ‘mean’ on TV show Fashion Police. She was also questioned about wearing fur when she was an animal rights activist. 'This whole interview is turning into a defensive interview,' Rivers announced. 'Are you wearing leather shoes? Then shut up,' she said. Naomi Campbell . Supermodel Naomi Campbell lost her cool and angrily knocked away a camera after being quizzed over allegations she was given a 'blood diamond' by the deposed African despot Charles Taylor. 'I didn't receive a diamond and I'm not going to speak about that,' Campbell told reporters before walking out of an interview in 2010 and punching the camera in a producer's hand. Cate Blanchett . The actress swore on national television during interview on TV program The Project in March this year. The Oscar-winning star came prepared to answer questions about her new Disney film Cinderella, but was faced with increasingly eccentric topics, including drinking beer. The exasperated actress finally reached breaking point at the end of the Q&A, when Channel Ten journalist Jonathan Hyla asked her about a cat that appeared in the fantasy flick. Turning around to look for her publicist, a confused and annoyed Blanchett fired back: 'That's your question? That's your f****** question?","Was promoting Avengers: Age of Ultron in interview for Channel 4 in UK .

"The parents of Michael Brown have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city of Ferguson over the fatal shooting of their son by a white police officer, a confrontation that sparked a national protest movement. Attorneys for Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., filed the complaint at the St. Louis County Courthouse on Thursday and called a news conference to announce that the case would bring to light new forensic evidence and raise doubts about the police version of events. The lawsuit is seeking $75,000 in compensation, as well as unspecified punitive damages, and calls for a court order prohibiting the use of police techniques 'that demean, disregard, or underserve its African-American population'. Scroll down for video . Attorney Anthony Gray speaks as Michael Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden, second from left, and Michael Brown Sr., right, listen along with attorney Benjamin Crump, left, during Thursday's news conference . The family's lawsuit is seeking $75,000 in compensation, as well as unspecified punitive damages, and calls for a court order prohibiting the use of police techniques 'that demean, disregard, or underserve its African-American population' Brown's parents didn't speak, but Lesley McSpadden wore a red hoodie bearing her son's likeness, while Mike Brown Sr. wore a St. Louis Cardinals snapback and a hoodie that said, 'Mike Brown chosen for change'. The new lawsuit alleges that Officer Darren Wilson destroyed evidence after he shot Brown on the street of the St. Louis suburb last August, saying he washed blood off his hands and cleared and bagged the gun used in the shooting. 'We expect to put on evidence that you never heard about before, that you have never seen,' Anthony Gray, one of the lawyers for Brown's family, said at Thursday's news conference. The civil suit claims Brown had his hands up in surrender when he was killed, a claim strongly disputed during the previous investigation. Gray said evidence had not been presented properly in the previous investigations and he criticized the prosecutor who had presented the case to a grand jury. 'The evidence has not changed, but the presentation of that evidence will,' he said of the civil lawsuit. The civil lawsuit names the city of Ferguson, former Police Chief Thomas Jackson and former police officer Darren Wilson as defendants. 'We expect to put on evidence that you never heard about before, that you have never seen,' said Anthony Gray, left, during Thursday's press conference . Wilson 'unjustifiably shot and killed (Brown), using an unnecessary and unreasonable amount (of) force in violation of (Brown's) constitutionally guaranteed right to life,' the lawsuit states. Jackson, who resigned last month, is included because he 'maintained general supervision' of Wilson and 'was also responsible for his hiring, training and retention,' the lawsuit states. If it comes to trial, the lawsuit could force a full review of all the evidence in the shooting and bring key witnesses to be questioned in open court, including Wilson. Attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters that the alleged subterfuge with which investigators handled the Wilson probe is indicative of a national trend. He cited the cases of Eric Garner, Floyd Dent, Tamir Riceand Antonio Zambrano-Montes. 'The narrative of the law enforcement all across the country for shooting unarmed people of color is the same: That they had no other choice,'  Crump said. 'But time and time again, the objective evidence contradicts the standard police narrative.' The lawsuit also lists incidents of alleged unlawful stops and arrests of African-Americans in Ferguson. It asks for the court to assign a monitor to the city's police force for five years or until 'the city of Ferguson has fully and effectually trained all of its police officers on the constitutional requirements of the use of deadly force.' Lesley McSpadden, the mother of Michael Brown, wore a sweatshirt remembering her son during Thursday's new conference, left, while Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, as also in attendance . Brown, 18, was unarmed and walking in the street with a friend on August 9 when Wilson told them to move to the sidewalk. That led to a heated confrontation and a scuffle between Wilson and Brown inside Wilson's squad car. Wilson shot Brown after the scuffle spilled into the street. Some witnesses said Brown was trying to surrender, but Wilson said Brown was moving toward him aggressively, forcing him to shoot. Brown's shooting led to sometimes-violent protests and spawned a national Black Lives Matter movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities. In the end, local and federal authorities ruled that the shooting was justified. A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November. But the Justice Department released a scathing report citing racial bias and profiling in the Ferguson Police Department and a profit-driven municipal court system that frequently targets black residents. Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge. The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails. Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, in a St. Louis suburb in August 2014. Wilson resigned in November . Civil cases generally require a lower standard of proof than criminal cases. Jurors must find a preponderance of evidence, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt needed to convict in a criminal trial. Two decades ago, football star O.J. Simpson was acquitted of the killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. But a civil jury awarded the Brown and Goldman families $33.5 million in wrongful-death damages. The family of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed man killed by police in 1999, settled with New York City for $3 million in 2004 after filing a $60 million lawsuit. The city did not admit any wrongdoing. The settlement came after four officers indicted in his shooting were acquitted of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment. Wrongful-death lawsuits have been filed in other recent high-profile cases, too. In New York, the family of Eric Garner is seeking $75 million in damages. Garner, who was black and had asthma, died in July after a white plainclothes officer applied what a medical examiner determined was a chokehold after Garner was accused of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes on a city street.

"Middlesbrough bounced back from defeat to Watford with a convincing 2-0 win over struggling Rotherham United. After losing by the same scoreline on Easter Monday, Aitor Karanka's kept their automatic promotion hopes alive with their 14th home win of the season thanks to second-half goals by Lee Tomlin and Patrick Bamford, who also missed a late penalty.

Lee Tomlin (centre) scored the opening goal in Middlesbrough's 2-0 win at home to Rotherham on Saturday . Tomlin (centre) is mobbed by his Middlesbrough team-mates after his fine solo effort gives them the lead . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Gibson, Ayala (Woodgate, 70), Friend, Clayton (Whitehead, 79),  Forshaw,  Adomah, Tomlin (Nsue Lopez, 85),  Bamford, Garcia Martinez. Subs not used: Ripley, Vossen, Amorebieta, Wildschut . Goals: Tomlin 50, Bamford 66 .

Booked: Arnason, Frecklington . Referee: Iain Williamson . Attendance: 19,537 . After a quiet start, Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute, returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez's hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half-hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala's header was cleared off the line before Tomlin's follow-up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area, but Martinez did well to get down to it, and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward, allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford, but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post. Patrick Bamford (left) doubled the Teesiders' lead on 66 minutes with a cool left-footed finish . The 21-year-old celebrates his strike, taking his personal tally to 16 league goals this season so far . But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford's first-time half-volley was easily saved by Martinez at his near post. Sub Emilio Nsue should have made it three with two minutes to go when he had an open goal but his shot was deflected just wide. And from the resulting corner Kike met Adam Forshaw's ball with a thumping header which Martinez had to tip over the bar. Bamford should have bagged his 17th goal of the season when Richard Wood brought Kike down in the area, but the forward's poor spot-kick was saved by Martinez. However, the on loan Chelsea star failed to add to his tally late on when he saw his penalty saved .","Lee Tomlin's superb solo effort gave Middlesbrough a 50th minute lead .

Bamford could have made it 3-0 but saw his penalty saved late on .

"When a rubber dinghy carrying around 100 African refugees across the Mediterranean began to sink, a Nigerian Christian prayed for his life in an innocent act that would end in the deaths of 12 fellow migrants. One of the Muslims on board the rickety craft ordered him to stop, saying: 'Here, we only pray to Allah.' When he refused, a violent fight ensued and 12 Christians drowned when they were thrown overboard by the Muslim refugees. The tragic news comes amid reports that an unprecedented 10,000 refugees fleeing war and persecution in Africa have been rescued by Italian ships in the past week. Scroll down for videos . Desperate: Nigerian Muslims on a dinghy carrying around 100 African refugees across the Mediterranean became angry when one Christian passenger began praying for his life (refugees in Sicily pictured) Furious: When he refused to stop, the Muslim migrants threw 12 Christians off the rickety boat (refugees in Sicily pictured) Rescue: Meanwhile another boat transporting migrants arrives at a port in Messina after finding them adrift in the Mediterranean . Refugees: These migrants are among the 10,000 refugees fleeing war and persecution in Africa who have been rescued by Italian ships in the past week . But over 900 making the perilous journey have either died or gone missing since the start of the year and 400 migrants died in two shipwrecks last week. Those who witnessed the African Christians being murdered on the crammed dinghy told investigators how Nigerian Muslims became angry at Christian who started praying. 'They told him that they would throw him overboard if he didn't stop praying to God,' he said, according to La Republica. The witness added: 'They started shouting, two pushed the lad and he fell in the sea and drowned.' The Muslims 'went mad' and began screaming ""Allah is great"" before they attacked migrants who tried to defend the boy, according to The Times. When 12 migrants were mercilessly thrown overboard, the other Christians formed a human chain and protected themselves against the attackers by clinging to the dinghy. A rescue ship arrived one hour later, according to a Ghanaian witness called Yeboah. Italian police arrested 15 people suspected of the killing including Ousmane Camar from the Ivory Coast. Exodus: The UN said that 23,500 migrants had sailed to Italy (pictured) this year in addition to 12,000 who had sailed to Greece . Killer: Italian police arrested 15 people suspected of killing the Christian refugees, including Ousmane Camar from the Ivory Coast (refugees in Sicily pictured) Injured: A six-month old baby with severe burns on her face was among traumatised survivors of another sea rescue near Italy's Lampedusa Island on Friday (refugees in Sicily pictured) The 21-year-old was identified by the wound on his big toe which he received when a migrant he threw overboard bit him. The boat's passengers reportedly looked distressed when it finally arrived in the port of Palermo in southern-Italy on Wednesday. A six-month old baby with severe burns on her face was among traumatised survivors of another sea rescue near Italy's Lampedusa Island on Friday. The infant was one of 70 refugees on board the half-inflated rubber dinghy that was rescued by the Italian coastguard after two days adrift on the Mediterranean Sea. Many of the migrants on board suffered horrific burns from a gas explosion before departing from Libya, but were forced on the smugglers' boat without treatment. The UN Refugee Agency said the explosion occurred at a holding centre run by smugglers who demand thousands of pounds for a place on the dangerous boats. Shocking: A six-month old baby with severe burns on her face was among traumatised survivors of another sea rescue near Italy's Lampedusa Island on Friday (file photo) Several people died in the tragic accident and many more were injured, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' spokesperson. Barbara Molinario said: 'The traffickers would not allow them to leave and reach the hospital so they did not get treatment for a few days. And then they were put on a boat.' Another UN spokesperson Carlotta Sami said: 'They were held in Libya for two to three days without being given medical care then forced onto a dinghy which began to sink immediately . She claimed to 'have never before seen cruelty like this' as the migrants' burns were exposed to blistering heat and salt water for two days at sea. The UN said that 23,500 migrants had sailed to Italy this year in addition to 12,000 who had sailed to Greece.","Nigerian Muslims threw 12 Christians overboard when he refused to stop .

"Just days after Bruce Jenner's powerful interview with Diane Sawyer, another transgender person is making a monumental television appearance. Starting in May, Scott Turner Schofield will become the first transgender man to have a recurring role on a daytime soap opera when he appears on The Bold and the Beautiful. It will mark the television acting debut of Schofield, who is a performer, speaker and author known for his one-person shows that address transgender issues. Scroll down for video . Major moment: Scott Turner Schofield (left, with Thorsten Kaye) has landed a role on the popular soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful . Major figure: Schofield (left, right in high school) is a speaker and author known for his one-person shows that address transgender issues . The New York Daily News reports that Schofield will be playing Nick, a mentor of sorts to the character of Maya Avant, played by Karla Mosley. Avant is struggling with her gender identity in her current storyline on the show. 'I’m Maya’s best friend and I come from her world when she first landed in Los Angeles before she became the huge success that she is,' said Schofield. 'We met in the trans community together. I’m her friend that comes in and kind of help remind her that she is beautiful and whole and authentic exactly as she is.' Schofield, then added that much of the storyline will have to do with the discrimination members of the community face, and for that reason the role seemed in many ways as if he were playing himself.

Schofield also reassured any concerned individuals that the show was making this a positive portrayal of a transgender person, and the struggles they face. 'It's going in the direction that transgender people can be happy about,' he said. 'And not only transgender people, but everyone who knows and loves a transgender person.'

"Fulham will sound out Brentford manager Mark Warburton about taking over at Craven Cottage with owner Shahid Khan planning to release a budget of £20million to spend on new players. The Championship strugglers are deliberating over the future of Kit Symons who replaced Felix Magath in September but has won only one of his last eight games. Khan, a billionaire who also owns NFL franchise Jacksonville Jaguars in America, has given his new chief football officer Mike Rigg the power to choose Fulham's next manager and he is looking at different options despite a good personal relationship with Symons. Fulham will sound out Brentford manager Mark Warburton about taking over at Craven Cottage . Warburton's impressive record at west London rivals Brentford has made him a leading contender alongside Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy. Warburton got Brentford promoted from League One and they have been surprise play-off contenders in The Championship this season doing the league double over Fulham along the way. It has already been announced he will be leaving The Bees at the end of the season with QPR also interested in his services along with assistant David Weir. But Rangers, who have 14 players out of contract and face a huge fine if they are relegated, won't have the same spending power to offer Warburton as The Cottagers. Waburton (right) signals to his players during Brentford's 1-1 draw with Derby County on Saturday . Symons wants to be given the chance of signing his own players and having a full season at Craven Cottage with them, but recent results are going against him. Fulham are conscious of FPP rules and with parachute payments from the Premier League due to run out, they feel the next transfer window may be the last opportunity to spend big to get them back into the top flight. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce could also be a shock contender with Khan prepared to invest to get Fulham back in the Premier League. Allardyce's current deal at Upton Park runs out in the summer but he would like to stay in London.

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. 1. Dick Advocaat might consider bringing in referee Anthony Taylor to give his players some lessons on keeping up with play. The official sprinted more than half the length of the field to be 10 yards from Yannick Bolasie when he completed his hat-trick for Crystal Palace in the 4-1 demolition of Sunderland. Top marks for him – but none at all for Lee Cattermole who was goal side of Bolasie before the breakaway began, yet way behind the official when the goal went in. Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson were also both stood nearer their own goal than the ref when James McArthur’s clearance began the move, but nowhere to be seen when the ball hit the net. Yannick Bolasie raced past Lee Cattermole before scoring his hat-trick goal against Sunderland . Cattermole was goal side of Bolasie before the Crystal Palace winger went on to score his third goal . Referee Anthony Taylor sprinted past Sunderland midfielder Cattermole during Bolasie's impessive run . Bolasie starred in Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . 2. Gary Cahill has responded to the challenge of fighting Kurt Zouma for his place in Chelsea’s defence and looks to be winning the battle. When it got tough for the Premier League leaders at Loftus Road it was Cahill who responded best to ensure Cesc Fabregas’ late striker was a winner. Cahill made 15 clearances – as many as the rest of Chelsea’s back four put together – and won 13 of 15 duels for the ball. Gary Cahill has managed to win back his starting spot alongside John Terry after his brief absence . Chelsea starlet Kurt Zouma had deputised for Cahill during the England international's stint on the sidelines . 3. Arsene Wenger’s decision to axe goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny after fining him for smoking in the showers at Southampton has proved a pivotal point of Arsenal’s season. The 1-0 victory at Burnley was the sixth clean sheet the Gunners had kept in 12 Premier League games since David Ospina took over – one more than they’d achieved in the previous 20. More important, Arsenal have won 11 of those matches to move from sixth in the table to second. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has kept six clean sheets since replacing Wojciech Szczesny . 4. Vincent Kompany’s recovery from a hamstring injury was supposed to be the boost Manchester City needed towards the end of the season but instead has marked the collapse of their campaign. City were in the middle of a 14-game unbeaten run when their skipper came back to face title rivals Arsenal at the end of January – a game they lost 2-0. The 4-2 collapse at Old Trafford made it 14 matches since then, of which City have lost eight. Belgian star Kompany has missed only one of them – a 2-0 win over Leicester which saw one of only three clean sheets. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has struggled for form during the past few weeks . 5. West Brom’s 'Jeff Astle day' provided a nostalgic trip back in time, with Albion’s players wearing replica kit from the 1968 FA Cup final and shirts numbered from two to 11 (goalkeeper Boaz Myhill wore no number, like John Osborne back then). But there was one aspect that was completely out of keeping with the flashback to football’s black and white days – every one of Albion’s players wore coloured boots. Four red pairs, two orange, two white, one blue, one yellow – and captain Darren Fletcher’s purplish pinky colour made up the modern footwear rainbow. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher wore multicoloured boots on 'Jeff Astle day' at The Hawthorns . 6. When Paul Lambert was sacked in early February, Aston Villa had scored just 15 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. It’s taken Tim Sherwood just 10 games to overtake that total – Christian Benteke’s winner at White Hart Lane was the 16th scored since his appointment. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has returned to form since Tim Sherwood's arrival at Villa Park . 7. James Ward-Prowse backed up manager Ronald Koeman’s faith by tucking away the penalty against Hull that put Southampton on the path to a 2-0 win. Koeman had to shout orders from the bench to let the England youngster take the kick as Senegalese striker Sadio Mane picked up the ball to head for the spot first. You couldn’t blame Mane for wanting to jump the queue – Ward-Prowse had never scored a Premier League goal in 68 previous appearances for the Saints, and none of his four England Under 21 strikes had come from the penalty spot. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman ensured James Ward-Prowse took penalty ahead of Sadio Mane . 8. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan has timed his return to fitness perfectly after 16 horrible months recovering from a cruciate knee ligament operation. The London-born product of the Royals’ youth academy got through 73 minutes of the 0-0 draw with Blackburn in his first start for 16 months – just in time to be available for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal. He has a good chance of playing at Wembley after helping make the defence more solid. It was the first time Steve Clarke’s side had kept a clean sheet in their last nine Championship games. Reading's Jem Karacan made his first start for 16 months against Blackburn on Saturday afternoon . 9. Taking 50 points is normally a guarantee of safety from relegation in League One – it’s been enough to stay up for all but one of the last nine years (Gillingham had 50 but went down on goal difference in 2010) This season looks like being different, though, after Crewe’s draw with Leyton Orient left both clubs plus Crawley on 47 points with four games still to play. That means sleepless nights for Crawley boss Dean Saunders who’ll have bad memories of going down from the Championship with Wolves despite finishing on 51 points. Crawley Town are in danger of dropping down to League Two despite ascertaining 47 points in 41 games . 10. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has the curious middle name of Armani – and he’s certainly all the fashion when it comes to taking set-pieces. The 22-year-old is on his third loan of the season from Bristol City because Pilgrims boss John Sheridan admires his pinpoint accuracy with a dead ball. He showed why by setting up goals from both a corner and free-kick in a 2-1 win over Mansfield that put Plymouth back into the League Two play-off places. Plymouth midfielder Bobby Reid has taken League Two by storm since being loaned out by Bristol City .","Yannick Bolasie raced past Lee Cattermole to claim his hat-trick .

Awford said his goodbyes to the Portsmouth players after he was informed of the news. Portsmouth have sacked manager Andy Awford following Saturday's 3-1 defeat to Morecambe . Awford's future had been in doubt as they slipped away from the play-off places and Saturday's result left them with an 11-point gap to the top seven with four games left. Assistant manager Gary Waddock is will take caretaker charge of the team ahead of the clash with Stevenage tomorrow. Awford, 42, has been in charge just over a year and won 20 of the 55 matches that he was in charge, Portsmouth are 14th in League Two. Portsmouth parted company with Awford at a meeting at the club's Roko training ground this morning . In a statement Pompey said: 'The club would like to place on record their sincere thanks for Andy's efforts - his service to Pompey is immeasurable.

"Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard was the toast of the English game  as he carried off the PFA Player of the Year award. The 24-year-old Belgian has scored 18 goals across all competitions for his club this season, helping the Blues win the Capital One Cup and putting them on the brink of a first Premier League title since 2010. He was rewarded for his sterling performances with the top individual award of the night at the Grosvenor Hotel in London. Victory in their next two games - at Leicester and at home to Crystal Palace - would see Chelsea wrap up the championship. Eden Hazard poses with the PFA trophy after winning the award with a superb season in a Chelsea shirt . The 24-year-old Belgian poses with the trophy after collecting the gong at a glittering award ceremony at London's Grosvenor Hotel . Hazard joined Chelsea from Lille in 2012 and put pen to paper on a new five-and-a-half-year deal with the club in February . Didier Drogba posted this picture on Instagram  of Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic, Cesar Azpilicueta, Hazard, John Terry and Cesc Fabregas . John Terry posted this photograph with Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard and Gary Cahill at the PFA Awards ceremony . Hazard has remarkably won Player of the Year or Young Player of the Year every season since 2009 with Lille or Chelsea. Hazard said of his award success: 'I'm very happy. One day I want to be the best and what I did this season is play very well, Chelsea played very well. 'I don't know if I deserve to win but it is good for me. 'It is good, it is better to be voted by the players - they know everything about football. This is good. I'm very happy.' He took the Young Player of the Year prize 12 months ago, and has rapidly progressed to the top award. 'We are almost champions, maybe this is the key,' said Hazard. 'Last season we finished third and this season we have an opportunity to win the league. This has changed from last season. 'I continue like I did last season - I try to be the same. I try to score more goals than last season. Personally I have played a good season, I have been there in the big games and I scored a lot of important goals, this is why I'm better this season.' Hazard has dazzled for Chelsea this season as the Blues look certain to win the first Premier League title of Jose Mourinho's second stint .

PFA Women's Player of the Year: Ji So-yun . PFA Women's Young Player of the Year: Leah Williamson . Hazard's goal last weekend earned Jose Mourinho's men a 1-0 win over Manchester United. He picked out that moment as one of his best of the campaign. Asked to describe his season in a single word, Hazard struggled. 'I don't want to say 'amazing' because it is not finished yet - maybe amazing!' he said. 'I started the season not to be the PFA player of the year but it was in my head - I want to be the best and I hope one day I can win a lot of trophies. 'I just want to say thank you to the players who voted for me - it is always good to have an individual trophy but the most important thing is to win the league. 'I hope I can win a lot of trophies again - the most important is to win the league, without my team-mates I would not be here. 'Jose (Mourinho) lets me play, we talk sometimes together and when I'm on the pitch I know what I have to do, this is most important. 'We are almost there to win the league. 'Last season we finished third, now we can bring the trophy to Stamford Bridge, personally I have played a very good season, have scored a lot of important goals and this is why I'm here.

Hazard has already won silverware this season, with the brilliant Belgian clutching the Capital One Cup with countryman Thibaut Courtois . Hazard (front) skips past the challenge of Manchester United's Wayne Rooney as the Chelsea man launches another attack . Mourinho has long sung the praises of the 24-year-old, believing he is rivalled by only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in the global order. 'I had lots of stars, but he is the humble star,' the Portuguese said last weekend. 'He knows that he is one of the three best players in the world, the responsibility that comes (with that) and he is coping with that responsibility. 'He understands that his talent is fundamental for the team.' Hazard was earlier on Sunday named in the PFA Premier League team of the year - for the third time in his three seasons in England. He was one of six Blues players in the XI, along with captain John Terry, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic and Diego Costa. The PFA Premier League Team of the Year for the 2014-15 season was announced ahead of Hazard being named Player of the Year . Hazard has benefited from working with Mourinho, with the Portuguese coach adding grit to his naturally flamboyant game . Ivanovic, though, was in no doubt as to the team's most influential cog. The Serbia defender, speaking about Hazard last week, said: 'He has been our most important player since day one. 'He is the guy who you just have to give the ball and he will do everything. 'Sometimes he looks so impressive, like he is not from this world.' Hazard arrived at Stamford Bridge in June 2012 - having been crowned Ligue 1 player of the year in each of his final two campaigns with Lille - for a fee reportedly around £32million. Tottenham's Harry Kane - the only English attacking player in the team of the season - took the 2014/15 Young Player of the Year award. The 21-year-old has enjoyed a remarkable rise to stardom, scoring 30 goals for Spurs in all competitions this term despite not being given a regular starting slot until November. He helped Mauricio Pochettino's men to the Capital One Cup final, and also scored 79 seconds into his senior England debut as a substitute in the 4-0 European Championship qualifying victory over Lithuania at Wembley last month. Elsewhere, Ji So-yun of Chelsea Ladies won the PFA Women's Player of the Year, while Leah Williamson of Arsenal Ladies won the PFA Women's Young Player of the Year.

"The finish might have been uncharacteristically scruffy, scored after his first shot came back off the keeper, but it was a landmark goal for Lionel Messi at the Nou Camp on Saturday as he made it 400 goals for Barcelona in a 2-0 win over Valencia. Messi scored with the last kick and Luis Suarez scored with practically his first, putting Barcelona 1-0 up after just 56 seconds. Between the two strikes Claudio Bravo saved a Dani Parejo penalty as Valencia dominated the first half but they couldn't make their pressure tell. For Messi, still only 27, it was another milestone.

Goals in the World Club Cup and the Spanish and European Super Cup have also made up the stratospheric total. He also has 141 assists to his name in those 471 matches. Afterwards Luis Enrique said: ‘Messi gave us what he always gives us. But it’s not just about him it’s about the whole forward line and the whole team.’ Suarez was once again decisive after his two goals in midweek against PSG in the Champions League and he is now just six games from picking up a league winners medal in his first season. The early strike would have counted for nothing however if Valencia had made their first-half domination pay and had Bravo not stopped that eighth-minute penalty. As Messi raced from inside his own half to get the late late second, Enrique could be seen jumping up and down in the technical area long before the ball was in the back of the net. He knows what a major hurdle his side have now cleared. The victory sees Luis Enrique's side move five points away from Real Madrid, who take on Malaga later on Saturday . Messi skips past two Valencia challenges as Barcelona secured an important win against La Liga's fourth placed side . Messi attempts an acrobatic kick for Barcelona against Valencia in the La Liga encounter at the Nou Camp on Saturday . Barcelona were ahead inside the first minute with a move that swept from one end of the pitch to the other starting with Bravo releasing the ball quickly and finishing with a first time finish from Suarez past Diego Alves into far corner. Between the two Barca moved the ball quickly with Sergi Busquets releasing Messi and his pass poked home by the Uruguayan who has now scored 12 goals in his last 12 games. Far from being shell-shocked by the early set-back Valencia unleashed the big guns and Barcelona were under-fire for the rest of the first half. Paco Alcacer and Rodrigo both went close and were running an out-of-sorts Gerard Pique ragged. On eight minutes Valencia should have equalized. Rodrigo went down easily under a half challenge from Pique. It was a generous spot-kick and Bravo got down well to Parejo’s kick to save it. With a full Camp Nou sensing that a win here would be a huge step towards the title for Barcelona, and Valencia in a scrap of their own to finish in the top four the game was being played at cup final pace. Parejo flattened Busquets who for once he didn't need to exaggerate the fall as he crashed to ground. And full-back Orban risked a first half sending off with foul after foul. He was shown a yellow and never appeared for the second period. Adding to the drama was the panic in Barcelona’s defence. Pique was either failing to stay on his feet or giving the ball to Valencia forwards. The falling down was contagious with Adriano – another who didn’t come out for the second half – also losing his footing despite the perfect playing conditions. Neymar (right) attempts a diving header for Barcelona as his side looked to increase their lead at the top of La Liga . Barcelona have a five-point lead over Madrid, who could cut the deficit to two points with victory over Malaga . Alcacer continued to threaten. It’s not difficult to see why on-loan Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo, who Valencia are obliged to buy this summer, cannot get a game at the moment. It is also why many Spain supporters think Diego Costa should not be Vicente Del Bosque’s first choice. Alcacer led the line and with Sofiane Feghouli and Rodrigo buzzing around him. Valencia gave Barcelona more problems than any visiting side at the Nou Camp this season. Alcacer came the closest in what remained of the first half making room for a shot from the edge of the area and hitting the base of Bravo’s post but Barca remained a threat on the break. In their best move Messi and Suarez linked with Neymar who pulled the ball back to Xavi instead of finishing. The midfielder set-up Messi and his shot flashed wide. Games at the Nou Camp can be like bull fights that used to be held in Catalonia before they were banned. Everyone in the arena knows the bull loses, it’s just a matter of when. But Valencia had worn the horns in the first half and Barcelona were relieved to get down the tunnel at half time still in one piece and still 1-0 up. The second half brought more calm to a Barcelona defence that now had Mascherano back alongside Pique after his first half spent in midfield. Valencia carried less threat and Barca went close with Neymar heading wide and Messi hitting the bar with a free-kick. He won a the kick with a brilliant run away from Parejo who up-ended him and his effort beat Diego Alves but not the frame of the goal. With 25 minutes left he moved to centre-forward as Suarez was taken off. There was no Neymar style sulk as he made his way off to a thunderous reception from the home fans. He goes into Tuesday’s game against PSG looking for his 20th goal of what has been an excellent first season. Negredo replaced Alcacer and immediately Valencia had their best chance of the second half with Bravo palming away Rodrigo’s shot. But there was to be no reward for all their fire and invention and when Messi raced clear to score the second with the last kick of the game it was all over in every sense.","Luis Suarez scored Barcelona's opening goal against Valencia in the first minute of the game .

"Fighter ace: Douglas Bader's story is to be told in a Hollywood film dubbed ‘The First Great Escape’ The story of how Douglas Bader recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of Britain’s greatest fighter aces is remarkable enough. But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed ‘The First Great Escape’. Bader – who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 – was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader’s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as ‘the most brilliant escape conception of this war’. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp’s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break – August 30, 1942 – the prisoners managed to fuse the camp’s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a ‘home run’ back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the ‘escape-proof’ Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader’s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton’s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA . As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton’s book have been bought by the makers of 2013’s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested. He said: 'I'm very, very pleased. It's very, very exciting. Essential 11 did a fantastic job with Saving Mr Banks and to have that same team working on this is very pleasing.'","Douglas Bader recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of Britain’s greatest fighter aces .

"There are moments when Falcao sets off on those delayed runs in the bright red shirt of Manchester United and it all comes flooding back. This could have been just the start. He made his name with Porto, adding to his allure with those darting runs across opposition defences for Atletico Madrid and Monaco during five glorious years in European football. Chelsea away is a tough one to come into; thrown into the team to start at the Barclays Premier League leaders because Louis van Gaal was short of bodies. Radamel Falcao strikes for goal but his effort is thwarted by Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Cortois . Falcao competes for a high ball with Chelsea centre back Gary Cahill at Stamford Bridge . The Colombian forward confronts Blues captain John Terry after the pair got tangled on the ground . He has yet to score against the top level Premier League teams, with his meagre return coming in games against Everton, Aston Villa, Stoke City and Leicester City. There were a couple of notable chances here, with a left foot effort flying wide of Thibaut Courtois’ left hand post and another, ten minutes later, which bounced back off his upright. It is sad to say but the knee injury he suffered in the build up to last summer’s World Cup, when he gamely tried to recover in time to play for Colombia, has cost him that critical yard of pace. In his heart he must know that. The United forward was schooled here, denied space and room to breathe by the constant, intimidating presence of Chelsea’s captain John Terry. Falcao lost almost every key battle at Stamford Bridge. When it all gets a bit narky out there, as it did in the movement leading up to Chelsea’s opening goal, which was scored by Eden Hazard after 38 minutes, Terry excels. Falcao and Marouane Fellaini stand dejected on the half-way line following Eden Hazard's first-half strike . For a man of his experience Falcao should have been stronger, shielding the ball when he took a buffeting from Terry on the halfway line. Seconds later, Chelsea had taken the lead. There was another skirmish before the break, a collision that ended with Terry jabbing his finger in Falcao’s face after they landed together in a crumpled heap. Terry was on top of him, taking the responsibility for marking the United forward away from his central defensive partner Gary Cahill for large sections of this clash. This central defensive pairing, with their constant communication, pass strikers over for fun these days. Falcao was no different. He looked like a man short of match fitness, the usual sharpness that is expected of a player in a game of this magnitude. This was a start, but Falcao has been restricted to substitute appearances of late. Falcao and Terry tangle once more as the United striker struggles to impose himself on the game . He had just 19 touches in the first half, failing to take any of them in Chelsea’s penalty area during a period when Van Gaal’s team were almost operating at full throttle. During Sir Alex Ferguson’s era the club were blessed with great strikers, from Andrew Cole to Ruud van Nistelrooy to Wayne Rooney. All of them pulled on the United shirt in their prime. Ferguson was here at Stamford Bridge, watching this new team take shape under their Dutch coach - and he will know that they are crying out for a fully fit forward. Falcao is indifferent, short of confidence (and goals) after a frustrating eight months since his move on loan from Monaco for the season was confirmed. He is crying out for help, desperate to roll back the years after spending so much of the season out of the picture. Sadly, for a man of his stature, he is trading on memories now.","Louis van Gaal handed Radamel Falcao a surprise start against Chelsea .

"An aspiring model who set a honey trap to lure a professional gambler to his 'pitiless and wicked' death in a bid to steal his winnings has been jailed for 16 years. Leonie Granger, 25, targeted playboy Mehmet Hassan, 56, after spotting him flashing a roll of £50 notes at a casino in London's West End. The care assistant, from Gillingham, Kent, used her good looks to befriend the poker player, who showered her with gifts, cash and trips to fancy restaurants. Scroll down for video . Aspiring model Leonie Granger (left) has been jailed for 16 years at the Old Bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler Mehmet Hassan (right) who she lured at a casino . Granger (pictured with Mr Hassan at Palm Beach Casino in central London) took advantage of him being a 'soft target', the court heard. Judge William Kennedy today described the attack as 'pitiless and wicked' But after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside. They tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings. Afterwards, they left him with multiple broken bones, lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood. Following a trial at the Old Bailey, Granger was found guilty of Mr Hassan's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder. She was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by Judge William Kennedy today. Co-defendants Kyrron Jackson, 28, and Nicholas Chandler, 29, were found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years. Sentencing, Judge William Kennedy described the attack as 'pitiless and wicked', adding: 'It was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion.' In mitigation, Orlando Pownall QC said Granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with Jackson and 'fell in with his desires'. Mr Pownall said she now 'deeply regretted' what had happened, adding: 'Her head was turned by Mr Jackson who she loved and to some extent by Mr Chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming.' But jailing her, the judge said she had been 'deceitful from the outset' and had 'lost her sense and compassion' when she got involved in the scheme. He added that she clearly cared more for Jackson than he cared for her. Granger, from Gillingham, Kent, used her good looks to befriend the poker player, who showered her with gifts, cash and trips to fancy restaurants. She wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter . Granger and Mr Hassan are pictured on CCTV going in to the Palm Beach Casino in central London together . All the defendants were convicted of robbing Mr Hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him. Jackson and Chandler, both of south east London, were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of Grosvenor Casinos, two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in January last year, and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison. The trial had heard how Mr Hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as Rachel, even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him. Granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two . After their first date, Granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that Hassan was 'flashy' and saying: 'This guy is a professional gambler. He has never worked a day in his life.' On the night of the murder, Mr Hassan had taken Granger to the top Mayfair restaurant Nobu before going on to the Palm Beach Casino nearby, where he gave her £1,000 in cash to gamble with. Dressed in a strapless top, tight-fitting black trousers, high heels and a large gold necklace, Granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing Mr Hassan 'passionately' and she told the pair to 'get a room'. Later, he took her back to his Islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend Jackson and his friend Chandler, who were poised to strike outside. Using parcel tape, the two men tied up Mr Hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash. While Mr Hassan's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered, the killers were filmed on Granger's mobile phone throwing wads of £50 notes around. They fled with £3,000, his TV and mobile phone, but were caught after Granger's phone records were examined. Granger's co-defendants Kyrron Jackson, 28, (left) and Nicholas Chandler, 29, (right), both from south east London, have both been convicted of murdering Mr Hassan and are to be sentenced in due course . Granger (left) helped Kyrron Jackson (centre) and Nicholas Chandler (right) rob and kill gambler Mr Hassan . Police found Mr Hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm. His knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek. Investigators found he had suffered a 'vicious and sustained attack' – probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money. Granger's 'soft target' was known to have two favourite casinos in Mayfair - the Playboy Casino on Old Park Lane and the Palm Beach Casino in Berkeley Street. He sometimes won as much as £15,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts, he would keep his winnings around his flat, even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave. The fact the divorced father 'enjoyed the company of women' made him particularly 'vulnerable to the unscrupulous', prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors. Chandler is pictured throwing around £50 notes around which he stole from Mr Hassan after killing him . He said Mr Hassan's death was the 'culmination of the ruthless greed' of Jackson and Chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in South Kensington in January and February last year, but with limited success. The jury was shown CCTV film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of Granger and Mr Hassan together in the casino hours before the killing. They were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim's money around hours after the murder, with Jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants. Speaking after their convictions last week, Mr Hassan's family said his death will 'haunt them forever'. His daughter Stephanie Hassan added: 'Every day we miss him and we love him.'","Leonie Granger, 25, has been jailed for 16 years for luring gambler to death .

"A fund-raising drive to help keep one of the country's oldest war veterans in his own home after a London council refused to pay for his ongoing care has reached £10,000 in just four days. Brent Council said it was no longer able to afford to pay for a live-in carer to look after Second World War veteran Robert Clark at his home in Burnt Oak, North London. This is despite the fact he had already used £50,000 of his life savings paying for his care. War veteran Robert Clark, pictured, who has had a fund-raising appeal set up in his name so he can remain in his own home with a live-in carer . A donations page set up by the forces charity Help for Heroes has already raised £10,000 to help Mr Clark remain in his own home . The council told Mr Clark he would have to be moved into a local care home with his son Mike describing the move as like asking his father to go back into a 'prisoner of war camp'. The pensioner's plight prompted armed forces charity Help for Heroes to launch a fund-raising campaign to allow Mr Clark to stay in his home, which he has lived in for more than 50 years and pay towards the cost of a carer. And in just four days the total amount of donations has reached £10,000, despite setting an initial target of £5,000 just four days ago. The amount will pay for around four to five months care for Mr Clark in his own home. David Fraser from the charity confirmed that they are working with Mr Clark to discuss what to do with the cash and added they have set a new fund-raising target of £15,000. He told MailOnline: 'I think when you look at what he has done and what he has been through, he deserves an awful lot of respect. 'He deserves to be able to stay in his own home.' Writing home: Veteran Robert Clark, pictured in 1940, when he was serving with Durham Light Infantry . Mr Clark is one of Britain's oldest surviving prisoners of war - and one of the few British soldiers to survive Hitler's 1,000-mile death march. He was a gunner in the Durham Light Infantry when he was captured by the Nazis in the North African city of Tobruk in June 1942. He spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Poland, before being forced to join the 'death match' in 1945. Now a great-great grandfather, he is one of Britain's oldest surviving PoWs and is registered blind, deaf in one ear, is dependent on a wheelchair and has suffered from severe anxiety. For the past two years he has used his savings to pay towards the £960-a-week cost of a live-in carer, while Brent Council contributed £350 per week. But as his money runs out, the council is refusing to increase its funding for Mr Clark. An online petition has also been set up calling for the council to increase its funding, which has also gained almost 170,000 signatures. Robert Clark (front row, second left) pictured on June 21, 1943 at prisoner of war camp Campo PG70 in Italy . His son Mike, whose home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire is not suitable for his father, has previously spoken of how he situation is causing the pensioner anxiety and making him unable to sleep. He explained: 'He’s as good as told me that if he has to move, he’ll just give up on life. Whenever he’s been in hospital, pulls the blankets over his head and stops talking. ‘He hates being anywhere which isn't familiar, going into a care home will be like going back into a prisoner of war camp.’ However, Brent Council have stated they will not increase their funding for a live-in carer but say there is absolutely no question he will be evicted. They also added he won't need to sell his house to pay for his care and say they want to find a solution which meets his needs and provides value for money for the taxpayer.

"January, it is said, is a bad time to do business. Either prices are inflated or you’re picking up problem players other clubs don’t want. This year, it seems, has proved no different. Big-money buys have struggled to impact, while loan signings, too, have not had the desired effect. Here, Sportsmail looks at five winter-window arrivals who have disappointed for their new employers… . Juan Cuardrado arrived at Chelsea for £23m from Fiorentina but has failed to impress at Stamford Bridge . Juan Cuadrado (Chelsea) For a fee in the region of £23m and arriving from Fiorentina with a reputation bloated by his impressive performance for Colombia at last summer’s World Cup, Cuadrado was expected to help fire Chelsea towards the Premier League and Champions League crowns. In nearly three months, however, he has played just over three hours of top-flight football, failing to score or create a goal in that period. The Colombian winger arrived with a big reputation after starring at the 2014 World Cup . Meanwhile, during the Champions League exit to PSG, Cuadrado appeared for just 11 minutes and remained a spectator as they were eliminated following the second leg at Stamford Bridge. Perhaps next season was always pencilled in for the explosive winger to make his impact, but the jury remains very much out based on his early efforts. Wilfried Bony (Man City) With Sergio Aguero perennially troubled by injury problems and Edin Dzeko about as reliable as his team-mate’s hamstrings, £28m Swansea striker Bony was supposed to be the man to take on the scoring mantle and see home City’s defence of their title. Wilfried Bony has netted only one goal as Manchester City have slipped out of the title race . His arrival, of course, was delayed by participation at the Africa Cup of Nations, but Bony has done little to breathe new life into City’s stuttering season. There has been just one goal – the opener in a routine 3-0 home win over West Brom – and he has missed the last two matches – including the derby defeat at Manchester United – after turning an ankle in training. The former Swansea striker scored more Premier League goals than any other player in 2014 . He has started just two games and his involvement during the Champions League defeat to Barcelona was restricted to 18 minutes at the Nou Camp. Bony will have to hit the ground running next season or his days at City could soon be numbered. Mauro Zarate (QPR) Perhaps the Argentinian should have taken the hint when Harry Redknapp tried to send him back to West Ham before he had even kicked a ball for the R’s. Mauro Zarate has failed to make an impression at Loftus Road during his loan . Premier League rules meant he had to stay and, four substitute appearances later, Zarate is yet to score or lay on a goal for his latest employers. Zarate fared slightly better at Birmingham City in 2008 when, during another loan stay, he netted four times. Zarate scored two goals in seven appearances for West Ham before being farmed out on loan . That, though, was not enough to keep the Blues in the Premier League and it looks as if he’ll have a second relegation on his C.V. come May. Callum McManaman (West Brom) The £4.75m capture of McManaman from Wigan was hailed as something of a coup given how he had impressed for the Latics on occasion. Callum McManaman's move to the Hawthorns has coincided with West Brom's slip into relegation battle . But therein lies the problem with the combative forward – getting him on the pitch and keeping him there. Talented, no doubt, but McManaman’s progress at The Hawthorns has been curtailed by an ankle problem and six appearances later he is yet to trouble the scorers. The Scotland international was one of the stars of Wigan's unlikely FA Cup victory in 2013 . He hasn’t featured for over a month and, in that time, West Brom have slid back towards the relegation mire. McManaman’s arrival was intended to help safeguard against such a scenario, so in that respect the signing has disappointed. Filip Djuricic (Southampton) Big things were expected of the Serbia international given Ronald Koeman’s prior knowledge of the skilful winger – who played for Heerenveen in Holland - and Southampton’s recent record in the transfer market. Ronald Koeman brought in the talented forward, but Filip Djuricic is yet to complete 90mins for the Saints . There have been flashes of promise but the 23-year-old is yet to play a full 90 minutes for the Saints and now finds himself sidelined with an ankle problem. Djuricic – on loan from Benfica – wants to make permanent his stay on the south coast, but injury could rob him of the chance to impress. The on-loan Benfica winger (left) will have to do more to make his move to St Mary's permanent .","Several January signings have failed to impress in the Premier League .

"When reports first emerged from China in 2006 that state-run hospitals were killing prisoners of conscience to sell their organs, it seemed too horrible to be true. However, a new documentary is about to blow the lid on the illegal organ trade that is now allegedly worth a staggering US$1 billion a year. This despite the fact 10,000 organs are transplanted in China every year, yet there are only a tiny number of people on the official donor register. ‘Human Harvest: China’s Organ Trafficking’ will show how once researchers around the world - including human rights lawyer David Matas and former Canadian member of parliament David Kilgour - began to uncover the gory details, the true picture was soon uncovered. Scroll down for video . A new documentary is about to blow the lid on the illegal organ trade that is now allegedly worth a staggering US$1 billion a year in China . In 2006 a non-governmental coalition was formed called ‘The Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of the Falun Gong in China’. They requested that Mr Kilgour and Mr Matas investigate allegations of organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners in China because of their extensive academic and political backgrounds and prior involvement in human rights activism. The damning evidence they uncovered suggests that tens of thousands of innocent people have been killed on demand to supply an ongoing illegal organ transplant industry. How these two Nobel Peace Prize nominees pieced together the evidence and continue to fight against this unimaginable horror is told in the program. Human rights lawyer David Matas (pictured) investigated allegations of organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners in China and uncovered some gruesome facts . ‘Human Harvest: China’s Organ Trafficking’ will show how  researchers began to uncover the gory details . The pair have spent years investigating organ trafficking in China, and it's claimed that political prisoners are being used as live organ donors. They believe the organs come from members of the Falun Gong movement – a quasi-religious group with millions of followers, which is banned by the Chinese Government. ‘I can testify that this hospital forcibly removed organs, such as livers and corneas,’ says former worker Annie of allegations that members of the banned Falun Gong movement were killed for their organs. The pair have spent years investigating organ trafficking in China, and it's claimed that political prisoners are being used as live organ donors . During a rally joined by thousands of Faul Gong practitioners at Taipei, four demonstrators play in an action drama against what they said was the Chinese communists' killing of Falun Gong followers and harvesting of their organs in concentration camps . 'Some practitioners were still breathing after their organs were removed, but they were thrown into the hospital’s incinerator anyway.' Filmmaker Leon Lee, who is based in Canada, is the man behind the documentary. He first read about the allegations in 2006 and he couldn't take it all in. ‘The story seemed too incredible to believe. Several months later, David Matas and David Kilgour published their investigation report Bloody Harvest,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I was inspired to investigate further and see for myself if this horrific story could really be and that's how it all began. Eight years later Human Harvest has been released and now you can see for yourself too.’ The China organ trade is now worth a staggering US$1 billion a year, Mr Lee claims. From 1980 onwards, China began withdrawing government funds from the health sector, expecting hospitals to start charging people for their services. According to Chinese doctors, state funding is often not even enough to cover staff salaries for one month. The China organ trade is now worth a staggering US$1 billion a year it is claimed . ‘Transplants range from about US$60,000 to over US$170, 000 depending on the operation, so there is a lot of money to be made there. Sadly the sale of organs has become a source of funding,’ Mr Lee told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Orient Organ Transplant Centre in Tianjin reported revenue of at least 100 million yuan (approximately US$16 million) on liver transplant alone in 2007. ‘That's the number in one hospital, for one kind of transplant in one year only. Now imagine the whole of China.’ Practitioners of Falun Gong protest in Parliament Square over the 10 year persecution of their spiritual discipline by the Chinese Communist Party . China outlawed Falungong as an 'evil cult' in 1999 and has since detained tens of thousands of members . The subject is still one that people find hard to believe or do not want to believe for various reasons. However, in recent years China has been heavily criticized by the UN for its use of death row prisoners for organ transplanting. Laws preventing organ tourism to China are being instated around the world and are already in place in Israel and Spain. Both US Congress and the European Parliament have passed resolutions condemning Chinese regime's practice of forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience, and asking China to stop such practice. Thousands of Falungong practitioners sit in silence in front of the presidential office in Taipei . Members of Falun Gong movement demonstrate outside the Hawaii Convention Center in Hawaii in 2011 . Canada's recent ‘Subcommittee on International Human Rights’ also unanimously passed a similar motion. ‘It's a start, but a lot still needs to be done. Awareness and action at this point is really essential, we can't keep allowing this human rights abuse to continue,’ Mr Lee said. As it would have been impossible and very dangerous to shoot in mainland China, Mr Lee filmed in several other countries and obtained footage from his sources in China. Mexican protestors demonstrate against China's actions towards the Falun Gong community . In recent years China has been heavily criticized by the UN for its use of death row prisoners for organ transplanting . ‘Finding people that wanted to talk and gaining their trust was a slow process, the film took eight years to make,’ he says. ‘It was very difficult because people fear persecution from the Chinese regime. Identities were hidden in some cases to protect those involved.’ But for all his best intentions, will anything really be done to stop this gruesome business? Particularly considering the power that China wields worldwide? Mr Lee believes that it will. China said authorities had broken no laws while cracking down on the spiritual group Falun Gong, while insisting it was a cult that violated human rights through mind control . Transplants range from about US$60,000 to over US$170, 000 depending on the operation . ‘You can help spread awareness in your networks of family and friends and hopefully this film, which is currently gaining momentum, will help to shed a light on this atrocious crime. That's the hope anyway,’ he says. ‘Human Harvest: China’s Organ Trafficking’ will be shown on Dateline on SBS One at 9.30pm on Tuesday.","A new documentary hopes to expose the illegal organ trade in China .

"It was a moment that gave Philippe Coutinho ‘the creeps’ - standing in the players’ lounge, awaiting the arrival of football royalty, he had nerves like never before. Not much flusters Coutinho, whom The Kop has christened O Magico (The Magician), but before Liverpool’s tussle with Manchester United last month he and Lucas Leiva were given the chance to meet Brazil’s most famous son. Spending time with Pele did not disappoint. ‘It’s the ultimate honour because Pele is the greatest player of Brazil and probably the world,’ says Coutinho. ‘We only spoke for a little bit but he asked us how things were. Yes, I got a photograph. I’m going to keep it alongside the one I have with Ronaldinho.’ Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho (left) described it as the 'ultimate honour' to speak to Brazil icon Pele . Pele (centre) was a special guest for the Reds' league encounter vs rivals Manchester United last month . In terms of looking for sources of inspiration, Coutinho could hardly choose two better. His ambition is to follow in their footsteps and make Brazil’s fabled No 10 shirt his own but, before then, his first task must be to dominate Anfield’s landscape. There is no doubting Coutinho’s class. Look on YouTube and you will find footage of him bamboozling opponents as a 10-year-old in Rio de Janeiro. A decade on and the same tricks and shimmies are flummoxing defenders in the Barclays Premier League. During Monday’s 2-0 dismissal of Newcastle United, Coutinho produced one moment of skill - a step-over and dummied pass all in the same movement - that prompted Brendan Rodgers to applaud. ‘When you see the manager trusts you and gives you a lot of confidence it makes you play even better,’ says Coutinho. Since the turn of the year, Coutinho’s form and confidence have risen dramatically. There have been a number of spectacular moments, particularly in the FA Cup - his goals in replays against Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers are the reason Liverpool travel to Wembley to face Aston Villa in the semi-final on Sunday. Rodgers feels the resurgence of Coutinho, who is on the six-man shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year, comes from him feeling settled after signing a new long-term contract at the beginning of February. The 22-year-old does not disagree with his manager. Unlike the situation surrounding Raheem Sterling’s negotiations, the discussions for Coutinho were straightforward. ‘Liverpool have always shown a great warmth to me so when they came to me with a proposal I did not need to think twice,’ he says. Coutinho (centre) scored the only goal as Liverpool won 1-0 at Blackburn in their FA Cup sixth round replay . ‘I have always been looked after very well by this club and I am very happy here, so I didn’t even have to think about it. My mind is at Liverpool.’ And so on to Wembley. Again Coutinho expects to feel ‘the creeps’ at one of the sport’s most iconic venues but he is also aware of how imperative it is to deliver. He says: ‘We will try to finish the season on a high but games like this are always tough. We have to start well, do our best to play our game. It would be important to win the cup, not only for me, but for the club. That would be a massive achievement.’ Coutinho's (right) displays have seen him nominated for the PFA Player and Young Player of the Year awards .","Liverpool face Aston Villa in their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Sunday .

"Earlier this month the tracksuit tycoon Mike Ashley agreed to buy a plot of land in Chelsea from the retailer John Lewis for somewhere in the region of £200million. The Clearings has been primed for redevelopment, with planning permission for 62 luxury flats, seven townhouses and an agreement to relocate Marlborough Primary School as part of the project. In five years, when the operation to build the properties is concluded and they have been sold to high-end buyers, Ashley will add something in the region of another £1bn to his net worth. There have been empty seats at St James' Park recently as fans let their feelings about Mike Ashley be known . The weekend defeat by Swansea was a seventh straight Premier League loss for the Magpies . Toon keeper Tim Krul had to pick the ball out of his net three times against Swansea . Ashley looks after the money, obsessing over the finances at his business empire, which includes SportsDirect, Tesco and his football club in the north east. Last year his group made more than £500m. In return, he expects his employees, across the board, to deliver. The biggest motivation in Ashley’s life is to make money, something reflected in Newcastle United’s latest accounts, which are showing another decent profit and £34m in the bank. The money men at Newcastle are already aware that the team could play in an empty stadium when the new television deals crystallise at the start of the 2016-17 season and still turn a profit based on current income and expenditure. It feels like it could come to that as Newcastle’s disaffected supporters wonder where to take their grievances to next. Ashley, the club’s owner, does not appear to be listening. He is not a football man, certainly not in the same way as the increasing number of disillusioned supporters at St James’ Park. After seven straight defeats in the Barclays Premier League under their interim coach John Carver, they have every right to fear for the future. All is not well. It does not help that Ashley has taken a neanderthal approach to negative criticism, frequently banning journalists from St James’ because they have gone into bat on behalf of the team’s disaffected supporters. For such a successful businessman, Ashley’s sensitivity to criticism is undoubtedly one of his biggest weaknesses. Ashley (right) has never been Mr Popular at St James' Park but the protests have been ramped up recently . A fan appeared to have a go at interim manager John Carver during the latest loss at St James' Park . The view from the bench hasn't been pretty for Carver and the Newcastle staff during the last few weeks . He should address it because his ability to make money should be one of his most powerful weapons at Newcastle. In January, after a deal had been concluded to take Alan Pardew to Crystal Palace, the former Newcastle manager gave a momentary insight into the financial strategy at St James’ Park. ‘Newcastle is a big club, it’s difficult because it is run on an tight financial margin,’ admitted Pardew. ‘We had to work hard on transfers, the funds for a club that size makes it difficult to understand that we had to build slowly.’ So what is so wrong with that, especially when the owner of the club still has an interest-free loan of £129m marked in the latest Newcastle accounts? It is the job of Newcastle’s chief scout Graham Carr, along with his staff, to identify and recruit the players who can improve this team. Talent identification is not Ashley’s area of expertise and he has always made it clear that it is the responsibility of his scouting department to improve the squad. The natural conclusion when clubs sell their best players, as Newcastle did when Yohan Cabaye moved to Paris Saint-Germain in January 2014 and Mathieu Debuchy left for Arsenal last summer, is to lose momentum. It always feels like a lack of ambition. Then there are teams such as Southampton, who sold four of their best players last summer - Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana, Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw - for £88m after finishing eighth in the Premier League. Newcastle fans held a protest urging fellow supporters to 'show Ashley the red card' They responded by recruiting Dusan Tadic, Graziano Pelle, Fraser Forster, Florin Gardos, Shane Long and Sadio Mane for an outlay of around £56m. Under Ronald Koeman, who replaced Mauricio Pochettino last summer after he moved to Tottenham, Southampton could still qualify for the Europa League. They are a fine example to the teams outside the top four because Southampton (with an annual income of £90m), Swansea (£84m) and Newcastle (£110m) cannot compete on the same financial terms. Swansea, who beat Newcastle 3-2  last Saturday, have also had a recent change in management after promoting Garry Monk. He has had an outstanding year in charge. Toon fans held up the cards during the latest protest against owner Ashley . Even with the loss of Wilfried Bony, sold to Manchester City for £28m in January, they are on course for a top-eight finish because of their own financial prudence and some smart recruitment. Like Southampton, they are not living above their means, but their transfer policy is first class. They are being rewarded for that. Newcastle are currently 19th in the annual Deloitte report into football’s rich list, but they do not have the same financial muscle as Manchester United (£371m), Manchester City (£277m), Chelsea (£277m), Arsenal (£219m), Liverpool (£208m) and Tottenham (£153m). This summer Ashley will make some new signings, something they desperately need after a depressing end to the season at St James’ Park. Without them, the balance sheet will be the only winner.","Newcastle United have lost seven Premier League games in a row .

"Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid may have played out a goalless draw at the Vicente Calderon on Tuesday night, but there was still plenty to talk about after the Champions League first leg. Here Sportsmail looks at the five things we learned after the two bitter rivals clashed again in Europe. Real Madrid must be careful with a talent like Raphael Varane . Something has to give at Real Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti's favoured centre-back partnership is Sergio Ramos and Pepe, but in Raphael Varane, who turns 22 later this month, they have a diamond. Pepe's injury trouble recently has meant Varane has started a few games, continuing the education that began under Jose Mourinho. Chelsea’s coach has fluttered his eyelashes at the French international a few times during the past year, making sure he's in pole position should the defender become available. Raphael Varane (left) impressed again for Real Madrid - and saved . Varane will be thinking he is more than ready to be the starting centre-back for a Champions League team and with good reason. His performance here was wise beyond his years and his lightning quick turn of pace can help mop up after any errors. One sprint back to deny Mario Mandzukic was like watching a gazelle catch up with a rhino without even breaking sweat. Varane saved his team at the death too, mopping up after Iker Casillas rushed out his goal and failed to reach the ball. Jan Oblak is proving patience is a virtue . Jan Oblak became the most expensive goalkeeper in Spanish football history when he signed for €16million from Benfica in the summer. And then Diego Simeone promptly dumped him on the bench and installed another new player, Miguel Angel Moya, in goal. There were reports in the Spanish media that the coach did not rate him, that Atletico wanted to sell him back to the Portuguese side. When he finally played, it was a disaster, with the team losing 3-2 to Olympiakos and Oblak put back on the bench. Jan Oblak (centre) denies Gareth Bale early on in the contest and the keeper had an impressive game . Eventually an injury to Moya left Simeone with Oblak in goal against Bayer Leverkusen, where he became a hero in the penalty shoot-out which secured the team passage to this round of the Champions League, and Atletico Madrid's goalkeeper was brilliant again against Madrid. The Slovenian stopper was the only thing standing between Real Madrid and a hatful of first-half goals. Oblak's save from Gareth Bale - spreading himself wide and blocking the Welshman's strike with his right arm - after barely more than three minutes had elapsed was hugely important. It was beautiful, crucial. The amazing atmosphere generated by Atletico's supporters would have been dented by a goal that early. Oblak makes a superb save to deny James Rodriguez (third left) from opening the scoring for Real Madrid . Better was still to come, Oblak making a superb save from a James Rodriguez snap shot, which he didn't see until very late, the highlight of a first-half in which he made six stops. It was altogether reminiscent of the backbone Atletico relied on last season, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois essential in their La Liga triumph and road to the Champions League final. And all this after sitting on the bench for half the season. Another fruitless evening for Gareth Bale . Nobody can say that Gareth Bale didn't work hard enough for Real Madrid here, but instead that he just wasn't good enough. The world's most expensive player endured another frustrating evening, which started in the worst way possible when he missed a one-on-one chance. Played in down the right, Bale had the ball on his favoured left foot, but his finish was too imprecise and Oblak made a brilliant save. Bale didn't get involved much in the first half, with the game passing him by as sometimes it tends to do. Bale (left) worked hard again for Madrid but failed to have the desired impact as Atletico kept him quiet . Bale (right) sees a shot saved by Atletico keeper Oblak as he endured another frustrating night . He upped the effort in the second period but to little effect. Working back in the right-back position he tried to skin Guilherme Siqueira, but the Atletico man nudged him and Bale tumbled. No free kick. In attack he nearly eked out an opportunity for Cristiano Ronaldo towards the end, but the Portugal striker was instantly closed down. It was that kind of night for Real Madrid, and yet another one for Gareth Bale. Mad Mario doesn't play for Liverpool... he's at Atletico . Atletico Madrid are good at replacing their strikers, after they are perennially taken by bigger teams. Fernando Torres was replaced by Sergio Aguero, who was replaced by Radamel Falcao, who was replaced by Diego Costa, who has now been replaced by Mario Mandzukic. While the Croatian hasn't quite lived up to the Chelsea striker's standards in terms of crucial goals, he's as ready for a fight as the Spaniard, and that's saying something. Mandzukic, like Costa, also gets short shrift from the referee, with his reputation going before him. He riled Dani Carvajal up so much here that the Real Madrid defender snapped and punched him in the chest. The theatrics that followed were part of his skill set of dark arts too, even if referee Milorad Mazic wasn’t buying. Mario Mandzukic was left bloodied after a stray elbow from Sergio Ramos but got little sympathy from the ref . Ramos and Mandzukic clash, leaving the Altetico Madrid striker needing treatment for a head injury . A stray elbow from Sergio Ramos left Mandzukic with blood sprayed across his face, but he knows what the deal is at Atletico – the pleasure comes with the pain. Eventually it was the striker who ended up, somewhat harshly, in the Serb’s notebook for fighting too hard in an aerial duel. Although he couldn’t find the net himself, his hold-up play was essential in giving Atletico some breathing room and it’s for the best that a row with Diego Simeone seems to have been buried. History says it's advantage Atletico . This season Real Madrid have taken on Atletico seven times and not won once. This was the third draw; Diego Simeone's side have won the other four games. The Argentine coach will be pleased with this result, because now a goalscoring draw at the Santiago Bernabeu next Wednesday will see his team through. So far this season Madrid have scored four times against Atletico, while the Rojiblancos have netted 12 in reply, including five at the Bernabeu. Antoine Griezmann (left) will be crucial to Atletico Madrid's chances of winning in the Santiago Bernabeu . Madrid will be obliged to attack and that will suit Atletico just fine. Simeone's side are built to resist and with Antoine Griezmann up front, they will be able to hit Los Blancos on the counter. Last season Chelsea came to the Vicente Calderon and fought for a 0-0 draw. They took that back to Stamford Bridge and were soundly beaten by Atletico Madrid, 3-1 at home. Simeone will feel quietly confident his men can repeat the trick once more. Furthermore, like for the 4-0 humbling Madrid suffered in February, Marcelo is suspended and Fabio Coentrao, who has been out of favour, will play. Mario Suarez was booked against Madrid and suspended too, but Tiago Mendes can slot in for him without much fuss.","Gareth Bale missed a one-on-one chance after just three minutes .

"These never-before-seen photographs show the horror of the doomed Gallipoli landings through the eyes of the soldiers who survived Winston Churchill's infamous operation. Today, world leaders were joined by Princes Charles and Harry on the Royal Navy's flagship HMS Bulwark in Turkey's Dardanelles straits to mark the centenary of the catastrophic landings which claimed 140,000 lives during World War One. An estimated 1,000 Allied soldiers died on the first day of the disastrous invasion until January 1916, when after huge losses on both sides, the Allies successfully fooled the Turkish forces and evacuated their soldiers from the peninsula. Historian Stephen Chambers has collected more than 100 rare photographs, many taken by the troops themselves, including poignant images of soldiers from their preparation for the first landings right up until the evacuation. Soldiers are seen being hosed down on the deck of the SS River Clyde, a mule is hoisted on board the ship and even the moment a soldier makes the dash across No Man's Land has been captured for posterity. These photographs, many taken by soldiers, show the true horror of the doomed Gallipoli landings during World War One, which claimed the lives of 140,000 troops in eight months of fighting before they eventually withdrew to North Africa in January 1916 with no material gain . The invasion is widely considered a shambles as soldiers were sent aimlessly to their deaths in Gallipoli peninsula in a bid to capture the city of Constantinople. Historian Stephen Chambers released the poignant images to mark the catastrophic campaign's centenary . The Gallipoli peninsula is in modern-day Turkey, but in 1915 it was part of the Ottoman Empire. As Allied soldiers prepared to invade, they hoisted a mule hoisted aboard the collier ship SS River Clyde ahead of the three-day journey across the Aegean Sea . The rapid spread of diseases, a lack of clean water and food meant soldiers often suffered from low morale. This image shows the measures taken to prevent the spread of diseases like dysentry, including soldiers being hosed down on the deck . The Ottomans were fighting alongside Germany, so the aim of the campaign was to knock them out of the war by capturing Constantinople, but the plan failed spectacularly, with 250,000 Allied troops injured or killed in vain. Pictured, a signpost warning soldiers of a 'dangerous' sniper . The assault began at dawn on April 25, 1915 as wave after wave of British and Irish, French, Australian, New Zealand and Indian troops attacked heavily defended beaches, through barbed wire and raced up cliffs to attack enemies . Mr Chambers, who is an expert in Gallipoli, which is also known as the Dardanelles Campaign, said: 'Some of the shots are blurry because they are real action shots'. Pictured, a soldier's photograph on the battlefield shows the moment one regiment made the dash across No Man’s Land . A picture, dated November 1915, shows Lord Kitchener (pictured third from left) and his generals in Gallipoli. At the start of the war, he was appointed Secretary of State for War by Prime Minister Herbert Asquith and proposed an invasion of Alexandretta on Turkey's Mediterranean coast but was eventually persuaded to support Churchill's plan for Gallipoli . In January 1916, after huge losses on both sides, the Allies successfully  evacuated their soldiers without further casualties. Today, soldiers from both the Ottoman and Allied sides lie close together in separate cemeteries on the Gallipoli peninsula. Pictured, an armoured Rolls Royce . The campaign has become synonymous with the heroism of soldiers from New Zealand and Australia, where Anzac Day is celebrated every year, but more British and Irish soldiers were killed. Pictured, soldiers pictured as they prepare for the campaign . Churchill put forward a proposal to send his naval fleet through the needle of the Dardanelles, a 38-mile waterway that separated Europe and Asia in northwest Turkey. The Allies later launched a major land invasion of Gallipoli . The Gallipoli landings came during a period of deadlock on the Western Front in 1915 when the British hoped to capture Constantinople in a bid to link up with Russia. Pictured, a collection of dummies on board a ship which were to be used in a 'feint landing' during the campaign . The doomed campaign was the brainchild of Winston Churchill thought up to bring an end the war early by creating a new front in the East that the Ottomans would not be able to cope with . After a failed naval attack in February 1915, the Allies tried to capture Constantinople via the Gallipoli Peninsula by land assault.

"Jose Mourinho praised John Terry's performance against Arsenal - hailing it as the Chelsea captain's best under him.

One performance at Highbury, I think in my first season, that was a fantastic performance, too. ‘But today everything was clean: giving cover, the defensive line, interceptions, reading the game so well, interceptions with a pass. The team were phenomenal, but John was one step ahead of every other player.’ Terry's performance also drew praise from Sky Sports pundit and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher, who said the 34-year-old was the best defender to play in the Premier League era. Carragher said: ‘I think Hazard will win it [Player of the Year] but Terry is just behind Hazard as he has been the most inspirational. 'We always talk about Chelsea being defensive and he's the best. I think John Terry is the best defender to have played in the Premier League. 'We will be talking about the John Terry position in 20 to 30 years. We have never seen anyone better at reading play and defending the front post.’ Fellow Sky pundit Thierry Henry also praised Terry for bouncing back in the past two seasons under Mourinho, having at times struggled under previous Chelsea managers Rafa Benitez and Andre Villas-Boas: .

"The end-of-season awards will go to the best attacker but if there was a Defender of the Year, John Terry would clean up. Nobody else would get close. This has been his best season in a Chelsea shirt. Two seasons ago Rafa Benitez said he couldn’t cope with two games a week. That will have frightened the life out of John. So credit Jose Mourinho for trusting him and building that defence around him. Terry has never had pace but that is not a problem as he reads the game so well. He didn’t break sweat against Arsenal and Chelsea were too streetwise for Arsene Wenger’s team. John Terry celebrates after the Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea at Emirates Stadium . Chelsea are undefeated against the top four this season where Arsenal have lost twice — that is the gap Wenger’s side need to bridge and Terry has been a huge part of that. I remember playing against him early in his career and after I tackled Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, he clattered right into me — he wasn’t going to let me put one on his team-mate. That’s when I knew he could grow up to be a special player. Terry  celebrates with his team-mates after the Premier League draw against Arsenal in north London . One Hull of a result . Beating Crystal Palace was a massive result for Steve Bruce. Their run-in is horrendous and had they lost at Selhurst Park, surely it was all over. It shows how football fortunes can change in an instant. Hull are not the best away from home but as the stats below show, they thoroughly deserved their win. Dame N’Doye was the star and could have had a hatful but I love the way he took his second. That little delay of his foot was just enough to put the defender off balance and give him a sight of goal before firing it in. Bruce had to move quickly to sign him on deadline day in February but N’Doye has done well since joining from Lokomotiv Moscow. If he carries on like this and Hull stay up they might have to build a statue outside the ground! Dame N'Doye  celebrates scoring the opening goal during the Premier League win against Crystal Palace . Can Manuel still be the man? After recent results, people say Manuel Pellegrini is a dead man walking. Beating Aston Villa was important but can he keep his job under so much pressure? Deciding Pellegrini’s fate will be one of the toughest choices Man City’s owners have faced. I spoke to Frank Lampard and he says they are fantastic people — there is no desire to chop and change. City are so close. They have world class training facilities, an expanding stadium and absolute fortunes to spend. But this season has been a blip. Manuel Pellegrini looks on during the Premier League match against Aston Villa at Etihad Stadium . Pellegrini won two trophies last year, so they could keep him and let him rebuild. Recruitment has been poor and they need to get it right in the summer. But it’s no good letting him buy players only to get a new man in next year. If he is sacked, who gets the job? Pep Guardiola is the dream but it would take a major fallout for him to leave Bayern. Patrick Vieira has the tools but no experience, Jurgen Klopp would be appointed on past success and Diego Simeone is an underdog manager. City want style. There is no shame losing to Barcelona, it’s the defeats to the likes of Burnley and Stoke that have hurt Pellegrini. City could still get rid of him, but I’m sure it would be with a heavy heart. Manchester City are dreaming of Pep Guardiola but it's unlikely the Bayern boss will make the move to City . Flying Foxes . Talk about timing your run. Leicester are in amazing form. Four straight wins is good for any side, let alone one facing a relegation battle. It’s been a tough season for Nigel Pearson with all the drama of him being ‘sacked’ and reinstated, but he has got his team flying at exactly the right time. Home disadvantage? There were only two home wins this weekend with three away and five draws. At this stage in the season sometimes it’s far easier to play with freedom on the road than under huge pressure at home. Toon's poor show . The way Newcastle are going I would not be surprised if they don’t get a single point between now and the end of the season. They have been an embarrassment. It’s as if they are in the clubhouse with 35 points. They don’t look like adding to that any time soon and anybody with Newcastle in their run-in has got a chance of a result.

The Newcastle players react as they suffer yet another defeat, this time to Premier League rivals Swansea . Chaos at Watford, but it works . Watford striker Troy Deeney celebrates scoring for Watford against Brighton at the Amex Stadium . Watford have spent 20 days at the top of the Championship table. Bournemouth, who are on the verge of promotion, have led for 111 days. Congratulations to Watford after their promotion, but if ever you want an example of how not to run a club, they have been it this season! With unpredictable owners, four different managers and a host of key players on loan, it has been chaos. They have been outsiders throughout but have come through when it counts. I’ve loved watching Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo bang in the goals and you can’t argue with the results. It just shows you there’s no right or wrong in football. The Watford players celebrate victory against Brighton as they all but secure their promotion to the big time . United slip up . Two weeks ago Man United had all the answers but two defeats later it’s back to the drawing board. It’s not that they have been found out, but maybe they are not as good as people thought. They were just in good form. They have had the luxury of playing with no European football this season so still have work to do in the summer. It’s the same feeling with Everton. They started the season dreadfully but have won five out of six. I’m a Roberto Martinez fan and they have good players so we should not be surprised that things have changed. Louis van Gaal watches on as his Manchester United side are comprehensively beaten by Everton . Paying the penalty . Why oh why did Danny Ings not take that penalty for Burnley? Yes, he is out of form and without a goal since February but what better way to get back on the scoresheet? He took one against Aston Villa in November and scored and he and Burnley needed that goal. Then to make things worse Leicester go up the other end and score 27 seconds later. Burnley midfielder Matthew Taylor holds his head after missing the chance to score from the spot . It was a similar story at QPR. Charlie Austin’s goals have kept his side going this season but he has missed two big penalties now — against Hull and West Ham. When every goal is so vital you can’t afford to pass up these chances. PS If QPR go down, Austin won’t be the only player with plenty of suitors. Matt Phillips has been scoring and setting up good goals in the run-in. He is a useful Premier League player.

"As Jose Mourinho led an angry touchline delegation in pursuit of fourth official Lee Mason, the entire section of Arsenal supporters who sit behind the visitors’ bench climbed to their feet to hurl their abuse. As they settled back into their seats, the rest of the Emirates Stadium exploded into verse about Mourinho, with advice as to where he should go. The Chelsea manager and his assistant Steve Holland had been complaining about the charge from goal by goalkeeper David Ospina which flattened Oscar in the first half, but which was not adjudged to be a foul. Cesc Fabregas returned to Emirates Stadium for the first time since leaving for Barcelona in 2011 . Francis Coquelin of Arsenal evades Fabregas of Chelsea during the 0-0 draw at Emirates Stadium on Sunday . Every Fabregas touch was booed as he operated in the first half in a deep role alongside Nemanja Matic . Fabregas - without his mask on - swaps shirts and salutes the Emirates crowd at full time . The pass to Oscar had been wonderfully delivered by Cesc Fabregas, masked villain of the day in this North London postcode, having the temerity to return in blue nearly four years after agitating to leave Arsenal for Barcelona. Every Fabregas touch was booed. And he didn’t hide. He was influential, operating in the first half in a deep role alongside Nemanja Matic, from where he is often more creative, before moving forward after the break into a No.10 role (and removing the protective mask). There were a lot of touches and a lot of boos. He rarely misplaced a pass but when he did the home crowd cheered. And no cheer was louder than the one when referee Michael Oliver booked him for a dive. It might not, in fact, have been a dive. Santi Cazorla and Fabregas collided knee-to-knee but the Chelsea midfielder also trailed a leg in search of contact more definite and made the it all seem a little too contrived. Oliver was on the spot. So much so that a split-second earlier, he had made a better effort than Cazorla at winning the ball. The referee ruled in Arsenal’s favour, and this proved a very popular decision. There was a rare energy about the Emirates and noise levels not normally associated with the stadium. Make no mistake, this one mattered to those in red. It mattered beyond the confines of the 90 minutes and the points won and lost in what remains of this title race. It was about next season. How close are Arsene Wenger’s team to challenging Chelsea for the title? Can they alter the balance of power in the capital? Can they close the gap at the top of the Barclays Premier League? Of course there were a couple of hate-figures in the vicinity. Animosity levels were up but Arsenal have been brilliant since the turn of the year, with one notable exception, and this was an opportunity to make a statement. Chelsea midfielder Oscar had to be replaced at half-time after a painful-looking collision with David Ospina . Arsene Wenger (left) has not beaten Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) in 13 games as the hoodoo continues . Santi Cazorla of Arsenal reacts after a missed chance during his side's 0-0 draw with Chelsea . It was time to get over the players they didn’t sign and get behind those they did. Mourinho showed respect to Alexis Sanchez by starting with Ramires wide on the right to offer defensive cover and limiting Branislav Ivanovic’s involvement as an attacking force, preferring the muscular Serb to mind the Chilean. There were flashes of what Arsenal do well and supporters rejoiced in flourishes, like a back-heel or two by Aaron Ramsey or a sliver of skill from Mesut Ozil, but they could not beat Thibaut Courtois. Arsenal fans sang: 'Boring Boring Chelsea' when they failed to penetrate, and the jeers for Fabregas were transformed into applause when he was substituted in the last minute. By then the game seemed destined to end goalless. Chelsea, had reverted to the six-man defensive shield at half-time by dropping Ramires deeper, and finished the game with centre-half Kurt Zouma also in central midfield. Mourinho was determined to leave with the clean sheet he came for and, left the more satisfied of the two managers. They remain on course for the title and celebrated at the final whistle. Wenger, meanwhile, cannot crack the Jose-hoodoo. There is work to do in the summer if this gap is to be closed.

"Real Madrid’s La Liga and Champions League chances have been dealt a major blow with confirmation that Luka Modric could miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. The Croatian midfielder pulled up in the second half against Malaga on Saturday and tests on Sunday confirmed a sprained ligament in his right knee with a recovery time of between five and six weeks. The news comes as the club wait to assess the full extent of Gareth Bale's calf injury, picked up in the same game. The connection between the former Tottenham pair is an essential part of Carlo Ancelotti's side's chances of picking up silverware this season. Former Tottenham midfielder Luka Modric is helped off the Bernabeu pitch by medical staff . Cristiano Ronaldo was the first Madrid player to go over to Gareth Bale, who picked up an injury on Saturday . Luka Modric hobbles off the Bernabeu pitch have sprained a ligament in his right knee on Saturday . Modric could still be back for the Champions League final but Real Madrid will have to get there without him. On Wednesday when they play the second leg of their quarter-final against Atletico Madrid, poised at 0-0 after the first 90 minutes, they will almost certainly also be without Bale. It’s one year on from his dramatic winner in the Copa del Rey final but Bale, who also scored in the Champions League final and the World Club Cup last year, is likely to be in a race to get back before the Champions League semi-finals on 5-6 May should Real reach them. Gareth Bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the Bernabeu on Saturday evening . Real Madrid will have Karim Benzema back against Atletico so he will partner Crisitano Ronaldo up front with James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Isco plus whoever Ancelotti calls upon to replace Modric in a midfield four. German international Sami Khedira and former Real Sociedad player Asier Illaramendi are the options. Bale’s absence will be a massive blow for Ancelotti. He said in midweek: ‘Bale was fantastic last season and has been very good this year. He scored goals in the finals last season and he will be important for us as this season reaches its climax.’ And most Real Madrid supporters see Modric as even more important to the team. The Croatian injured himself towards the end of last year and when he missed three months of football it coincided with the team’s worst run of form. The Welsh forward was forced off and faces a race to be fit for Real's Champions League quarter-final .

"New satellite images have revealed that China has constructed an airstrip on a stretch of disputed territory in the South China Sea - and could be planning to build another. They reveal the country's rapid progress in constructing the runway on the contested Fiery Cross Reef which the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all claim. China's building activity in the Spratly Islands has infuriated neighbouring countries and the United States whose leadership accused the country of bullying others with its 'military muscle'. Images reveal Fiery Cross Reef virtually untouched by man-made structures in March 2014 but by March this year, it had been transformed into an artificial island which could be used for military operations. They follow equally disturbing photographs released earlier this month showing a flotilla of Chinese vessels dredging sand onto another artificially-built island on the nearby Mischief Reef. Construction: Newly released satellite images reveal that China has built a runway (pictured) - which could be used for military operations - in a dispute region in the South China Sea . Disputed: China has built the airstrip (pictured) on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands without consulting the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan who all claim the region . Territory: The area near the Spratly Islands (pictured) where China is constructing artificial islands is claimed by many other countries in the region . Serene: Satellite images from August 2014 (pictured) show Fiery Cross Reef as a virtually untouched and beautiful natural sea-structure . Controversial: Whereas just seven months later in March this year, dredging ships can clearly be seen around the artificial island which has virtually destroyed the reef . The worrying photographs were revealed by security analysts Jane's Defense Weekly who claim building work in the nearby Subu Reef could create space for yet another 3,000m airstrip. And the same report suggested China was also working to extend a runway of that length in the Paracel Islands further north which is seen as a vital shipping route. More than £3.3trillion worth of trade passes through the potentially energy-rich section of the South China Sea every year. The United States' military commander for Asia has said China could eventually deploy radar and missile systems on the outposts it is building in the region, which would give it the power to enforce an exclusion zone. The images showed a paved section of runway 505m by 53m on the northeastern side of the reef which China began turning into an island with extensive dredging last year. China's ambassador to the United States has said it was 'natural' that his country's reclamation work would include military defence facilities. Cui Tiankai said there 'should be no illusion that anyone could... repeatedly violate China's sovereignty without consequences'. Its actions in the South China Sea have been described as 'aggressive' by Senator John McCain, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. Show of strength: Other satellite images released earlier this month showed a flotilla of Chinese vessels dredging sand onto another artificially-built islands on Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands (pictured) Force: Following their release, U.S. President Barack Obama accused China of using its military might to reclaim the contested territory in the South China Sea . He urged President Obama's administration  to move more military resources into the economically important Asian region - and boost cooperation with Asian countries worried by China. McCain claims Washington has a lot of work ahead to maintain its military advantage in the Asia-Pacific. He added: 'When any nation fills in 600 acres of land and builds runways and most likely is putting in other kinds of military capabilities in what is international waters, it is clearly a threat to where the world's economy is going, has gone, and will remain for the foreseeable future.' A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the scale of China's land reclamation and construction is fueling concerns in the region that China intends to militarise its outposts. They said: 'We do not believe that large-scale land reclamation with the intent to militarize outposts on disputed land features is consistent with the region's desire for peace and stability.' Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki said China had a duty to address regional concerns And his Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yong stressed the importance of stability in the South China Sea for trading nations like his. China's leadership has hit back at U.S. President Barack Obama who last week condemned the country for constructing an artificial island on Mischief Reef in another section the disputed South China Sea. Obama claimed Beijing was 'using its sheer size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions' amid reports of controversial land reclamation efforts in the Spratly Islands. Worrying: A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the scale of China's land reclamation in the South China Sea (pictured) is fueling concerns in the region that China intends to militarise its outposts . Territory: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said the country has 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly Islands (pictured) and it was 'protecting its nation's sovereignty' Ownership: China claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the South China sea . But a furious Chinese leadership hit back by claiming that Washington which possesses - and wields - the greatest military muscle. Only hours before Obama's comments, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying added that it has 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly Islands and it was 'protecting its nation's sovereignty', according to the BBC. She said the construction was to serve troops protecting the area, civilian activity such as search and rescue operations, scientific research and commercial fishing. Before-and-after images from the area show aircraft runways appearing from jungle, solid masses where there was once coral and man-made harbours replacing natural reefs. The country claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the South China sea. But the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all have overlapping claims to the region. The dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels. Several south Asian countries stake claim to the territory, though China tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago. Beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which, they say, includes the islands in Chinese history. Taiwan supports its claim, and has its own airfield on the island of Taiping. Vietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the Philippines, the closest geographically, says the islands belong to them. In 1974, Chinese forces seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing 70 troops. There were further clashes between the two countries in 1988, with 60 Vietnamese soldiers killed. In 2012 China and the Philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a Scarborough Shoal. The Filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call Panatag. Upon boarding a Chinese military vessel for inspection, officials claimed they found live sharks, clams and illegal reef. Later, Vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting Chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in January it was claimed China would be taken to a UN tribunal to challenge its stake.","Reveals a massive construction effort on Fiery Cross Reef in Spratly Islands .

"Frank Ernest Shepherd, III of Houston, Texas, led police on a high-speed chase after being pulled over for a traffic stop that ended when he slammed into another vehicle . An unarmed man shot dead by police on live television on Wednesday afternoon was a 41-year-old father of three who had another baby on the way. Frank Ernest Shepherd, III of Houston, Texas, led police on a high-speed chase after being pulled over for a traffic stop that ended when he slammed into another vehicle. He then got out of the car and reached into his backseat before being shot by police. According to ABC 13, the pursuit began a little after 10am, when Shepherd, 41, peeled off and led a fleet of cars on a chase as he drove on the freeway, across grass medians, through parking lots and even busy intersections. The entire incident was captured live by a helicopter filming from above. At one point he called 911 and claimed to have a child in the backseat, which turned out to be untrue. It lasted roughly 20 minutes before he slammed into a white van and then another car, totaling the front of his car and forcing him to get out of his vehicle. 'He was given commands to show his hands and come out of the vehicle,' said Thomas Gilliland, a spokesperson for Harris County Sheriff's Office. Scroll down for video .

The chase ended when Shepherd crashed into another car (above) and after reaching into his backseat was shot by two officers . No weapons were found in the car and it is not known what Shepherd was reaching for . When he came back up after reaching into his backseat, two officers fired 10 to 12 rounds, and Shepherd fell to the ground. No weapons were found in the car, which was riddled with bullet holes after the shooting. Two of the passengers in the cars hit by Shepherd received medical attention, with one being treated at the scene and the other being taken to a local hospital. The Houston Chronicle reports that Shepherd's mother later appeared at the scene as her son was taken away on a gurney mouthing 'Oh god!' His father meanwhile fell to his knees and began crying when he heard what happened to his son. 'I'm looking at it on TV saying 'why would you run from the law?' Not knowing it was my nephew,' said the man's uncle, Chris Shephard. 'My sister, his mom, called and told me that they shot and killed him.'

Disputed: But newer images (pictured in March) show Chinese vessels dredging sand onto artificially-built land masses near the Spratly Islands . Territory: The area near the Spratly Islands where China is constructing artificial islands is claimed by many other countries in the region . Agressor: After the American president condemned China for building land masses on disputed territory, its furious leadership claimed it was Washington which possesses - and wields - the greatest military muscle . A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said: 'The US leader talked about China's 'sheer size and muscle', but one can also see clearly who has the biggest size and muscle in the world. Only hours before Obama's comments, Hua Chunying added that China has 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly islands and it was 'protecting its nation's sovereignty', according to the BBC. She said the construction was to serve troops protecting the area, civilian activity such as search and rescue operations, scientific research and commercial fishing. 'The structures... do not affect, nor are they targeted at, any particular country,' she claimed before adding China would 'continue to strengthen' its activities in the area. The US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has has been picturing and documenting the construction of an artificial island known as Mischief Reef in the South China Sea. Massive expanses of sand and concrete were being unloaded among the Spratly Islands in the disputed waters. China used dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea before dumping it on submerged coral reefs to make islands, Ethan Rosen, a geopolitical researcher in China claimed. Before-and-after images from the area show aircraft runways appearing from jungle, solid masses where there was once coral and man-made harbours replacing natural reefs. The country claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the South China sea. But the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all have overlapping claims to the region. Construction: The US Navy initially claimed China was creating a 'great wall of sand' (pictured in February 2014) in the South China Sea . Controversial: A spokesperson from China's foreign ministry said the country 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly islands and it was protecting its nation's sovereignty . They claim China is illegally reclaiming the contested area and creating artificial islands with facilities that could have military use. Late last month, the U.S. Navy reported the latest land mass China had built was 1.5 square miles in size and created by dumping sand on live coral reefs, possibly damaging local ecosystems. It was just one of several artificial islands China had been creating in the region and their exact purpose remains unknown. Analysts claim the images circulated by CSIS reveal that China is trying to create 'facts in the water' to bolster its territorial claim. Manila - one of the most vocal critics of Beijing's actions in the region - has appealed to the international community to intervene after conceding it and other countries in the region are powerless to stop China's controversial construction. Its foreign affairs spokesman Charles Jose said: 'We are asking the international community to tell China that what it is doing is wrong, and to ask China to stop this reclamation work. China's declared defence budget of around £97billion this year is 55 times that of the Philippines' £1.7 billion. Jose believes Beijing is rushing the construction to undermine an upcoming United Nations ruling on the Philippines' claim to the territory. He said: 'We think China has a plan and they think they have the means to do it and they can actually do it. Aerial photo shows Thitu Island, part of the disputed Spartly group of islands in the South China Sea located off the coast of western Philippines, pictured on July 20, 2011 . On Thursday, Obama waded into the debate by telling a town hall meeting in Jamaica that Beijing should not push around countries with which it is in dispute in the South China Sea. The president said: 'Just because the Philippines or Vietnam are not as large as China doesn't mean that they can just be elbowed aside.' The United States broadly supports its Asian allies against Chinese pressure and has asserted that freedom of navigation is in the country's national interest. On Friday, Hua maintained that China has maintained 'security and peace' in the region and was working with neighbouring countries. The commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet warned  the constructions were 'increasing regional tensions and the potential for miscalculation' late last month. Admiral Harry Harris Jr added: 'China is building artificial land by pumping sand on to live coral reefs - some of them submerged - and paving over them with concrete.' Harris said the region is known for its beautiful natural islands but 'China is creating a great wall of sand with dredges and bulldozers over the course of months'. The dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels.

"Linda Thompson, Bruce Jenner's second wife, has praised her former husband for being 'a champion for those who share the struggle to just be who they are.' She tweeted her message of support and pride just hours before Bruce's highly-anticipated  sit down interview with Diane Sawyer is set to air on ABC. It's the first public comment the former beauty queen, who was married to the Olympic gold medalist from 1981 to 1986, has made about his rumored transition from male to female. Scroll down for video . Breaking her silence: Bruce Jenner's second wife Linda Thompson tweeted a message of support for the Olympian ahead of his ABC prime time special with Diane Sawyer set to air on Friday night . Supportive and proud: Linda, 64, has said her former husband's anticipated confirmation that he's transgender and plans to live as a woman is as monumental as his Olympic success . Linda shared two pictures of the former decathlete, one of him celebrating his victory at the Montreal Olympics in 1976 and one of his sporting image on a billboard. She compared his expected revelations about his personal journey to the magnitude of what he accomplished as an athlete. Linda had two sons with Bruce - Brandon and Brody - and both have been seen in teaser videos released by the TV network suggesting they are also supportive of their father's transition. Second time around: The star athlete met Linda Thompson as his first marriage crumbled and as soon as his divorce was finalized in January 1981, he and Linda tied the knot in Hawaii . Real man: A shirtless Bruce happily posed on the cover of Playgirl in 1982 with  Linda, as he continued to reap the rewards of his Olympic success . A former beauty queen and an ex-girlfriend of Elvis Presley, Linda and Bruce tied the knot in a beach ceremony in Hawaii on January 5, 1981. The two had started seeing each other while the Olympian was still legally married to his first wife Chrystie and married as soon as his divorce was finalized. They led a glamorous Hollywood lifestyle and were fixtures on the celebrity circuit. Linda starred in the Hee Haw TV series and had small parts in other TV shows and films while Bruce worked as a TV commentator and actor, appearing in six episodes of CHiPS and the Village People movie Can't Stop The Music. In 1982, the couple posed for the cover of Playgirl with Bruce shirtless alongside his curvaceous wife. Following their divorce in 1986, Linda went on to marry prolific music producer David Foster, from whom she was divorced in 2005, and became a celebrated songwriter in her own right. Proud mama: Linda shared this photo of herself with her sons Brody, 31, and Brandon, 33, Jenner on on April 6 . It's been reported previously that Bruce has said that he told both his first two ex-wives, when their divorces were finalized, that he's known since childhood that he should really be living as a woman. There have also been persistent stories over the years about the former star athlete's penchant for wearing women's clothes. Bombshell claims surfaced Friday suggesting Bruce had, in fact, started a gender transition process in the mid-1980s, following his divorce from Linda, but had stopped after he met and fell in love with Kris Kardashian, who became his third wife. Entertainment Tonight, quoting 'a source with direct knowledge,' said Bruce, now 65, had allegedly started hormone therapy and electrolysis and had had plastic surgery to make his features look more feminine. A spokesperson for the father of six declined to comment on the report after being contacted by DailyMail.com Friday morning.

"A picture posing with a St Bernard dog in front of the snowy peak of the Matterhorn must top the list for the ultimate Swiss souvenir. But that iconic photo opportunity has been consigned to history after a Swiss town bans selfies with the giant rescue dogs. Zermatt in the Upper Valais area of Switzerland has imposed the ban after a report from an animal welfare charity alleged the dogs were kept in 'miserable conditions'. Scroll down for video . Posing with dogs like these St Bernards has now been banned by the Swiss town of Zermatt . According to the Swiss Animal Protection Agency, the St Bernard dogs are being kept as tourist props by a company in the town that treats them very badly. The organisation has carried out investigations into the conditions the dogs were being kept since 2012 and published a report earlier this year. The report said said when they were not being taken out on excursions with tourists, the dogs  were being kept locked up in confined conditions in an unheated condemned building for long periods of time. It claimed the dogs are left without food or water in foul smelling conditions and are not given enough exercise. When they are put on show,  the dogs are kept in the cold for long periods of time and quickly grow tired while posing for photographs, sometimes with children riding on their backs. The organisation has been calling for the town council of Zermatt to ban the use of the dogs for many years. In a statement, SAP said the town's decision showed it 'loves the animals'. Zermatt, under the shadow of the Matterhorn is a popular tourist desitnations . It said: 'SAP rejoices that the town of Zermatt has now taken action to ban taking pictures of St Bernard dogs in its territory. 'Zematt has shown that it loves the animals and it will put an end to the contemptible and dangerous shows these dogs were made part of by being used as tourist props. 'For several years, the SAP, and its section working in the Upper Valais have criticised the conditions in which these animals are kept, and time and time again, has complained about those who keep the animals in captivity, for their violation of laws on the protection of animals. 'The SAP will continue to do all its can to make sure these dogs, which at the moment are housed in a condemned building in miserable conditions flout animal protection rules, are kept in comfortable conditions that meet their needs. 'The SPA is offering its help on the condition those holding the owners decided to put these dogs in better accommodation after they have been used purely as objects for hire.' The mayor of the town, Christophe Bürgin, told Swiss radio station Walliser Bote: 'No Saint Bernard dogs will be used for photo shoots with tourists on the peaks of Gornergrat and Sunnegga. 'We have been able to convince providers that it is not right to continue to offer pictures in that way.' He said over the summer a few dogs might be found because of long-term contracts with tour operators but the practice will be stamped out by next winter. In March the association filed a legal complaint against the St Bernard owners, claiming that the dogs’ living and working conditions were abusive. MailOnline has contacted the St Bernard owners for comment.","Swiss town of Zermatt bans tourists taking pictures of St Bernard dogs .

"Living near congested roads with high levels of air pollution can cause ‘silent strokes’ which increase the risk of dementia, scientists have warned. Exposure to small, sooty particles, mostly caused by traffic fumes and factory emissions, alters the structure of the brain, they said. The microscopic particles have previously been shown to cause lung damage and harmful changes in blood vessels and clotting, and are thought to contribute to the deaths of 29,000 people every year in Britain. Living near a congested road can increase the chance of developing dementia, research has found . Researchers examined the brains of more than 900 people aged more than 60 and assessed the pollution risk . US researchers found evidence that living near congested roads or polluted areas can lead to ‘silent strokes’ which in turn cause shrinkage of the brain and other damage. Silent strokes, which arise from blockages in blood vessels supplying the brain, do not have any outward symptoms and the victim is usually unaware of them. Sudha Seshadri, a professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine, said: ‘This is concerning, since we know that silent strokes increase the risk of overt strokes and of developing dementia, walking problems and depression. ‘We now plan to look more at the impact of air pollution over a longer period, its effect on brain shrinkage over time, and other risks including stroke and dementia.’ The study, by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine, involved more than 900 people aged 60 and over who did not have dementia or a history of strokes. It recorded how far participants lived from major roads and used satellite imagery to assess their exposure to the fine particulate matter known as PM2.5. This is made up of small particles measuring just 2.5 micrometres, or 30 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. These particles are generated from a variety of sources, including power plants, factories, trucks and cars and the burning of wood. They can travel deeply into the lungs and have been associated with increased numbers of hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes. The study participants’ brain matter was measured using MRI scans. The researchers found that increases in PM2.5 in towns and cities was linked with a 46 per cent higher risk of silent strokes. The research was published in a report in the journal Stroke. Researcher Elissa Wilker, of the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Research Unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said: ‘This is one of the first studies to look at the relationship between ambient air pollution and brain structure. ‘Our findings suggest that air pollution is associated with insidious effects, even in dementia and stroke-free individuals. ‘The mechanisms remain unclear, but inflammation resulting from the deposit of fine particles in the lungs is likely important.’ The study will add to mounting pressure on the Government, which faces a judgment at the Supreme Court next week over its failure to meet EU legal limits for air pollution. Sixteen cities – including London, Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield and Birmingham – have failed to hit air quality targets.","American researchers examined more than 900 people aged 60 and over .

"Switzerland is the world's happiest nation thanks to healthy GDP figures, strong social bonds and an increasing life expectancy, a new study of global wellbeing has revealed. The list is dominated by European nations, particularly those in Scandinavia, and measures a country's population by factors contributing to its citizens' contentment, rather than wealth. Britons are happier now than they were two years ago, the study found, but still ranks in at a relatively lowly 21st place. And despite often mocking its northern neighbour as an inferior nation, the United States is a full 10 places below Canada, ranking at 10th and fifth respectively. Unsurprisingly the world's least happy countries are places ravaged by war and extreme poverty - with Syria, Burundi and Togo taking their place at the bottom of the 158-nation strong list. Celebration: Switzerland is the world's happiest nation thanks to healthy GDP figures, strong social bonds and an increasing life expectancy, a new study of global wellbeing has revealed . Spectacular: Icelandic citizens are now so happy that the country jumped from number nine in 2013 to number two this year, thanks in part to their well beautiful scenery (pictured) and cultural history . The 2015 World Happiness Report is the third of its kind and is edited by a team of renowned academics and analysts - among them American economist Jeffrey Sachs and  head of the London School of Economics' 'wellbeing' programme, Richard Laynard. First published in 2012, the study uses a range of factors to determine how happy a nation is, ranging from purely domestic perspectives - such as GDP and life expectancy figures - to how its citizens view themselves and their country within the world at large. 1. Switzerland              6. Finland . 2. Iceland                     7. Netherlands . 3. Denmark                  8. Sweden . 4. Norway                    9. New Zealand . 5. Canada                   10. Australia . This year's study is the first to additionally break the statistics down by age and gender, however, with it possible for readers to find, for example, that a country ranking relatively highly overall, has a hidden population of deeply unhappy young women concerned about equal rights and pay. The top 10 on the list is dominated by nations from Scandinavia - which are unsurprisingly also among the wealthiest on the planet too. Equally unsurprising are the countries lower at the bottom of the list - almost all of which are in the midst by bloody civil war, political unrest or crushing poverty. One surprising anomaly, however, is Palestine, which came just below the midway point in the study at number 108, despite being ravaged by conflict. Happiness: The top 10 on the list is dominated by nations from Scandinavia. Citizens of these countries, such as Swedish nationals (pictured) are unsurprisingly also among the wealthiest on the planet too . Fierce rivalry: Despite often mocking their northern neighbour as an inferior nation, U.S. nationals (left) are a full 10 places below Canadians (right), ranking at 10th and fifth respectively . Low ranking: Unsurprisingly the world's least happy countries are places ravaged by war and extreme poverty - with Syria (pictured) Burundi and Togo taking their place at the bottom of the 158-nation strong list . The idea of assessing nations by the citizens level of happiness, rather than simply by wealth, is something promoted by the EU, who consider it a more accurate representation of the population as a whole. While many of the study's headline findings were relatively predictable, the wellbeing test becomes far more interesting when experts being analysing the biggest rises and falls. 149. Chad                    154. Rwanda . 150. Guinea                 155. Benin . 151. Ivory Coast           156. Syria . 152. Burkina Faso        157. Burundi . 153. Afghanistan          158. Togo . Greece, which is crippled by national debt and faces an increasingly uncertain future, is by far the fastest declining nation on the list. Other European nations that suffered the worst during the global recession, such as Spain and Italy, have also plummeted in the happiness stakes. Recent economic difficulties do not guarantee a country tumbling down the rankings, however. Both Ireland and Iceland suffered financial woes towards the end of the last decade, but the wellbeing of their populations appear to have been more affected by improvements in health and social issues. In fact Icelandic citizens are now so happy that the country has jumped from number nine in 2013 to number two, pushing the world's previously most happy nation, Denmark, down into third place thanks their country's perceived level of generosity, as well beautiful scenery and cultural history.","List is dominated by European nations - particularly those in Scandinavia .

"A 17-year-old boy who was killed after breaking out into Gangnam Style dancing in his local corner shop had aspirations of going on Britain's Got Talent, his heartbroken mother has revealed. Speaking for the first time since Jordan Brennan's killer was jailed for eight months for manslaughter, Kim reveals how her son was a 'cheeky chappy' and 'lots of fun', and would 'dance and sing all the time. He was a real show off'. However, the 43-year-old mother-of-five, from Gorton, Manchester, has slammed what she calls the lenient sentence, saying: 'There is no justice at all.' Jordan's heartbroken mum, Kim, 43, said: 'Jordan loved dancing – and he was killed because of it.' She told of how her son longed to go on Britain's Got Talent, and how he had made a recording of an Ed Sheeran song . Jordan Brennan was attacked in September last year, as he left his local shop. 'His favourite question was: 'Have you got £1 mum?'. In tribute, his mother Kim says they all threw a pound coin into his grave for him . Jordan was attacked in September 2014, after breaking into the dance made famous by South Korean artist Psy, but it enraged the other boy, 16, who thought his South East Asian ethnicity was being mocked. After claiming Jordan bumped into him as he spun round, the 16-year old attacker tried to stop the victim and ordered him to apologise - but the pair became involved in a tussle. As they struggled, Jordan fell back and hit his head on metal shutters before his head hit the concrete floor below. College student Jordan got to his feet and walked home not realising he had suffered a serious head injury in the bust up. He was found lifeless in bed at 9am the following morning when Kim tried to raise him for breakfast. Tests showed he had suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. At Manchester Crown Court in March, the killer, now 17, was jailed for eight months. Speaking about the incident for the first time, Kim said: 'His six-year-old sister had taught him a new dance on the day he died, and he was showing off in his local shop, in high spirits, which was typical of him.' Speaking about the incident for the first time, Kim said of Jordan: 'His six-year-old sister had taught him a new dance on the day he died, and he was showing off in his local shop, in high spirits, which was typical of him.' 'He always sang in front of the mirror and he loved admiring himself,' Kim Brennan (right) said of her son (left), who she added loved dancing and showing off . She told of how her son longed to go on Britain's Got Talent, and how he had made a recording of an Ed Sheeran song. 'He loved dancing to 'Gangnam Style' and The Shuffle, but that day, it cost him his life,' she said. She said that Jordan was a typical teenager, a keen footballer and fisherman, who loved girls, music, singing and fashion. Kim said: 'Jordan was a really cheeky chappy. He was lots of fun; he loved music and dancing and when Gangnam Style was released, he loved it. He would dance and sing all the time. He was a real show-off. 'He always sang in front of the mirror and he loved admiring himself. 'His favourite question was: ""Have you got £1 mum?"". In tribute, we all threw a pound coin into his grave for him. It broke my heart.' Kim said Jordan, pictured holding his baby sister, always sang in front of the mirror and loved admiring himself . His mother Kim says she went to the local shop in Gorton, Manchester to see what had happened. The shop owner confirmed Jordan had been dancing the shuffle and 'Gangnam Style' before he was attacked by a stranger who had then disappeared . Jordan's mum, Kim, says the killer's eight month sentence is an insult to her son's memory . On the day that Jordan died in September last year, his little sister, Millie, six, had taught him to do a dance called 'The Shuffle'. Kim said: 'The pair of them were dancing in the kitchen and they had me in stitches laughing. 'Millie kept saying to him: ""Don't bend your knees"". 'Eventually, he got the hang of it and he and Millie were messing around and laughing.' Early in the evening, Jordan went out with his friend, Lewis. Kim said: 'Jordan came back and said that someone in the local shop had hit him because he was dancing. He was rubbing his neck so I checked him over thoroughly but he seemed fine. 'He seemed a bit tipsy and I told him off and said he'd have a hangover in the morning. 'It was only after he died that I found out he wasn't tipsy at all - he had a head injury. I just presumed, like a typical 17-year-old, he had sneaked a couple of drinks. 'I torture myself that I didn't take him to hospital.' Kim herself went to the local shop to see what had happened, and the shop owner confirmed Jordan had been dancing the shuffle and Gangnam Style before he was attacked by a stranger who had then disappeared. Kim said: 'Jordan seemed OK, he ate dinner and went to bed but was sick during the night. Again, I thought it was perhaps alcohol, and so I cleaned him up, helped him change his pyjamas, and he went back to sleep. 'I looked in on him again when I went to the toilet at around 3am and he was fine.' But at 8.30am, when Kim and her daughter Millie went to wake him, Jordan was dead. Kim said: 'Millie and me went into his room as usual; she was full of beans and she was armed with a deodorant because she always complained that Jordan's feet smelled. Jordan's family and friends walk past the funeral procession . Jordan's mother Kim said she knew there was something wrong when she found him lying in bed. Pictured, friends and family at his funeral . 'But I knew, from one look at his face, that there was something dreadfully wrong.' Kim called an ambulance as she frantically tried to resuscitate her son. Police inquiries revealed that Jordan had been attacked as he left the shop, with his killer pushing, pulling and kicking him, causing him to fall twice, banging his head on metal shutters and again on the pavement. Kim said: 'I had to move out of the house whilst forensics took over. It was horrendous. Millie kept asking for her big brother. Our whole family was devastated.' A now 17-year-old youth was charged with murder, but prosecutors accepted a guilty plea to manslaughter, concluding he could not be proven he intended to kill. The court heard the 'flashpoint' for the fatal incident was Jordan 'dancing and making reference to 'Gangnam Style'. The attacker claimed he took the remarks as 'racist' and 'mocking' because of his ethnicity. But prosecutor Rob Hall said Jordan may simply have been 'in high spirits and exuberant' and that he was of good character and there was nothing at all to suggest his actions were racist. The youth was jailed for just eight months, leaving Kim and her family devastated. Kim said: 'For the killer to say he took Jordan's dance as racist or offensive is disgusting. Jordan was just dancing, as he always did, regardless of who was watching. 'Jordan was killed because he had a sense of fun, that's all there is to it. It's a disgrace that his killer is allowed to say such things when my son isn't here to talk for himself. 'There is no justice at all. The sentence is an insult to Jordan's memory.'","Jordan Brennan, 17, died after being attacked in a Manchester corner shop .

"Dr Mehmet Oz's fellow faculty members at Columbia have written an op-ed lashing out at how his 'unsubstantiated medicine... sullies the reputation' of the university - in just the latest attack on his talk show tactics. But they also leap to the physician's defense in the piece, saying that his on-air 'Ozisms' should not cancel out his stellar work at the university, where he has an unblemished record as a doctor. The eight staff wrote the op-ed for USA Today after 10 doctors urged Columbia to sever all ties with Oz, who serves as vice chairman and professor of surgery at the College of Physicians. Those doctors accused him of being a 'charlatan' who promotes 'quack treatments' on his syndicated talk show - accusations Dr Oz has vehemently fought this week. Scroll down for videos . Under fire: Faculty at Columbia University have said some of Dr Mehmet Oz's tactics have 'sullied their reputation' - but also applauded him for the work he had carried out at the Ivy League school . In the new op-ed, his fellow faculty also denounced his TV show methods. They pointed out that in 2014, the BMJ medical journal said 'that less than half of the recommendations on his show are based on at least somewhat believable evidence'. 'Many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking Ozisms regarding metabolism game changers,' the staff members wrote in the op-ed. 'Irrespective of the underlying motives, this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of Columbia University and undermines the trust that is essential to physician-patient relationships.' That said, 'the weaknesses in [his] professional balance sheet' should not force him out of his job at Columbia University, where he has been employed since 2001, they wrote. He was hired because of his strengths as a doctor and receives top reviews from his peers and patients, and therefore should not be forced to leave the job 'in which he excels', they wrote. Support: The eight faculty members, including Drs Michael Rosenbaum, left, and Joan Bregstein. right, said they have spent a great deal of their time debunking 'Ozisms' their colleague had shared on air . Instead, they suggested that his case raises questions of what responsibilities doctors in the media have to their patients. 'What happens when a doctor's job in media-medicine collides with office- or hospital-based medicine? Dr. Mehmet Oz is a case in-point.' 'Many of us are spending a significant amount of our clinical time debunking Ozisms regarding metabolism game changers. Irrespective of the underlying motives, this unsubstantiated medicine sullies the reputation of Columbia University and undermines the trust that is essential to physician-patient relationships.' 'We need to re-evaluate the roles of the health sciences and government in broadcast medicine and what are the responsibilities of media physicians to their patients?' 'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful. However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine. 'Regulatory guidance addressing the tension between his two positions is potentially a far better solution that could result in improved health care both in the doctor's office and in the media. 'Dr. Oz might begin each program with a simple disclaimer: ""The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University.""' The full op-ed can be read at USA Today . 'Non-evidence based medical recommendations presented without the appropriate caveats are costly and potentially harmful,' they wrote. 'However, unless these foibles can be shown to render Dr. Oz inadequate or ineffective at Columbia, there is no justification for forcing him to resign from a well-earned position in academic medicine.' Rather, he should start each show with a disclaimer: 'The opinions expressed on this program may not be evidence-based or part of accepted medical practice and have no endorsement from Columbia University,' they said. The op-ed was penned by Dr Michael Rosenbaum, Dr Joan Bregstein, Dr Elizabeth Oelsner, Dr Sumit Mohan and Dr Dana March of Columbia University Medical Center, Dr Michelle Odlum of the School of Nursing, Dr Katherine Shear of the College of Physicians & Surgeons, and Tal Gross of the Department of Health Policy and Management. On Friday, Dr Oz, 54, said he was 'very proud to have that feedback' from his colleagues as he appeared on the Today show. 'The [Dr Oz] show has to be much broader than what might take place in a doctor's office,' he said. 'I completely respect why so many of my colleagues might have a difficulty with that, but I'm also appreciative that many of them do understand why that's important.' While appearing on Today, he insisted that, despite the criticisms, his show will continue. He has been hosting the program since 2009. 'Without question, the show will survive it,' he said. 'I want to keep doing the show for as long as I can because I think we played an important role in making America a better place.' Even though he often wears his scrubs on air, he added that his show is not about medicine, but about living 'the good life', such as looking at the power of prayer or techniques abroad. Defense: On Friday, Dr Oz appeared on the Today show and said his show would survive the criticism . Vehement: He told Matt Lauer that his show was more about living 'the good life' than medical information . He said he continues to stand by his use of the word 'miracle' to some treatments - but wishes he had not used it for weight-loss supplements. 'This is a flawed area with lots of fraud, both in the research and in products,' he said. 'And we no longer talk about them. I haven't talked about them in a year.' And talking about the letter from the 10 doctors last week, he said that those critics have agendas, particularly against genetically modified organisms, which he has supported. 'The 10 doctors who attacked me got what they wanted – sensational headlines and sound bites,' he previously said on his Thursday show, which was entitled The Truth About His Critics. 'It's ironic that I am being accused of a conflict of interest by these doctors, when, as you are about to see, some of them have their own conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also.' Four who signed the letter, including leader author Henry Miller, have at some point been associated with the American Council on Science and Health. Defiant: The celebrity doctor used Thursday's episode of The Dr. Oz Show to hit back and claim that the criticism he's received is part of a conspiracy because of his outspoken views on genetically modified food . The organization has previously received grants from Monsanto, who manufactures GMO seeds. During his show on Thursday, Oz denied attacking genetically modified foods. 'That is not true. I have never judged GMO foods,' he said. 'But just like 64 countries around the world, I support GMO labeling so you can decide on the foods for your family.' Dr Miller had written of Oz: 'He's a quack and a fake and a charlatan. I think I know the motivation at Columbia. 'They're star-struck, and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country. 'But the fact is that his advice endangers patients, and this doesn't seem to faze them.' Columbia previously released a statement that it 'is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.'","Eight faculty members at Columbia University penned an op-ed accusing Dr Oz's on-air tactics of sullying the reputation of the Ivy League school .

"The wife of a U.S. Army colonel who shot her two children dead four years ago says she does not regret it. Julie Schenecker, 54, was convicted last May of shooting her son Beau, 13, and daughter Calyx, 16, in their upscale Tampa Bay, Florida home in January 2011 while her husband served overseas. Now in an exclusive jailhouse interview, she has claimed she pulled the trigger to 'save' her children, despite previously admitting to authorities that she had shot them for being 'mouthy'. When asked by ABC Action News in the interview if she regretted the shooting, Schenecker, a former military linguist, shook her head. Scroll down for video . No apologies: Julie Schenecker, pictured in an interview from jail, has said she does not regret shooting her 13-year-old son and 16-year-old daughter dead at their home in January 2011 . 'I saved them,' she said quietly. She claimed her son was being sexually abused - but would not say by whom - and that Calyx had told her she was suffering from mental illness. She feared the girl would be attacked, too, she said. 'I was raped as a virgin and my whole life has been a mess,' Schenecker told ABC. 'I came from a great family. They protected me. And this still happened. I couldn't let it happen to Calyx.' But police disputed the claims, saying she had admitted to killing the children for being 'mouthy'. Last year, the court also saw pages from her journal that detailed her plans to kill them in the days before their murders, as well as entries after she carried out the killings. 'I offed Beau on the way to practice,' she wrote. 'I accidentally shot the window then shot him. One in the side of the head and one in his mouth because he became so mouthy just like Calyx.' Killed: She shot her son Beau, left, inside their car before going to the room of her daughter Calyx, right, and shooting her as she did her homework. She then forced her daughter's mouth into a smile, she said . Emotional: She sobbed throughout the interview as she claimed she'd killed her children to 'save' them . Speaking to ABC Action News, she said that she shot her son as he went to tie his shoelace. The boy's body was found inside her car in the garage. Afterwards she walked to Calyx's room and shot the girl in the head as she was doing her homework, Schenecker said in the interview. 'Shot the two mouthy mouths in the mouth after shooting them in the head,' she wrote in her journal. In the interview, she admitted that only one side of Calyx's mouth appeared to be in a smile when she lay dead, so she forced the other side of her mouth to smile as well. Both the children were covered in blankets when authorities went to the home after Schenecker's mother had contacted them, worried that she had been unable to contact her daughter. Schenecker was found covered in blood and passed out at the house. She was taken to hospital and was later charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Speaking in the interview, she said that she had initially only intended to kill herself but when she went to buy a gun, she was unable to take the weapon home the same day. Plot: Pages in her journal showed how she detailed the killings long before carrying them out - despite claiming in the new interview that she only thought about killing them at the moment she shot them . In court: Schenecker is seen during her trial in a Tampa courtroom in April 2014. Her attorneys tried to prove that she was insane at the time of shooting dead her children but the jury rejected the argument . Parker Schenecker, pictured in court as his wife was found guilty last May, was serving in the Middle East when she shot their children. She wrote in her journal she thought he was going to divorce her . 'I had to wait,' she recalled. 'If I had gotten it the day that I went to the gun store, I would have killed myself that day.' Despite the journals detailing how she planned to kill the children, she said in the jailhouse interview that she did not wake up that day thinking she would kill them. Instead, the thought to take their lives only came seconds before she pulled the trigger, she said - but she added that she remembers little about the murders. 'I don't understand what happened that day,' she said. 'So I don't know how to make you understand, what happened that day. That is the problem.' She claimed she had struggled with alcohol and painkiller addiction, and she had a history of mental health issues, including clinical depression. At her trial last year, her defense team had tried to argue that she was insane at the time of the killings. Former life: The couple, pictured in happier times, were married for 20 years after meeting in the military . Scene: Police surround the couple's upscale home in Tampa following the discovery of the bodies . All six mental health experts who testified at her trial last year said Schenecker was mentally ill, but three experts called by prosecutors said she was legally sane when she shot her children. The jury rejected her insanity plea and she was convicted of the two murders and sentenced to life in prison without parole. In her jailhouse interview, she said she had wanted to get the death penalty. Her husband of 20 years, Parker Schenecker, who divorced her a few months after the killings, said there was never any indication she would hurt the children. The Army colonel was on a 10-day deployment to the Middle East at the time of the murders. In his children's memories, Mr Schenecker has created a memorial fund that has provided scholarships for promising student leaders, artists and athletes.

"An entire herd of buffalo has been shot dead by law enforcement in upstate New York after they escaped from a farm. Around 15 animals ran away from their pen in Schodack in Rensselaer County on Thursday evening and then swam across the Hudson River. They then started running down the Thruway, a series of toll roads which link up the major cities in the state, including Buffalo and New York City. Three men hired by the farm were cleared to open fire Friday afternoon in a stream in woods in the town of Coeymans, about 10 miles south of the state capital Albany. Scroll down for video . Around 15 animals ran away from a farm in Schodack, upstate New York, on Thursday and then swam across the Hudson River. They were all shot dead by law enforcement on Friday.

One of the men firing at the animals gets into a heated exchange with officials before another is bundled into a car by deputies . Police say the decision was made after experts agreed tranquilizers would not be effective and no portable corrals could hold the animals. George Mesick, the farm's owner, told Albany's Times Union they must have swam across the river to the town of Bethlehem, where they wandered Friday morning between Interstate 87 and the river's west bank. The herd crossed a local road at about 11:15 a.m. and ambled onto the Thruway in a spot 10 miles south of Albany. Drivers slowed to avoid the buffalo. The animals safely crossed the northbound lanes and then trotted south on the shoulder into some woods. Mesick had previously admitted he had little hope they would be captured unharmed. 'There is a zero percent chance of getting them back right now I think. I just want to get this done with as fast as possible so that no one gets hurt,' he said earlier on Friday. He would have tried to bring the herd in himself, but they are wild and not tame.  A police helicopter was hovering over them to make sure the group did not split.

"The LAPD for searching for the person who tagged a police horse with graffiti this week - but the answer may be in the so-called 'art'. The horse, Charly, was patrolling Venice Beach with his minders on Tuesday when the vandalism incident occurred. It was broad daylight, and somehow the person managed to spray Charlie without the handlers seeing - a move that taggers pride themselves on, but usually with stationary objects and facades. 'I think it's unfortunate, but people love to tag things in Venice, so really, I guess a horse is just the next step,' local Mark Stegall told CBS LA. Vandalized: Charly was patrolling Venice Beach with with his minders Tuesday when the cruel tagger managed to write 'RBS' and an arrow on the horse's flank with silver spray paint . 'It's cruel and it's not respectful,' another local, Robert Kendall, said. 'It's bad for the animals and it's just people who want to mess with the status quo and I think it's pretty awful.' However, tags are cryptic signatures, and authorities are hoping they will be able to track down the person responsible using the tag, which was 'RBS'. A witness who saw the officer taking a picture of Charly after the incident posted their image to Instagram. All clean: The paint came off relatively easily, but police are still trying to find the person responsible . 'RBS': The key to finding the tagger likely lies in deciphering the tag, RBS, and working out who it belongs to .

"Children as young as three are being asked to sign a contract pledging not to use transphobic language at school. The pledge is contained in a ‘home-school agreement’ which all children must sign before they start at Turnham Primary School in September. The infants must also promise to refrain from using homophobic and racist phrases and to be tolerant of people with different sexual orientations and lifestyles. Each child must print their name and provide a signature to confirm that they understand their ‘responsibilities’ while attending the school. Anti-bullying: Turnham Primary School - led by executive headteacher Selina Sharpe - sent out an agreement for all new children to sign before they start in the new academic year . Tick-box bureaucracy: But parents were dumbfounded when it included a demand not to use 'transphobic language', as it would mean explaining something many three-year-olds are not even aware exists . It is understood that teachers at the South-East London school introduced the document to help stamp out playground prejudice against transgender people and a wide range of disabilities and cultures. But yesterday the chairman of governors said that they knew nothing about the change to the contract, which was also dismissed as ‘bonkers’ by parents who said pre-school children could not be expected to understand such complex issues. The contract was sent to parents last week along with the letters offering a place at the school. It reads: ‘We believe that every child can and should reach their full potential. This is achieved when all staff, parents and children understand their responsibilities and work together towards the same goals, as detailed in our home-school agreement.’ In a list of responsibilities for pupils to sign is a clause which states pupils will be tolerant of ‘sexual orientation or lifestyle and refrain from using racist or homophobic or transphobic language in school’. The contract does not say what will happen to pupils who disobey the clauses. Yesterday, one mother said: ‘My son is three yet he is meant to pledge not to use “transphobic” language. ‘How am I meant to explain it to my three-year-old that he must sign on the dotted line not to do something which he is not even aware exists when he can barely hold a crayon? This just fills me with dread about what sort of politically correct, tick-box bureaucracy runs this school. ‘I agree that teachers need to be made aware of transgender issues as it affects a number of children who suffer in silence, but to make three-year-olds sign up to something they do not even know exists is bonkers.’ Sorry: The school's chair of governors has apologised for any offence or distress caused to parents or pupils . Turnham Primary is a foundation school, which means it is funded by the Government through Labour-run Lewisham Council, which yesterday refused to comment on the matter. The school, led by executive head teacher Selina Sharpe, also declined to comment. Yesterday, Robert Mapp, chairman of governors, said he was not aware of ‘the change in format’ to the home-school agreement. He said Miss Sharpe was an ‘interim executive head’ at Turnham, adding: ‘Given she is a Lewisham Council employee who was personally referred to Turnham Primary Foundation School by the executive director for children and young people, Frankie Sulke, I am surprised the local authority have elected not to comment on the matter once. ‘On behalf of the governing body I would like to sincerely apologise for any offence or distress caused to our parents and pupils. Until I have held a full inquiry into the matter, I am not in a position to make any further comment.’ The controversy comes in the wake of the Coalition’s British Values drive, which requires all schools to teach tolerance of other faiths and lifestyles. It was introduced last year in response to the Trojan Horse scandal, which saw schools in Birmingham allegedly infiltrated by Muslim hardliners hoping to impose an Islamic agenda. But since then, schools have complained they have been penalised by Ofsted for failing to meet the criteria. Two Christian schools in the North East said pupils were asked ‘inappropriate’ questions on race and sexuality – and branded intolerant when they gave the wrong answers. One ten-year-old girl was left in tears after inspectors allegedly asked her ‘whether she felt trapped in someone else’s body’. Two years ago Turnham Primary came to national attention when Cliff Pearce, then chairman of governors, claimed expenses for travel to the school for meetings from his home in Menorca in Spain.","Turnham Primary School demands pupils sign 'agreement' before  starting .

"A stunning convertible Ferrari which is almost identical to one that was famously destroyed in cult 1980s film Ferris Bueller's Day Off is expected to sell for £10million at auction. The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider is widely regarded by many as the most beautiful convertible ever made. But it is best known for that infamous scene in the 1986 teen comedy starring Matthew Broderick. The car, in classic Ferrari red, was the pride and joy of the father of Ferris Bueller's best friend Cameron in the movie. That was until the friends take the model out for a spin which results in the convertible accidentally smashing through its glass showroom doors into the ravine below. A stunning Ferrari - which is almost identical to the model driven in cult eighties classic film Ferris Bueller's Day Off is up for auction . The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider (pictured) is regarded by many as the most beautiful convertible ever made . But its most famous moment came it was used as the car for the 1986 teen comedy Ferris Bueller, starring Matthew Broderick . In the movie, Ferris took best friend Cameron's dad's red model out without permission but the car eventually trashed . You killed the car: In one of the film world's best-known scenes, the beloved Ferrari crashes into the ravine below after Cameron accidentally knocks it off the jack . This car, however, is in significantly better condition and has recently undergone a full restoration by Ferrari in Maranello. One of just 16 in existence, it has a 3-litre V12 engine which develops around 280bhp. It will do 0-60mph in less than 7 seconds and hit a top speed of more than 150mph. It will be sold next month at RM Sotheby's auction in Villa Erba, Italy, and has a guide price of around £8 million.

"The family of one ANZAC veteran were thrilled to receive news from a stranger this week that their relative's war medal had been unearthed in an east Melbourne Park. Fossicker Ashley Manzie was combing the park with his metal detector when he discovered a medal belonging to Frederick George Biddulph, who served with the 23rd Australian Infantry Battalion at Gallipolli between 1914 and 1915. Mr Manzie posted photos of the silver medal to an online fossicking forum, which led him to Sydney man Stephen Norton - Biddulph's great-nephew. 'At first I thought it was a scam or someone trying to sell me something,' Mr Norton told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just couldn't believe it - I thought wow - and then I was really confused.' Rare find: Ashley Manzie unearthed the WW1 star medal when he was combing a Melbourne park with his metal detector last week. Mr Norton, who has been researching his family history for 'a very long time' says the discovery has raised more questions than it has answered. He thinks the inscribed medal doesn't belong to Frederick at all, but to his brother Lewis William Biddulph. 'Frederick never went to war. He'd lost two fingers blowing up fish so he  wouldn't have been accepted to fight,' said Mr Norton. 'We think his younger brother Lewis, who had a slight hearing problem, may have used his name to sign up.' It means that a grave in Melbourne's Springvale Cemetery bearing a plaque with Frederick's name is probably not his either. Instead, it records the date of Lewis's death, or 'Bunny' as he was called in the family 'because he was so fast.' Norton recently discovered that Frederick had actually died nine years before 'Bunny' in New Zealand. Frederick Biddulph's plaque at Melbourne's Springvale cemetery probably belongs to his brother Lewis, who joined the army in his name because he had poor hearing . Frederick Biddulph (left) pictured with Stephen Norton's grandfather, Thomas Driscoll, and another brother, Bill . Stephen Norton says tracing the family history has been difficult because it seems the men changed their names a number of times in order to get into the service. He says the only thing he knows for sure is that there were three brothers who went off to WW1 from Tasmania - and that they all came back alive. The other brothers were Benjamin William, who was awarded the Gallipoli Medal, and David Tasman. According to national records, the 23rd Battalion with which Bunny served landed at Anzac cove in September 1914. The troops manned Lone Pine, 'one of the most trying parts of the Anzac frontline' until they left Gallipoli in December 1915. Norton says his own grandfather - Bunny's brother - fought in the Battle of Fromelles in France. 'He was a machine-gunner who was caught on the wire and spent years as a Prisoner of War in Germany before making it back to Australia,' Norton says. 'Somehow they all made it home.' From the archives: Frederick (left) whose name is inscribed on the WW1 medal, never joined the army because he lost two fingers 'blowing up fish' before the war. The lost medal is instead thought to have belonged to his brother, Lewis 'Bunny' Biddulph . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says it made his year to be able to return the medal to a living relative ahead of  the ANZAC Day Centenary this weekend . Some of Manzie's other finds with the silver war medal . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says he was 'blown away' to unearth the medal so close to the 100 year ANZAC Day anniversary. He says he found Stephen Norton after 'researching his heart out' with other members of the Australian Metal Detecting and Relic Hunting online forum. 'Definitely a roamer,' he posted to the forum after finding a slew of documents on Frederick Biddulph in the National archives. 'I found out that he was discharged from the Army as medically unfit when he returned to Australia in 1917, that he was diagnosed with Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart),' Manzie told Daily Mail Australia. Manzie also found letters from Biddulph's mother in Tasmania, appealing to the authorities for information about her son. 'Not knowing he whereabouts:' Ashley Manzie discovered this letter from Frederick Biddulph's mother asking the authorities for information on the whereabouts of her son . Did Mrs Biddulph ever make contact with her son Frederick or was she looking for Bunny? 'I don't know, I don't know if she even knew about the name swaps,' says Stephen Norton. 'Dad's the only one from that era who would know - and I was hoping to be able to drag more out of him - but he's 94 now and his memory isn't what it was.' For Norton, the discovery raises the question of the other two medals that the records say were awarded to 'Frederick'. 'This is the only one that has come to light, maybe the others are with his family, I don't even know if he had children and if there's other family out there,' he says. Stephen Norton doesn't know whether Private Frederick George Biddulph's mother ever made contact with her son, or his brother Lewis 'Bunny' Biddulph, when they returned to Australia from the war . Stephen Norton says he will proudly wear the newly-found medal, alonsgide those of his grandfather and his own father, to the Marylands RSL Anzac Day dawn service this weekend. Ashley Manzie says the discovery has 'made his year.' 'It made not just my day but my year when I found out that I could return the medal to a living relative. Especially being the 100 year anniversary of ANZAC,' he said. 'All this history and amazing story all from a beep on my detector in a park! Lest we forget.'","A Melbourne man has unearthed a WW1 medal  with his metal detector .

"The vaccine, known as RTS,S, took 30 years to develop but it is now hoped it can be used to save millions of lives . A new jab against malaria could prevent millions of cases, scientists claim. Researchers say the vaccine, which has just completed the final stages of testing, could make a ‘substantial contribution’ to controlling the disease. Drug firm GlaxoSmithKline has applied for a licence from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the RTS,S vaccine. The news is significant because RTS,S is the first malaria vaccine to reach advanced trials. Tests were carried out on 15,500 toddlers and babies in sub-Saharan Africa. Among those who had three doses of RTS,S and a booster shot, the number of clinical cases of malaria – those confirmed by a doctor – was reduced by 36 per cent after four years. But the protection waned over time, boosters worked less well than the initial dose and the vaccine was not as effective in younger children, a report in The Lancet journal says. Scientists have worked on the vaccine for more than 20 years – at a cost of more than £330million, but experts say there is a long way to go. There is no licensed vaccine against malaria anywhere in the world and researchers say they are hopeful the results will be sufficient for RTS,S to gain a licence from the EMA.The World Health Organisation could then recommend its use by October this year. In the trials, an average of 1,363 cases of clinical malaria were prevented over four years for every 1,000 children vaccinated, and 1,774 cases in those who also received a booster. Over three years, an average 558 cases were averted for every 1,000 infants vaccinated, and 983 cases in those also given a booster dose. Professor Brian Greenwood, the study’s author and professor of clinical tropical medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ‘Despite the falling efficacy over time, there is still a clear benefit from RTS,S. ‘Given that there were an estimated 198million malaria cases in 2013, this level of efficacy potentially translates into millions of cases of malaria in children being prevented.’ But he said he was ‘disappointed’ by the results of the clinical trials, adding: ‘I hoped the vaccine would be more effective, but we were never going to end up with the success seen in measles vaccines, with 97 per cent efficacy.’ The shot , which is designed to be used by children in Africa, could be approved by October, making it the first approved vaccine for the world's most deadly disease . The disease is difficult to treat because the malaria parasite has a complicated life cycle and has learned how to evade the human immune system over hundreds of years. The latest World Health Organisation figures show that of the 198million cases in 2013, 584,000 people died. Most victims are children in Africa, where one dies every minute. Currently, the most effective prevention measure is the use of mosquito nets. The trial involved 15,459 infants aged six to 12 weeks and children aged five to 17 months from Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. Bloodsucker: A mosquito. Only female mosquitos can transmit malaria .","Vaccine named RTS,S could be available by October, scientists believe .

"Anthony Trollope, a famous novelist, introduced post boxes to the UK in 1852 after seeing them in France . Royal Mail is to issue a set of stamps marking 200 years since the birth of Anthony Trollope – the Victorian novelist who also introduced post boxes to the UK in the 1850s. The limited edition sheet of stamps feature images of Trollope and his life, including the first post box design. Although famous as a novelist, Trollope also made history by introducing post boxes while working for the Post Office, after seeing them in France. The first boxes were erected in Jersey in 1852 as a trial before appearing across mainland Britain. They were initially painted green, to blend in with the landscape, but that was later changed to red to make them more visible. The new colour was introduced in 1874 and it took 10 years to repaint all post boxes. Red has remained the standard colour for UK boxes with only a few exceptions, one being blue post boxes for overseas mail. There are now 115,300 post boxes in the UK. Sue Whalley, Royal Mail's chief operating officer, said: 'We are delighted to contribute to this year's bicentenary celebrations of the birth of Anthony Trollope. 'He is well known as a former Post Office employee and we have him to thank for introducing pillar boxes to the UK. 'Whether in walls, on poles or freestanding, the network of post boxes has grown from Trollope's time to reach around over 115,000 boxes which are now an iconic feature of communities across the UK.'

"The mother of a five-year-old girl has told of her heartache each time she looks at her daughter's disfigured face. Young Alexis Douglas was playing at her sister's friend's house in Melbourne earlier this year, when a neighbour's pitbull attacked the little girl. Left with deep gashes of up to 10cm, her mother Monique Douglas told Daily Mail Australia that not a day goes by that she cries for her daughter who has been left so traumatised that she is unable to play outside by herself. But what has outraged Mrs Douglas even more is that the dog's owner escaped without a conviction for not registering his pitbull and was instead handed a $1500 fine by the court. Five-year-old Alexis Douglas from Melbourne required 50 stitches after a savage pitbull her face earlier this year . The injured girl pictured in hospital after the dog attack which left her with permanent facial scars . Alexis spent the first term huddled inside the classroom with her teachers close by for fear of going outside . It was a week after Alexis's fifth birthday when Mrs Douglas received a call from her distraught teenage daughter, Maddie, on January 23. The 16-year-old had just witnessed her younger sister being mauled by a pitbull. Mrs Douglas rushed over to the home, only to be told by her husband Andrew not to look at her youngest daughter. This was because Alexis had been bitten on the left side of her face with gashes from her middle forehead, the side of her temple to the left of her cheek. The five-year-old needed 50 stitches to her face and still requires treatment for the next three years, which Mrs Douglas says will cost nearly $10,000. It was a week after Alexis's fifth birthday when she was horrifically attacked by the savage pitbull .

The mother of the five-year-old girl has told of her heartache each time she looks at her daughter's disfigured face . So Mrs Douglas was infuriated on Thursday when Frankston Magistrates' Court handed dog owner Edward Powell a $1500 fine and no convictions, as he had put down his pitbull soon after the horrific incident occurred. The pitbull which attacked Alexis Douglas . 'He made himself out to look like the nice guy because he had originally rescued the dog from a factory but no questions were asked about why the dog had been abandoned in the first place,' Mrs Douglas told Daily Mail Australia. 'And because he put down the dog - despite having a close relationship with it - even though he didn't register it, it all makes me really angry. 'I had to sit through all the lies and the fact that he walks away with just $1500 is a disgrace. 'Even Ed's son told us that the dog had always been aggressive and that it growled at him all the time. 'I would've felt better if he was charged or given a fine of maybe $10,000 to $15,000 but at the end of the day, what his dog did to my daughter's face is something we have to live with for the rest of our lives.' Mrs Douglas says her daughter requires day and night masks as well as silicon patches to help heal the permanent scarring . Due to her facial injuries, Alexis was not able to attend her first day of school this year and spent the first term huddled inside the classroom with her teachers close by for fear of going outside. She also goes to school with bandages on the left side of her face and further requires day and night masks, as well as silicon patches to help heal the permanent scarring. Mrs Douglas says she also massages her youngest daughter's face every night to reduce the injuries. 'The scarring is getting better but I work hard and ensure that I don't miss out a day or night of treating my daughter's face,' she said.

'People don't understand what we've been through but I guess there's nothing we can do now as the verdict has been handed down.'

"Business leaders have voiced their fears over the 'disastrous Tory campaign' which they believe has been too focussed on 'personal attacks and scaremongering'. They expressed concerns over the negative tactics employed by the Conservative campaign ahead of the general election next month – which they believe have done little to discredit Ed Miliband. As it emerged that the Labour leader is now the bookies' favourite to be the next prime minister, a number of business leaders revealed they are worried David Cameron will lose the battle for Number 10. And it appears Mr Cameron's advisers have the same fear and have called on campaigners to change tack today. Scroll down for video . Business leaders have blasted the 'disastrous Tory campaign' which has focussed too much on personal attacks against the opposition. Pictured: David Cameron in Lincoln today (left) and Ed Miliband campaigning at Chatham House, London, today . Business leaders said Cameron's role in delivering economic growth had become the 'background noise' of the Conservative campaign when it should have been the focus . The critique comes just weeks after more than 100 of Britain's top business leaders backed the Conservatives' economic plan in what was described as an 'unprecedented move' urging voters not to risk a 'change of course'. In a notable intervention weeks from the election on May 7, the business chiefs, who run companies with well known retail brands such as Primark, Iceland, Ladbrokes and Costa Coffee, signed a better claiming a Labour government would 'put the recovery at risk'. But now, a number of FTSE 100 and other business leaders have anonymously criticised Mr Cameron's use of personal attacks on his opposition. Speaking to the Financial Times on the condition that they would not be named, one chairman said: 'The negative campaign has been disastrous'. Another added that the successes of the coalition government, including delivering real economic growth and jobs has become the 'background noise' of the campaign instead of its focus. But a Conservative spokesman insisted that the campaign's focus on the idea of the SNP in a coalition with Labour is doing well on the doorstep, according to the FT. Some argued the campaign's focus has been too narrow and that 'fear tactics' could backfire badly. 'The Scottish scaremongering plays into the SNP's hands,' said one chief. And it appears Tory tacticians had believed Mr Cameron's economic record would have delivered a solid poll lead by now. The polls put Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband on equal footing – and several business leaders suggest this is a result of the Conservatives underestimating the leader's appeal to voters. As bookies named Ed Miliband the favourite to be the next prime minister, one business leader said: 'Every time Miliband is visible, he appears credible' 'Every time Miliband is visible, he appears credible,' said one. 'The worst thing is when (Conservative) Central Office tries . to be helpful,' one Conservative candidate told Reuters. 'On the doorstep, when you speak to voters, very little is . changing. The campaign has been almost genteel.' Mr Cameron helped nurture a recovery that has lifted the . economy out of its deepest downturn since World War Two to give . Britain one of the fastest growth rates in the developed world. Lynton Crosby, Cameron's Australian election guru, has now told the Conservatives to focus on that. His philosophy, fellow advisers reveal, is that 'you can't . fatten a pig on market day,' meaning voters need to be bombarded . with a message well in advance of polling day for it to 'take.'","Expressed concerns over tactics employed by the Conservative campaign .

"An owl breeder has come up with a novel idea to help him tell his young fledglings apart - by giving them brightly coloured manicures. Jay Brittain, 63, was worried that the baby owls at Small Breeds Farm Park and Owl Centre, Herefordshire, look so similar at birth that he could end up overfeeding them, which can be fatal for the birds. So he instructed workers at the farm to varnish the claws of each fluffy owlet using nail polish  in their very own 'talon salon'. The first born Tawny owl is given orange talons, the second hatched has theirs painted purple and for the third born, pink. Scroll down for video . Talon salon: An owl breeder has come up with a novel idea to help him tell his young fledglings apart - by giving them brightly coloured manicures . So far, a total of seven cute owlets born to two different mother's have been given the colourful makeovers at the centre in Kington, Herefordshire . The first born Tawny owl gets orange talons, the second hatched has theirs painted purple and for the third born, pink . Alice Pond applies nail paint to a baby tawny owl which hatched on April 8 at Small Breeds Farm Park and Owl Centre. Staff use ordinary nail varnish for the job . Staff at the farm park have to feed baby mice to the little owlets within 12 hours of hatching and initially three or four times every day. But after three days their feeds reduce to three times a day and, by two months, they need to eat twice a day . Mr Brittain said: 'It is just normal ladies' nail varnish.  It is as simple as that. It is important to keep accurate records and it is important to not to overfeed any one of the single owls.'So to make sure we can see the ages we do this. They all look very similar' Mr Brittain said: 'It is just normal ladies' nail varnish. It is as simple as that. 'It is important to keep accurate records and it is important to not to overfeed any one of the single owls. 'So to make sure we can see the ages we do this. They all look very similar.

Alice Pond applies  purple nail paint to a baby tawny owl. The fledglings look so similar at birth that he could end up overfeeding them, which can be fatal for the birds . Mr Brittain, who has been breeding owls for 22 years, said the risks of overfeeding can be fatal. He added: 'Owlets need to eat more food the older they get but if you do overfeed them it can be very dangerous.'They could die. The food just sits in the stomach' Jay Brittain applies nail paint to a baby tawny owl which hatched on April 8. The owls talons are simply painted and not filed in any way . 'So each one family member in one clutch is painted a different colour depending on when they were born. 'We have for instance three Tawny owls from one clutch, or family, so we have painted their nails three different colours according to when they were hatched.' Mr Brittain, who has been breeding owls for 22 years, said the risks of overfeeding can be fatal. He added: 'Owlets need to eat more food the older they get but if you do overfeed them it can be very dangerous. 'They could die. The food just sits in the stomach. 'It is a bit like us having a really heavy lunch or dinner. They just lie there and they are not in any way active. Painted nails on a baby tawny owl. The new owls will go to other farm parks, zoos, breeding centres or private collectors when they are old enough . 'It should be a lesson for us all really.

But after three days their feeds reduce to three times a day and, by two months, they need to eat twice a day. They are fully grown at three-months-old and are able to break up the food themselves. Animal carer Alice Pond said: 'In the wild, owls only live three to five years but in captivity they live a lot longer. 'We have a Tawny owl that is about 20 years old. He was rescued from the Weobley area of the county by Jay and he is still here.'

"A man finally freed satisfied a well-earned fast food craving by eating his first hamburger after being wrongfully imprisoned for 36 years. Michael Hanline, 69, was convicted of murder for the fatal shooting of truck driver JT McGarry in 1980, and on Wednesday a judge dismissed the charges against him. In a video posted on April 20 by the California Innocence Project, which has been working to free Hanline since 1999, he is seen on the day he was released at the counter of a Carl's Jr asking for a hamburger 'they show on TV with the bacon on it'. As he dug into his meal of a large  Mile High Bacon Cheeseburger with fries and a drink, it was a special moment for him. 'My oh my, that's what meat tastes like huh?' he said after taking his first bite. 'The commercial does it justice.' Scroll down for video . Michael Hanline, 69, who was wrongfully imprisoned for 36 years, was dismissed of charges on Wednesday. On the day of his release last November, the moment he ate his first burger after being in prison for decades was captured on video (above Hanline tucking away into a bacon cheeseurger at a Carl's Jr restaurant) On Wednesday, after a GPS monitor was cut off, Hanline finally  put on the boots (above) he last wore 36 years ago when he went to prison for a crime he did not commit . Following more than three decades after Hanline was incarcerated, it emerged that crucial DNA analysis and investigative reports were withheld from his original trial. The new evidence proved that Hanline was innocent and the longest-serving wrongfully imprisoned inmate in California's history was finally released last November. And earlier this week, a judge dismissed him of the charges. 'The whole thing was surreal for him when we got him out. It’s impossible for any of us to imagine what it’s like to spend 36 years in prison and then come out,' Justin Brooks, director of California Innocence Project at California Western School of Law told Daily Mail Online. In the video showing his first moments of freedom, Hanline is seen on November 24, 2014 walking with  Brooks as he takes his first steps after leaving prison. 'Today is the day we are finally getting the first of the California 12 out of prison,' Brooks says in the video. In the video posted on April 20 by California Innocence Project, Hanline is seen on the day of his release on November 24, 2014 as he walks out to a cheering crowd . Holding his wife Sandy's hand, the video shows him looking up into the sky and taking in a breath of fresh air as he leaves prison. While in the car he said: 'It's just an incredible rush. It doesn't seem I guess actually real yet' Hanline is then greeted by a cheering crowd as he walks next to Brooks, and holding his wife's hand, he walks out of the doors looking up at the sky. When asked what he is feeling in that moment, he is left speechless only able to shake his head in awe. 'You can see the look on his face when he looks up at the sky as a free man and it’s so overwhelming for him,' Brooks told Daily Mail Online. 'My oh my oh my. It's kind of hard. This feels like I'm on the front of a rocket ship,' Hanline says in the video as he rides in the backseat of a car. 'It's just an incredible rush. It doesn't seem I guess actually real yet.' Brooks said Hanline had not seen much movement in 36 years so everything just seemed like it was moving at a 1,000 miles per hour while he was inside the car. 'It’s a sensory overload nobody could understand,' Brooks told Daily Mail Online. 'I’ve been doing this for 25 years and I’ve walked 18 other people out of prison, and I still have no idea what that experience is like unless you’re in their head. Once he enters the Carl's Jr restaurant, at the counter (above) he asks for 'a burger they show on TV with the bacon on it' After taking his first bite (Hanline pictured above eating the cheeseburger), he said 'that's what meat tastes like huh?' Once inside of Carl's Jr, Hanline takes a few moments stumbling to figure out what to order but then says he wants a burger that is 'seen in commercials' before tucking into his meal. 'Inside of Carl’s Jr it was a beautiful moment and also a sad one,' Brooks told Daily Mail Online. 'He looks at the menu and he hasn’t made choices in 36 years, being in prison took away his choice and he eats what he’s told to eat. 'You can see he’s sort of stunned by that whole process. I didn't know what to get him either because I’m a vegetarian and it was my first time inside of Carl's Jr, so I just told them to give him the biggest one.' On Twitter, Carl's Jr announced on Thursday they were giving him a year of free burgers. The company wrote: 'Michael, thank you for choosing Carl's Jr./Hardee's. Hope you enjoyed it. Here's a few more' After learning of Hanline's story, Carl's Jr shared on Twitter they would be giving him a year of free burgers. 'Michael, thank you for choosing Carl's Jr./Hardee's. Hope you enjoyed it. Here's a few more,' the company tweeted to CIP on Thursday evening with a pictured attached that said 'Free burgers for a year, Michael 2015'. Brooks said Hanline was really excited about the offer from Carl's Jr. After Hanline's murder charges were formally dismissed on Wednesday, he appeared with a white beard and pony tail outside of court with his wife, Sandy, where he said he was hoping to return to a normal life. He also had a GPS monitor cut off allowing him to finally put on the boots he last wore 36 years ago when he went to prison for the crime he did not commit, according to CIP. 'All I want to do is go fishing and ride my bike and spend time with Sandy and do a little gardening,' he said outside of court in California on Wednesday. 'Hopefully everything is going to be like it used to be.' He added that he had been riding a motorcycle ever since his release and complained that California roads had gotten bumpier during his years behind bars. Following the judge dismissing him of charges on Wednesday (Hanline pictured left with his wife Sandy on April 22 and right on November 24, 2014), he said he is looking forward to returning to a normal life . California Innocence Project wrote back to Carl's Jr saying Hanline was thrilled to hear about the free burgers . 'Mike said it’s like being reborn  everyday and that the world has changed so much in 36 years,' Brooks told Daily Mail Online. After decades in prison, Hanline, who lives in Paso Robles, was also coming to terms with 21st century living and talked about 'Buck Rogers' gadgets such as cellphones. 'Gas isn't 32 cents and a pack of cigarettes isn't 30 cents,' he said. 'It's a whole new ball game.' Hanline was in his early thirties when he was charged with killing friend, Ventura resident J.T. McGarry in 1978. He said he kept waiting for justice to prevail but had no idea that he would spent the next 36 years in prison. Testing showed new DNA evidence found at the crime scene did not come from Hanline or his alleged accomplice. In addition, prosecutors withheld evidence that should have been disclosed to Hanline's legal team during the trial. Michael Hanline leaves court after his case was dismissed of charges in Ventura, California on Wednesday, April 22 . Hanline said all he wants to do now is go fishing, ride his motorcycle and spend time with his wife Sandy . Hanline's conviction was overturned and he was freed from prison on November 24 after prosecutors told a judge doubts had been raised about the case. However, he had been required to wear a GPS ankle bracelet and had faced the possibility of a retrial. A Ventura County Superior Court judge dismissed the charges at the request of prosecutors, telling the courtroom it was done because the allegations can't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 'I’ve been working on his case for 15 years and and when you spend all of that time with someone in prison and you get to walk them out, there’s no greater feeling,' Brooks told Daily Mail Online. 'If a lawyer gets to have one of those experiences, they’re lucky and I’ve gotten to have 18.' Prosecutors are still investigating who might have killed McGarry. 'When I first got arrested, I figured it might take a year or two to get this all straightened around but not 36,' Hanline said, including two years he spent in jail after his arrest but before his conviction. He added: 'I never believed I'd spend the rest of my life in prison, but man, 36 years is a long, long time.'","Michael Hanline, 69, was convicted in 1980 for murder of JT McGarry .

"Police put extra security measures in place after a kiwi man associated with Islamic State urged followers to launch attacks targeting Anzac Day commemorations. Kiwi jihadi Mark John Taylor, who claims to be fighting with Islamic State in Syria, posted a video on YouTube in an attempt to incite violent acts in Australia and New Zealand during services commemorating Anzac Day's centenary. In the video, which has since been removed after 3 News notified authorities, Taylor instructed fellow jihadists to act out against police and soldiers. 'Now is the time to commence your operations, even if it means you have to stab a few police officers, soldiers on Anzac Day and so be it.' Scroll down for video . Kiwi jihadi Mark John Taylor has posted a video to Youtube urging IS sympathisers to attack Anzac Day services in Australia and New Zealand . New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush confirmed Taylor was 'known to New Zealand authorities' and that this was not his first attempt at publicly 'airing his views'. Mr Bush said police had conducted a thorough assessment of the troubling video and he was satisfied all appropriate measures had been put into place to protect those who plan on attending Anzac Day services. 'We take our responsibility for the safety and security of New Zealanders very seriously and, while we are unable to go into detail, we have already taken further security measures.' Police in New Zealand have confirmed they have implemented extra security measures amid growing concerns of a targeted terror attack . 'Zealanders should feel confident in attending Anzac Day events as planned, while exercising their usual vigilance in light of the current global security environment,' Mr Bush said. Prime Minister John Key told 3 News the troubling video only further confirms that IS are a growing threat to New Zealand and its people. 'It just reaffirms what I've been saying, that IS is a war that they are trying to bring to New Zealand.' Mr Key told reporters that while IS enjoy 'inciting fear' by publicising the atrocities they commit, the group are under extreme scrutiny. 'Those people are under…a pretty significant watch from the authorities, so we will continue to watch those people very, very closely.'

He reportedly burned his passport upon crossing the Syrian boarder and posted to Facebook that his move to Syria was a 'one-way trip, no going back', the Guardian reported. Before his account was suspended, Taylor became an active twitter user and made headlines after he geo-tagged 45 tweets, subsequently revealing his precise location in Syria to the whole world. While some claimed he did this unknowingly branding him the 'bumbling jihadi', Taylor said he had 'every intention' to display his location.

Before his account was suspended, Taylor became an active twitter user and made headlines after he geo-tagged 45 tweets, subsequently revealing his precise location to the world . This comes only weeks after an Anzac Day terror plot was foiled by Australian authorities when 200 officers raided properties in south east Melbourne. Five men were arrested and it was revealed they were allegedly plotting to run over a police officer, savage him with a knife and steal his gun so they could embark on a shooting rampage in the streets of Melbourne on Anzac Day. Two of the five men arrested in the pre-dawn raids remain in custody, including Sevdet Besim, 18, of Hallam, who was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act. Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court . A second 18-year-old man, of Hampton Park in Melbourne's southeast, was being held under a Preventative Detention Order, which allows police to hold a person without charge for up to 14 days. A British teenager was also arrested on suspicion of helping to plot the ISIS-inspired attack during Anzac Day commemorations. A 14-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire, allegedly communicated with Australian men who had planned to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day. Police said the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after they intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested  on suspicion that he was instigating a beheading, again on Australian soil. The Australian Federal Police confirmed the 14-year-old's arrest was linked to counter terrorism operations in Australia.

"A woman asked a judge on Thursday to dismiss her lawsuit against the daughter of University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban, bringing an end to a legal fight between sorority sisters that was sparked by an alcohol-fueled brawl. Attorneys for plaintiff Sarah Grimes and for Kristen Saban would not say whether there had been a settlement of the lawsuit, which was set for trial in early August. 'We are pleased that this case is over,' said Josh Hayes, a lawyer for the coach's daughter. Burying the hatchet: University of Alabama graduate Sarah Grimes (left) has dropped her lawsuit against her former sorority sister Kristen Saban (pictured right with coach dad), whom she had accused of brutally beating her . Sisters: Both Saban and Grimes pledged the Phi Mu sorority (pictured) at the University of Alabama in 2009 . Stephen Strickland, who filed the request on behalf of Grimes, declined to comment. The one-sentence dismissal motion did not give a reason for the move, but it said each woman should pay her own legal costs. Tuscaloosa County Circuit Judge James Roberts did not immediately rule on the request. Grimes sued the coach's daughter in Tuscaloosa County in 2012 over a fight they had while attending college in 2010. The lawsuit said Grimes suffered lasting injuries during the brawl, which evidence showed began over a Facebook post after a night of drinking. Arguments during a hearing and court documents showed the two women came to blows at Kristen Saban's apartment after the famous coach's daughter posted 'No one likes Sarah yayyyyy!' on Facebook. Grimes banged on Saban's bedroom door demanding that the post be deleted and the two were soon in a tussle that included pushing and hair pulling. Grimes portrayed Kristen Saban as the aggressor. Grimes said she suffered serious injuries, including a concussion and a broken nose that required surgery. But a judge in Tuscaloosa cited Alabama's 'stand your ground' law in ruling that Saban only defended herself against Grimes. Nick Saban and his wife, Terry Saban, were not parties in the lawsuit, which sought an unspecified amount of money. Girl brawl: Grimes (left) claimed in her 2012 lawsuit that she suffered lasting injuries during a boozy brawl with Saban (right) in 2010, which evidence showed began over a Facebook post after a night of drinking . Grimes' now-defunct lawsuit stated that the fight happened in the wee hours on Aug. 29, 2010, after a night of drinking at Rounders, a local bar in Tuscaloosa. The two sorority sisters and five other girlfriends were hanging out in Saban's apartment when they began to bicker over a boyfriend. Grimes told Saban to 'shut up' and that 'others were tired of listening to her,' according to court documents. Grimes told Saban she 'needed to get therapy' because she was a 'psycho' — to which Saban fired back: 'Because that worked really well for you,' court records show. Standing her ground: Saban claimed it was Grimes who attacked her first and she was just defending herself . Saban then locked herself in the bathroom, and posted on her Facebook: 'No one likes Sarah, Yayyyyy!' That's where things get murky — which each of the sorority sisters claiming in legal papers that the other beat her badly. In her testimony, Grimes said that Saban 'used both of her hands and shoved her into an open door frame,' where she hit her head. Grimes said she put 'one hand on [Saban's] throat, one hand on her chest, and threw her back' to try to get away. But Saban bounced back on top of her and 'hit her in the face more than five times,' leaving Grimes bleeding 'all over the floor and all over herself,' running down her face and into her bra. Grimes later testified that she had 'extensive' injuries, including a swelling on her left temple and a black eye. Saban presented a different version of events. She said in legal papers that, after she posted on Facebook, Grimes rushed over to confront her and began banging on her door. 'She was screaming at me to take it off and cursing, and I finally took it off, and I opened the door, and I showed her,' Saban testified, according to court records. 'I had my phone out, and I said, ""It's off. It's off."" 'And then she took both of her hands and put them around my throat.' University of Alabama coach Nick Saban (pictured) and his wife, Terry Saban, were not parties in the lawsuit . Saban added there was 'just a lot of slapping and punching, not many [punches] landing, and scratching.' Her injuries including a broken nose and scratches on her back, she testified. Kristen Saban pleaded guilty to an unspecified offense before the university's judicial board but was not prosecuted criminally, according to the suit. It said she was required to undergo psychological screening and take an anger management class. Grimes and Kristen Saban, one-time close friends, have both graduated from the university. Ms Grimes went on to become a first-grade teacher in Alabama, while her arch-rival has launched a career in marketing.","Sarah Grimes accused Kristen Saban, daughter of Alabama football coach Nick Saban, of brutally beating her after a night of drinking in 2010 .

"A young mother wrote a heartbreaking obituary for herself before she passed away after a years long battle with cancer. Beth O'Rourke, 44, of Paxton, Massachusetts, has spent the past 7 years fighting stage four biliary cancer, and on April 16, the mother of Courtney, 11, and Seamus, 8, lost that fight. But as she stated in her obituary; 'I was a survivor.' Beth O'Rourke (above with husband Brendan and children Courtney and Seamus), 44, has spent the past 7 years fighting stage four biliary cancer and passed away April 16 . Beth (above with Brendan) wrote her own obituary . 'I died Thursday, April 16, 2015 surrounded by family, in the arms of my husband and 'anam cara', Brendan Patrick O'Rourke,' she wrote in the obituary. Anam cara means soul mate in Gaelic. She then went on to acknowledge all those she loved so much in her life, and then express just how happy she was, even though she was gone. 'I LOVED my life. I loved a long run, to sit quietly by the lake, to read and dance and sing and be silly with our children,' she wrote. 'We loved watching summer storms blow across the water. I loved to chat and laugh with my sisters and friends, until tears ran down our legs!' In the end though, she focused on her two children and her husband. 'Of all the things I did in this life, nothing compared to being with Brendan and our children. I fought every day to stay alive and to be with them. No person could ever ask for a more loving and supportive husband, always my champion, always,' she said. 'I enjoyed every moment we shared; the great ones, the sad ones, the easy and the hard. I pray they have learned to feel the deep sense of faith that I shared. No matter where this journey brings me next, I will forever carry their love with me, as I am sure there is a piece of me that will forever remain with them.' As for her own life, she said she hoped to be remembered 'with laughter, love and a good pint.' Beth and Brendan are seen above on their wedding day . Beth dancing with her father in an old family photo . Jim Heald, the owner of the Heald & Chiampa funeral home and a longtime friend of Beth, says he was not surprised at all she wrote her own obituary. 'She was a planner, and it was in her best efforts to prepare herself and her family for what was coming,' he told ABC News. 'Being in the first person is very different. I write them for the family and she did it firsthand. It's absolutely magnificent.' He then added; 'In that obituary she was teaching. She so eloquently says, ""Cancer loses grace and love wins."" It was so profound and so true . Brendan also thought his wife's message was magnificent. 'It's pretty amazing to think that someone could write that before passing away. It's pretty amazing,' he said. 'Beth was amazing.' 'Beth was amazing,' said Brendan of his wife . Beth is seen getting her nursing degree above . In an interview with Today, Brendan once again praised his wife. 'She was so powerful,' he said. 'Most people, up until very recently, didn't even know she was sick, even though she'd been through multiple surgeries and [chemotherapy] treatments. She always had a positive outlook. She always cared more for everybody else first.' He also said that in addition to writing her obituary she planned the entire funeral so no one else would have to worry about anything after she was gone. Now family members have set up a GoFundMe page to try and fund her children's education, and help out Brendan, who met his wife when the two were just 14-years-old. Already $30,000 has been raised, with the hopes of making it to $100,000 from Brendan and the children. 'This is a story about a love that will live forever and will never fade or waver,' the page says of Beth. 'Her love is like the wind, we can't see it but we can feel it every single day.' I died Thursday, April 16, 2015 surrounded by family, in the arms of my husband and anam cara, Brendan Patrick O'Rourke. I was 44 years old. I was a survivor. I was blessed in this life with two amazing children; Courtney Elizabeth age 11 and Seamus Brendan aged 8. I was a Burncoat girl, raised by my mother, Eileen (Courtney) Rafferty now of Holden, and my very dear uncle, George 'David' Rafferty who predeceased me. Henry J Rafferty was my father who also predeceased me. I also leave my brother Sean P. Rafferty, sisters: Noreen Erickson and her husband Robert, Ellen R Harrity and Megan Rafferty, all of Worcester. I leave a most loving mother and father in law, James G. and Hannah 'Joan' O'Rourke; a sister, Colleen and her husband, Martin Dyer all of Worcester; a brother-in-law, James O'Rourke and his wife, Michelle (Holden) and lifelong friends Carrie Ann Buccaglia (Worcester), Maureen Grenier (Dudley), Patricia Flagg (Millbury), and many nieces and nephews. I'd like to thank my colleague, physician and dear friend Venu Bathini MD, for his care and support in this battle. You always saw me as a person and not a statistic. In addition I thank my PCP Elizabeth Murphy MD, nurses Beth and Faith and all those who cared for me during this journey. It was not easy for me to be a care receiver, but we forged a path for me that brought me further than most would have imagined. I attended Burncoat High School, Worcester State University obtaining my masters in nursing. As a 'roaming' catholic I attended Mass in various parishes. We are members of St Columba but attended St. Johns, Our Lady of the Angels and the Abbey in Spencer. Nursing was my calling, during my career I had the honor and privilege, to care for patients who were amazing people; they often gave me the strength and courage to get through my journey and the desire to return to the work of caring for others. I hope I was able to give them a fraction of what they gave me. I LOVED my life. I loved a long run, to sit quietly by the lake, to read and dance and sing and be silly with our children. We loved watching summer storms blow across the water. I loved to chat and laugh with my sisters and friends, until tears ran down our legs! Brendan and I enjoyed many trips together, most enjoyable were those to Ireland, visiting family to share a pint and some good 'craic'. And of course sitting quietly on the porch with Brendan (listening to the Red Sox). I enjoyed working for a cause, among them, the Pancreatic Cancer Alliance, whose members' spirit and dedication amazed me. Of all the things I did in this life, nothing compared to being with Brendan and our children. I fought every day to stay alive and to be with them. No person could ever ask for a more loving and supportive husband, always my champion, always. I enjoyed every moment we shared; the great ones, the sad ones, the easy and the hard. I pray they have learned to feel the deep sense of faith that I shared. No matter where this journey brings me next, I will forever carry their love with me, as I am sure there is a piece of me that will forever remain with them. But cancer does not care who it takes, who it hurts, or honor or love. It comes into your life and starts to break the threads that hold you and you are left to see pieces of yourself slip away and dreams fade. We were clung only to each other with pure love and faith binding us, in the end is when the most amazing thing happens, cancer loses its strength and grace appears. We need to see it. We accept it, and go with it. Grace and love win, not cancer. I hope to be remembered, with laughter, love and a good pint. And for my children to know ""No Momma ever did and no Momma ever will….."" Family and friends will gather to honor and remember my life at calling hours on Tuesday, April 21, 2015 from 4:00 to 8:00 pm at Heald & Chiampa Funeral Directors – The Sumner House, 5 Church Road, On the Common, Shrewsbury Center. My Funeral Mass will be celebrated in Saint John's Church, 44 Temple Street, Worcester on Wednesday, April 22nd at 10 a.m. Burial will follow in Mooreland Cemetery, Paxton.

"The headline sounds almost too good to be true, doesn't it? But this one is perhaps as close to a sure bet as you'll find - the secret to winning at Two Up, Australia's iconic game of chance. Punting analyst Mike Steward has outlined an approach, known in gambling parlance as the Martingale Betting Strategy.The staking plan is outlined in the table below, but seems simple enough to follow for even a first-time Two Up player. The essence being, that if you lose, you have to double your bet until your coins fall right. A word to the wise however, there is, as with any supposed sure-bet, or an almost can't lose system, a catch - and that is that you'll need a healthy bank of cash with you. Scroll down for video . Scenes like these will be repeated across Australia on ANZAC Day this Saturday, heaving crowds of punters betting on the toss of coins in games of Two Up . The Martingale Betting Strategy of doubling up originated in France and is used with levels of success by punters on ANZAC Day throughout Australia . The traditional game of Two Up involves two coins but many venues now play with three for ease of betting among the crowd . Two Up is one of Australia's longest lasting traditions, it dates back to Australia's goldfields and the first recorded games are believed to have taken place in the late 1790s. It is now legal to be played on ANZAC Day across Returned Servicemen League clubs (RSL) and pubs. Versions will vary between the original two-coined game (with three outcomes) and three-coined version (with two outcomes), the latter preferred by many venues prefer for ease of betting between punters. 'One of the most easy to understand betting staking strategies that punters use is what I call the approach, otherwise known as the Martingale Betting Strategy,' writes Mr Steward, author of 'Betting Strategy doubles up to win' for the website Punters Club Hero. It's a system of betting which originated in France. 'A punter simply bets a stake to win an amount of money, if they fail to win with the first bet they increase their stake to recover their losses plus win the initial targeted win amount on the second bet and so on,' he added. BET #                              AMOUNT . 1                                      $1 . 2                                      $2 . 3                                      $4 . 4                                      $8 . 5                                      $16 . 6                                      $32 . 7                                      $64 . 8                                      $128 . 9                                      $256 . 10                                    $512 . * From Mike Steward's ""Betting Strategy doubles up to win"" 'To simplify this betting strategy, let's take a simple coin toss where the outcome is even money each time. 'I bet $1 on Heads for the first toss to win $1. 'If the bet loses, I will bet $2 on the second toss. If I win on the second toss I have recovered my earlier loss of $1 plus my target winning amount of $1, otherwise if I lose I will have to bet $4 on the third toss to recover the $3 lost and still win my targeted win amount. 'If I continued to experience successive losses I double the stake of the previous wager until a win occurs.' 'The Martingale staking approach is alluring to punters because of its seemingly guaranteed approach to make a buck,' he stated. 'I mean how many losers can you back in a row after all? The game was still illegal in some Australian states and territories up until 10 years ago. Wagering expert Damian Deguara, who writes for website The Great Tip Off, told Daily Mail Australia that: 'It's that one time of the year when the law permits men and women across this great country of ours to follow in the footsteps of our brave Aussie diggers and keep to the old gambling tradition.' 'Two Up is a pretty simple game, all you need are coins, a wooden stick (the kip) to flip them into the air and a crowd of screaming punters yelling ""Heads"" or ""Tails"". 'Most punters have their corner, you are either a Heads punter, a Tails punter or someone who goes with either depending on your intuition. 'The Double-up approach is alluring to punters because it seems to provide a guaranteed approach to making a buck. If you win you're happy and if you lose you increase your stake until you win. 'Sounds easy enough right? But what are the real odds of winning and losing if you chose to use the Double-up approach on ANZAC Day? 'Think back to ANZAC Day last year and recall how many successive loses that a Head or a Tail endured over the entire day. Was it four, five? 'What are the chances of experiencing six losses in a row? It's actually about two per cent but that means it is actually possible. 'On the bright side there is a 98 per cent chance that you would have made your money before this point.' 'Come in Spinner' is the cry from the Ringkeeper at Two Up games . The coins fly into the air during a game of Two Up, the uniquely Australian tradition, in which punters bet on which way coins land. It is celebrated on ANZAC Day on April 25 and is associated with soldiers because it was popular with troops during World War I . Australian Army soldiers pictured playing Two Up. ""There is no form guide or books written on pushing the odds in your favour, as two-up is one of the fairest bets in the world. For every two-up coin toss there are two possible outcomes, Heads or Tails, and punters receive even money if the coins turn-up the right way, which is as true as the odds can get,' said wagering guru Damian Deguara . Versions of Two Up will vary between the original two-coined game (with three outcomes) and three-coined version (with two outcomes), which many venues prefer for ease of betting between punters. Spinner at the ready with the wooden Kip which is used to toss the coins. 'The thing to remember is that each time you lose, the probability of winning the next bet in the example given is still even money' warn some professional punters . 'The attractiveness of this approach is certainly strong, however the downside, although rare in the example given, is very significant,' Mr Steward added. 'If successive losses continue, the amount that needs to be wagered increases significantly. 'The other thing to remember is that each time you lose, the probability of winning the next bet in the example given is still even money. 'The odds don't change because you have already incurred such significant losses. 'I spoke with an ex on-line betting executive recently and asked if the Martingale betting approach was common amongst punters and he indicated that it was noted frequently. 'He mentioned a time when a punter endured 16 consecutive losses in-a-row with the last $69,000 bet failing before it appeared as though his bankroll had run out. ""That's the problem with this approach that most punters do not realise"" he said. ""It only guarantess success if you have an infinite amount of cash"". Mr Deguara offered a similar warning: 'Before you run off to the ATM to load yourself up in readiness for a Double-up day of two-up, remember that the perception of guaranteed success that punters have about the Double-up approach is not entirely accurate.' 'The only way that it can guarantee a win is if you have an infinite amount of cash and an infinite number of coin tosses, neither of which are available to punters tomorrow.' Two Up is one of Australia's longest lasting traditions and is legal to be played on ANZAC Day across Returned Servicemen League clubs (RSL) and pubs and has been permitted for Australian and New Zealand troops deployed overseas during this time of year .","Punting aces say they have found a way to beat the odds in Australia's iconic game of chance .

"The family of a 24-year-old woman who died of a heroin overdose has penned a candid obituary openly discussing her struggle with drugs in a bid to prevent others from losing their lives. On April 16, Molly Parks was found in the bathroom of the pizza restaurant where she worked in Manchester, New Hampshire with a needle still in her arm. When police turned up on her father's door in Saco, Maine, he immediately knew they were there about Molly. Days later, he wrote an obituary announcing her death. 'She made a lot of bad decisions including experimenting with drugs,' it reads. 'She fought her addiction to heroin for at least five years and had experienced a near fatal overdose before. Loss: Molly Parks, 24, passed away on April 16 after she overdosed on heroin in the bathroom of the restaurant where she worked. Her family has written an honest obituary about her struggle with drugs . 'Molly's family truly loved her and tried to be as supportive as possible as she struggled with the heroin epidemic that has been so destructive to individuals and families in her age bracket.' The obituary closes with a plea to other families to help their loved ones if they see they are going through the same struggles. 'If you have any loved one's who are fighting addiction [sic], Molly's family asks that you do everything possible to be supportive, and guide them to rehabilitation before it is too late,' it reads. Her father, Tom Parks, said she had abused alcohol and prescription pills before moving on to heroin. They tried numerous ways to get her to stop, from being nice to being mean, but she continued using the drugs, he told NPR. Then last August, while staying with her aunt in Manchester, she overdosed and was found passed out in the bathroom, he told WMUR. She was rushed to hospital and went to rehab on three separate occasions. Heartbroken: Her father, Tom Parks, said he knew that when police turned up on his doorstep, they were there about Molly. He pleaded with other families to 'stay right on top' of loved ones with addictions . Loved: Tom Parks shared this image showing him with Molly when she was little . Candid: The obituary pleads with families to be supportive and get help for their loved ones with addictions . Despite her struggles, she remained a vivacious personality who loved theater, fashion and reading Harry Potter, according to her obituary. She 'will always be remembered for fearless personality and her trademark red lipstick,' it reads. The weekend before her death, she had visited her father and stepmother in Maine. She was working as a delivery driver for the pizza restaurant and seemed to be doing well, Tom Parks said. But days later, she was found inside the restaurant's bathroom with the needle in her arm. 'Don't believe your addict is clean,' her father told WMUR. 'Don't do it. You have to be diligent. Stay right on top of them.' On Facebook, her sister Kasey also shared her honest thoughts about her sister's passing. Battle: Molly had visited her dad and stepmom just days before she passed away and seemed to be doing well, they said. They remembered her as someone who loved fashion, theater and red lipstick . 'Young people need to realize that they aren't invincible,' she wrote on her Facebook page. 'Please ask yourself this: is this really worth putting my family and friends through this tragedy if I were to pass away, just so that way I can get that one last high. Every drug abuser/user would probably say yes the gamble is worth it. The families would say it's not.' She went on: 'All my family and I want to do is save a restless soul by spreading awareness of this raging epidemic that needs to be a controlled somehow in someway. 'RIP my memories of you will never die, neither will my love for you.'","On April 16, Molly Parks was found in the bathroom of the New Hampshire pizza restaurant where she worked with a needle still in her arm .

"The Apple Watch is officially going on sale today - but none of its stores will have them in stock . Apple launches its first smartwatch today - but anyone turning up to buy one in the high street will be disappointed. For although the Apple Watch is officially going on sale, none of its stores will have them in stock. Instead, consumers willing to shell out between £299 to £13,500 - for the gold edition - have to pre-order the watches online and wait for their arrival until June. Usually, Apple launches generate long queues outside stores. But City analysts believe the company feared the queues might be embarrassingly small and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang. In fact, despite the high price and some skepticism that consumers are keen to adopt a new generation of wearable technology, pre-orders have far exceeded expectations. As a result, the company's initial production run is simply not large enough to ensure that watches will be available in stores from today. Analysts believe Apple is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year. The watch includes a host of personal trackers, including a heart rate monitor, and is being billed as a personal doctor that will help users to lose weight and improve their health. However, Apple also wants it to be seen as style statement and fashion accessory, with customers able to choose from any of 38 variants depending on the case and watch strap. As a result, limited supplies have been given to six designer outlets around the world, which will apparently be sold to a few select customers by appointment today. These include the exclusive Dover Street Market in London's Mayfair, which is understood to have 570 of the watches, although not the gold edition. The launch of the watch into stores is being handled by Apple retail chief, Angela Ahrendts, who is very familiar with the world of designer labels. She was head of the luxury British fashion label Burberry, where she was one of the UK's highest paid women executives, before joining the US company last May. Her recruitment was sweetened with a golden hello of shares worth around £40million. She told Apple staff via video message earlier this week that the decision to make the watch only available through online orders is because demand has exceeded supply. In it she said: 'We know that you have been bombarded with questions from customers. 'Luckily, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We know they are excited about the Watch ...but there are a lot of questions about availability and timing etc. 'Last week we announced that due to the high global interest and the initial supply that we would only be taking orders online right now. 'This was not an easy decision, and I think it's really important to remind every single customer that this is not just a new product for us, this is an entirely new category.' The official Apple UK website states anyone ordering the new watch can expect a delivery date in June, however some might get them before. Apple chief executive Tim Cook pictured giving a presentation on the Apple Watch in San Francisco last month . A spokesman said: 'Our team is working to fill orders as quickly as possible based on the available supply and the order in which they were received. We know many customers are still facing long lead times and we appreciate their patience.' Stuart Miles, technology expert and founder of website Pocket-lint.com, said: 'I think the watch will follow the same lines of success as the iPad did five years ago. It's an intriguing device that has enough wow factor to pull people in.' But he added that the change in buying process this time - and the online backlog that has already begun - could put some people off. 'The biggest problem Apple looks to be facing, is not if people will buy one, it's whether they are going to be happy to wait until they can get one,' he said. Will Findlater, editor-in-chief of gadget magazine Stuff, said: 'In many ways the Apple Watch is the ultimate gadget. Beautifully made and finished, hugely desirable and capable of a host of clever things, none of which you need, but many of which are nice to have. 'The functionality that could end up most compelling is messaging - the ability to send scrawled drawings, emoticons and even your heart beat direct to another Apple Watch owner feels personal in a way no other message platform does.' He added: 'The one-day battery life and price are the two factors that will put many buyers off. £300 or more is a lot to pay for a first-generation device, especially as Apple will learn a lot about making it better once it's in the market. 'That means the second or third-generation Apple Watch is probably the wiser buy. However, waiting would mean missing out on the fun of living with an entirely new, cutting-edge gadget right now, and for early adopters, that will be too much to bear.' Industry commentators believe the Apple Watch will follow the same lines of success as the iPad (pictured) did five years ago .","Apple launches its first smartwatch today - but its stores will not  stock it .

"The SNP will help make Ed Miliband Prime Minister even if Labour finish 40 seats behind the Tories at the general election, Nicola Sturgeon said last night. The Scottish First Minister said she would form an anti-Tory alliance with Labour and other smaller parties regardless of how many MPs David Cameron wins on May 7. While Mr Miliband has ruled out going into coalition with the SNP, Ms Sturgeon's remarks raise the prospect of Labour ruling as a minority government - despite winning fewer votes and seats than the Tories. Protesters wearing masks of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon hold placards outside Chatham House, a foreign affairs think-tank, where Labour leader Ed Miliband delivered a speech in London this morning . The SNP could win as many as 50 MPs in Scotland - allowing Mr Miliband to become Prime Minister even if he falls far short of a majority. Her comments came as Labour slipped four points behind the Tories in the latest polls - with David Cameron's Tories moving to 36 per cent. However, the SNP could win as many as 50 MPs in Scotland - allowing Mr Miliband to become Prime Minister even if he falls far short of a majority. Ms Sturgeon was asked on BBC2's Newsnight whether her party would be ready to prop up a Labour government if the party had fewer seats than the Conservatives. She replied: ' Yes. Even if the Tories are the largest party, if there is an anti Tory majority, my offer to Labour is to work together to keep the Tories out.' Asked if this would remain her position even if Mr Cameron had 30 more MPs than Mr Miliband, she confirmed: ' If there is an anti Tory majority, yes, that's what I've been saying all along - I'm not sure why there's any confusion about it - that we would work with Labour to stop the Tories getting into Downing Street.' And if the margin was as wide as 40 MPs, she said: ' If they can't command a majority they can't be a government, that's the basic rule of how governments are formed I'd have thought.' The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon - campaigning in Glasgow today - said she would help make Ed Miliband Prime Minister even if Labour finish 40 seats behind the Tories . Ms Sturgeon was pictured with three-year-old Kitty MacDonald and SNP Candidate for Glasgow South Stewart McDonald during a visit to Glazed, a ceramic painting studio in the city . Ms Sturgeon also rejected an independent study which said there was a 'significant disconnect' between the SNP's claims to be an anti-austerity party and plans that implied it would be spending less than Labour by 2019/20. The Institute for Fiscal Studies accused  the major parties of keeping voters 'in the dark' by spelling out only the 'broad outlines' of their tax and spend plans following the May 7 poll, though it  singled out the Liberal Democrats for being more transparent than their rivals about their intentions. Ed Miliband, pictured in Chatham House, central London today, could become Prime Minister even if he wins fewer votes and MPs than David Cameron . The thinktank's deputy director Carl Emmerson said: 'There are genuinely big differences between the main parties' fiscal plans. 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice.' Conservatives say they would eliminate the deficit by 2017/18 and start to run a surplus while Labour says it will reduce the deficit each year and balance the books 'as soon as possible' during the five-year term. The IFS said the Tory plans were 'predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases', and could involve 'further real cuts to unprotected departments of around £30 billion'. Labour's plans were consistent with a pledge not to borrow for day-to-day spending but 'would leave borrowing at £26 billion a year in today's terms', it said. The IFS said the Liberal Democrats had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017-18, revealing that they are aiming for tightening more than Labour but less than the Conservatives. While the SNP would 'cut less to start with', the implication of the plans spelt out in their manifesto would be that the 'period of austerity would be longer than under the other three parties we consider', it said. Responding to the comments, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said Ms Sturgeon was going to 'ignore the will of the people', if she chose to support the smaller of the two main parties at Westminster. He added: 'She's going to ignore how people vote and she's just going to insist on her personal preference.' She told the BBC's Newsnight that 'if [the Conservatives] can't command a majority, they can't be a government'. Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly said she would work with Labour to 'get rid of the Tories' if the SNP had enough MPs. The Prime Minister, speaking in Lincoln with the Foreign Secretary William Hague, has called that prospect on an SNP-Labour alliance 'frightening' and claimed it would lead to 'economic ruin' Conservative leader David Cameron has called that prospect 'frightening' and said it would lead to 'economic ruin'. While the SNP had only six MPs at Westminster in the last Parliament, recent polls suggest they could win the majority of Scotland's 59 seats. That could leave the party holding the balance of power if the election resulted in a hung parliament.","SNP leader vowed to prop up Labour even if the Tories finish clear winners .

"Lounging on a deckchair by the pool, soaking up the sun in a skimpy bikini, Rhiannon Langley is just like any other tourist on holiday in Thailand... except she's sporting two bruised eyes, swollen cheeks and a bandaged nose. The 24-year-old from Melbourne is recovering from Rhinoplasty, but rather than recuperating at home, she is at a five-star hotel, part of the $5,190 'Bangkok Nose Job' medical tourism package she is on. Rhiannon, a popular social media personality with almost 200,000 Instagram followers, told Daily Mail Australia that she has been enjoying her post-op holiday time, 'chilling out' by the pool, getting mani pedis, and going shopping. Scroll down for video . Living it up post-op: Rhiannon Langley, the blogger sharing her 'nose job journey' with her social media followers, is recovering from Rhinoplasty at a Bangkok hotel . Seeing results: The 24-year-old from Melbourne tells Daily Mail she 'already loves' her new nose . The hairdresser turned model raised eyebrows this week for her decision to go public with her 'nose job journey' in spectacular fashion, by sharing pictures and videos since her arrival in Thailand for the procedure on social media, which fans can follow along by using the hashtag #RhiannonGetsRhino. Miss Langley has been updating her Instagram feed daily, and sharing her progress in a series of Snapchat videos. 'I'm feeling so much better now, just excited to see the outcome!' Langley said. 'I already love it.' While many post-op patients retreat to their beds for weeks afterwards, Rhiannon has taken her recovering poolside. Poolside convalescing: Rhiannon says she has been 'chilling out by the pool', getting manicure and pedicures, shopping and eating out . 'I've been chilling out by the pool,' she said. '[I] got a manicure and pedicure yesterday, today we are shopping, and just eating out.' In videos uploaded to Snapchat, Rhiannon noted that she could already see a difference in the shape of her nose. Sporting a bloodshot eye and bruising, she said doctors had removed some of the stitches. 'I can finally see that my nose is in line for once and I don't have this droop,' she said. Langley spoke to Daily Mail Australia earlier this week just one day after her surgery, and revealed that the changes would be 'quite drastic'. Follow the journey: The hairdresser has over 190,000 Instagram followers and decided to share the experience with fans and 'own' her decision to have cosmetic surgery . Rhiannon said that she chose to go public as she was sick of seeing other well-known women hiding their nips and tucks from followers. 'I have quite a big following on social media and I don't want to lie about it,' she said. 'I think people are more accepting of the decision if you own it. 'I've seen so many other girls on social media get things done and then try and hide it. 'I have been a bit scared about getting negative feedback,' Rhiannon added,referring to the announcement she made the week before departing. Day one and two: Rhiannon has been posting progress selfies on social media . 'I've always wanted this since I was a lot younger, and I decided why not, if it makes me happy and improves my self esteem then I'm doing it!' she wrote at the time. 'Yes plastic surgery is a controversial thing to do but this is my life and it's something I've wanted to do for so long and especially before my wedding.' 'They've all been really positive and supportive though. Obviously you get a few weird comments, but it's been a lot better than I expected.' Before: The 24-year-old as she appeared pre-surgery in one of her Instagram posts . Miss Langley wanted to share her experience with her followers, having found no one in her friendship circle to turn to for guidance on what the surgery and recovery would be like. 'None of my friends have had nose jobs, so I was searching on the Internet and couldn't find anything useful,' she said. 'So I decided to post about my experience, post photos, share how I feel, how I look, and what I've gone through.' A little off here, and here: Rhiannon revealed to Daily Mail Australia that her makeover will not be a subtle one, with changes being made to the shape and length of her nose . Holiday with a side of hospital: Rhiannon's $5,190 'Bangkok Nose Job' package included a stay in a Phuket beach hotel . Bedside view: Langley has been updating her followers with hospital snaps and post-op video messages . Rhiannon says her motivation to take her surgery overseas was financially motivated. 'The price difference [between Australia and Thailand] is huge,' she told DMA. 'I'm getting married in a year, so I couldn't afford to have the surgery in Australia.' Her trip to Thailand is a $5,190 'Bangkok Nose Job' package with CosMediTour. The Medical Tourism Agency has confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that while they have assisted the social media influencer with finding accommodation, Langley paid the full rate for her surgery package. The packages include four to five star accommodation and meals, as well as the full cost of hospitalisation and surgery. 'I'm owning my decision': Rhiannon says  that she decided to be honest rather than hiding it from her followers . Nuptials: Langley says her Thailand medical tourism package holiday was financially motivated, as she cannot afford surgery in Australia with her upcoming wedding to fiancé Jody (pictured) to pay for . Dream: The hair dresser has wanted the nose correction since she was a teenager . 'Rhiannon had been considering Rhinoplasty for a long time and she approached CosMediTour after being referred from a friend who previously had surgery through CosMediTour. We are very happy to have her as a client,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Rhiannon has a loyal Instagram following and she wanted to Blog about her Rhinoplasty experience as it was something that she didn't want to hide. 'We use fully accredited hospitals with internationally trained and highly skilled Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons and have CosMediTour personnel in all destinations. We create four and five star packages which include surgery, accommodation, transfers, meals and don't charge any additional agency fee for our services.'","Rhiannon Langley, from Melbourne, underwent Rhinoplasty in Bangkok .

And the president believes that to deny the existence of climate change is to deny an observable fact that is substantiated by science,' press secretary Josh Earnest said today after he was asked about a Duke study that claimed the earth isn't heating up as quickly as expected. He then added, without any nudging, 'And there are some who are involved in politics that choose to deny that fact because it's inconvenient to their case and it might be inconvenient to some of their strongest political supporters.' Earnest's channeling of former Vice President Al Gore, star of the 2006 global warming documentary an Inconvenient Truth, followed the president's gas-guzzling, 1,836 mile trip on Wednesday, Earth Day, to the Florida Everglades aboard Air Force One. The White House doubled down today on President Barack Obama's Earth Day message that climate change is 'a problem now' and knocked political figures who disagree with him as climate deniers and opportunists. The president is seen here on Wednesday, Earth Day, boarding Air Force One before departing from Florida. There  he mocked opponents of climate change and said global warming is a 'problem now' There he preached about the harmful effects of global warming on the environment and the economy and mocked skeptics of man-made climate change. 'Climate change can no longer be denied,' he said. 'And action can no longer be delayed.' 'This is a not a problem for another generation. Not anymore. This is a problem now. It has serious implications for the way we live right now.' The president's spokesman did not name-check opponents of Obama's argument on climate change today but it was evident that he was referring to conservatives such as Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe. The author of the anti-global warming book, The Greatest Hoax, Inhofe, has been a vocal critic of the administration's environmental policies. In late February he brought a snowball to the upper chamber's floor and presented it as evidence that global warming is a farce. 'It's very, very cold out. Very unseasonable,' Inhofe, chairman of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, said and threw the snowball at the Senate president. Obama scoffed at the Republican lawmaker's antics in his Wednesday speech saying, 'yes, this winter was cold in some parts of this country, including Washington.' 'Some people in Washington helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact,' he noted. Taking a shot at Florida Governor Rick Scott, who allegedly banned the phrase climate change from his employees' vernacular, Obama said that 'simply refusing to say the words ""climate changed"" doesn’t mean that climate change isn’t happening.' 'If you’ve got a coming storm, you don’t stick your head in the sand,' he said. 'You prepare for the storm.' He said at another point in his remarks that climate change cannot be 'edited out' or 'omitted from the conversation.' 'There are some who are involved in politics that choose to deny' that global warming is happening 'because it's inconvenient to their case and it might be inconvenient to some of their strongest political supporters,' Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said today . Responding to the question today about the Duke study, Earnest said  'the president is demonstrating genuine leadership by challenging the country and the world to confront [global warming].' Furthermore, he said, the president is going about it in a way that will 'not just safeguard the American people,' but one that can also have 'significant benefits for our economy.' Wind and solar power, he said, do stand to yield long term benefits for the United States' economy if it makes an early investment in alternative energy sources. The president 'is determined to position' the U.S 'so that we can capitalize on those trends,' he said.","President 'believes that to deny the existence of climate change is to deny an observable fact that is substantiated by science,' press secretary said .

"Climbing trees and spending hours playing outside used to be part of every childhood. But today’s youngsters are more likely to be stuck indoors – and it may be harming their eyesight. And it is not just because of the time spent sitting in front of a screen. For a lack of natural daylight is thought to be driving up rates of short-sightedness among the young. Spending an extra 40 minutes a day in the sunshine has been shown to improve children’s sight dramatically. Scientists had though reading or looking at a screen could cause shortsightedness, but now think it could be down to a lack of natural light while taking part in these activities (file image) In China, where four teenagers in five are short-sighted, transparent classrooms are being tested in a bid to increase pupils’ exposure to natural light. Chinese scientists have reported a 23 per cent reduction in myopia – short-sightedness – in children who spend an extra 40 minutes a day in the sunshine. Studies in Australia and by Ohio State University in the US produced similar results. Leading eye surgeon David Allamby warned that an increase in eyesight problems is likely in Britain if children do not regain a love of the great outdoors. Two in five adults in this country are short-sighted, but Mr Allamby said those rates are likely to increase. ‘For 100 years we have researched into the effects of reading and prolonged study on making short-sightedness worse,’ he said. ‘It has become a common belief that spending too much time inside a book, or today on a screen, will make anyone’s eyesight worse. ‘Recent research might have turned this on its head. That’s why today some Chinese schoolchildren are going to school inside a big glass box. There are several studies showing that lack of daylight might be the principal reason why children become more short-sighted, rather than prolonged reading. Study shows that 40 minutes of extra natural light per day, by playing outside or climbing trees, could help to reduce cases by 26 per cent (file image) 'What wasn’t factored into our decades of research was that reading and studying are done indoors, away from daylight. ‘The link between studying and myopia might really be a red herring, where the close vision activity is just a proxy for lack of daylight.’ Donald Mutti, who led the Ohio study, told the journal Nature: ‘We thought it was an odd finding but it just kept coming up as we did the analyses.’ Mr Allamby, who runs Focus Clinics in London, said: ‘The incidence of short sight in the West is rising, now affecting around 40 per cent of the population. ‘If we look at hunter-gatherer societies that live mainly outdoors, such as those studied in Gabon, we find that only 0.5 per cent of adults are afflicted by short sight. ‘Chinese children are participating in research to determine if more exposure to daylight will protect them from their myopic genes. ‘If [it] is shown to help it might mean we all got outdoors more often. It could be time to invest in conservatory companies.’","Researchers had thought reading or looking at screens caused condition .

"The 16-year-son of Michael Schumacher, the seven-time Formula One champion, is set to make his debut in the same sport this weekend. Mick Schumacher will compete in the Formula 4 category, in what is regarded as a stepping stone for junior drivers hoping to reach the top. By doing so, he will follow in the footsteps of his father - who is still recovering from a ski accident at his home in Switzerland - who won a record 91 races in Formula 1. Mick Schumacher - who bears a striking resemblance to his father, Michael - makes his debut in the ADAC Formula 4 series in Germany this weekend . Schumacher Junior will drive under his own name for the first time in his career when he races this weekend . Schumacher Jnr is part of the Van Amersfoort Racing team competing in the 2015 ADAC Formula 4 series. He will start on the grid in 19th position out of 38 tomorrow and will take part in two more races on Sunday. For the first time in his career, he will drive under his own name. Previously, when taking part in go-karting, he had used the maiden name of his mother, Corinna, to avoid media attention. Three-time Formula One champion Niki Lauda said: 'Of course, the public will be watching him, thanks to his father, and that is a huge burden for him.' Van Amersfoot Racing team managing director told Bild: 'We are all pleased with how things are going. Mick makes few errors. 'The talent is there, the preparation is there, the intelligence is there. 'We are proud to have a big name race for us, but the name alone won't bring us any points. We'll all have to work hard for those.' Schumacher Junior is pictured in the team garage ahead of the first race of the season on Saturday . Michael Schumacher pictured during Formula One testing at the Jerez circuit in Spain in December 2007 . Gerhard Berger, an Austrian former Formula One driver and rival of Schumacher SNR, feared the boy's name could become a burden. 'It's quite tough for Mick to be treading in his father's footsteps,' he said. But he expected Schumacher Jnr to have a successful career in the sport. 'I know him a bit and he's a good lad, with both feet on the ground and the racing bug within him. He grew up in this environment and it is his life. He's not in any danger of being imbalanced by it.' He also thought it could give him something to focus on other than his father's grave condition, which has had a devastating affect on his life. The pair were skiing on the Meribel slopes in France in December 2013 when Schumacher Snr fell and cracked his head on a boulder. Schumacher celebrates on the podium after winning the Australian Grand Prix in March 2004 - he is still recovering from a skiing accident in December 2013 . He emerged from his induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September. Despite the intensive therapy he has been receiving at his home in Lake Geneva, Switzerland, his condition is believed to be extremely serious. Tents have been erected around his house so the media cannot photograph him in his wheelchair. Schumacher Jnr finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season and signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4 in March. He will link up with team-mate Harrison Newey, the British 16-year-old son of Red Bull designer Adrian.","Mick Schumacher makes his  Formula 4 debut this weekend in Germany .

"A crying 19-month-old girl was removed from a plane and met by police after she was accused of causing a security breach. As the aircraft taxied on the runway at Ben Gurion Airport in Israel, bound for Luton, Sarina Aziz became agitated after cabin crew asked that she sit on her parents’ lap. Ariella and Mark Aziz, who live in north London, struggled to keep their daughter still after strapping her in the connector belt required for children under the age of two. One-year-old Sarina Aziz became agitated on a flight from Israel to Luton that led to her being ejected from the plane . Mark Aziz, pictured right, spoke with airline staff outside the aircraft before his family was removed . However they say they were shocked to find that staff had decided to alert the captain, who took the decision to halt the flight and call security to remove the family from the plane. Mr Aziz, who said the family are seeking legal advice over the incident on a Transavia Airlines flight in Tel Aviv, said: ‘I want to emphasise that we wanted to, and were, complying with the crew’s instructions. ‘I was simply trying to restrain our daughter who had become unhappy after being moved from a child seat on to our laps. We had actually purchased a seat for her to sit in, and she was very happy in that and belted in correctly. ‘But the stewardess came up to us and said that their policy was for the child to be seated on a parent’s lap. We said we were happy to go along with this and were in no way argumentative.’ Mr Aziz described how after being moved from her seat, his daughter became frustrated and unhappy, and it became difficult to keep her subdued. ‘All we were doing was asking the cabin crew what we can do, and asking for help,’ he added. After his daughter’s behaviour continued to attract the attention of the crew, Mr Aziz claims another steward, who had not seen the original incident unfold, marched over to him ‘very aggressively’. Transavia Airlines have said that the action was justified as the child was not 'following safety instructions' The incident occurred at Ben Gurion Airport in Israel (pictured) on a flight bound for London Luton . Mr Aziz said: ‘He was standing over me shouting and it felt like he was trying to provoke me. I felt very threatened; he was saying “you’ve got to sort it,” and that he would not help as it was not his problem.’ Speaking to  Jewish News Online, Mrs Aziz said: ‘It was like a terrorist incident, I couldn’t believe it. The next thing you know we’re all in squad cars heading back to Ben Gurion.’ Fellow passenger Ben Wasserstrum described how the pilot said that there had been ‘a security breach,’ before returning those on board to the terminal. A spokesman for Transavia told MailOnline: ‘It is very important that flight safety instructions are followed by all our passengers. It was unfortunate that the child was ill, but even then the flight safety rules must be followed.’ However, Mr Aziz said his daughter was not ‘ill’, although he admits that she was sick after she was moved. He said: ‘I was covered in sick but we received no sympathy from the staff whatsoever.’ He added: ‘The airline is trying to legitimise their actions and shirk responsibility. I believe that if this instance was legitimate then they’d be kicking families off planes every day because I’ve been on so many flights where babies don’t settle. But you can’t ban families from going away with babies on planes – that would be crazy.’ A Chinese family was kicked off a Cathay Pacific flight last month after their three-year-old son refused to wear a seatbelt, causing a delay for other passengers. The Hong Kong-bound plane sat at its gate at a Bangkok airport for an extra 30 minutes while the family, flight attendants and other travellers were involved in a heated stand-off. Most airlines allow children under two to sit on a parent’s lap during take-off and landing. Any child over that age must sit in their own seat and wear a safety belt. The boy's father (middle) rowed with other passengers, after the family were instructed to leave the plane after his son refused to wear a seatbelt . The boy refused to take his seat and wear a seatbelt moments before flight CX654 was scheduled to take off from Suvarnabhumi Bangkok International Airport, a passenger, named Lau, told Hong Kong’s Apple Daily newspaper. All other passengers were seated and prepared for their two-hour journey. Flight attendants asked the family to put the boy in his seat and buckle his safety belt, but the parents refused to obey their directions and insisted that the boy be allowed to sit on his mother’s lap, the South China Morning Post reported. Elizabeth Sedway, 51, says Alaska Airlines had her ejected from a flight because she has cancer and lacked a doctor's note clearing her to fly . A married mother of two battling cancer was ejected from an Alaska Airlines flight from Hawaii to California along with her family because she lacked a doctor's note clearing her to fly. Elizabeth Sedway, 51, from Granite Hill, California, posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane. Mrs Sedway, who suffers from multiple myeloma - a rare form of plasma cancer - detailed her ordeal in a status update accompanying the short video, which has been shared nearly 10,000 times as of Tuesday evening. In the message, the mother of two explained that she was sitting in the handicapped section of a boarding area at Lihue Airport on Kauai when an Alaska Airlines representative noticed she had put on a surgical mask to shield herself from germs and came up to her asking if she needed anything. Mrs Sedway initially said she was fine, but when the airline employee approached her a second time, she indicated that she might require a little extra time to board the plane because she sometimes felt 'weak.' Daniel Levitan was barred from an American Airlines flight after his family advised a tannoy announcement saying he had a nut allergy . The Sedway family eventually boarded the plane and were awaiting takeoff in their seats when an airline representative came on board and announced that the cancer-stricken passenger could not fly without a note from her doctor. A  schoolboy with a peanut allergy was barred from boarding a U.S. plane after his parents asked for a tannoy announcement advising fellow fliers not to eat nuts. The parents of Daniel Levitan are appalled at their alleged treatment by American Airlines, adding a staff member had told them previously: 'Americans have the right to eat nuts'. Daniel, 11, was at the gate at Florida's Fort Myers airport when his parents demanded the announcement - but an American Airlines staff member refused, they said. In the ensuing row, Daniel's parents explained his throat could have closed in a 'worst case scenario', which prompted them to be barred altogether. The AA staff member then allegedly demanded to see a 'fit to fly' certificate before sending the family away and cancelling their tickets.","Sarina Aziz was flying back from Israel with parents Mark and Ariella Aziz .

The antibacterial compounds in this herb are berbamine and berberine, which are antiseptic when used topically. When used internally, these compounds are liver tonics that improve bile flow, stimulate digestion and act as a tonic on the bowel wall. Neal's Yard Remedies created a tincture packed with the stuff, as well as a purifying blend of the skin-loving botanicals calendula, schisandra and gotu kola. Gotu kola helps stimulate collagen and tissue formation. It improves circulation, which benefits skin tone, and  has anti-inflammatory and skin-regenerating actions. When used internally, mahonia can improve bile flow, stimulate digestion and act as a tonic on the bowel wall . Antimicrobial herb calendula is rich in anti-ageing antioxidant beta-carotene, which is important for healthy skin structure and renewal. Also known as magnolia vine, schisandra has been used historically for immune support and for skin care. Modern Chinese research suggests it has a protective effect on the liver, so enhancing the cleansing benefits. The succulent globe artichoke, meanwhile, has been used in Chinese medicine for millennia as a digestive cleanser. It helps to purify and calm the system from within. It is recommended to add 2ml to a cupful of water three times a day to reap the rewards.","The women of Japan swear by the 'beauty from within' philosophy .

"The glamour of a jet setting lifestyle has made working for Virgin airlines the most desired job in Australia. But a survey of workers has also revealed working for government departments - long considered an easy ride - are among the jobs people would most like to have. The Department of Immigration ranked third in the survey, while the Department of Defence and the Department of Health were also named in the top ten places Australians would like to work. Virgin, the second-largest airline in the country, was reportedly handed the accolade for its ‘pleasant working atmosphere, a good work-life balance and strong management’. Richard Branson's Virgin Airline is the place most Australians want to work for, according to a new survey . Desk jobs in government departments highly ranked in Australia’s Most Attractive Employer awards . More than 50 per cent of participants in a study of 12,000 appeared to want to work for boss Richard Branson. Coming second in the survey of Australia’s Most Attractive Employer is national public broadcaster the ABC – confirming a TV career is still high on the list of many people’s dream jobs. And named in third place Thursday was the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, headed up by Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Other Australians named the ABC as the place they would most like to work, alongside journalist Leigh Sales . Fourth and fifth place at the Randstad Awards were also airline and TV jobs, with the Seven Network and Qantas named respectively. People were asked which companies they had heard of, just how much they would like to work there and why they would like to work there.

"A woman has warned of the dangers of getting a cut-price boob job abroad after a bungling surgeon left her with a deformed breast that 'looked like a croissant'. Alison, 43, from Gloucestershire, has since had to go under the knife a further 12 times but is still living with the damage that ensued following a breast augmentation operation six years ago. 'It's horrible to look at and horrible to live with,' says Alison, who admits she would do 'anything' to look normal again. Badly damaged: Alison was left with a breast that resembled a croissant following an infection . Desperate to improve the look of her breasts, the retail worker has now had a 13th operation on her breasts, this time as part of TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters. Speaking on the show, surgeon Vik Vijh, a cosmetic doctor who specialises in correcting botch jobs, said he was shocked by the appalling damage. 'When I first saw Alison I thought she looked mutilated,' he said. 'She had an imploded breast, it looked like a croissant.' More surgery, he said, was the only way to fix it but warned more than one operation could be needed. Alison's problems began as a teenager when, embarrassed by her small breasts, she began using a booster bra. Horrible: Alison, who wants to 'feel normal again', has consulted plastic surgeon Vik Vijh . Hopes: Alison had hoped to boost her bust but ended up loathing her body (picture posed by model) 'I was always conscious of the way I looked, I bought a booster bra so I could look bigger,' she remembers. But when she decided to fix the problem by going under the knife in a bid to increase her cup size to a DD, it proved to be the worst decision of her life. Initially pleased with the results, she noticed shortly after the operation that one implant was going hard. 'It started to go hard so I went back and got another implant inserted but that got an infection,' she said. Bacteria attacked her breast tissue causing it to die so she was left with one shrivelled, deformed breast and one enlarged by surgery. Relief: Following 13 different operations to fix the damage, Alison now has the normal breasts she hoped for . Now she says she would do anything to feel like a normal woman again. 'I hate the way I look and want to be fixed in some way,' she adds. Mr Vijh, who had initially thought she would need several operations, used fat cells from her stomach combined with an implant to fix the damage. Although a course of antibiotics was needed to keep a repeat of the infection at bay, Alison says she is delighted with her new-look breasts. 'I feel fantastic and feminine,' she says. 'I can wear anything now. My partner gets flashed on a daily basis and I have a smile back on my face.'","Alison, 43, from Gloucestershire, had breast augmentation six years ago .

"An Ohio woman has spoken out in a Reddit Q&A about why she and her Catholic husband made the painful decision to have a legal abortion at 23 weeks. When the couple learned that their unborn daughter had a chromosomal defect 'incompatible with life outside the womb', they decided that terminating the pregnancy was the best course of action. 'I am pro-choice because I am pro-life,' the woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, said. 'My little girl would never have [had] a life, and attempting to give her that could take mine away in the process.' Sad decision: After an amniocentesis, the Ohio woman found out that her unborn daughter found out that her daughter wouldn't survive outside the womb, and she chose to get an abortion . The anonymous couple was happy to learn that they were expecting last December. In March, they were looking forward to the 20-week anatomy scan. But the woman had a gut feeling something wasn't right. At about five months along, she wasn't showing yet, and though her family assured it was just because she had an athletic body, she explained: 'Things just felt wrong, felt off.' Her fears proved to be right. On April 1, she and her husband went to her OB-GYN for the planned anatomy scan. They found out they were having a girl - but at the same time discovered that the fetus was much smaller than it should have been at that time. She was referred to another hospital with a specialized fetal medicine center where, two weeks later, an amniocentesis test  showed that the fetus had Triploidy, a chromosomal defect that is 'incompatible with life outside the womb'. They learned that their unborn daughter had 69 chromosomes instead of the normal 46, an abnormality that also resulted in Dandy Walker Syndrome. The fetus also had a diaphragmatic hernia and severely stunted growth, weighing 8oz when she should have weighed just over a pound. These major health issues  also meant there were risks for the mother. The fetus was so small that it could have died in the womb without the woman knowing, which could have resulted in an infection. The mother was also at a higher risk for preeclampsia, a blood pressure-related pregnancy complication that can be fatal. She also noted that her placenta could have ruptured, leaving her to 'bleed out in my bathtub faster than anyone could help me'. With the knowledge that her health was at risk and her child would be unable to live, the woman and her husband made the decision to terminate the pregnancy. It wasn't an easy choice. The couple had already picked out a name, Gwendolyn Renee. And the woman added that the decision was especially hard for her husband, who grew up Catholic. Still, he agreed, carrying the child to term wasn't worth the risk to his wife's health. In their state of Ohio, abortion is legal until 24 weeks - but that doesn't compel all doctors to perform them. At the age of 23 weeks, the average baby is the size of a large mango. The woman tracked down the only doctor in her city who offered abortions. But because he practiced within a Catholic institution, he had to seek special approval from the CEO and the ethics board, explaining that that the woman's child wouldn't survive and that there were dangers in letting the pregnancy progress naturally. She was approved for the abortion, and quickly started taking steps toward having the procedure. 'My doctors were honest and clear about the situation,' she said. 'They used explicit terms and didn't dance around the issue. During the different procedures they walked me through exactly what they were doing, but at the same time, they were very empathetic and understanding.' First, she had to have three to four sticks of laminaria, a form of kelp, inserted into her cervix to begin dilation, which she describes as 'pretty uncomfortable'. After going home for the night, where she experienced cramping, the woman  went back to the clinic with her husband the next day to have the 45-minute procedure under general anaesthesia. '[Our baby] passed painlessly inside me and was never alone,' the woman said, adding that their daughter will be be cremated, and the ashes will be spread over garden at hospital. Also called Triploid Syndrome, Triploidy is a chromosomal disorder characterized by having three of every chromosome - so infants affected have a total of 69 chromosomes rather than the standard 46. Babies with Tripoidy are often lost through miscarriage. Those that survive usually die within the first five months of life. The rare disorder also causes babies to be much smaller than average, and often results in birth defects. Source: WebMD . The woman said that she and her husband are still grieving and experience bouts of 'spontaneous sobbing'. She wonders how Mother's Day, which is on May 10, will feel and how she'll cope on the baby's due date, but she knows that she and her husband made the right decision. 'I don't regret it,' she said. 'My other option was to wait for her to pass naturally, but the risks were too high.' She does, however, wish people would stop telling her that 'the next baby will be just fine'; she explained that though she and her husband do plan to try again, they are still dealing with the loss of this baby. 'I'm facing this head-on and telling people about it no-holds-barred,' she expained, because she knows she is not the only woman to go through this. 'Because it does happen, a lot, and we shouldn't be afraid to talk about it.'","The Ohio woman revealed on Reddit that her unborn daughter's dangerous condition would have left her unable to live outside the womb .

"Two soldiers, one a Buckingham Palace guard, walked free from court yesterday despite inflicting a shocking beating on a helpless civilian. During the drunken attack, which was caught on CCTV, Scots Guard Shaun Smith, 25, can be seen stamping 18 times on his victim’s head. His fellow soldier, Welsh Guard Jason Collins, 22, rained blows with his fists on to the man’s body. Scroll down for video . CCTV cameras captured the horrifying attack last April in which soldiers Shaun Smith (left, in black jeans) and Jason Collins (right, bending over), kicked and punched two men repeatedly near their barracks . Collins, 22, (right) has been stationed at Buckingham Palace since the attack. Smith (left), was described as an 'angel' in court by his officer . The soldiers were expected to be jailed for the ‘deeply unpleasant and inexcusable’ assault. But yesterday a judge at Teesside Crown Court made what even he admitted was an ‘extraordinary’ decision to let the men walk free. Judge James Hill, QC, said he had decided to show mercy after hearing glowing tributes and being told the Army was keen to keep them. ‘I state in open court that what I have done is entirely exceptional,’ he said. ‘I can’t say what the Army will do but I simply express the hope, as your commanding officers have expressed, that the Army feels able to keep you.’ The furious victim James Wormald – who was left with the imprint of Smith’s shoe on his forehead – said it was wrong that the pair had got off so lightly and that there was no excuse for what had happened. ‘There was absolutely no reason for the attack,’ he said. ‘To stamp on someone that many times and get away with only being sentenced for actual bodily harm is wrong. With one of their victims motionless on the ground the pair begin to chase the second across the main road near their barracks at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire . Reaching for his neck, Collins tries to grab the man before the pair chase him round a tree and back onto the road . After dragging the man onto the ground Collins is seen raising his fists and punching him repeatedly in the face . The pair earlier claimed they had been followed out of a nightclub by the victims who threatened to stab them. A judge rejected their version of events, saying the man seen in the footage (above) posed 'no threat' when they were beating him . ‘I don’t know how I escaped that without really serious injuries, the force they used could have killed me and I really expected them to go to jail for it.’ Both men were cleared by a jury of grievous bodily harm but admitted causing actual bodily harm. Smith was given a 12-month suspended jail sentence and ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work. Collins was given a 12-month community order, and both men were each told to pay £1,000 compensation. The maximum penalty for a single count of occasioning actual bodily harm is five years imprisonment according to the Crown Prosecution Service's sentencing guidelines. With both Smith and Collins found guilty of two counts each, the soldiers could have faced sentences of ten years. Instead they both walked free from court in what even the judge in the case described as 'exceptional'. In the most lenient circumstances a sentence of one year in custody is advised. Smith was given a 12 month sentence suspended, while Collins received a 12-month community order. The pair launched the vicious attack after a night’s heavy drinking near Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire last April. They matched each other drink for drink in bars and each downed six beers and 15 shots. They encountered local men Mr Wormald, 25, and his friend Mark Thompson after leaving a bar at 3.30am and there was an exchange of words. Collins and Smith claimed the two men had threatened to stab them – a claim strongly denied by Mr Wormald, a chef. The court was shown video of Collins knocking Mr Thompson out cold with a single punch before he and Smith set upon Mr Wormald. Their victim runs across a road, trips and falls. Smith, who has a hood covering his face, can be seen bringing his foot down over and over on his victim’s head while Collins relentlessly pummels Mr Wormald’s body. The pair then ran off and hid in a stream, but were caught by the police. Mr Wormald had severe bruising to his face. Collins is highly regarded by the Welsh Guards and has been entrusted to stand guard at both Buckingham Palace and St James’s Palace since the incident. He is likely to keep his job. Scots Guard Smith was also of previous good character. Richard Herrmann, defending him, said: ‘But for that night this man is an angel, but on that night he was a devil.’ Captain James Dyson said Smith had ‘picked himself up’ since and ‘is proving to be one of the best performing people in his platoon’. Outside court Detective Constable Andy Palmer said: ‘This is the most violent piece of CCTV footage I have seen in ten years as a police officer and it is extremely fortunate the victims were not more seriously injured. This case highlights the horrors of alcohol-fuelled violence.’","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Richard Wilkins is made of stern stuff, he's had to be across almost 30 years of dealing with tantrums and egos as a television presenter and interviewer, but standing on ANZAC Cove thinking of what his grandfather George had faced 100 years ago, reduced him to tears. Wilkins, 60, made the pilgrimage to Gallipoli on the eve of the centenary commemorations, to discover more of his grandfather, George William Thomson, a qualified dentist, who toiled for many hours on end as part of the New Zealand medical corps to mend broken bodies. He tells how having read excerpts from his ""papa's"" war diary, lit 'a flame of interest' to learn more of the World War One veteran. Scroll down for video .

TV presenter Richard Wilkins is rarely overcome with emotion despite working in the industry for almost 30 years but broke down as he retraced his grandfather's footsteps in Gallipoli . 'It’s quite overwhelming, I was keeping a stiff upper lip until tonight, when we visited a Turk memorial at Ari Burnu,' Wilkins said, admitting he rarely becomes emotional during a shoot, but this was different. 'When you're working, when you are shooting a story, it's about doing a piece and you've got to do it right, we are doing your job .. but it just happens to be about your grand-dad, it changes things,' he revealed. 'Standing on ANZAC Cove and just thinking that it was at a similar time of the day, it was 2 in the morning, it was cold, the cliffs are steep and you think that these poor buggers found themselves in the middle of hell, they were just mowed down, families gutted, it makes me so sad. Richard Wilkins has had almost 30 years of dealing with tantrums and egos as a television presenter and interviewer, but standing on ANZAC Cove thinking of what his grandfather George had faced 100 years ago, reduced him to tears . 'I've got a 29-year-old son and another who turns 20 on ANZAC DAY, those are prime ages to have been over here a century ago, perish the thought, it's deeply, deeply overwhelming.' Wilkins told Daily Mail Australia of his immense pride at the role his grandfather played and at seeing the medals and reading his diary at the war memorial in Auckland. 'It was something I thought about doing for some time because I was aware he was a young dentist, straight out of uni, who had enlisted in the war went to Egypt and found himself here at Gallipoli, helping to mend soldiers so they could continue to serve,' he said. 'I've got a 29-year-old son and another who turns 20 on ANZAC Day, those are prime ages to have been over here a century ago, perish the thought, it's deeply, deeply overwhelming,' said Richard Wilkins pictured here with his son Christian . Richard Wilkins pieced together a story for the Today Show on the Nine Network about his grandfather George's time at Gallipoli on the eve of centenary ANZAC Day commemorations . Even though he admitted, at first, to being 'a bit miffed' that the war memorabilia was not kept within the family, 'I was thrilled at how they restore and maintain all the various artefacts that have been donated by various families'. 'You have to put gloves on, go into special rooms where they are temperature controlled and all that, that too was deeply moving,' he added. 'There were all these maps and very, very good records of where he went, time he'd spent on the beaches, boats and ferrying wounded off to hospitals. 'We opened this one page, where he talked about 200 being wounded, were brought on the ship, one had his jaw blown off, other with limbs missing, he said ""shells exploding all around us, huge spouts of water"" and as he went on he became more and more bleak.' Wilkins said that one of his most enduring memories of Gallipoli was 'the heartwarming reverence the Turks hold for it all, particularly in the Dardenelles, in all the restaurants and cafes there are photos of (Mustafa) Ataturk and of ANZACS too'. 'What struck me was the enormity of it all, over half the eligible male population from New Zealand enlisted, 14,000 went, one in five died and two in five were seriously wounded .. no families were unscathed,' he said.","Veteran TV presenter Richard Wilkins was moved to tears as he retraced his grandfather's ANZAC footsteps .

"This is the moment a heroic teenage Baskin Robbins employee in Washington punched an armed robber as he tried to steal money from the cash register. Rachael Bishop, 19, was working an afternoon shift at the ice cream chain's Lynnwood store when a man wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses came in, unzipped his jacket and showed her he had a gun. Bishop said she tried to plead with the man when he ordered her to hand over all the money in the cash register, but when that didn't work she took action.

'I didn't want him to take my store's money, it was just a reaction,' Bishop told KIRO TV. 'It hurt, but you have adrenaline so you don't really think about it.' The robber punched Bishop right back, and that's when she said he managed to steal $280 from the cash register, according to Komo News. And yet the teenager remained unfazed. As the robber fled out the door she immediately ran after him. Bishop continued to chase the robber through the strip mall's parking lot, warning people nearby that he had a gun.

Officers later discovered the 44-year-old man was a wanted felon for forgery. Both police and Bishop's boss recommend to just hand over the money when confronted with an armed robber, but Nelson said 'the reality is that people kind of react as they react'. 'In this case, she fought back and didn't want to be a victim of this crime.'

"Posters promoting a 'straight pride' week at a northeast Ohio university were removed this week after student leaders determined that the message went beyond free speech. Youngstown State University student government leaders said they decided to remove the posters, which were hung on around campus earlier this week, after consulting with university officials. The posters included profanity and promoted the event as a time to not highlight sexual orientation or differences among students. Posters promoting a 'straight pride' week were removed from campus after student leaders said that they went 'way further than a free speech issue' They encouraged students to 'go about your day without telling everyone about how 'different' you are', according to WKBN. The anonymously posted flyers encouraged students to celebrate 'by not annoying the s*** out of everyone about your sexual orientation'. 'Brought to you by the students that are sick of hearing about your LGBT pride,' the posters read. 'Nobody cares about what you think you are, or what you want to have sex with. We have nothing against your sexual orientation. We just don't give a f***.' Campus leaders at the approximately 15,000-student university said that while they believe the posters were meant as satire, the message was inappropriate. 'If you actually read through it, it seemed like it went way further than a free speech issue,' said Student Government President Michael Slavens. 'There were swear words and took it a little further than the average free speech should go.' Student Government vice president Jacob Schriner-Biggs agreed with Slavens. 'When you are talking about minority activism, it is very easy that if you are in the majority to say ""well, this sort of activism is not necessary. This sort of zeal in your activism is over the top"",' he said. 'For minorities who experience discrimination, that is not the case,' It is believed by student leaders that the posters were satire, but they still missed the point of activism, a statement from the student government says . The posters counter the school's mission to create a diverse campus, university spokesman Ron Cole told WFMJ. Officials are investigating possible student code violations, and disciplinary action may follow. A statement from the student government said while it respects free speech of all students, the posters weren't authorized, contained vulgar language and missed the point of activism. 'When individuals belong to dominant societal cohorts (Caucasian, male, heterosexual, etc.) it is very easy to state ""We have nothing against your sexual orientation"" and to claim that efforts to raise awareness are ""annoying"",' it read, according to Gay Star News. The statement continued: 'For minorities who every day face discrimination and marginalization, such efforts are necessary without zeal and persistence, sociology teaches that minority concerns very easily go by the wayside. 'Thus, dismissing the efforts of LGBTQIA students to push for equitable treatment as unnecessary is dangerous because it catalyzes discrimination, whether meant to do so or not.' University officials are investigating into the posters, which were hung anonymously, and disciplinary action may follow .","The posters were hung around Youngstown State University this week .

"As Captain Ross Poldark, his brooding good looks and rippling muscles have sent women around the country into a frenzy. But Aidan Turner's Poldark co-star Heida Reed has claimed the obsession with his body is sexist, and is unintentionally undermining the BBC1 series. Miss Reed, 27, who stars in the period drama as Poldark's former lover Elizabeth, said Turner, 31, was being 'objectified' in a way that would not be tolerated if he were female. Poldark star Heida Reed has claimed audiences' obsession with Aidan Turner's (pictured body is sexist . Claiming it is evidence of reverse sexism, Miss Reed said: 'I think there should be the same standard for both sexes when it comes to things like this. 'Of course it's nice for everyone involved that he's viewed as a sex symbol or very attractive man. But it's getting a little bit ridiculous. I think it just undermines the rest of the show. 'I don't think it should be any more allowed than if a woman was in the same situation. And if she was, the media would have a field day that she's being objectified.' Reed said she knew 'for a fact that [Turner is] completely baffled by the amount of interest' in the popularity of images that show him scything in a field. 'The producers had no idea that was going to happen either,' she explained. 'They never said 'let's have his shirt taken off and everyone will go nuts'. It wasn't a strategy.' The Icelandic actress's comments follow overwhelming interest in Turner's physique from Poldark's avid fans. Hundreds of viewers have taken to Twitter to marvel at his strapping form, as scenes showed him swimming naked in the sea and scything a field topless. One joked on Twitter: 'If Poldark gets any hotter we'll have to call the fire brigade.' Another told MailOnline: 'There isn't a single woman I know, who doesn't think he's absolutely gorgeous.' And they even complained after last week's episode failed to feature Turner's bare chest. One posted: 'All bad news on the Poldark front tonight. @Aidan didn't get his shirt off once.' However while fans' interest might be taken for flattery, Miss Reed said Turner, who is reportedly engaged to his girlfriend of four years, actress Sarah Greene, is 'completely baffled' by the level of attention, which has included online marriage proposals. Heida Reed pictured with her popular co-star in a scene from the TV series Poldark . Miss Reed, who is currently starring in a play about revenge porn called Scarlet, in which she appears on stage in just her underwear was speaking to the Daily Telegraph. Poldark, which is based on the books by Winston Graham, has followed Ross Poldark since he returned from the American War of Independence only to find that his father has died and his former fiancée, Elizabeth, has married another man. He rescues Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, 22, from life as a street urchin and takes her in as his maid. And their relationship develops from a working one to one of passion, climaxing with a steamy bedroom scene. The final instalment of Poldark airs on BBC1 tomorrow at 9pm.","Heida Reed has claimed audiences' obsession with her co-star is 'sexist'

"Vladmir Lenin may have been dead for 90 years, but his corpse looks better than the day he passed. This is the claim made by his embalmers, who have developed experimental techniques to maintain the look and feel of the communist revolutionary's body. They brag that their technique has been the result of almost a century of fine-tuning, creating a science that has benefited real-world medical applications. Scroll down for video . Vladmir Lenin may have been dead for 90 years, but his corpse looks better than the day he passed. This is the claim made by his embalmers, who have developed experimental techniques to maintain the look and feel of the communist revolutionary's body. Pictured is his body in 1997 . The gruesome job is the responsibility of a team known as the 'Mausoleum group' which, at its peak, involved 200 scientists working in a lab dedicated to the former leader's corpse. According to a detailed report by Jeremy Hsu in Scientific American, the Russians prefer to preserve the body's shape, weight, colour and flexibility, rather than biological tissue. 'They have to substitute occasional parts of skin and flesh with plastics and other materials,' Alexei Yurchak, professor of social anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley told Mr Hsu. 'That makes it dramatically different from everything in the past, such as mummification.' Yurchak has published a paper on this project in the journal Representations, along with a book, 'Everything Was Forever, until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation.' The Bolshevik leader's remains were embalmed on Stalin's orders when he died aged 53 in 1924 and kept on display in Moscow apart from a period in the Second World War . The revolutionary's body is on public display in a mausoleum on Moscow's Red Square more than two decades after the break-up of the former USSR. Vladmir Lenin was behind the Bolshevik take-over of power in Russia in 1917. He was also the architect and first head of the USSR. Born in Simbirsk, he was expelled from university for his radical policies while studying law. This prompted him to move to St Petersburg, where he became a revolutionary. He was arrested and exiled to Siberia. He later spent most of his time in western Europe, where he became the leader of the 'Bolshevik' faction of the Russian Social Democratic Worker's Party. In 1917,  Lenin returned to Russia where he led what was to be known as the October Revolution. Around three years of civil war followed in which millions died. In 1918, Lenin survived an assassination attempt, but was severely wounded. In 1922 he suffered a stroke from which he never fully recovered. But this year Russian officials closed Red Square so that scientists could prepare the body for public display during Lenin's 145th birthday anniversary – which took place yesterday. In his book, Yurchak describes how a mild bleach is often used to deal with occasional fungus stains on Lenin's face. One such stain that appeared on Lenin's cheek had the embalmers worried for their lives when they were unable to remove it. 'They might have even killed us,' Ilya Zbarsky, who managed to bleach away the mould, told Jewish World Review. 'The atmosphere of fear and terror was there for us scientists, just as it was for everyone in the society.' The skin is studied each week using precision instruments that can measure moisture, colour and contour to look for signs of dehydration. Every two years and the body is immersed in a bath of glycerol and potassium acetate for 30 days – a technique which scientists say could make the body last for centuries. While Lenin's blood, bodily fluids and internal organs were removed, his eyebrows, moustache and goatee are his own. A material made of paraffin, glycerin and carotene is used to replace most of Lenin's skin. Vladmir Lenin was behind the Bolshevik take-over of power in Russia in 1917. He was also the architect and first head of the USSR. He is pictured here in 1918, six years before his death . Some of the techniques have had real-world medical applications, according to Scientific American. For instance, one technique inspired technology used to keeping the blood moving through donor kidneys during transplantation. The Bolshevik leader's remains were embalmed on Stalin's orders when he died aged 53 in 1924 and kept on display in Moscow apart from a period in the Second World War. In 2012, Russia was edging towards a historic decision to bury the embalmed corpse of the founder of the Soviet Union. The former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky said it was 'absurd' that Lenin had not been laid to rest 88 years after his death. Calling for him to be buried in a normal grave, as Lenin himself had requested, Medinsky said: 'Maybe something would change for the better in our lives then.' Putin has repeatedly postponed a decision on burial, arguing that Lenin remained an icon for many elderly Russians.

"UKIP is only seen as racist by white people, Nigel Farage has claimed. The party leader said that he gets an ‘unbelievably’ positive welcome when he meets black people. But he said claims the party is racist have stopped many supporters – including internationally acclaimed rock stars and billionaires – from backing him publicly. Mr Farage said that when he goes into ‘black parts’ of London he gets a warm reception. UKIP leader Nigel Farage (pictured canvassing today) says the party is only seen as racist by white people . ‘I stopped this morning to get some newspapers in a petrol station in Catford [south east London]. Everybody was black, getting petrol, buying newspapers,’ he said. ‘It's unbelievable, they all wanted selfies and pictures. And the only people who think Ukip are racist are white people, middle class white people. ‘Come with me to a black part of south London, walk down the street, and you will find black people going: 'Hey man, good to see you‎”.’ Mr Farage said the idea that Ukip is racist is based on ‘no evidence whatsoever’. ‘It is the self-loathing that the middle and upper classes in Britain have about themselves in this country and they’ve convinced themselves that Ukip is a racist party on the basis of no evidence whatsoever, he said. ‘These Michael Heseltine types, they hate Britain, “oh things are done so much better on the continent”, they’ve built up this narrative that Ukip is racist, black people don’t think that.’ Mr Farage said supporters in the Thanet South constituency where he is standing to become an MP had been targeted by vandals. Nigel Farage claims that he gets an ‘unbelievably’ positive welcome when he meets black people . He added that claims the party is racist have stopped many supporters – including internationally acclaimed rock stars and billionaires – from backing him publicly . He said one man had his garage spray-painted with the word ‘racist’ three times in a month because he displayed ‘Vote Ukip’ signs. Mr Farage added: ‘I’ve got internationally acclaimed rock stars, famous actors and actresses, billionaire owners and runners of FTSE 100 companies who in private support me, who will not say a word in public because they are so scared of what will be said about them. ‘That’s where we are and that’s how we get the phenomenon of the “shy kipper” and I’m getting people who say “I wouldn’t even tell a pollster on the phone that I’m voting Ukip in case they smash my windows in”. ‘That is how much fear and loathing has been put on us.’ As Mr Farage canvassed in the Kent constituency he met one supporter who said he hoped the Ukip leader would become Prime Minister, but said he did not think it would happen at this election because ‘we have got too many foreigners over here at the moment who are eligible to vote and will obviously not be voting Ukip’. Asked what he thought of the remarks, Mr Farage said: ‘Well in London he might have a point.’ He added: ‘He is the sort person Ed Miliband would condemn as being an appalling and despicable human being, but these are real people.’ Whilst knocking on doors, Mr Farage was also greeted by an eight-year-old boy who told him: ‘Thank you for trying to take our country back.’ Cameron should have offered me a deal but he thinks I'm a ghastly yobbo . Nigel Farage has said the Tories would have offered him an election pact if they had ‘half a brain cell’. But he Ukip leader said David Cameron had not tried to strike a deal because he sees him as a ‘ghastly yobbo’. Mr Farage pictured celebrating St George's Day with a pint at the Northwood Club in Ramsgate yesterday . He said: ‘If the Tories had half a brain cell they would have come to me with a deal six months ago . ‘But they see me as a member of the lower orders, that's how Osborne and Cameron look at me. Well fine, I don't care.’ Asked how they could see him as a ‘member of the lower orders’ when like them he attended a public school, Mr Farage said: ‘Don't forget, unlike them I had to work for a living. 'That's quite a big difference. I'm not a trustafarian. ‘A ghastly yobbo, that's what they think I am. They're never brave enough to tell anybody to their face what they really think, they don't do things like that I do.’ Mr Farage said that the deal could have been an agreement not to stand against each other in certain seats. He said: ‘I don't think Ukip would have accepted it anyway, but if I'd been them, I'd have said well look here's 25 seats ‎in the Midlands and the North - like Dudley North, Grimsby, Rotherham and Heywood and Middleton - where they haven't got a cat's chance in hell, but against that in Somerton and Frome where you've got up to 22 or 23 per cent Ukip vote where they're trying to get rid of the Lib Dems. ‘If I was in their boots that is what I'd have considered, but they just no didn't consider it.’","Ukip leader says people of Catford, south east London, 'all wanted selfies'

"Imagine a future where humans are skiing on the surface of a distant moon and living in floating cities on Venus - while Earth lies in ruin. That’s the future envisioned by an artist in a fantastic series of ‘tourism’ posters, showcasing his dream for how we might one day explore the stars. And he hopes the posters encourage us to expand our presence into the solar system - especially as our planet is vulnerable to cosmic disasters. Scroll down for video . Artist Frank McKeever from Florida created these amazing posters. They show how we could colonise various worlds in the solar system. Included are humans skiing on a moon of Uranus and living in cities on Mars. Others show life on Europa and near Saturn - and a destroyed Earth (shown) The posters were created by artist and entrepreneur Frank McKeever, 28, from St Augustine in Florida and his colleague Miranda. Mr McKeever runs an art business called Science Hype with his wife Nicole, where each of these posters can be bought. All the posters seen here are hand-drawn, and then taken into Photoshop and Illustrator to finish them off. Mr McKeever told MailOnline his inspiration for the posters came from his love of travel, retro-style designs and a love of space. ‘To us, it's reminiscent of ads that were displayed during the 60s, and seeing as that was the time of the Space Race, it just made sense to present space posters in that medium,’ he said. Perhaps the most striking image is the one of Earth seemingly destroyed and uninhabitable. It’s a future that has left many experts to recently call for more effort to be made to protect Earth from threats such as asteroids - and expand our presence into the solar system. ‘The destroyed Earth was big for me,’ said Mr McKeever. ‘I began thinking about the possibility of being hit by an asteroid - especially with the fact that a huge one just flew awfully close to us a few days ago.’ Another poster shows humans living on the surface of Mars in cities, which Frank says he thinks is ‘very possible’. He added: ‘I can see that happening in my lifetime. And I think it should.' On Mercury - the closest planet to the sun - is a large crater 960 miles (1,550km) wide called the Caloris Basin, which Mr McKeever thinks we might explore (left). Colonisation of Mars in the form of a city, meanwhile, is something that may also be a possibility (right) Venus is known to have an Earth-like band in its atmosphere about 30 miles (50km) above the surface, where some have said it could be possible to place floating space colonies (shown) Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton, which Mr McKeever thinks we might colonise (left). Maybe one day we will also return to the moon (right), with a destroyed Earth in the background - while one of the Apollo flags has been bleached white from radiation . Owing to the orbits of Earth and Mars, there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place. Our planets come as close as 33.9 million miles (54.6 million km), but can be as distant as 250 million miles (400 million km). For this reason spacecraft to Mars, such as the Curiosity rover, have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned. The next window is open from January 2016 to April 2016, and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet. For a future manned mission, they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in another. Just getting there will take up to nine months. The astronauts will then be there waiting for a year until they can come back, again taking up to nine months - a total of around three years. Many have wondered whether it might be possible to colonise certain corners of the solar system before. Venus, for example, is known to have an Earth-like band in its atmosphere about 30 miles (50km) above the surface, where some have said it could be possible to place floating space colonies. In fact, in 1985 the Soviet Union sent two balloons into the atmosphere of Venus - Vega 1 and 2 - to provide key evidence for this potentially habitable band. Europa, meanwhile, has often been said to be a potential place to find life in the solar system - and Mr McKeever has imagined we might live there one day, too. Nasa is in the process of designing its unmanned Europa Clipper spacecraft, which would arrive at the moon of Jupiter in the 2020s and fly through geysers erupting from its surface.

"Freddie Gray should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested - before he was put inside a police van, authorities said Friday. Baltimore police have come under intense scrutiny after Gray was taken into custody and suffered an unexplained spinal injury that led to his death. Six officers have been suspended with pay as local police and federal authorities investigate. However, commissioner Anthony Batts has ruled out the possibility of his resignation. Scroll down for video . 'That's not going to happen': Baltimore police commissioner Anthony Batts ruled out his resignation despite that fact that his deputy admitted they should have sought medical attention for Freddie Gray . Batts addressed a news conference in Baltimore on Friday amid growing calls for him to step down . Concession: Police admit they should have sought medical help for Freddie Gray (pictured being detained on April 12) when he requested assistance in the police car. He was later pronounced dead . Commissioner Batts said the investigation is being refined and the picture is getting 'sharper and sharper.' He did not elaborate. As for calls for his resignation, he said: 'That's not going to happen.' Gray, who is black, was arrested April 12 after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said. Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into a police van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. Gray died on Sunday, April 19, after he 'had his spine 80 per cent severed at his neck' while in police custody . Gray was not buckled in by a seat belt, a violation of the police department's policy. He asked for medical help several times, and after a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. At some point - either during his arrest or inside the van - he suffered a mysterious spinal injury. Authorities have not explained how or when it occurred. Deputy police commissioner Kevin Davis said Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot of his arrest. Bystander video shows Gray screaming as officers carried him to the van, his legs appearing limp. After a week of protests, people angry over the death promised their biggest march Saturday, when they would try to 'shut down' the city. The demonstrators say Gray's death shows police mistreatment of blacks in Baltimore and throughout the country. The mayor thanked protesters for being peaceful so far. She expects the results of the investigation to be turned over to prosecutors in a week, and they will decide whether any criminal charges will be filed. 'I will not deny we have had a very long and complicated history on issues such as these,' Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said. 'But it's important to remember that we have an equally long history of peaceful and legal protest.' Asked if Gray's possible 'rough ride' is a one-off, the mayor said: 'It's clearly not a one-off. The reason we have the policy around seat belts in the police vans is because of an incident that happened previously,' referring to Dondi Johnson. He died of a fractured spine in 2005 after he was arrested for urinating in public and transported without a seat belt, with his hands cuffed behind his back. Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake speaks in front of local faith leaders at a news conference regarding the death of Freddie Gray on Friday. She appeared to support the police with her statements . Captain Erik Pecha of the Baltimore Police Department exchanges words with young demonstrators . More than 50 officers manned a barricade surrounding the station, separating them from the protesters . Protesters for Freddie Gray stand outside the Baltimore Police Department's Western District police station. The protest was peaceful, though some in the crowd hurled insults at the officers behind the fence, who stared back stone-faced . Angela Hazel (C) reacts near City Hall during a protest against the death of Freddie Gray Hazel said 'I lost my child to the streets, too. My only child...' The leader of a group of local ministers called on Batts to resign immediately. 'It seems that no one in the police department can explain what happened,' said the Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr., president of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Baltimore. He said the police department is 'in disarray' and Batts has shown a 'lack of viable leadership capabilities.' The mayor appeared to back the police commissioner at her own news conference. 'Nickel rides' have caused spinal injuries in the past and Baltimore police epartment rules were updated nine days before Gray's arrest stating that all detainees shall be strapped in by seat belts or other device . The president of a black lawyers' group predicted thousands of people would turn out Saturday, when good weather is forecast and the Orioles are hosting the Boston Red Sox in a Major League Baseball game. 'Things will change on Saturday, and the struggle will be amplified,' said Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers for Justice. Shabazz rejected the notion that he was an outside agitator who would stir up trouble. Bernard Young, Baltimore City Council president said prior to a rally on Thursday that he hoped citizens wouldn't let 'outside forces come in here and dictate how we act by destroying our infrastructure.' 'We can lead ourselves. We're capable of doing that,' he said.","Freddie Gray, who is black, asked for medical help but was denied during 30-minute police car ride, eventually paramedics were called .

"The number of passenger vehicle teen drivers involved in U.S. fatal crashes decreased from 5,724 to 2,568, per 100,000 people in the last decade . The number of fatal crashes involving teenage drivers has dropped 55 per cent in the past decade, according to a U.S. report. Between 2004 and 2013, the number of passenger vehicle drivers aged 16 to 19 involved in U.S. fatal crashes decreased from 5,724 to 2,568, per 100,000 people. New safety features in cars and graduate license restrictions are among the top reasons for the dramatic drop in fatalities. Ruth Shults, an injury prevention researcher at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta who worked on the report, said graduated licenses decrease overall crash rate in teen drivers by 20 to 40 per cent. Graduated licenses can put curfews on young drivers, putting less teens on the road at night. These types of licenses can also restrict the number of passengers a new driver can have in their car, according to Autoblog. Some states limit young drivers to one passenger, while others only allow relatives and driving instructors. As for time restrictions, some states, such as Idaho, do not let young drivers on the road from sunset to sunrise. Other states have more concrete time periods, such as 11pm to 5am or 12am to 6am. The age in which graduated licenses change from beginner to intermediate to fully privileged driver also varies among states. Eric Teoh, a senior highway statistician at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Arlington, Virginia, who was not involved in the study said younger teens might not be getting behind the wheel, which means less accidents can occur. On average, three out of four U.S. high schools students aged 16 or older reported to have driven in the past 30 days when taking a survey . 'An 18-year-old novice is probably more prepared maturity-wise than a 16-year-old novice,' he told Autoblog. Three out four U.S. high schools students aged 16 or older had driven at least once during the 30 days before a survey was taken by the CDC, according to the report that announced the fatality information. The report looked at students in 42 states - California, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington were not included. The percentage of students who drove was higher in Midwestern and mountain states, and it was found to be lower in metropolitan areas.","Between 2004 and 2013, number of passenger vehicle drivers aged 16 to 19 involved in U.S. fatal crashes decreased from 5,724 to 2,568, per 100,000 .

In the spotlight: 'Yes, we will be all watching as a family tonight,' the 34-year-old beauty told E! when stopping by Variety's 2015 Power Of Women luncheon in New York City . Bruce pre-Kris in 1989: On Thursday evening Entertainment Tonight reported that Jenner started a gender transition process in the mid-1980s but stopped after he met and fell in love with Kris Kardashian, who became his third wife . She insisted the entire clan is fully supportive of Jenner. She added: 'As a family we always support each other 100 per cent and I know that I see things online that there is this divide and this one doesn’t support this and this one doesn’t support this and you know it’s all ridiculous and it’s all rumors and we love everyone in the family and we support everyone equally so we're excited to watch tonight and I’m excited for Bruce to tell his story on Diane Sawyer.' She added to Entertainment Tonight: 'I hate so badly when I see things [like] my mom doesn't support him, or this sister doesn't support him. It's all just a story that people want to put out there. None of us have spoken and we're letting Bruce speak first.' TMZ claimed that Bruce, 65, would be watching the special twice. 'He will be watching both an east coast and west coast feed,' said a source. 'The Kardashian family will be watching one feed with Bruce, and the rest of his family, including Brody, Brandon, Burt and Casey, will be watching the other feed.' The Jenners will gather at his Malibu mansion. The site's source added, 'Bruce felt it was very important to be around his family when the show airs.' The cameras for Keeping Up with the Kardashians will not be on when he watched the show, it was also claimed. But there was no mention if some of Bruce's own cameras for one of his own projects would be there. On Thursday evening Entertainment Tonight reported that Jenner started a gender transition process in the mid-1980s but stopped after he met and fell in love with Kris Kardashian, who became his third wife. A supporter: The E! queen previously told Entertainment Tonight. 'I think Bruce is very happy, the happiest I've ever seen him...He's our dad so we support him no matter what… I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about' By the mid-1980s, the Olympic gold medalist had allegedly started hormone therapy and electrolysis and had had plastic surgery to make his features look more feminine. Jenner found his own facial hair to be repulsive, the source told ET. A spokesperson for Bruce declined to comment on the report after being contacted by DailyMail.com Friday morning. The bombshell Entertainment Tonight report, broadcast Thursday night, claims that Bruce was exploring the idea of gender reassignment surgery with doctors in Denmark but had a change of heart after meeting Kris, the ex-wife of famed LA attorney Robert Kardashian. Mum's the word on her ex: Kris Jenner would not comment on Bruce's upcoming tell-all when she stopped by Craig's in West Hollywood on Thursday evening . The revelation comes just hours before the famous decathlete and reality star is expected to tell all about his personal journey and his transition to living as a woman in a two-hour ABC special tonight with Diane Sawyer. On Friday morning ABC released another clip from his upcoming sit down. In the emotional video, Sawyer asked Jenner if there was anything that they hadn't covered over the course of the interview. 'What is the question—if I were you, what question would you ask me?' he clarified. 'Right...""Are you going to be OK? You know? Are you gonna be OK?""' Not a peep from this trip either: Khloe Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner had nothing to say about the former Olympian when they attended the Calvin Klein Jeans' celebration launch of the #mycalvins Denim Series at Chateau Marmont Thursday . He then said, 'Yeah. I hope I'm gonna be OK. I feel like I'm gonna be OK...2015's gonna be quite a ride. Quite a ride.' Earlier Bruce said he was worried about his children. 'I can't let myself hurt them.' Kim earlier showed support for her stepfather when talking to Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way...I think everyone goes through things in life,' she explained. 'I think Bruce is very happy, the happiest I've ever seen him...He's our dad so we support him no matter what… I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about.'

"A remote Iron Age fort built by the Picts as a look out post on top of a 20-foot-high sea stack has been uncovered on the coast of Scotland. Archaeologists believe the stronghold, which would have been cut off from the land at high tide, may have been one of a number that lined the east coast of Scotland. The fort, which was found on top of the Dunnicaer sea stack close to Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, appears to have been built with stone imported from elsewhere in the country. The small fort was discovered on top of Dunnicaer sea stack (shown above) and would have given the inhabitants a strong defensive position, although resupplying the fort up the cliff faces would have been hard . Stones used to construct the walls were also engraved with Pictish designs of fish and disks with broken spears through them. Dr Gordon Noble, an archaeologist at Aberdeen University who led the excavation, said the site was so remote it could only be accessed by climbing up the cliff face with ropes. The Picts were a group of tribes who lived north of the Forth and Clyde during the Late Iron Age and Early Medieval period. By the late 200s AD the Picts had overrun the northern frontier of the Roman empire more than once. Mel Gibson's blue face . paint in Braveheart is a nod to the Pictish tradition of body-paint - . but the real Picts fought stark naked, and there are records of them . doing so up until the 5th Century. The Roman name for the people - Picti - means 'painted people'. It's not known what they called themselves. The habit of fighting naked, especially in the cold Scottish climate, didn't harm the tribe's reputation for ferocity.  Picts were . one of the reasons even heavily armoured Roman legions could not conquer . the area. He said it appeared that despite its position, the fort had been lived in for extended periods and so must have been an important building. Dr Noble said it was possible the fort had been built there to help the Pictish tribes living there dominate the sea in the area. He said it was possible the fort, which is thought to date from the 5th to 6th century, could also have been a precursor to Dunnottar Castle, a medieval fortress built on the rocks of a headland less than quarter of a mile away. Dr Noble said: ‘It is possible that there was a series of forts along the coast. 'The Picts were known as sea raiders and forts like this may have helped cement that naval power. ‘It is quite an impressive site. It was pretty hairy climb to get up there and at high tide it is completely cut off. Resupplying the fort when it was inhabited would have been a challenge.’ The Picts were a group of tribes that lived in eastern and northern Scotland. Although best known for the carved stones and jewellery they left behind, it is thought that they were farmers but also engaged in sea raids. The archaeologists discovered the fort on Dunnicaer after following up reports that Pictish stones had been found there when some local youths climbed up the sea stack. Dr Noble said: ‘Being youths, they did what youths do and threw them down into the sea. ‘One of them returned later to collect one of the stones and since then a few others have been found. They had rough designs carved into them.’ When Dr Noble and his team from the Northern Picts project conducted a five day excavation on the top of the site, they uncovered the remains of what appears to be a rampart wall. They also found post holes and the remains of a hearth that appears to have been within a house built inside the fort. They even found charcoal still in the stone fire place. Mr Noble said there may have been a settlement built on the land behind the fort, although as the Picts largely built their homes from wood, it would be hard to find many remains. In order to reach the site, the team had to employ the services of professional rock climber Duncan Patterson, who climbed up the sea stack and put ropes in place. The archaeologists found the remains of a stone wall that would have formed part of the Iron Age fort . Some of the stones used to build the walls of the fort (like the one above) had rough Pictish carvings on them . The sea stack is only accessible at low tide and still requires a rock climb up the cliff face to reach the summit . This stone hearth, with the black charcoal dust still evident at the bottom of the picture, was uncovered by the team. It suggests the fort had been inhabited for relatively long periods, according to Dr Gordon Noble . Mr Noble said that at the time when the fort had been inhabited it may have had a wooden bridge across to the stack from the land otherwise it would have been very hard to access. He said: ‘The stone is not local, so it was quarried elsewhere and taken to build the fort and carved. ‘As for access, it is possible an easier route was present on the landward side and has now eroded, but certainly a timber access of some kind is well within their capabilities.’ The team now hope to examine some of the charcoal and other artifacts they found at the site in the hope of getting a better understanding of who lived there. The Dunnicaer sea stack sits just off the east coast of Scotland close to Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire . The researchers also found evidence for post holes (above) that were used in the fort ramparts during the dig . Archaeologists had to set up ropes to reach the sea stack after a professional climber scaled the rock face .

"Andrea McVeigh, 44, has been left scarred for life after being knocked down by cyclist . A woman has been left scarred for life after being knocked down by a cyclist who was riding on the pavement. Pedestrian Andrea McVeigh was sent crashing face-first into the concrete after being hit from behind by the rider. The cyclist fled the scene, chased by the 44-year-old's husband after she was left sprawled in a pool of her own blood. The social media manager suffered two three-inch gashes to the middle of her forehead, as well as other facial and hand injuries. Met Police have issued CCTV footage of a cyclist they want to speak to in connection with the crash, which happened in Bermondsey, south London on April 14. 'I got hit by a speeding cyclist on the pavement,' said Mrs McVeigh. 'He needs to be caught. 'I'm now scarred for life. It was as bad as being hit by a car.' She told how the cyclist initially stop after the impact and appeared to be locking his bike up, but then sped off. Mrs McVeigh said the rider turned around and smiled at her husband, who was chasing him, as he disappeared. 'The cyclist knew an ambulance and police were coming yet sped off,' she said. 'He knew the damage, saw the blood. 'Currently I'm now off work sick, with two black eyes, a swollen nose, stitches and feeling very scared to go out onto the street.' The police have now issued an appeal about the shockingly callous incident, which happened at about 6pm. Sergeant David Hunt said: 'The victim sustained significant facial injuries and If not for her husband and a member of the public stopping to help she would have been left on that footpath. 'I would encourage anyone who recognises him to contact us immediately.' Police have launched a hunt for the mystery cyclist who allegedly mowed down the 44-year-old . Chief Superintendent Zander Gibson, Borough Commander for Southwark, said: 'It must have been an awful encounter for the victim, both physically and emotionally and she has my heartfelt sympathy for what she went through. 'We sent an officer to the scene and they completed an investigation. 'There was a delay in following this investigation up but I am confident we are now taking appropriate steps to identify the person responsible.'

"Prosecutors have been accused of losing a Nissan Micra at the centre of a double murder case. Timothy Crook is alleged to have murdered his elderly parents Bob, 90, and Elsie, 83, and then driven their bodies 150 miles before dumping them. But the grey car he is accused of using to transport the bodies has been lost, Bristol Crown Court was told. Prosecutors have been accused of losing a Nissan Micra (similar to the one shown here) at the centre of a double murder case . Timothy Crook (pictured) is alleged to have murdered his elderly parents Bob, 90, and Elsie, 83, and then driven their bodies 150 miles in a grey Nissan Micra . Sarah Jones, representing Crook, 50, said the blunder could have forensic consequences for his case. Crook is accused of killing his parents at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live. Ms Jones told Judge Neil Ford QC at a preliminary hearing: 'The car in which the bodies were transported to Lincoln has been lost. 'That may have forensic consequences. We have some forensic angles being looked at. 'I have simply been told the Crown don't know where the car is. If it is not available it would be of help to have an identical model. 'It was a particular model which we believe did not allow for the laying down of the back seats.' Crook is accused of killing his parents (pictured) at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live . Police said the car (similar to the one pictured) which Crook is said to have driven was not lost and was in the North of England . A spokeswoman for the CPS added: 'It's not us who lost the car. We don't investigate the case, we can't be in possession of the car.' Wiltshire Police said the car was not lost, but did not know where it was exactly. A spokesman said: 'The vehicle has not been lost, we understand it to be in the North of England. 'But I believe there was a conversation in court around whether or not it would need to be brought back for further forensics etc.' Crook appeared at the plea and case management hearing via video link from Rampton Hospital and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty to the two murder charges. He is accused of murdering both parents between July 6 and 12, 2007. Some 49 witnesses are expected to be called at the trial which is provisionally set to open on July 6 and last up to four weeks.

"A second ice cream company has recalled all of its products after health officials found listeria in a sample of its frozen treats. Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams of Ohio said on its website on Thursday that it is recalling its frozen products after the listeria discovery. In an online statement, Jeni's said it is taking the voluntary precautionary measure in order to ensure complete consumer safety. The company is recalling its ice creams, frozen yogurts, sorbets, and ice cream sandwiches and closing retail stores until its products are 'ensured to be 100 per cent safe'. Scroll down for video . Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams of Ohio announced on Thursday that it has initiated a voluntary recall of all of its ice creams, frozen yogurts, sorbets and ice cream sandwiches . In an online statement on their website, the company wrote it is ceasing all sales and closing all scoop shops until all products are ensured to be 100 per cent safe . Half of Jeni's shops are in Columbus, others are listed in Atlanta; Chicago; Charleston, South Carolina; Cleveland; Los Angeles; and Nashville, Tennessee. The Nebraska Department of Agriculture found the listeria in a sample of Jeni's ice cream it had randomly collected at a Whole Foods in Lincoln, Nebraska. 'We will be working with our suppliers to determine if the bacteria was introduced by one of the ingredients we use,' John Lowe, the company's CEO said in a statement. 'We will not reopen the kitchen until we can ensure the safety of our customers.' Jeni's said the recalled ice cream was distributed in the United States to retail outlets, including food service and grocery stores, as well as online at jenis.com. On Facebook, the company wrote that they are taking this precautionary measure in order to ensure complete consumer safety . The recall includes all products bearing the brand name 'Jeni's.' The action follows a similar recall by Texas-based Blue Bell Creameries on Monday night. Blue Bell's ice cream was linked to ten listeria illnesses in four states, including three deaths, and listeria was found in several of the company's products. The company is the third largest ice cream manufacturer in the US and sells its products in 23 states. It said it 'can't say with certainty' how the bacteria was introduced to the manufacturing line, Blue Bell's chief executive Paul Kruse said in a statement. 'We're committed to doing the 100 percent right thing, and the best way to do that is to take all of our products off the market until we can be confident that they are all safe,' Kruse said. On Monday, Texas-based Blue Bell creameries issued a voluntary recall for all of its products on the market on Monday night after two samples of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream tested positive for listeriosis . Just last month the family-owned creamery issued its first recall in its 108-year history after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked ice cream contaminated with listeriosis to three deaths at a Kansas hospital. Five others in Kansas and Texas were sickened with the disease. The foodborne illness was tracked to a production line in Brenham, Texas, and later to a second line in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. The recalls are uncommon: listeria isn't usually found in ice cream, since the bacteria can't grow at freezing temperatures. A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration said the agency has no evidence, for now, that the listeria found in Jeni's ice cream and the listeria found in Blue Bell ice cream are connected. 'At this time, the FDA does not believe that the finding of listeria in one sample of Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams is related to the outbreak and recall associated with Blue Bell Ice Cream,' said spokesman Jeff Ventura. 'We are continuing to investigate both situations and will provide updated information to consumers as we learn more.' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there are no known illnesses linked to Jeni's products. Listeria generally only affects the elderly, people with compromised immune systems, pregnant women and their newborn infants . Also on Thursday, Blue Bell Creameries said it will close its facilities in Texas, Oklahoma and Alabama for intensive cleaning.  The creameries will be closed next week and possibly into the following week. The FDA said it still has open investigations in all three plants and will evaluate Blue Bell's progress in removing listeria from the plant and its products. Blue Bell did produce some ice cream in its plants this week, but that product will be used for testing and data gathering and won't be sold to the public, the company said. Listeria generally only affects the elderly, people with compromised immune systems, pregnant women and their newborn infants. It can cause fever, muscle aches and gastrointestinal symptoms. The worst cases are fatal. The bacteria is found in soil and water that can be tracked into a facility or carried by animals. It can be very difficult to get rid of once it contaminates a processing facility, partly because it grows well in refrigeration. It is commonly found in processed meats, unpasteurized cheeses and unpasteurized milk, and it is sometimes found in other foods as well — listeria in cantaloupes was linked to 30 deaths in a 2011 outbreak. What is Listeria? Listeria is a hardy bacteria found in soil and water that can be tracked into a plant or carried by animals. It can be very difficult to get rid of once it contaminates a processing facility, partly because it grows well in refrigeration. It is commonly found in processed meats, unpasteurized cheeses and unpasteurized milk, and it is sometimes found in other foods as well — listeria in cantaloupes was linked to 30 deaths in a 2011 outbreak. It is less well-known than other pathogens like salmonella and E. coli, which cause many more illnesses in tainted food every year. But one in five people who get sick from listeria can die. The people who get sick from listeria are often already weaker and more vulnerable to disease. What are the symptoms? When a person contracts the disease, it can cause fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal symptoms and even death. Am I at risk? Listeria generally only affects the elderly, people with compromised immune systems and pregnant women. It can cause miscarriage, stillbirth and premature labor for women and serious illness or death in newborn babies. Healthy, younger adults and most children can consume listeria with no ill effects or only mild illness. How can I protect against listeria? In the case of the ice cream and hummus recalls, there is nothing you can do to prevent it — just throw away the food if you learn it has been recalled. With fruit, scrubbing is never a bad idea, but it may not rid produce of all contaminants. In the case of the cantaloupe, the listeria likely hid on the fruit's thick, rough skin. Health officials think people may have been sickened when people cut into their cantaloupes, bringing listeria on the outside of the fruit to the inside. Always clean surfaces that come into contact with food with hot, soapy water.

"Britain's last Guantanamo Bay detainee Shaker Aamer is expected to be freed as early as June, according to US government sources. In a development which will hearten his family, officials in Washington said the 48-year-old is likely to be released in the summer after 13 years in captivity without charge or trial. It came as the man appointed by President Barack Obama to speed up the closure of the notorious prison camp said there was ‘no sound reason’ for keeping the terror suspect locked up any longer. British Guantanamo Bay detainee Shaker Aamer (pictured) is expected to be freed in June, US government sources have revealed. He is pictured right and left with son Michael and daughter, Johninh . The 48-year-old has been held at Guantanamo Bay without charge for more than 13 years (file picture of the prison) Campaigners welcomed moves to end the scandal of Saudi-born Mr Aamer continuing to languish in the naval base in Cuba but said his detention was an ‘affront to civilised values’. Mr Aamer, who lived in South London with his wife and children, is the longest-serving UK resident in Guantanamo and has twice been cleared for release, by the Bush administration in 2007, and by Barack Obama in 2009. His imprisonment is embarrassing for David Cameron, who said Mr Obama had vowed to prioritise the detainee’s release after White House talks in January. But sources in the White House said the father-of-four was expected to be one of 11 captives transferred within weeks. Cliff Sloan, who was the State Department’s envoy dealing with prisoner transfers until last year, said: ‘They should be moved just as promptly as possible. We are talking about people who have been at Guantanamo for 12 or 13 years... they should not be having to spend a day longer than necessary in Guantanamo.’ He said there was no sound reason for delay. Officials said the transfer will take place after a 30-day notice period to Congress, following a sign-off from US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter. Kat Craig, legal director of Reprieve, which has represented Mr Aamer, said: ‘He continues to be the victim of the most extraordinary injustice, as well as daily abuses that are an affront to civilised values. ‘Any moves to return Shaker to his British wife and children cannot come soon enough, and should be welcomed.’ The UK has made repeated calls since 2010 for the release of the 48-year-old, who has a British wife and four children in London . Karla McLaren, of Amnesty International UK, said: ‘These reports are obviously encouraging but we’ve been here before. ‘There have been so many false dawns over the release of Shaker that we won’t believe it until a plane bringing him back actually touches down here in Britain. ‘Guantanamo has always been a complete travesty of justice and whoever is in government must ensure... Shaker is returned to his family as soon as possible if he’s not going to be charged.’ Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and married, securing leave to remain in Britain. In 2001 he was detained in Kabul while doing peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity, his supporters say. He was handed to the US military for money and tortured at a secret ‘black site’ prison. US intelligence claimed he financed Al Qaeda and was a key aide of Osama Bin Laden, an accusation that he vehemently denied. Despite being cleared for release, US officials are determined that he should be sent to Saudi Arabia, even though there are serious concerns he will face torture there. Mr Aamer’s lawyers allege the intention is to silence their client, who claims to have witnessed abuse in the presence of a British security official. But the Foreign Office welcomed President Obama’s commitment to prioritise Mr Aamer’s case, saying: ‘We will continue to work with the US to secure his release as a matter of urgency.’ The Daily Mail has long campaigned for the closure of the inhumane Guantanamo Bay prison camp. The paper has also championed the release of Mr Aamer. Pressure to explain why the London father had been incarcerated for 13 years without charge or trial ratcheted up in December amid global outrage at a US Senate report into the torture of terror suspects by the CIA. That month, we told how the detainee’s family had broken their silence to insist that if the 48-year-old came home he would have no hesitation in facing a British court to lay to rest grave allegations that he is a dangerous extremist. Then, a day before Christmas, we revealed how David Miliband, when he was Foreign Secretary, had secretly plotted to hand Mr Aamer to the hardline Saudi Arabian authorities while leading his British family to believe he was seeking to bring him back to the UK. Documents obtained by the Mail show the Labour government was involved in negotiations to transfer Mr Aamer from the camp to the Arab kingdom despite fears he would be tortured. In January, leading doctors warned that 13 years in Guantanamo – described as an ‘affront to humanity’ – had destroyed Mr Aamer’s physical and mental health. The Mail also told how he had been beaten 315 times by guards. Mr Aamer was sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002 after being detained in Kabul, Afghanistan while, his representatives claim, he was carrying out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity . 1996 – US-educated Saudi translator Shaker Aamer settles in London, marries Briton Zin Siddique .

"Disgraced: Christopher Wheeler, 54, has been sentenced to 50 years in prison for dealing child pornography (mugshot from 2013) A disgraced former headmaster of a $27,000-a-year prep school has been sentenced to 50 years in prison for dealing child pornography. Christopher Wheeler, 54, who worked at the exclusive Tower Hill school in Delaware, had more than 2,000 images and videos of boys engaging in sex acts with men when police raided his $350,000 mansion in Wilmington in October 2013. One of those showed a naked boy with his head being held by an adult male while performing a sex act. Court documents say Wheeler was running Net Shred - a program designed to eradicate internet history - when authorities knocked on his door. The discovery led to the accomplished composer and pilot being fired from a job he had held for nine years, which had a salary of nearly $3700,000. The investigation stemmed from allegations he had sexually his adopted son, aspiring professional golfer Nikolai, and two other teenagers. Nikolai has however denied the allegations and Wheeler has not faced abuse charges. He was sentenced by Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis on Friday, the same judge who found him guilty of the shocking crimes in December. Wheeler opted for a non-jury trial in September which only last one day. She told the court on Friday Wheeler had 'developed a pattern of Internet browsing for child pornography.' After police searched his school-owned mansion, his private plane and his school office, he tried to flee, but turned himself into authorities less than a month later. According to the Delaware News Journal, he turned down a plea bargain which may have substantially reduced his sentence. Wheeler's attorney, Thomas A. Foley, plans to appeal the sentence, claiming Delaware law requiring two years behind bars on each count is 'obscene and outrageous'. Fall from grace: The former headmaster at the exclusive Tower Hill School in Delaware, who earned nearly $370,000 a year in the position, was arrested after police searched his mansion, school office and private plane in 2013 . He insisted that the court wanted to paint Wheeler as 'Mr Filthy' insisting there is 'no proof he knew' the child images were there. But Davis stated the sheer number of indecent images did not inadvertently end up on his computer. Prosecutor Abigail Layton told the paper after sentencing: 'Think about what is contained in each of those pictures. 'In those pictures, kids are being raped and violated and it is captured on film for the rest of their life, the life of the Internet. Their worst moments are on film.' She added Wheeler had used child porn for his 'own gratification' and 'it was not by mistake, it was by design.' He had previously been assistant head of school and dean of admissions at Lake Forest Academy in Illinois and had held a post at St. Paul's School in Garden City, New York. Property: Police discovered more than 2,000 images of children engaging in sex acts with men during a raid on his school-owned mansion in Wilmington, Delaware (pictured) In the 1970s he was accused of attacking two brothers from a family he had befriended at Westtown Friends School. According to a search warrant seen by the News Journal, the pair decided to bring up the allegations after the child sex abuse case of former Penn State University assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. Wheeler wrote a letter to one of the brothers which, according to court documents, read: 'I did those things. I am the one responsible. 'I will not compound your pain by attempting to deny or in any way deflect responsibility for my actions 35 years ago. I'll wait to hear from you about further appropriate steps towards resolution and restitution.' School administrators said last month they had found no evidence Wheeler had abused any students there. They added that he had been 'thoroughly vetted' before taking the job. Founded in 1919 by Du Pont family members, Tower's Hill's graduates include US Senator Chris Coons, former Governor and Congressman. Mike Castle, DuPont Co. chief executive Ellen Kullman and television personality Dr. Oz. The school, named one of the top 50 in the United States, has around 750 students aged from three to 18.

"A hilarious new video has mocked teenagers taking part in the #kyliejennerchallenge - using a tube of Pringles. In footage posted by Elihudi Justin Urassa, from Brighton, on Facebook that has been watched more than three million times, a young woman can be seen sucking on to the tube before removing it to reveal her new pout... made of crisps. The worrying trend started sweeping social media over the weekend, encouraging teens to blow their lips up to epic proportions using bottles or shot glasses to mirror Kylie Jenner's often voluptuous looking pout. Scroll down for videos . In the video the girl is seen sucking onto the tube of tortilla flavoured chips . The mickey-taking video has already been watching more than 3.7million times on Facebook in just a day. One user commented: 'Now this one is funny.' Whilst many others put a series of laughing face emojis. The company behind the snack said: 'We’re overjoyed that people have found a safer way to ace the Kylie Jenner challenge with Pringles Tortilla lips. 'Whether your lips are naturally plump or you need some assistance from Pringles Tortilla, we’re all about showing off your tasty pout (and eating it afterwards).' In the hilarious video which was posted to Facebook and has been watched over 3.5million times the girl pulls the tube of Pringles away to reveal her new lips . The reportedly painful and dangerous trend involves participants placing their mouth over the opening of a cup, jar or other narrow vessel and sucking in until the air vacuum causes their lips to swell up - all in the hopes of emulating Kylie Jenner's bee-stung pout. Countless teens, both boys and girls, have been sharing the disturbing results of their experiments on Twitter and Instagram, which in many cases has led to severe bruising around the mouth. Surprisingly, given the sheer number of teens attempting the feat, it appears the results are far from desirable. The worrying trend dubbed the '#kyliejennerchallenge' swept social media, encouraging teens to blow their lips up to epic proportions using bottles or shot glasses (pictured) 'I screwed up,' wrote one teenage girl along with her #kyliejennerchallenge selfie, while another complained she looked 'gross'.

Countless teens, both boys and girls, have been sharing the disturbing results of their experiments on Twitter and Instagram . Surprisingly, given the sheer number of teens attempting the feat, it appears the results are far from desirable . The method works by way of the airlock created in the opening of the glass or jar, which increases blood flow to the lips and causes them to swell. Problematically, the results are said to last for hours, even days, with several people complaining that they were stuck with the after-effects for a lot longer than expected. Plenty of Twitter users have been quick to ridicule the craze. 'Stop with that Kylie Jenner challenge it's so gross,' one wrote. 'I hate our generation. It's so dumb. Like you guys are really sticking your lips in small cups,' another ranted. 'Do people not realise they're bursting blood vessels?' another pointed out.

Last month, two Icelandic sisters attempted the trick by sucking into a hairspray lid, and warned others against it after the stunt went disastrously wrong. Yrja Ás Baldvinsdottir, 18, and her sister, Bir­gitta Ás, from Reykjavik, were left with swollen and blue bruised lips. Writing on Facebook, Yrja As said: 'I wanted to warn people against do-it-yourself lip expansion, but was really surprised and shocked that it ended up being something that loads of people were copying. 'I just wanted to try it and see what they would look like, I've never done it before, and I won't be doing it again. It was very, very painful. My lips turned blue.' One boy expertly demonstrates just how extreme the effects can be if you try hard enough . Sore-looking red marks are visible around the lip line of this dejected experimenter . As for Kylie herself, the 17-year-old Kardashian clan member has recently denied artificially enhancing her lips, despite much speculation to the contrary. 'I haven't had plastic surgery,' she told Grazia Daily. 'I've never been under the knife. People flashback to pictures of me when I was 12 and say ""Kylie's so different"" but how can I look the same from 12 -18?' Kylie has reacted to the challenge by taking to Twitter to say: 'I'm not here to try & encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look.' She added: 'I want to encourage people/young girls like me to be YOURSELF & not be afraid to experiment w your look.'

"The owner of five horses rescued from rising flood waters during this week’s storm of a decade in New South Wales has revealed the amazing lengths her brother-in-law went to over six terrifying hours to save her horses. Steve Spowart dived down into the freezing cold water to cut the barbed wire and free the horses that had become tangled in fences amidst the floods. The animals’ owner, Sonia Sharrock, praised her ‘absolutely amazing’ brother-in-law, for his incredible feat, saying ‘I don’t know what I would have done without him and my sister’. ‘Steve was cutting the wire, he had to dive right down into the deep water to cut it. It was really difficult and absolutely freezing,’ Ms Sharrock told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Sharrock watched in horror as her stud farm in Woodberry, in Maitland in the Hunter Region of New South Wales - one of the worst affected areas by the storm – rapidly flooded. Scroll down for video . Stud farm owner Sonia Sharrock (right) looked relieved as she managed to save her horses from the NSW floods thanks to help from her brother-in-law Steve Spowart (left) and his surfboard . Steve Spowart paddled out to where the horses were stranded, with concentration etched on his face, before diving down into the freezing water to cut the barbed wire they were trapped in . The brown horse reared up after becoming caught in barbed wire, splashing and throwing Steve back into the storm water . On Tuesday morning the horses were just ankle deep in water ‘but by 1pm it was up to their chest,’ Ms Sharrock said. ‘I was really stressed out and panicking that the water was coming up really fast and I was worried we were going to get caught up,’ she said. In the incredible photos taken of the recue, Mr Spowart – a keen surfer – is seen paddling out into the deep storm water on his surfboard to free the horses. The moving images show the concentration on his face as he moves towards the animals and his concern as he struggles to lead them out of the deep murky water. Steve Spowart spent five hours helping to rescue the horses from the farm in Maitland, NSW . His tough journey to save the animals was captured as he paddled past submerged trees and bushes . In one photo, a startled brown horse attempts to flee as Mr Spowart is kicked backwards into the water. Ms Sharrock, in a green jacket, is seen trying to calm the animal to coax it to follow them without any head collars or leads. ‘The brown horse was my neighbours and he had got caught in barbed wire as he was trying to swim down to get to my horses,’ Ms Sharrock explained. Her horses live just 500m from her house, which is located on a hill, but it took six hours to bring them - and a cow - up to safety in her garden. ‘The surfboard was his idea; he wanted to do that to get in. The problem was the water covered the fences and the horses couldn’t see it so we had to cut them all back to get them out,’ Ms Sharrock said. The brown horse stood off against the two rescuers, Sonia Sharrock and Mr Spowart, in fear of the terrifying floods . The man was helped by Ms Sharrock and her sister as he led two white and one chestnut horse out of the deep water . Barefooted, Steve looked more relieved as he held on tightly to one horse's lead after emerging from the water . Ms Sharrock, in a green coat, talks to a chestnut horse as it follows her to safety out of the storm water . Unlike Mr Spowart who was wearing a wetsuit, Ms Sharrock was a little less prepared and had just ankle length gum boots on her feet after suffering blisters from her full length boots the day before. ‘We didn’t realise it was going to be as big as it was, it took us by surprise. Normally the horses go on the mound and they are fine but this time we realised we’ve got to move them again,’ she added. The flood water is now finally receding but it will be a few weeks before the horses can return to the fields. ‘It’s turned into a big mud pit,’ Ms Sharrock explained. ‘I’m really grateful to my brother-in-law and sister in helping out, I wouldn’t have done it without them. ‘The local community has been brilliant too, we had a guy from a pet produce store ask if he could donate food to us. Everyone has been so good.’ The white horse stands tall amidst the stormy skies in Maitland, an area that has been hit especially hard by the storm . 'The surfboard was his idea; he wanted to do that to get in,' Ms Sharrock said . The incredible moment Mr Spowart walked out of the water as the rain continued to fall during the storm was photographed .","Sonia Sharrock's stud farm near Maitland, in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, was badly flooded .

"A playground in Tokyo has been found to have dangerously high levels of radiation, which has raised fears for the health of children in the area. Soil underneath a slide at the park in the Toshima ward in the north-east of the Japanese capital, showed radiation readings of up to 480 microsieverts per hour. This is nearly half the recommended annual limit of exposure for a person. Danger: Japanese authorities detected an unusually high level of radiation around playground equipment in this Tokyo park (pictured) Safety: Authorities cordoned off the park after high levels of radiation were detected underneath a slide . It was not immediately clear why radiation levels were so high in the park, which opened two years after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Authorities believe that the radiation could be coming from something buried underneath the park. The playground has now been fenced off with an orange barricade. Park representative Kyoko Tsujimura said: 'We are still checking what caused these elevated radiation levels and what type of radioactive substance it is.' The city has set up a health advice office to answer queries from concerned parents. According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommendations, members of the public should not be exposed to more than 1000 microsieverts per year. Japan has seen heightened concern over radiation since the 2011 failure of a nuclear plant in Fukushima following an earthquake and tsunami, which led to leaks of radioactive water. In the months after the nuclear meltdowns, concerned parents and citizens began measuring radiation levels in Tokyo schools and parks. Thousands of people are still living in temporary shelters and have been unable to return home in areas closest to Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear plant. Elsewhere, a drone with a small amount of radiation was found on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office building this week. Clean up: Workers carry away a container after extremely high levels of radiation were detected in the park . Tests: Following two rounds of testing, officials found high levels of radiation on a section of the equipment .","Soil underneath a slide in the park showed extremely high radiation levels .

"The legal wife of Lyle Jeffs - brother of Warren Jeffs and current leader of the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - has officially filed for divorce from her husband in Utah, citing rape and illegal practices within the Mormon sect. Charlene Wall Jeffs, 58, had 10 children with her husband and the two have been married for 31 years, but she claims the church has 'become even more disturbing than it was under Warren'. Lyle Jeffs has multiple wives within the sect - nine, according to reports - but Mrs Jeffs is legally married to him and has been since 1983. She claims to have been excommunicated in September 2014, and is now fighting to have her two youngest children, who still live with Mr Jeffs, returned to her. Scroll down for video . Leader: Lyle Jeffs stepped up to head the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints when brother, Warren Jeffs, was sentenced to prison in 2007. His wife Charlene Jeffs has now filed for divorce . Lyle Jeffs is seen here leaving the federal courthouse in Salt Lake City in January 2015 with his other brother, Nephi Jeffs. The brothers of polygamous sect leader Warren Jeffs refused to answer questions about suspected child labor violations on a Utah pecan farm . 'Disturbing': Lyle Jess' legal wife, Charlene Jeffs, says the church has become worse under his control . 'Under Lyle's reign as substitute Prophet, the FLDS Church as become even more disturbing than it was under Warren,' Mrs Jeffs says in a petition filed earlier this month and was obtained by The Salt Lake Tribune. 'Of Lyle's multiple wives, I was never the favorite because I have a mind of my own. 'Lyle sent me away from the family to repent for the first time in November 2002 because ''I did not know how to properly treat the Priesthood in my life''.' FLDS leaders are referred to as 'the Priesthood'. Mrs Jeffs said she was only allowed to cook and clean during her expulsion and was not allowed to see her children. 'In the FLDS Church, children belong to the Priesthood and can be transferred to different mothers or different parents all together upon an order from the Priesthood,' she said in the petition. Mrs Jeffs was 'repenting' for two years, but when she was allowed to return to her husband's compound in Hilldale, her children were not returned to her. The children were split up among Jeff's 'spiritual wives'. Previous reports claimed that Charlene Jeffs was the first of nine wives. Mrs Jeffs said she was ordered to leave the compound on September 27 last year for being 'unrighteous'. She is now trying to get the two children - a 17-year-old boy and 14-year-old girl - to come and live with her. Compound: While the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has compounds all over the country, it is based in Utah, and the Jeffs live at a compound in Hilldale (picture). Mrs Jeffs says she was forced to leave Hillale last year for being 'unrighteous' In the petition she says she is scared for her well-being and her children, who could be 'The Jeffs family is the FLDS equivalent of the British Royal Family and they have their own FLDS ''secret service'' to protect them from the outside world,"" Mrs Jeffs wrote in her petition. She added that Mr Jeffs isn't aware she has no plans to return to the FLDS, and is scared of what he will do with the children when he finds out she speaking out against the church. 'If Lyle had any idea that I have gone ''apostate'', he would make my children ,' she said in the petition. However the most startling of the allegations in the documents spoke of rape, which Mrs Jeffs claims is common practice. She said a doctrine was enforced in recent years that said women had to be impregnated not by their husbands, but a 'seed bearer' - a group of men selected by the church. The husbands were to hold their wives hands as the seed bearers had sex with the women. 'In layman terms, the husband is required to sit in the room while the chosen seed bearer, or a couple of them, rape his wife or wives,' Mrs Jeffs said in the petition, according to The Tribune. Another practice, known as the 'Law of Sara', has FLDS women perform sex acts on each otther in preparation for a sexual encounter with a member of the Priesthood. Mrs Jeffs said she is worried her daughter will be subjected to such a practice. Polygamist: FDLS leader Warren Jeffs was sentenced to life in prison for child sex abuse. He is pictured here during his trial in 2007 . Warren Jeffs, 59, was convicted in Utah in 2007 of two counts of first-degree felony rape for his role in the 2001 wedding of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin. The convictions were reversed on the basis of erroneous jury instructions. Separately, Jeffs received a life sentence plus 20 years in Texas for sexually assaulting two girls he claimed were his 'spiritual wives'. He is said to still head the polygamous sect from prison. However the leaders in practice are believed to be Lyle Jeffs and some other bishops, even though the church have never announced the appointments.","Charlene Wall Jeffs, 58, is one of a reported nine wives of Lyle Jeffs .

"A 12-year-old girl battling Leukemia for two years has been kicked out of school for her lack of attendance. 'I didn't do anything wrong, but they still got rid of me,' Rose McGrath of battle Creek, Michigan said tearfully. Last week St. Joseph's Middle School, a private Catholic School, sent a letter to Rose McGrath and her dismissing her from the school for low attendance and poor academic performance. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: 'I didn't do anything wrong, but they still got rid of me,' Rose McGrath of battle Creek, Michigan said tearfully of her school kicking her out for poor attendance because of her Leukemia . Dismissed: John Fleckenstein, with Battle Creek Area Catholic Schools, claims that the school made many accommodations for Rose and that none of them seemed to help her enough . Rose's mother Barbara McGrath was just as heartbroken to hear the news and said even though her daughter is no longer getting cancer treatment, that her recovery will take some time. 'Even though she's now done with her treatments you still have a very long recovery process because you've basically just put two and a half years of poison into your body. You're not recovering overnight,' said Rose's mother, Barbara McGrath. Rose has been attending the Battle Creek Catholic Schools her whole entire life and when she was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukemia her world was turned upside down. Rose told WWMT that school was the one place that she actually felt normal. 'When I'm at home, I'm sick, I don't feel well; no one else does that. But when I'm at school I'm like everyone else,' Rose said. A struggle: Rose was diagnosed with leukemia in 2012 and though she is done with her treatment she still feels ill and has trouble attending her classes and finishing her schoolwork . Not having fun: Rose's mother says her daughter isn't skipping out of school 'to have fun' but that she . Long battle: Rose's mother Barbara (right) stands beside her daughter Rose she continues to heal from her debilitating disease . St. Joseph's catholic school that charges as much as $6,983 per year said that they were generous enough to provide Rose with special accommodations because of her illness. It is unclear as to whether Rose was receiving financial assistance and they did not elaborate on what kinds of accommodations were made. 'These were extraordinary circumstances, but so many accommodations were made we felt eventually it became a point where we really had to help Rose, by being able to make sure that she was getting the assistance that she needed and to learn,' said Father John Fleckenstein, with Battle Creek Area Catholic Schools. The school says that Rose only attended school 32 days out of this entire school year. Rose McGrath's parents feel as though the school is seriously failing their child. 'The accommodations which were made were woefully inadequate for a child with such a serious diagnosis,' said Rose's father Tom McGrath to WWMT. 'It's not like she's out at the mall having fun, she's in her bed, sick with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. She’s not having fun, she's sick. She’d be at school if she could,' Barbara said. The McGrath's say that they filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights and that they are waiting for a response. Trying to help others: Rose raising money for St. Baldrcks to find a cure for childhood cancer . Support: Rose has plenty of support from family and friends but she will need to figure out where she will go to school if she is not allowed back at St. Josephs .","'I didn't do anything wrong, but they still got rid of me,' Rose McGrath, 12, of battle Creek, Michigan said tearfully of her dismissal .

"Smoking, pregnant, covered in dirt and down-and-out - it's not how we pictured a superhero. But that's exactly how they have been imagined in this amusing photo series that reveals how the good guys could end up after their life fighting crime comes to an end. Photographer Martin Beck has snapped Captain America, Iron Man and the Green Lantern taking a step back from fighting crime and portrays how they are instead focusing on the struggles of getting through the week. Scroll down for video . Not too bothered about the Joker these days, the Bat family have a little one on the way (Omar as Batman and Dina as Batwoman) Clinging onto their costumes, Iron Man tucks into chips while Superwoman relaxes with a cuppa (Ahmed as IronMan, Teresa, Superwoman) Some indulge in unhealthy fast-food, others suck on cigarettes while the rest get bogged down in household chores or everyday life in a future that looks bleak for Marvel and DC comics stars. The Dubai-based artist of Scottish and South African heritage  has produced the series of gritty portraits laced with melancholy humour in his latest project called We Can Be Heroes. His subjects look like they can't get over the fact they've had to retire, or like they never quite passed at superhero school. And now, just like many of us, their daily lives are ruled by 'simple' struggles; chores,  providing for their loved ones, and even battling the bulge, all while fighting for their ego and trying to retain some of that hero gloss. Beck says there is a very important message to his work. Superwoman Teresa naps next to past-it Superman, Ghalib, on a dodgy, dated sofa . The moody portraiture of an ironing, cigarette-smoking Superman echoes the troubled writer Charles Bukowski . Spiderman Dan and Spiderwoman Kristina have inked up since their crime-fighting days . The Green Lantern, posed by Mohammed, grooms his locks, while Captain America looks out into the distance at a cafe . 'When we think of superheroes, we think of perfect bodies and beautiful faces, achieving unbelievable feats. These are people we idealise as characters that can do no wrong and only seem to exist in our daydreams,' explains his work's official description. 'This project tries to humanise superheroes. Despite our flaws and failures, each of us, in our own way, can be heroes to our family, our friends, our colleagues and we all have the potential to help others.' Martin's heroes are regular people not restricted by race, religion or beliefs. They live among us, they surround us, and they are everywhere. Everyone is a superhero. Known for his unique post-shooting treatments, Martin effortlessly turns photography into art. With diverse shooting styles, his personal love for art, design and music keep Martin in touch with the world of popular culture.

"Paul Gregory, 51, of Bedford, has been fined £795 for having a blue badge, claiming he could only walk 200 metres, when in fact he was a keen walker . A disability badge holder who claimed he could only walk 200 metres ended up in court after council officials noticed a newspaper report recounting his exploits on a 191-mile hike. When Paul Gregory, 51, applied to renew his blue badge, he claimed exercise left him breathless, despite being a keen walker and member of a mountaineering club. He was exposed when Bedford Borough Council staff read an article in The Westmorland Gazette,  describing how the 'experienced walker' had been attacked by cows in Cumbria on the third day of a hike in 2012. The article, which featured a picture of him dressed in walking gear, told how he was knocked over by four cows in a field at the edge of Shap in Cumbria. The council also found he had spent a weekend walking in Wales days before making a blue badge application. Gregory, of Bedford, pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly obtaining a blue badge by misrepresenting his physical abilities at Luton Magistrates' Court. He was fined £795, ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and pay a £60 victim surcharge. He was also subject to a one year supervision order and told to undergo 19 sessions of 'thinking skills'. A Bedford Borough Council spokesman said it was one of the 'most outrageous cases' of blue badge fraud it had investigated. He said: 'He was taking part in national walking trips that many able-bodied adults would find difficult. 'Mr Gregory's abuse of the scheme is completely unacceptable and we will continue to investigate all reports of blue badge fraud thoroughly.'

"Bruce Jenner has confirmed he started a gender transition process in the mid-1980s but stopped after he met and fell in love with Kris Kardashian, who became his third wife. The 65-year-old told Diane Sawyer he embarked on hormone therapy and electrolysis, and had plastic surgery to make his features look more feminine, shortly after winning the Olympic gold. However, he says, he stopped out of 'fear' of publicity and shame, and kept his secret to himself until he couldn't bear it any longer. Scroll down for video . Early signs?  Bruce Jenner has revealed he started having hormone therapy and plastic surgery in the mid to late 1980s to make himself look more feminine. He's shown here in September 1987 . Before the changes: Bruce, seen here on set, still had his athletic physique and heavy set masculine features when he appeared in the 1980 film Can't Stop The Music. These were noticeably gone by the end of the decade . Bruce said he was exploring the idea of gender reassignment surgery with doctors in Denmark but had a change of heart after meeting Kris, the ex-wife of famed LA attorney Robert Kardashian. On Friday night, he publicly addressed about his personal journey and his transition to living as a woman in a two-hour ABC special tonight with Diane Sawyer. As the romance between Bruce and Kris blossomed in late 1990 and early 1991, the former star athlete  halted hormone therapy and underwent breast reduction surgery. The couple married months after meeting on April 21, 1991, and went on to have two children together - Kendall, now 19, and Kylie, 17, - before divorcing in December last year. Change of heart: Bruce halted his gender transition after meeting Kris Kardashian in late 1990. He stopped hormone injections and even underwent breast reduction surgery before the couple married.  He's seen here with Kris in February 1993 . Family man:  Bruce and Kris tied the knot in April 1991 just months after meeting. Seen here in 2000 with their daughters Kendall and Kylie, the couple were married for 22 years. Bruce found fame again with a whole new generation thanks to the reality series about their blended family Keeping Up With The Kardashians . A source quoted by Entertainment Tonight says that Bruce was greatly influenced by the life story of transgender tennis player Renee Richards. Richards, born a boy Richard Raskind in 1934, underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1975. In 1976, she launched a legal challenge after the US Tennis Association denied her permission to compete as a woman in the U.S. Open because she had not been born a woman and in 1977 the New York Supreme Court ruled in her favor in a landmark decision for transsexual rights. It's believed that her autobiography Second Serve, published in 1983, had a significant influence on Bruce. In 1986, the book was made into a TV movie starring Vanessa Redgrave who received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Inspiration: Transgender tennis player Renee Richards won the right to complete as a woman in the 1977 U.S. Open after winning a landmark legal battle. Richards was born a boy in 1934 . Textbook transition: It's suggested that Bruce was greatly influenced by Richards' life story as outlined in her 1983 autobiography Second Serve. The Kardashian-Jenner patriarch and reality TV star addressed his gender journey during the two-hour prime time special airing tonight on ABC. He says: 'I wanna know how this story ends, you know? How does my story end?' In a message of support, TV's Dr. Phil told ET on Thursday that he's happy for the Olympian. 'This is his body and his life, and he needs to do what he wants to do,' said Dr. Phil. 'It drains your spirit if you can't be yourself. He is freeing himself.' The interview was conducted before Jenner was involved in an auto accident in which another motorist was killed. Nervous: Bruce Jenner is seen greeting Diane Sawyer at his home in the latest promo video released Thursday ahead of the airing of his sit-down interview in which he is expected to address his gender transition . Resolute: The former decathlete tells the journalist that it is 'going to be an emotional rollercoaster but somehow I'm gonna get through it' Looking to the future: The clip released Thursday concluded with Bruce asking, 'how does my story end?' Tight lid: ABC has only released snippets with non-specific quotes from Bruce, paving the way for his story to air in full tonight . Moral support: The 65-year-old father-of-six appears alongside his four oldest children  Burt, 36, Casey, 34, Brandon, 33, and Brody, 31; the latest clip reused this previously aired footage from another promo . Not appearing in the interview: Kim, 34, Khloe, 30, and Kourtney Kardashian, 36, as well as Kendall, 19, and Kylie Jenner, 17, are not scheduled to talk during the interview .","Bruce started hormone therapy and had plastic surgery to look more feminine in the late 1980s .

"Birmingham Airport could soon be known as 'Shakespeare's Airport' in the U.S. in order to attract more visitors, tourism chiefs have announced. The concept was put forward after proving a success in attracting more people from China, but there are concerns that not enough Americans will know of the famous playwright. The airport could also be called 'Birmingham London' as the HS2 rail link will make the hub just 38 minutes from the centre of the capital - only ten minutes further away than Terminal 5 at Heathrow. Birmingham Airport could be rebranded 'Shakespeare's Airport' in the U.S. to attract more tourists, but there are concerns that not enough Americans will know who the playwright is . Chief executive Paul Kehoe said: 'The reason we used Shakespeare for the Chinese is there is a lot of interest there. 'When the Chinese Premier came here, he wanted to see the RSC and he said to us through an interpreter that Shakespeare was very big in China and we should make the most of it. 'We are still debating it. Personally, I think Shakespeare is still right for America. 'The average person in Chattanooga may not enjoy much Shakespeare but the sophisticates on the east and west coast do.' A similar rebranding in China has attracted thousands of tourists to Birmingham by advertising its proximity to Shakespeare's place of birth . Birmingham Airport announced in March it would be re-branding in China as it revealed a run of flights to Beijing. Hainan Airlines is to operate two flights a week between July 3 and August 28, expected to pave the way for a regular service. The flights are set to carry almost 4,000 Chinese tourists to the UK and follow a trial last year saw three flights between the cities. Mr Kehoe said there was competition in the Far East for the flights and was hopeful it could lead to scheduled operations directly from the city to China. Meanwhile, he said hopes of using Shakespeare to promote the region in the US were long-held. He adde: 'People tell me nobody has heard of Shakespeare in America but I don't believe that. 'When I started in 2008, I said ""How do we get to the chocolate-eating, 4x4 driving Shakespeare-loving people of Idaho?"" 'We have Cadbury, Shakespeare and Land Rover here, so there is no shortage of options.' Meanwhile, Mr Kehoe said the HS2 station near the airport would be so convenient for the capital it would rival the likes of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. He said this could raise questions over whether 'London' should be added to the airport's name. Mr Kehoe accepted the capital was always going to be a major draw for tourists but added: 'The day HS2 opens, this airport effectively moves 70 miles closer to London. 'My successor will have to ask themselves: ""What do we call this airport now?"" We will only be 10 minutes further than terminal five. Does that make it a London airport?'","Airport bosses say re-branding in China has already brought more tourists .

"Long before mobile phones came along - allowing single men and women to flirt behind the comfort of a glowing screen - shy love-seekers had to resort to other tactics. In the case of late 19th-century America, it was the 'escort card' - not to be confused with the explicit sort you might imagine today - but rather a comical printed card men would hand to women they found attractive. Collector Alan Mays has unearthed a treasure trove of these vintage ice-breakers, which bear phrases such as: 'May I be permitted the blissful pleasure of escorting you home this evening?' Scroll down for video . Long before mobile phones came along - allowing single men and women to flirt behind the comfort of a glowing screen - shy love-seekers of the late 19th Century had to resort to other tactics (pictured) These comical printed cards were handed out by men  to women they found attractive . According to The Encyclopedia of Ephemera, there were two types of cards used in the 1870s and 1880s. One was referred to as the 'calling card' and would be used by gentleman to formally introduce themselves to new acquaintances - much like the modern business card. The second, as seen in Mr Mays' collection, was a novelty variety reserved for more casual encounters, namely men seeking the company of women, known as an 'escort card'. 'The device commonly carried a brief message and a simple illustration,' the encyclopaedia states. 'Flirtatious and fun, the acquaintance card brought levity to what otherwise might have seemed a more formal proposal. 'A common means of introduction, it was never taken too seriously.' MessyNessyChic uncovered the collection, calling them an array of 'amusing pick-up lines you’ve not likely heard before while waiting for your drink at the bar'. Rhyming couplets appeared to have been rather popular  in the 19th century according to these cards . The card commonly carried a brief message and a simple illustration . Some were quite specific in their nature - albeit in a very polite way . Many of them have all the flowery but insincere charm of a cheesy modern-day pick-up line. 'Dear Miss: You are sensible and good, you have all the charms of womanhood, your eyes resemble the stars above you, I shall be miserable if I can't love you,' reads one. 'May I see you home? Or will I have to set on the fence and watch you meander by?' reads another. Some were a little more down-to-business. 'I very much desire to make your acquaintance. If agreeable, please return this card, appointing time and place for interview, on the other side,' reads one. Another even blunter card bears the question: 'I am _ who the devil are you?' Several of the cards bear phrases such as: 'May I have the pleasure of seeing you home this evening? If so, keep this card; if not, please return.' Practical, if nothing else. Certain cards were short and to-the-point - including this 'may I. C. U. Home?' card . These 'escort cards' were seen as a more casual version of what we today regard as business cards . This blank card poses, 'Who the devil are you?' This man's intent is made crystal clear by its very title . Many of the cards have all the flowery but insincere charm of a cheesy modern-day pick-up line . 'Two souls with but a single thought; two hearts that beat as one', reads this one . This card addresses its recipient as a 'dear creature' Many carried the disclaimer, 'If so, keep this card, if not, please return it'","The cheeky cards were given by men to women in 19th century America .
Some were romantic in tone, others more blunt - but they were always very polite .

"The families of four Minnesota men charged with trying to join the Islamic State have accused the FBI of paying an informant to set them up. The suspects, all of Somali descent, were detained after months of being monitored by the government agency through one of their former allies. On Thursday, there were audible gasps in the court room as a government official revealed the informant, who once planned to travel to Syria himself, has been paid at least $13,000 for providing tip-offs. The suspects' families screamed from the packed public gallery as their lawyers questioned the reliability of the mole. However, U.S. Magistrate Judge Becky Thorson maintained there was probable cause to believe a crime was committed, and ordered the four men to remain in custody while the case proceeds. 'They came here for peace': Halima Yusuf, a friend of the family of one of the suspects Hanad Mustafe Musse,  cries for the boys outside the United States Courthouse in St Paul, Minnesota . Charged: Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19, (left) and Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19, (right) are among six Minnesota men of Somali descent that have been charged with traveling or attempting to travel to Syria to join ISIS . Families of the boys, including 19-year-old Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman (pictured) claim they came to the country for peace and they were set up by their former friend, insisting he devised much of the alleged plot . They are among six men of Somali descent who were charged over the weekend with conspiracy to support a foreign terrorist organization and with attempting to support a foreign terrorist organization. Authorities allege some of the men made repeated attempts to get to Syria, and had developed a plot to get fake passports and travel overseas through Mexico. Slamming the allegations, local imam Hassan Mohamud told CBS: 'The majority of the community was expecting those young people would be released because they did not show any threat to the public safety while they were here.' Weeping, the grandmother of two of the suspects - who are brothers - told the station: 'We ran away from Somalia's problems. We come here and again we get a problem. We need peace.' According to an FBI affidavit, the government's months-long investigation was aided by recordings made by a man who once planned to travel to Syria himself, but then decided to cooperate. More than 200 people tried to get into the court room for Thursday's hearing which escalated into shouts . Emotional: Mohamed Jama, 19, (left) and Abdirahman Shiekh, 19, (right) - both friends of the suspects - wept outside court after hearing that the boys would all remain on jail suspected of trying to join the Islamic State . More than 200 people tried to get into the court room for Thursday's hearing, which was for Guled Omar, 20; Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19; Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; and Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19. Two other men, Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, 21, and Abdurahman Daud, 21, faced hearings in San Diego, where they were arrested. Daud's mother, Farhiyo Mohamed, told the Wall Street Journal: 'My son is a good kid.' She explains they moved over to the U.S. from Somalia in 2003, adding: 'We came to this country for peace.' In ordering the four men detained, Thorson said she was looking at the weight of the evidence and other factors. Her ruling prompted one community member in the courtroom to shout: 'You cannot weight anything but evidence, ma'am. We are the community! You should ask us!' He was led from the courtroom. The hearing was tense for Somali community members. Afterward, Imam Hassan Mohamud said the community is angry, and some blame the informant. He criticized a Department of Justice pilot program designed to stop recruiting for terror groups before it starts, saying it will cause division. 'Some members of the community are looking @ other members of the community (as) spying to each other and sending them, their kids, to jail,' Mohamud said. 'That's why they are all angry. These four, all of them, are innocent until proven guilty.' The U.S. attorney's office said the pilot program is an outreach effort that 'is and always has been completely separate from the investigative and prosecutorial responsibilities of this office.' Members of Minnesota's Somali community cover their faces as they arrive at the St Paul court on Thursday . Tensions were high among the community in the court as defense attorneys also questioned how the FBI could take the informant's word when he previously lied about his own involvement . In court, defense attorneys questioned FBI Special Agent Harry Samit about the government's payments to the informant. Musse's attorney, Andy Birrell, asked whether his compensation was related to the number of people charged. Defense attorneys also questioned how the FBI could take the informant's word when he previously lied about his own involvement. They also asked why only some of his conversations were recorded, and whether it was the informant's idea to pursue fake passports to get to Syria. Samit testified the informant was paid nearly $13,000 for expenses and 'services' and the amount wasn't related to the number of people charged. Samit said the informant was being asked to gather evidence against people involved in 'the most violent terrorist group in the world.' 'He's exposing himself to a certain element of danger,' Samit said. Samit also said the investigation was broader than just the informant's evidence, and agents verified some details through their own surveillance. As for why not all conversations were recorded, Samit said some early conversations happened before the informant was given recording equipment. He also said some conversations weren't recorded because of equipment failure or poor sound quality. The fake passports were initially Abdurahman's idea, Samit testified, but when that fell through, the FBI suggested the informant come up with his own way to get fake passports. Support: Hordes of people flocked through the doors including friends, families and local imams . High security: Agents were seen patrolling the area with sniffer dogs during the controversial proceedings . When Assistant U.S. Attorney John Docherty asked Samit how the defendants responded to that idea, Samit said: 'Very enthusiastically.' Monday's announcement of charges threw Minnesota's Somali community, the largest in the U.S., into familiar turmoil. Since 2007, more than 22 young Somali men have traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to join the militant group al-Shabab. Authorities have also said a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to fight with militants in the past year. About 200 people from the Somali community packed the courtroom Thursday, plus an overflow room and spilled into the hallway. As the hearing began, Docherty told the court that several attempts had been made to contact the informant or members of his family, and there had been 'ugly behavior' on social media. Docherty warned that such activities could lead to prosecution. Omar Jamal, a longtime activist, said the community has a hard time accepting that a Somali informant was involved, but he said local Somalis shouldn't create an adversarial situation. He said it was good the government stopped young men from potentially joining a terrorist group, then added: 'but that doesn't mean we can't ask the government questions.' Samit testified that the informant has been relocated at FBI expense, but isn't in custody or under constant watch. He also said the government has made no promises that the informant would not be prosecuted in the future.","FBI revealed it has paid $13,000 to a man who once tried to flee to Syria but was caught and agreed to cooperate .

"An obscure agreement struck by state governments in 1993 means the vast majority of Australians will not get a day off this Anzac weekend. Under the pact, no public holiday is triggered when Anzac Day falls on a Saturday, as it does this year. The agreement was designed to provide uniformity of public holidays across the nation. That makes Anzac Day the exception when it comes to public holidays. If Easter, Christmas, Australia Day, the Queen's Birthday or Labour Day fall on a weekend, a holiday is granted on a weekday. Scroll down for video . Bosses in some states have been warned to expect a rise in employees calling in sick this Monday due to the lack of an Anzac Day public holiday . But the rules do not apply to everyone, it seems. Western Australia and some public servants in Canberra have decided to go it alone and will get Monday off. The head of the Immgration Department declared Monday a public holiday for 8,500 staff, but other departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and Defence will have to turn up to work. For the rest of the country, it's back to work on Monday. The decision not to grant the holiday has been condemned by some groups and human resources expert Paul Dundon warned there would be a big jump in employees calling in sick because they feel 'entitled' to the day off, reports Courier Mail. 'Employees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off, Australians have an entitlement mentality,' said Mr Dundon, the boss of Direct Health Solutions. 'They're missing out and people want their fair share.' Mr Dundon said bosses should expect a 20 per cent-25 per cent rise in absenteeism on Monday 27. In turn, some businesses have notified staff that if they they fake a sick day, they risk losing their job. In Queensland alone, losses to businesses are estimated at more than $7.5 million if an expected 20,000 workers call in sick. The anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli has fallen on a Saturday this year, meaning all states but WA will miss out on holiday on Monday . Australian state governments came together for a Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1993 to try and make public holidays consistent across the nation. The reason was to avoid 'costs and disruption for business' that occurred when every state had different laws. The states agreed that when Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day fell on a weekend, a public holiday the next working day would be triggered. It was decided that a public holiday for Anzac Day would only be triggered if it fell on a Monday . Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Easter Monday would continue to be observed on the days set according to tradition across the nation. In NSW, the Greens called on Premier Mike Baird to give workers Monday off, claiming the government has the power to grant an additional holiday under the Public Holidays Act. But NSW Business Chamber chief officer Stephen Cartwright told The Sydney Morning Herald there is no need for another holiday. 'Anzac Day is a very special day for Australians as it commemorates the landings at Gallipoli on April 25, 1915, and we rightly pause and take time to reflect on that day, whatever day of the week it happens to fall on each year,' he said. Punters playing traditional Australian Anzac Day gambling game two-up: NSW Business Chamber officer Stephen Cartwright said there is no need for an additional holiday on for Anzac Day . The last time Anzac Day fell on a Saturday was 2009, and before that in 1987, 1992 and 1998. A survey released last year by Direct Health Solutions found Australian employees took on average of 10 sick days per year. It estimated that Australia experiences an annual cost of $33 billion in lost productivity from sick days.","There is no Anzac Day holiday for most states as it falls on a Saturday .
Only Western Australia and some Canberra bureaucrats will get day off .

"It took a team of firefighters, police and engineers, but a house on Sydney's Northern Beaches tragically damaged in the this week's destructive storm in NSW has finally been demolished. The Narrabeen property began sliding down the hill it was built on after it was battered by the wild weather on Tuesday, endangering neighbouring houses and forcing locals to evacuate. 'I was thinking, god how is this thing not falling?' Fire and Rescue Superintendent Kel McNamara told The Brisbane Times. A house in Narrabeen has been demolished after it was damaged during this week's storm in Sydney . A tree stump on the hill prevented the house from falling further down, but authorities feared it was only a matter of time before it caused further damage to surrounding properties. A group of highly trained firefighters, police and engineers undertook the difficult task. 'We had to get it down,' Superintendent McNamara said. The demolition methods were slightly unusual, and Sup McNamara, a firefighter of 30 years, said they worked well, though he had never seen anything like it. A group of highly trained firefighters, police and engineers undertook the difficult task of pulling it down . A cherry picker was brought in to harness the house's weight, and pressurised fire hoses pushed it further down the hill as a thick cable was used control the direction it fell .

A cherry picker was brought in to harness the house's weight, and pressurised fire hoses pushed it further down the hill as a thick cable was used control the direction it fell. 'We did it in the safest possible measure and at the end of the day the best result,' Sup McNamara said. A firetruck had been brought in to dampen the house and the surrounding area as the property contained asbestos, which needs to be wet in order to prevent the toxic material becoming airborne. Locals celebrated the demolishing, clapping and cheering as their own properties were spared from the ticking time bomb. The consequences of the wild weather which battered the state's coast is still being felt by many families. The SES has had over 11,000 calls for assistance across the state, and insurance companies have received more than 19,500 claims, with losses estimated at $129 million, The Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) said. A firetruck had been brought in to dampen the house and the surrounding area as the property contained asbestos, which needs to be wet in order to prevent the toxic material becoming airborne . Locals celebrated the demolishing, clapping and cheering as their own properties were spared from the ticking time bomb . But this figure is expected to climb, with comparable weather disasters in recent years resulting in damage costing in excess of $1 billion. ICA spokesman Campbell Fuller said it was impossible to estimate the level of destruction, with floods still impacting on properties across the state. ‘There are still hundreds of thousands of people without power and I can tell you they’re not lodging insurance claims… Claims will keep flowing through for weeks to months,’ Mr Fuller said. Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier, Gareth Ward, predicted the clean-up operation would take a long time. 'The damage has been so enormous over a large footprint of an area, it may take weeks or it may take months for some of the really severe damage,' he said.

Fire and Rescue Superintendent Kel McNamara said . NSW Premier Mike Baird said the hardest hit areas of New South Wales - including in Maitland, Dungog and other areas on the Central Coast - will be declared natural disaster zones following three days of wild and destructive weather. Approximately 2000 people are still stranded by the storm's effects, especially in Gillieston Heights and Hinton. The death toll of the super storm reached eight at it's end, with police confirming an 86-year-old woman's body has been discovered in the hull of a submerged car in Maitland while searching for two elderly women feared dead. Four others were killed on the state's drenched roads on Wednesday, with two drivers killed in a head-on collision on the New England Highway near Singleton, a man died after his ute collided with a truck at Galston, and an 87-year-old pedestrian was fatally hit by a car in East Gosford. This comes after three elderly people died due to floodwaters on Tuesday in Dungog. The woman and two men reportedly died in their homes as water surged through the small town after it received more than 300mm of rain  in 24 hours.

"North Korea may already have 20 nuclear warheads - double as many as previously thought, Chinese nuclear experts have warned. The pariah state may also have the capability to produce enough weapons-grade uranium to double its arsenal by next year, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Chinese estimates of Pyongyang's nuclear production, relayed to US nuclear specialists, exceed most previous US forecasts of between 10 to 16 bombs, said the report, which cited people briefed on the matter. Scroll down for video . A North Korean vehicle carrying a missile passes by during a mass military parade in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square. The pariah state may have as many as 20 nuclear warheads, it has now been suggested . North Korean leader Kim Jong Un addresses Korean People's Army pilots in an undated photo released by the state news agency earlier this month. Under the Kim dynasty North Korea has long used nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in international relations . Experts at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies earlier this year presented three scenarios for North Korea's nuclear capability, predicting its stockpile of weapons could grow to 50 or even 100 within five years. North Korea has conducted three nuclear detonations, the most recent in February 2013. Asked about the report at a regular press briefing yesterday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said he 'did not have knowledge of the specific situation'. 'We must persevere with denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula, persevere in safeguarding peace and stability, and persevere in resolving the relevant issue through dialogue,' Hong said. Earlier this month, US Admiral William Gortney, commander of the US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said the US military believes North Korea has the ability to miniaturise a warhead and mount it on a ballistic missile, although there had been no tests. One such rocket is an intercontinental missile with could theoretically hit California as it is designed to carry a payload of more than 5,000 miles. Kim Jong Un (centre in black) posing with his soldiers on top of snow-covered Mount Paektu in North Korea. The country could have as many as 100 warheads within five years, it has been suggested . Stanford University professor Sigfried Hecker was allowed to visit Pyongyang in 2010 and reported seeing a large uranium-enrichment facility. The Journal quoted him as saying: 'Some eight, nine, or 10 years ago, they had the bomb but not much of a nuclear arsenal. 'I had hoped they wouldn't go in this direction, but that's what happened in the past five years. 'The more they believe they have a fully functional nuclear arsenal and deterrent, the more difficult it's going to be to walk them back from that.' North Korea carried out nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013, and has an extremely active ballistic missile development programme, although expert opinion is split on how much progress it has made, reports Agence France Presse. The Chinese estimate reflects growing concern in Beijing about the nuclear ambitions of its errant ally, and is the latest in a series of expert assessments that suggest Pyongyang is moving faster down the nuclear path than previously thought. Kim Jong Un inspecting the newly built Wonsan Baby Home and Orphanage in a photo released earlier this month. North Korea has conducted three nuclear detonations, the most recent in February 2013 . In 2012, Pyongyang demonstrated its rocket capabilities by sending a satellite into orbit, but it has yet to conduct a test that would show it had mastered the re-entry technology required for an inter-continental ballistic missile. The other key question is how close the North is to being able to miniaturise a nuclear device that could be fitted on the tip of a missile. In a white paper published in January, the South Korean defence ministry said the North had already taken its miniaturisation technology to a 'significant' level. Under the Kim dynasty, represented by current leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has long used nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in international relations. Last month the country's ambassador to the UK issued a chilling warning that North Korea would be prepared to use nuclear weapons. In a rare interview, Hyun Hak-bong claimed the secretive state could launch a deadly warhead 'anytime'.","Pariah state may have 20 warheads not 10 as previous US forecasts held .

Hazy: Footage shows him entering the burning building and carefully navigating the smoke-filled interiors . Several other firemen then enter the scene and Murphy moves with them upstairs. Wearing smoke masks, they step through crumbling walls and flooded passageways. In order to hear each other, they shout loudly to one another. They also use radios to communicate to a second team of firemen with the truck outside. Although the headcam video cuts at the 31-minute mark, it apparently took the fire fighters six hours to get the blaze under control. Former Sea Bright fire chief Joe Eskridge says the helmet cam is 'probably one of the best tools you can have besides water' when it comes to coordinating fire efforts.

"Sheriffs are hunting a gunman who shot a young woman through the neck as she was driving down a Colorado interstate, amid fears he may have tried to attack other drivers too. The unnamed 20-year-old woman was driving on the I-25 in Weld County, north of Denver, when her window shattered and she felt bleeding from both sides of her neck. In a chilling 911 call from around 11pm Wednesday night, she told operators: 'I'm on the highway right now and somebody just hit me and I'm bleeding from my neck and I'm scared. 'I don't know if they hit me or if they threw something out the window... my neck hurts. I think there's glass in my neck.' Scroll down for video . Highway shooting: A bullet passed clean through a woman's neck after she was shot at by an unknown gunman driving down the I-25 highway north of Denver, Colorado . She was taken to hospital where surgeons found she had been shot clean through the neck. Miraculously, the bullet did not damage the woman's airway or sever any major blood vessels. She is expected to recover, according to 7News Denver. The woman, from the nearby town of Milliken, said that she had seen a dark SUV just before her window shattered and she felt the gunshot wound. Deputies from the Weld County Sheriff's Office have said that the shooting may be linked to other unexplained reports of shattered windows on highways in northern Colorado. Hours before the woman was shot, a man's rear window was shattered as he drove on the nearby I-76 after he heard a 'pop' sound which could have been gunfire. The previous day a prison van transporting inmates along the I-25 had its window shattered by an unidentified 'projectile', the Coloradoan reported. Another incident came on Thursday, when a man's driver-side window shattered as he drove down a nearby county road during the daytime. Nobody was injured in any of the other incidents. Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said drivers should be aware and report suspicious behavior as deputies investigate. 'There's a lot more leg work that needs to be done on this case,' Smith said. 'It's hard because at this point we have no indication that this person was targeted by a person looking for her.' Deputies were yesterday pictured investigating an abandoned black SUV on I-25, which had shattered rear windows. It is not clear whether this was the vehicle the woman had seen.","20-year-old woman was hit by bullet at 11pm on Wednesday night .

"Anger: The UN said Katie Hopkins (pictured) used language similar to that of Rwandan media in the run up the 1994 genocide and by Nazis in the 1930s . The UN's rights chief has urged Britain to crack down on tabloid newspapers inciting racial hatred after a columnist for The Sun called migrants 'cockroaches'. In a hard-hitting statement, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Husein said Katie Hopkins had used language similar to that employed by some Rwandan media outlets in the run-up to the 1994 genocide, and by the Nazis in the 1930s. He said the April 17 article in the newspaper was reflective of a 'nasty underbelly of racism that is characterising the migration debate in an increasing number of EU countries'. This was also 'sapping compassion for the thousands of people fleeing conflict, human rights violations and economic deprivation who are drowning in the Mediterranean,' he said. The article came as migrant boat tragedies in the Mediterranean escalated. Already, more than 1,750 people have died this year making the perilous sea crossing to try to reach Europe - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014. Zeid asked British authorities, media, and regulatory bodies to take immediate steps to stop racial and inflammatory articles. 'This vicious verbal assault on migrants and asylum seekers in the UK tabloid press has continued unchallenged under the law for far too long,' he said. 'The Sun's editors took an editorial decision to publish this article, and - if it is found in breach of the law - should be held responsible along with the author.' The high commissioner said the Hopkins piece was 'simply one of the more extreme examples of thousands of anti-foreigner articles that have appeared in UK tabloids over the past two decades.' He also asked all European countries to take a firmer line on racism and xenophobia. Eritrean migrant Wegasi Nebiat is saved by rescuers after the wooden boat carrying her crashed off the popular Greek island of Rhodes . Death of a child: More than 1,750 people have already died this year making the perilous sea crossing to try to reach Europe - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 . Clinging on: Migrants trying to reach Greece are seen onboard a capsizing sailboat off the coast of Rhodes . 'Make no mistake, these migrants are like cockroaches,' she wrote. 'They might look like 'Bob Geldof's Ethiopia circa 1984' but they are built to survive a nuclear bomb.' 'It is extraordinary and deeply shameful to see these types of tactics being used in a variety of countries, simply because racism and xenophobia are so easy to arouse in order to win votes or sell newspapers.' The columnist also said Europe should adopt a hardline approach to clandestine immigration like Australia by using navy ships to turn back boats carrying asylum seekers. 'Britain is not El Dorado,' Hopkins said. 'Some of our towns are festering sores, plagued by swarms of migrants and asylum seekers, shelling out benefits like Monopoly money.' Zeid said provocative articles could trigger dangerous reactions. 'It is extraordinary and deeply shameful to see these types of tactics being used in a variety of countries, simply because racism and xenophobia are so easy to arouse in order to win votes or sell newspapers.'

Ed Miliband has been accused of stooping to a 'shameful' new low by blaming David Cameron for the Mediterranean refugee crisis. The Labour leader  used a keynote campaign speech today to suggest the deaths of hundreds of refugees fleeing North Africa could have been avoided if the Prime Minister had done more following his intervention in Libya to remove the former dictator Colonel Gaddafi. In a briefing note sent out before the speech, Labour went further - claiming the crisis was 'in part a direct result' of Mr Cameron's foreign policy. Anger: Ed Miliband, speaking at Chatham House in central London this morning, has been accused of stooping to a 'shameful' new low by blaming David Cameron for the Mediterranean refugee crisis . The provocative allegation has provoked a furious response from the Tories who this morning demanded that Mr Miliband apologise for the 'outrageous and disgraceful' remarks. It comes after Mr Cameron held emergency talks with EU leaders in Brussels yesterday over how to tackle the growing humanitarian crisis. The Prime Minister announced the deployment of one of Britain's biggest warships - HMS Bulwark - as part of beefed-up efforts to prevent more refugees packing onto tiny boats. Up to 1,750 refugees have lost their lives trying to reach Europe this year - out of around 35,000 who have tried to make the crossing. The vast majority of the migrant boats set off from the Libya, which has descended into chaos in the aftermath of the 2011 revolution which saw Colonel Gaddafi swept from power with the support of France and Britain.","UN High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned Katie Hopkins'

"He may be the fastest man on the planet, but Usain Bolt has made no secret of his love for chicken nuggets, KFC hot wings, Pringles crisps and a pint of Guinness. But now the Jamaican sprinter has had to lay off his beloved fast food and eat a 'lot more vegetables', despite confessing that 'he hates them all'. And it is his chef who is entrusted with the unenviable task of chasing him round the house to check he is eating his greens. Cutting back: Usain Bolt said he has had to lay off his beloved fast food and eat vegetables instead . 'I haven't had KFC for about four months, which is killing me', the 28-year-old sprinter said in an interview with Runner's World. 'I've tried to bribe my chef but not only is he not bribeable, he chases me around the house and makes sure I eat what he's cooked. 'He also lays out my vitamin pills and supplements in front of me so I can't ""forget"" to take them. 'I eat a lot more vegetables - and I hate them all. I used to eat them occasionally, but now with every meal I have a plate just for veg. But I can't get away any more with just winging it. 'To perform how I want I have to be perfect in training - and eating right is a part of training - so down it goes.' He added:  'I've backed off hard liquor too - rum and that stuff - but I still drink Guinness, or a Heineken or two. A guy's got to have something, right.' Perfection: The sprinter said that he needs to be 'perfect in training' and 'eating right is a part of training' Showman: The Jamaican has always been notorious for his unhealthy diet and love of fast food . Bolt, who won gold with an Olympic record of 9.63 at London 2012, admitted eating a McDonald's wrap on the morning of the race, as well as 'some hash browns, rice and pork.' He also consumed 1,000 McNuggets as he set three world records at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, earning three gold medals. Bolt, 28, is not the only athlete who has confessed to having an unhealthy diet. Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time with 22 medals, enjoyed a staggering 12,000 calorie breakfast diet. This included three fried egg sandwiches, with cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, fried onions and mayonnaise; a five-egg omelette, three sugar-coated slices of French toast, and bowl of grits, two cups of coffee and three chocolate chip pancakes. Elsewhere in the interview, Bolt said Tyson Gay should have been given a longer ban for drugs cheating and branded the decision to shorten his punishment 'the stupidest thing I've ever heard'. Gay had his suspension reduced after he agreed to co-operate with authorities, and is now set to compete against Bolt after returning to the sport. The interview with Usain Bolt appears in the May issue of Runner's World.","Sprinter says he is 'eating a lot more vegetables' but 'hates them all'

"Furious parents have launched a campaign to overturn a primary school headteacher's decision to ban all drinks except water during the school day. Headteacher Linda Shute has banned children from consuming drinks - including tea, coffee, fruit juice and soft drinks - in a bid to protect the long-term health of pupils at Rowdown Primary School in New Addington, south London. But some parents believe the water-only rule is too strict, claiming many children go all day without a drink because they do not like water. Scroll down for video . A headteacher is forcing primary school pupils to only drink water during the school day after banning all other drinks, including fruit juice . Samantha Moore, who launched the petition, said: 'As a mother, I have the right to choose what my son drinks.' Another campaigner, Anela, from Croydon, added: 'They should be able to drink whatever they want and not just water because some kids don't like water.' Mrs Shute, who announced her aims by enforcing the rule in a school newsletter last month, said: 'The water-only policy is being very well supported by parents and children. 'Thank you for this and know in your hearts, if you have any doubts, this policy is for the long-term health of all your children.' But her move provoked a backlash from some, who branded it a 'joke'. Alan Fay said: 'It's about time that schools started looking after the kids again and stop just doing what is told by the powers above.' Gemma Irwin, from New Addington, added : 'I believe that it should be up to the parent what their child drinks. 'If teachers are allowed tea and coffee, why can't a child have a bottle of juice or flavoured water?' But the school has defended its decision. The rule has been enforced to protect the long-term health of pupils at Rowdown Primary School (pictured) in New Addington, south London . It follows a similar ban which sparked anger at Valence Primary School in Dagenham, east London, when it was introduced in January last year. Headteacher Elizabeth Chaplin brought in the new rule as part of a 'health drive' and drinks other than water were poured down the sink. In June last year, children at Carlton Central Infants' School in Nottingham, were barred from drinking fruit squash - a measure opposed by some parents. Tam Fry, chairman of the Child Growth Foundation and spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, is among campaigners who have pushed for healthy drink options in schools. He has praised schools that clamp down on sugar-filled juices, which he believes should be limited to one small glass a week. Mr Fry said: 'Fruit juice is known to be really laden with sugar, and it needs to be a treat - not an everyday occurrence. The preference in schools should be water, which is hugely beneficial.'","Headteacher Linda Shute has banned tea, coffee, fruit juice and soft drinks .

"Terrified: Miriam, 11 (left), and Ayesha, nine (right), are currently living in fear in their basement . A terrified British family who are stuck in a basement in war-torn Yemen have launched a desperate appeal to be evacuated to the UK. Louise Henderson Alakil, 49, moved to the Middle Eastern country 27 years ago and worked as a teacher at the International School in the capital Sanaa until recent fighting forced it to close. She is now hiding in a shelter below her family home on the outskirts of the city with her youngest children, Miriam, 11, and Ayesha, nine, amid heavy shelling and while bombs fall all around them. Britons have been advised to book commercial flights out the country, but Mrs Henderson and her children's passports have expired and the UK authorities in Yemen are closed. They have posted applications to the UK but fear they will not return, and are terrified of dodging fighting to get to the UK embassy in Sudan for emergency documents. It comes after Houthi militias, aligned with Iran, began taking control of territory in Yemen, including the country's capital in September. In response, a Saudi Arabia-led coalition started launching airstrikes in late March. More than 1,000 people have been killed in the fighting in the past month, prompting thousands to flee their homes and hospitals and schools have been hit by shelling. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has suspended embassy operations in the region and urged British nationals to leave by commercial means. Mrs Henderson, a mother-of-six formerly of Linlithgow, West Lothian, has now launched an urgent plea for assistance to get out of the warzone and back to the UK. Speaking from the UK, Mrs Henderson's sister, Heather, 51, said: 'We are trying to get them out of the country. It's an absolute mess. It's just a shambles. 'We are at our wits end trying to get my sister and her two young girls to a place of safety. 'They could have got a flight just after the bombing campaign started but the flights which managed to leave were forced to run the gauntlet of surface-to-air missiles.'.

Mrs Henderson father, Bill, a 77-year-old painter, said: 'We are concerned for their safety...During the bombing they were forced to run into the basement and hide under the snooker table. 'I know the kids are very frightened. It makes us feel dreadful. The big problem at the moment is the uncertainty,' he added. 'There is a shortage of basic things like water and gas for cooking and even food supplies. The money is another big problem, because all the banks are shut, he went on to say. Mr Henderson said he and his family are worried and hoping for the best, but currently do not know what the outcome is going to be. 'It's been stressful to say the least. We've been working very hard to help out in any way we can... We don't know what the Saudis are going to do. They could bomb Sana'a tonight,' he said. 'Our talks with the authorities have been unsatisfactory and we've tried everything and nobody seems particularly interested.'

Frontline: More than 1,000 people have been killed in the fighting over the past month, prompting thousands to flee their homes as hospitals and schools are hit by shelling . Mrs Henderson has been living in the country for the past 27 years after marrying husband Wahab, an engineer who is in his mid-50s. He is sheltering with her. She worked as a teacher at the International School in the capital city of Sana'a until the troubles forced the facility to close over safety fears. The family are facing a number of problems in their fight to leave the country, as Louise and her children's passports have expired and the UK authorities are closed. Documents have now been posted to the UK for renewal which could take three weeks. And it is not clear whether they would receive them if they were posted back. Mrs Henderson and her daughters are now considering making their way to the UK embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, where they could get emergency documents. But getting there is dangerous as planes have been forced to run the gauntlet of surface-to-air missiles.

Battleground: Armed militiamen loyal to Yemen's fugitive President Abderabbo Mansour Hadi duck from sniper-fire as they run during clashes with Houthi rebels in the port city of Aden this morning . Mr Henderson added: 'Getting out of Yemen is dangerous because they are firing at the planes on their way out. And the last thing we want is for them to get out and become stuck in another country... The FCO in London have been completely useless.' The International Organization for Migration took the decision to temporarily suspend its evacuation of third country nationals from Yemen, due to difficulties faced in operating flights out of the city. And despite requests made to facilitate such movements, IOM continues to experience challenges in getting people out of Yemen. The FCO could help if Louise and her children managed to get to a British emabassy or consulate where they could be supplied with emergency documents. A spokesman for the FCO said: 'Our Embassy's operations have been temporarily suspended. Our longstanding and consistent message to British Nationals has been to leave the country.

"With celebrities appearing to magically snap back into shape mere weeks after giving birth, there's increasing pressure on new mums to get their pre-pregnancy body back quicker than ever. The Duchess of Cambridge, who is due to give birth any day now, was applauded for her natural approach to her post-birth figure, when she had Prince George in 2013. Experts agree that carefully easing the body back into exercise is the best method and Camilla Lawrence, women’s health physiotherapist at Six Physio, tells MailOnline how to get your body back to its pre-pregnancy shape - safely. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth to her second child any day now. But Camilla Lawrence, a Women’s Health Physiotherapist, warns that trying to do too much too soon following pregnancy and birth can do long term damage to your body . According to Camilla, a women's health specialist and a member of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Women’s Health (ACPWH), most women are left with dozens of questions post-birth, about what is and isn't safe for them to do. Even after their six week GP check-up, many don't know how soon they can start to exercise, if they want to, and what they should avoid. The confusion and lack of trusted information can leave some women baffled as to how celebrities could ever do it, and others too afraid to even try. But according to Camilla, following these simple steps can get new mums on the right track. The Duchess of Cambridge played volleyball three months after giving birth to Prince George in July 2013, which experts agree is the recommended amount of time to wait before doing exercise . GET YOUR BODY ASSESSED BY AN EXPERT . Getting assessed by an expert will enhance your entire postnatal experience, says Camilla. A full assessment of your back and pelvis, posture, and pelvic floor and abdominal muscle function will identify areas which are recovering and areas of weakness or tension. These areas all affect your sleep quality, bonding with your baby, sexual function and getting back to normal levels of activity exercise postpartum. DON'T SUFFER INCONTINENCE IN SILENCE . Some 30 per cent of women have ongoing urinary incontinence post pregnancy, admits Camilla, and 50 per cent have some form of prolapse after childbirth. This is caused by weakness or tension in the pelvic floor muscles from pregnancy and child birth. However the good news is that this can be treated. So women are advised not to suffer in silence out of embarrassment or fear. Consult your GP or a health expert, and get some advice. Experts warn that although back pain is common post pregnancy it shouldn't be viewed as normal . DON'T ASSUME BACK PAIN IS NORMAL . Around 40 to 60 per cent of postpartum women complain of ongoing back and pelvic pain following pregnancy, says Camilla. But while common, this pain should never be seen as ‘normal’. If your pain is not settling by itself within one week of giving birth, then seek a specialist therapist for treatment she advises. PELVIC FLOOR EXERCISES ARE VITAL . According to Camilla, 30 per cent of women who try to contract their pelvic floor muscles, do so incorrectly. Common mistakes include tensing the buttocks and thighs, instead of the pelvic floor muscles, and breath holding. At best this will mean your pelvic floor strength won’t improve, at worst it could mean that you could actually be straining and weakening your pelvic floor further. But it’s not just muscle weakness you need to be aware of. In some women, the pelvic floor also becomes ‘overactive’ or over-tense (like a muscle spasm). In this instance, Kegel pelvic floor exercises  can actually be detrimental and worsen the spasm, causing symptoms of pain, urgency and difficulty emptying the bladder or bowels. This is why it’s so important to seek instruction from an expert, warns Camilla. CORRECT YOUR POSTURE EARLY ON . Be smart when loving your new baby, says Camilla. Simple actions such as feeding, changing, bathing and soothing your baby can all put unwelcome pressure on your back and pelvis. A few top tips she suggests are to try not to lift anything heavier than your baby for the first six weeks, and think about your posture and body position. Try to keep your tummy muscles gently engaged and your pelvis directly under your shoulders when soothing your baby. DON'T HAVE SEX UNTIL YOU'RE READY . When to have sex again is the big question! It is important to remember that everyone is different, says Camilla, and there's no normal time to resume your sex life. A survey carried out by nct.org.uk has shown that 29 per cent of women had resumed sex within a month of their baby’s birth, and almost 60 per cent within eight weeks. This left 40 per cent who took longer, with a further three per cent of women who took over a year. The most important thing is to wait until you are physically and emotionally ready. Experts recommend starting with low impact exercises such as Pilates to help rebuild muscles . TAKE YOUR RETURN TO EXERCISE SLOW . Hormones during pregnancy and breast feeding may put you at increased risk of injury. The hormone relaxin increases the flexibility of your soft tissues and joints, and can remain in the body for up to six months after delivery, making you prone to joint strains or sprains. The hormones produced when breast feeding can also have an effect on your soft tissues which is why it is important to really build up your muscle strength and core stability before you return to high impact exercise like running or aerobics. START WITH LOW IMPACT EXERCISE . This will address the areas that you will be weak in such as your core (including tummy muscles), your back and glutes. Try to leave six weeks after your delivery (or up to eight weeks after a C-section) before starting low-impact cardio exercise such as swimming or using a cross trainer. Accompanying this with core-strengthening and conditioning work such as postnatal Pilates and light weights will help you rebuild muscles. According to Women's Weekly Zara Tindall claims she got her post-baby body thanks to 'weight-training' runs by pushing newborn Mia in her buggy. HOLD OFF ON HIGH IMPACT EXERCISE FOR THREE MONTHS . You can go back to being a gym-bunny says Camilla, but advises that you first optimise your core strength and control before re-starting high-impact exercise, such as jogging, running, aerobics or team sports. Ensure you are pain free before gradually getting back to this around three months after delivery. The Duchess of Cambridge wasn't spotted doing exercise until she took part in a volley ball match three months after George's birth. Zara Tindall claims that pushing Mia in her buggy was enough to help her achieve her post-baby body .","New mothers under more pressure than ever to 'bounce back' after birth .

"Angelina Jolie's acclaimed film about the kidnap and rape of a 14-year-old girl in Ethiopia has helped burnish her image as a human rights campaigner. But the Hollywood star is at the centre of controversy after the makers of Difret were accused of exploiting the real-life victim at the heart of its story. Aberash Bekele, 32, is angry at the filmmakers for using her story without her knowledge or consent, and failing, initially, to pay her compensation. Fear: Aberash Bekele (second left) believes the film could put her and her family in danger of reprisals . Hollywood glamour: Angelina Jolie, 39, has become increasingly known for her humanitarian work . Miss Bekele was abducted so she could be pushed into a forced marriage. She escaped but was put on trial for killing one of her abductors. While she was released by the courts, local elders forced her into exile away from her home and family. Miss Jolie, who helped produce the film, spoke about how it will 'make a change' in the world and it was screened last year at her Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, hosted in London, co-chaired by then Foreign Secretary William Hague. But Miss Bekele believes the film, which has won awards around the world, could put her and her family in danger of reprisals. She was never consulted by the film-makers and did not give them permission to lay her traumas bare on screen. With the character based on Miss Bekele renamed Hirut and with the film focusing on her lawyer, the Ethiopian directors originally refused to acknowledge it was about her. Miss Bekele, now a mother of one, was the focus of a 1999 BBC documentary Schoolgirl Killer, made by journalist Charlotte Metcalf. Miss Metcalf, who saw Miss Bekele earlier this year, said: 'Aberash feels doubly abducted not to have had the story acknowledged as hers. It's an absolute outrage that they should pretend it could have been anyone's story and she's still fighting that. 'Today, she could be bathing in the glow of international admiration for her extraordinary courage and resilience. Instead she is invisible, her story taken.' Last year, Miss Bekele won an injunction banning the film from being shown in Ethiopia. Respected: The Oscar-winning actress is a special envoy for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees and was awarded an honorary damehood by the Queen for her efforts . She obtained it on the night of the film's premiere in the country, just after the producers had screened a message from Miss Jolie in which she admitted it was based on the 'untold story of Aberash Bekele'. While an out-of-court settlement eventually led to Miss Bekele being paid a small amount of money, she still lives in poverty and feels she has been exploited by the film. She told an Ethiopian newspaper: 'My life is on the edge [financially] while they are planning to premiere my story in a glamorous way. That is not right.' Miss Jolie, 39, a mother of six who is married to fellow star Brad Pitt, 51, has become increasingly known for her humanitarian work. The Oscar-winning actress is a special envoy for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees and was awarded an honorary damehood by the Queen for her efforts. Last year she spoke excitedly about Difret getting a wider release, saying: 'I cried for the first 20 minutes and then I smiled for the rest of it thinking I can't wait for the world to see it because it will make a change'. Her representatives did not respond to requests for a comment yesterday.","Aberash Bekele, 32, is angry at filmmakers of Difret for using her story .

"A brand new £4million apartment block in a World Heritage Site is facing demolition after residents complained that it was four feet wider than approved. Landmark Developments Ltd tore down a derelict property in Bath city centre and replaced it with a modern block of 14 flats. But residents complained that the development was three feet higher and four feet wider than the plans approved by the council. A brand new £4million apartment block in Bath (pictured) is facing demolition - because it is four feet wider than approved . Bath and North East Somerset Council says the developer has committed a 'breach of planning control' and ordered the building to be bulldozed. Dr Douglas Bernardt, a local resident with a PHD in architecture, described the situation as 'madness'. He said: 'I don't know how it was possible that things have got to this stage. 'Lots of money will have been spent on this and I can't understand why it was built different to what they had permission for. It's total madness. 'Architecturally I think there is nothing to complain about. The flats look nice, it's not aggressive to look at.' But Architect David Hadfield claimed the building was 1.5ft higher and just under three feet wider in some places than the approved plans. He said: 'Late in the design process the building’s insurers insisted on the introduction of a steel frame which resulted in the increase in width, and improved noise separation increased floor thicknesses adding to the height.' Planning permission for the development at 43 Upper Oldfield Park was granted in 2009 following three rejections since 2007. Planning permission for the development at 43 Upper Oldfield Park was granted in 2009 following three rejections since 2007 . Bath and North East Somerset Council says the developer has committed a 'breach of planning control' and ordered the building (right) to be bulldozed . The average price of a two-bedroom flat in the area is £289,000, meaning the 14 flats would be worth at least £3.9million on the open market. In October last year - as the building neared completion - residents complained that it differed from the  approved plans. Bath and North East Somerset Council halted construction and ordered Landmark Development to apply for retrospective permission. Planning officers said they thought the work was 'acceptable' and said permission should be granted. But the council's Development Control Committee disagreed and rejected the proposals on April 17, giving the developer six months to demolish the building. Architect David Hadfield submitted this drawing of the development showing the approved height and width in grey and the existing building in bold . The committee said it felt the development was 'harmful' to the character and appearance of the conservation area. Landmark Development is appealing against the decision and a  meeting will be held next week. Marc Willis, who is the developer's planning consultant, described the council's decision as 'unreasonable'. He said: 'The report suggests the complete demolition and it must be done within six months. The developer is very concerned and is doing everything to stop it. 'The planning officers said the plans were okay, but the council said no. The idea that they have ignored the officers is just wrong. 'We have been in constant dialogue with the council. Demolition goes well beyond what is needed to remedy the issue. 'There are 14 flats which should be on the market now, but you can't move in without planning permission. It is an expensive and unnecessary position to be in. 'If the council followed its officers, we wouldn't find ourselves in this situation. There would be significant work to do, but we consider a demolition is unreasonable.'","A brand apartment block with  14 flats has been built in Bath city centre .

"In the heart of Yellowstone National Park, a supervolcano releases around 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day. But the magma chamber lying directly beneath its surface is not considered large enough to produce such levels, so researchers have been searching for an alternative source for years. Now, by tracking seismic waves, a team of geophysicists has discovered an enormous secondary chamber deeper underground that's so large its partly-molten rock could fill the Grand Canyon 11 times over. Scroll down for video . A supervolcano in Yellowstone National Park (pictured) releases around 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day. A magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce these levels and now researchers have found the source in a secondary magma chamber deeper underground . The Yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world. Silicic is used to describe magma or igneous rock rich in silica. It is situated in Yellowstone National Park - which spans the midwestern US states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana - and last erupted 640,000 years ago. The Yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world. It is situated in Yellowstone National Park - which spans the midwestern US states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana - and last erupted 640,000 years ago. Although lava has flowed in the area as recently as 70,000 years ago, the researchers said. Experts say there is a one in 700,000 annual chance of a volcanic eruption at the site. Previous research found a relatively small magma chamber, known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir, directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles (10,420 cubic km). To discover the latest chamber, Hsin-Hua Huang from the University of Utah and colleagues  tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes. The researchers said the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock. The remaining 2 per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption. It sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km). Lava has flowed in the area as recently as 70,000 years ago, researchers added.

To discover the latest chamber, Hsin-Hua Huang from the University of Utah and his colleagues  tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes. These readings combined data from the University of Utah Seismograph Stations, which collected shallow readings from nearby quakes in Utah, Idaho, the Teton Range and Yellowstone, and from the Earthscope array, which revealed deeper readings from temblors from more further afield. Each of these quakes created waves that echoed around the supervolcano. The movement and structure of these waves could then be used to map the earth beneath. The researchers said in their paper: 'The Yellowstone magmatic system from the mantle plume to the upper crust', published in the journal Science, that the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock. The remaining two per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption, they added. It sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km). To put this into perspective, the Grand Canyon in Arizona has a volume of 1,000 cubic miles (4,168 cubic km) meaning the molten rock in the upper chamber would fill it two-and-a-half times, and the rock from the larger lower chamber would fill it 11 times. Previous research found a relatively small magma chamber, known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir, beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles (10,420 cubic km). The latest chamber sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the surface and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km) (illustrated) To discover the large chamber (shown in yellow), the University of Utah tracked seismic waves from 5,000 earthquakes. Each of these quakes created waves that 'echoed' around the supervolcano. The smaller magma chamber is shown in red beneath the supervolcano's caldera . Researchers said the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three Yellowstone eruptions 2 million, 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago. If Yellowstone did erupt, estimates from a National Geographic report said its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly. A 10-foot (3 metre) layer of ash would travel around 1,000 miles (1,610km), leaving two-thirds of the US uninhabitable. This spread of volcanic ash, rocks and gas would then prevent planes from taking off and disrupt air travel around the globe. Not only do the findings reveal what is causing the high levels of carbon dioxide, researchers can use it to learn more about how the supervolcano connects to the hot-spot plume in Earth's mantle. It could also provide clues about the structure of other supervolcanoes. 'An understanding of its properties is key to enhancing our knowledge of volcanic mechanisms and corresponding risk,' said the researchers. 'This lower-crustal magma body has a volume 4.5 times larger than the upper-crustal magma reservoir [and] these estimates are critical to understanding the evolution of basaltic-rhyolitic volcanism and explaining the magnitude of CO2 discharge.' The presence of magma reservoirs underlying upper crust magma chambers has been inferred at other locations, but not detected. The paper added that the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three Yellowstone eruptions 2 million, 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago.

If Yellowstone (pictured) erupted, estimates suggest its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly. A 10-foot (3 metre) layer of ash would travel around 1,000 miles (1,610km), leaving two-thirds of the US uninhabitable. And this spread of volcanic ash, rocks and gas would then  disrupt air travel around the globe .","Researchers used seismic readings to map what is beneath Yellowstone .

"Cigars may be more harmful to smokers than cigarettes, researchers warned yesterday. The news comes as cigar use rises in the US, where the study was carried out, and cigarette smoking declines. Alarmingly, more young people appear to be taking up cigars thanks to new ranges of flavoured ones. Researchers have warned that cigars may be more harmful to smokers than cigarettes. They found the risk for cigar smokers of dying from oral, oesophageal or lung cancer was at least as bad as for cigarettes . Cigar consumption more than doubled from 6.2billion in 2000 to more than 13.7billion in 2011 – in contrast with a 33 per cent fall for cigarettes. Researchers analysed 22 studies, including five from Britain, and found the risks for cigar smokers of dying from oral, oesophageal or lung cancer was at least as bad as for cigarettes. They also found that those who smoked cigars and had previously smoked cigarettes had a much higher risk of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared to cigar smokers who had not previously smoked cigarettes. The team said they believed this could be due in part to the inhalation patterns of these different types of cigar smokers. Cindy Chang, of the US Food and Drug Administration, which did the study, said: ‘Some risks associated with cigar smoking can be as high or higher than with cigarette smoking. ""Cigar smoking is linked to fatal oral, oesophageal, pancreatic, laryngeal, and lung cancers, as well as heart disease and aortic aneurysm."" Cigar use is on the rise in the US, where the study was carried out, while cigarette smoking declines.

"Former Young Divas singer Kate DeAraugo has made the shock revelation she turned to drugs  and took anything she could get her hands on to mask her crippling depression after gaining considerable weight. Speaking on KIIS 106.5's The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Friday, the Australian Idol winner spoke out about her battle with mental health, and the surgery she had to help her lose a staggering 68kg. At her heaviest, the now 29-year-old weighed 127.5 kgs . Scroll down for video . Candid confessions: Kate DeAraugo talked to Kyle Sandliands and Jackie O about her drug-taking past . She said that it was after her stint on Young Divas that she began to spiral out of control, eating herself 'into a mess'. 'After Young Divas [in 2008] I basically lost the plot and went into hiding,' she said. 'Drugs, depression, the lot. 'I'm always dieting. It's always been up and down but after that I really lost the plot and I just ate myself into a mess,' she added. When Kyle Sandliands, 43, asked the 29-year-old singer if her weight gain caused her to turn to illegal substances, DeAraugo agreed, but declined to divulge too many details on what she was taking. She replied: 'Everything and anything. I was out of control in every aspect of my life.' 'You were masking your pain with whatever you could?' Kyle asked, to which the singer said 'yes' and went on to agree when he suggested there were times when she would wake up not knowing where she was. The Maybe Tonight singer said she also believes her expanding waistline and depressive state were the reason why a relationship she was in at the time ended. 'I stuffed up an amazing relationship during that time,' she said. At her heaviest DeAraugo weighed 127.5 kilos, but  after undergoing dramatic gastric sleeve surgery in May 2012, she lost a staggering 68 kg. In her candid interview, Kate said her wake-up call came when she got out of the shower once day and was out of breath. Shaping up: The Maybe Tonight singer underwent sleeve surgery  in May 2012 to help her lose weight . The blonde songstress turned her back on music during her dark times and even tried her hand at a 'normal' job for a while, before deciding that enough was enough and she needed to pursue her passion of singing. She explained: 'There was so much stuff going on at that time and I was a bit broken by it, I think. I thought, I can't get this right, it's not working, stuff it and I gave up on myself.' She added; 'And then I woke up one morning and thought, What are you doing? You love music, you love singing, just get yourself together.' The brunette beauty underwent her extreme weight loss surgery three years ago. She had a large chunk of her stomach cut away to prevent overeating and lost the staggering 68 kilos. After beating the bulge, her confidence has now sky rocketed, and she's preparing to release her new independent single, Shut Your Mouth, along with a music video next month. 'There's a few singles lined up and there's a lot of angst in it all,' she explained to Kyle and Jackie O. Hitting the right notes: Kate is preparing to release her new independent single, Shut Your Mouth . Despite many being impressed by her slim down physique, some fans have taken to social media to hit out at the star for being 'lazy' and using the surgery as an easy way out. 'It's different for everybody and this is what I needed to do for me. And it's worked for me and I'm happy and I'm feeling the best I've felt in my adult life,' she said. Meanwhile, Kate is currently penning her autobiography, Confessions Of A Fallen Idol, giving her fans more of an insight into her struggles.","Australian Idol winner spoke out about her battle with mental health .

"The family of an American hostage killed in a US drone strike gave his Al Qaeda captors money in a failed bid to guarantee his release, a report suggests. It has also been claimed Dr Warren Weinstein, from Rockville, Maryland, and a fellow aid worker were used as a shield to protect a senior Al Qaeda operative while in captivity. The 73-year-old was killed alongside Giovanni Lo Porto during an anti-terrorist strike on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border intended to kill members of the group. His family yesterday slammed their response to his abduction, and it has now been claimed that they transferred an undisclosed amount of money to his kidnappers two years before his death. A source in Pakistan who was in regular contact with the captors told CNN that after the money exchanged hands, they started demanding the release of prominent Afghan prisoners. They included the 'poster girl' for jihad Dr. Aafia Siddiqui - who is currently serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States for the attempted murder of a United States Army captain. Sources suggest the family of American hostage Dr Warren Weinstein, who was killed during a US drone strike in January, gave money to his kidnappers. His wife Elaine (right) has already slammed the US government's response to his abduction . After the money allegedly changed hands, the captors are said to have demanded the release of prominent Afghan prisoners, including the 'poster girl' for jihad Dr. Aafia Siddiqui - who is currently serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States . He said they were professional during the transactions and they connected themselves to other abductions - including that of murdered journalist James Foley. The source told CNN the militants would call him on a daily basis and when he last spoke to them in early April, they said Weinstein was still alive. However they did not provide a proof of life. When they stopped calling, CNN's source could not contact them as he had no phone number for the captors. He did not reveal how much money had been handed over. According to CBS News' David Martin, Dr Weinstein and Mr Lo Porto may have been used to safeguard an Al Qaeda leader while they were in the compound. US officials have not revealed a specific individual that was targeted during the attacks, but said the compound was hit because intelligence strongly suggested militants were inside. The senior member of the terrorist organisation may have believed if opposition forces knew hostages were in the compound, he would be safe from drone strikes. It has also been claimed that Dr Weinstein (left) and  fellow captive Giovanni Lo Porto (right) were used to shield a senior Al Qaeda operative from drone strikes . The leader being shielded was Ahmed Farouq, a longtime al Qaeda operative who once hatched a plot to hijack Pakistani vessels and ram them into American warships, the station reported. President Obama has taken 'full responsibility' for the attack which killed Dr Weinstein and Italian aid worker Mr Lo Porto in January. Weinstein's wife Elaine has said the US government's reaction to his plight following his capture in Lahore, Pakistan, in 2011 was 'inconsistent and disappointing'. In a statement released on Thursday, she said her family were devastated by the news he will never return home. She said: 'On behalf of myself, our two daughters, our son-in-law, and two grandchildren, we are devastated by this news and the knowledge that my husband will never safely return home. Pictured next to his wife are his two daughters, his son-in-law and two granddaughters . 'We were so hopeful that those in the U.S. and Pakistani governments with the power to take action and secure his release would have done everything possible to do so and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through. We do not yet fully understand all of the facts surrounding Warren's death but we do understand that the U.S. government will be conducting an independent investigation of the circumstances. 'We look forward to the results of that investigation. But those who took Warren captive over three years ago bear ultimate responsibility. I can assure you that he would still be alive and well if they had allowed him to return home after his time abroad working to help the people of Pakistan. 'The cowardly actions of those who took Warren captive and ultimately to the place and time of his death are not in keeping with Islam and they will have to face their God to answer for their actions,' Mrs. Weinstein said. 'Warren spent his entire life working to benefit people across the globe and loved the work that he did to make people's lives better. In Pakistan, where he was working before he was abducted, he loved and respected the Pakistani people and their culture. He learned to speak Urdu and did everything he could to show his utmost and profound respect for the region. 'We cannot even begin to express the pain our family is going through and we ask for the respect of our privacy as we go through this devastating ordeal.' 'I want to thank Congressman John Delaney, Senator Barbara Mikulski, and Senator Ben Cardin - as well as specific officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation - for their relentless efforts to free my husband. 'Unfortunately, the assistance we received from other elements of the U.S. Government was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years. We hope that my husband's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the U.S. Government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families.' 'I am disappointed in the government and military in Pakistan. Warren's safe return should have been a priority for them based on his contributions to their country, but they failed to take action earlier in his captivity when opportunity presented itself, instead treating Warren's captivity as more of an annoyance than a priority. I hope the nature of our future relationship with Pakistan is reflective of how they prioritize situations such as these.' During a press conference on Thursday, President Obama  revealed two other Americans, both prominent members of the terrorist organization, were killed in during missions in the same region. Ahmed Farouq, an American who was an Al Qaeda leader, was killed in the same January operation that resulted in the hostages' deaths while notorious hate preacher and US-native Adam Gadahn was killed in a separate US mission. The commander-in-chief gave his 'deepest apologies' to the families and revealed he had spoken to Weinstein's wife and the Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Wednesday. President Obama has taken 'full responsibility' for the attack which killed Dr Warren Weinstein, admitting that US forces sometimes make 'deadly mistakes' Defending the operation, he said it was 'fully consistent' with guidelines set out for counter-terrorist missions. 'As a husband and as a father, I cannot begin to imagine the anguish that the Weinstein and Lo Porto families are enduring today,' Obama told reporters, with a deep sigh. 'I profoundly regret what happened,' Obama said, explaining he declassified some of the details of the operation so that the families could know what happened.' 'There could be no starker contrast between these two men and their captors.' He added there will be a full review into the deadly incident and his press secretary, Josh Earnest, later said both of the victims will be given compensation by the US government. Earnest did not reveal how much they would receive, but the figure could be in the millions.","Dr Warren Weinstein died during the counterterrorism operation in January .

"A carpenter from South California has created what may well be the world’s biggest see-saw. Kyle Toth, who runs his own custom woodworking business, built the seesaw from trees behind his workshop in Temecula. It measures a whopping 45ft in length, and according to its maker, sends its occupiers into the air at a height of around 25ft. Kyle said the tree was about 65ft long so he cut it to make it even on both sides and the seesaw was born . As seen in the video, the seesaw is made from entirely raw materials – a large trunk sits securely in between the natural split of a tree. Kyle told MailOnline: ‘I was cutting down some dead and damaged trees one day and was trying to drop this tree in between two others. ‘It didn't go as planned and ended up dropping in between a tree that had two huge branches splitting. ‘It fell basically where it is now but was about 65ft long and was laying on my fence. ‘So I cut the tree at what looked like would be even on both sides and just like that a massive teeter totter (American term for seesaw) was born. Kyle climbed the tree with a sledge hammer and pounded the trunk  into the split branches to stop it from sliding . There is no seat attached to the trunk but handrails have been added for support and ropes help people get on . ‘The whole thing kind of just happened. It ended up being the perfect weight on both sides. ‘I climbed up the tree with a sledge hammer and pounded the tree trunk down into the split branches to stop it from sliding. ‘I then called up a few of my friends and they came over really quickly once they heard.’ While there is no seat attached to the trunk, handrails have been added for support and ropes can be seen dangling from the base of it. Kyle said: ‘We had to attach a rope on one side so that when one person gets on they can pull the other person up and let someone else on. The seesaw measures  45ft in length, and according to Kyle, sends its occupiers into the air at a height of around 25ft . ‘I got on with one of my friends and it worked perfectly. It was a bit scary at first because it'll send you about 25ft in the air. ‘We used it for about 20 minutes. It’s so much fun. It takes the childhood ask of playing on a teeter totter and magnifies it by a thousand. ‘Basically if you were six-years-old and had never seen a regular teeter totter before that's what it would be like to see this thing as an adult.’ According to Kyle, four people can ride on the seesaw at one time and there is an amazing view from the top. The short clip, captured from two angles, shows two people riding the seesaw – one pumps the air in celebration and swings his dangling legs. Kyle said that the seesaw is a lot of fun and that it takes the childhood memory of playing on one and magnifies it by a thousand . Kyle's woodwork has been featured in the Providence Art Show, Boston’s World Trade Center Furniture Show and the Del Mar Woodworking competition in California . A number of people have commented positively on the video with one YouTube user writing: ‘That and a beer looks like a good time.’ The carpenter, who launched his business, Wood By Kyle Toth, in 2010 claims to have developed a passion for woodwork from a young age. His work has been featured in the Providence Art Show, Boston’s World Trade Center Furniture Show and the Del Mar Woodworking competition in California.","The seesaw was created by talented Temecula-based carpenter Kyle Toth .

"It is a skill employed by stand-up comedians, politicians and market traders alike – an effortless way with words that can persuade, cajole and tease. Now scientists believe they have found evidence of what may lie behind 'the gift of the gab'. Brain scans on a group of professional comedians has revealed differences in the way the brains of these 'super speakers' work while talking. The ultimate wheeler dealer, Del Boy's gift of the gab came from a difference in the way his brain worked . Compared to the less silver tongued among us, the super speakers – which also included a barrister and a radio presenter – showed less activity in a key area of the brain involved articulating and comprehending speech. This suggests that this group were putting less effort into the basic mechanics of speech, allowing them to devote more resources to what they were going to say next. Sarcasm is often described as the lowest form of wit, but it seems you need the right kind of wits in the first place to be able to recognise it. Neuroscientists have identified the area of the brain that is the key to picking up on when someone is being sarcastic. They found that people with damage to the right sagittal stratum - a bundle of white matter that lies between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures in the brain - are unable to detect sarcasm. Stroke survivors often suffer damage to this area of their brain and struggle to recognise when family and friends are being sarcastic. Dr Joe Devlin, a neuroscientist at University College London, told the Guardian: 'The fact that they show less activity there reflects the fact that they simply find speech less effortful and I suspect part of that has to do with practice. ' The findings may also help to explain why some people dry up completely when asked to speak. Dr Devlin and his colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brains of 17 professional comedians, a radio presenter and barrister. They were asked to lie in the scanner while talking for 30 seconds on random topics without hesitation, deviation or repetition – a task based on the BBC 4 panel show Just a Minute. Among the comedians taking part were Robin Ince, who presents a show with physicist Brian Cox, Richard Herring and Helen Keen. They were compared against a control group of students, who, according to Dr Devlin, were far less adept at the task. Super speakers were found to have less activity in Broca's region of the brain, shown in the image above . Dr Devlin said: 'One of the participants was given ""Scotland"" and just said ""I've never been there"", and that was basically it. 'We asked them to speak about ""a perfect cup of tea"", topics that should've been easy for everyone. 'A lot of our interest in speaking in fluency has been about things that go wrong, such as stutters. There's been almost no interest in how speech goes right.' The study revealed that the same areas of the brain were activated when both the comedians and the students were speaking. Market traders are known for their ability to sell almost anything to anyone due to their talent for speaking . However, the comedians and other super speakers showed lower levels of activity in an area of the brain known as Broca's region. Perhaps surprisingly, some studies have shown that Broca's region is also underactive in people who stutter.

"A sex offender has been jailed for fatally stabbing a forensic science student who dreamed of becoming a policewoman after befriending her on a canal towpath. David Marshall must serve a minimum of 20 years behind bars for the murder of Eni Mevish, a 20-year-old student at Staffordshire University. The 68-year-old stabbed her in the heart, lungs and liver six months after they met because he was 'jealous' of her other friendships, Stafford Crown Court heard. The pensioner had already served a jail sentence for assaulting a 14-year-old girl when he stormed her house Stoke-on-Trent in November last year to butcher her with a kitchen knife. Eni Mevish was killed by a sex offender who stabbed her in the lungs, liver and heart six months after she befriended him while out jogging . The pair are thought to have met around six months earlier when Miss Mevish, originally from Manchester, was out jogging. Prosecutors told the court Miss Mevish had received financial support from the pensioner, though the nature of their friendship is not clear. On November 9 the 20-year-old received a number of text messages thought to have been from Marshall. While she was watching a film with fellow student Rizwan Bukhari, Marshall is understood to have arrived at her house drunk. He asked Mr Bukhari to leave them alone before being heard 'swearing, shouting' and asking 'why didn't you text me?' The 22-year-old student then heard a 'slow scream' and tried to intervene but was struck by the sex offender's knife. David Marshall was on licence for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl when he killed Eni, a 20-year-old student . After Marshall had fled the scene he discovered Miss Mevish's body in a pool of blood and phoned an ambulance. She had been stabbed in her heart, liver and lungs and died in hospital. Appearing via video link in Stafford Crown Court Marshall was told he must serve a minimum term of 20 years and six months for her killing. Sentencing, Judge John Wait said it was clear the sex offender had intended to hurt her. 'You came to be jealous of her friendships with fellow students and sought to distance her from them. 'It is clear you had in mind violence when you went to her home.' The court heard how at the time of the attack Marshall was on licence for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. 'At the time of this terrible offence you were on licence following a sentence for an offence of indecent assault,' added Judge Wait. 'It was a condition of your licence that you notify your supervising (probation) officer of any developing friendship with a woman. 'It is noteworthy that you failed to tell your supervising officer of the relationship (with Eni) though you were asked on many occasions.' In a statement released by police Miss Mevish was described as 'beautiful, clever and with her whole life ahead of her.' 'Eni was a loving sister and daughter who was taken from us suddenly and violently. 'We are so proud of her achievements. We are devastated by her death. 'Nothing can make up for that but we are glad Marshall is now paying for his actions.' The 20-year-old was studying to become a police woman at the time of her death. 'She would train really hard as she was so determined to join the police. 'Eni would run through the park and when she saw an officer she would say ""that’s what I want to be’""- she just wanted to help,' said close friend Melanie-Vanessa Enyong. The 20-year-old aspiring policewoman was in her second year of a degree in Policing and Criminal Investigation when she was murdered . 'She only ever wanted the best for people because she loved exercising so much she used to encourage us to get out there with her - that was the type of person she was.' She is thought to have met Marshall while out running though details of their friendship are not known. One of her former lecturers said she was a 'warm-hearted and conscientious' student. Speaking on behalf of Staffordshire University, Professor Andrew Jackson said: 'She is greatly missed by all who knew her. 'Today’s events bring that loss into sharp focus and our thoughts are particularly with her family at this very difficult time.' She is thought to have met Marshall while out running though details of their friendship are not known. In the days after her death Thomas Barnes described how her housemate, Rizwan Bucari, had come into a shop to ask for help after seeing Marshall flee her body. 'She had blood pouring from a stab wound in her stomach, and cuts all up her arm. 'By the time the ambulance arrived, her breathing was very weak. I told them what had happened and moved so I didn't get in their way. 'It was surreal, after being in direct contact with that kind of situation it’s hard to concentrate on anything else.' Marshall stormed the student's shared house in Shelton, Stoke on Trent, (street pictured above) and killed her with a kitchen knife .","Eni Mevish, 20, was stabbed to death by David Marshall, 68, last November .

"A Mississippi man is lucky to be alive after a lawn mower shot a three-and-a-half inch metal wire up his nose and into his head. Bill Parker, 34, of Gulfport was mowing his lawn while at his family home last Sunday when he thought a rock hit him in the face not realizing it was actually a metal fence wire. Dr Timothy Haffey, who removed the wire which was as thick as a heavy-duty nail, said that it miraculously dodged all of Parker's important nerves and arteries. Bill Parker, 34, of Gulfport was mowing his lawn on April 19 when the rusty metal wire entered his left nostril and was lodged in his sinus cavity (above the CT scan showing the wire inside Parker's head) Parker (left) thought a rock had struck him in the face but after going to Memorial Hospital a scan revealed it was a three-and-a-half-inch metal fence wire . 'It threw me back a little bit and it hurt real bad,' Parker told the Sun Herald. 'I felt my face but I didn't feel any disfiguring or anything. I saw blood, so I knew I got a bloody nose.' After nearly 15 minutes following the incident, he and his fiancee Katie Heggins decided for him to go to Memorial Hospital for treatment. A CT scan revealed the metal wire had been shot up his left nostril and was lodged in Parker's sinus cavity beneath his eye socket and next to his jaw hinge. 'Had it gone straight up his nose at the rate it was traveling, it could have gone inside his brain,' Heggins told the Sun Herald. Dr Haffey removed the wire with a simple sinus surgery which took 20 minutes and entailed making an incision on Parker's upper lip. 'It was about a nine-centimeter long, rusty piece of metal that went all the way up to his skull base, and it pretty much dodged everything,' Dr Haffey told the Sun Herald. 'Once the scan showed that, my job was pretty easy.' 'He shouldn't have any long-term effects,' he added. 'Basically, it was a sinus surgery. The problem is this was a rusty piece of metal.' Dr Timothy Haffey removed the wire in a 20-minute sinus surgery (left the wire being removed from Parker's nose). Dr Haffey made an incision on Parker's upper lip during the surgery (pictured right the incision) The rusty wire (above the wire after it was removed during surgery) dodged all of Parker's important nerves and arteries, according to Dr Haffey . Following the surgery, Parker shared on Facebook that he was grateful to be alive as he retold his account of what happened the day before. 'Just woke up at memorial hospital. Much of yesterday is kind of a blur and lots of it i just don't remember,' he wrote. 'Always wear protective gear for your face when cutting grass!!! I thought a rock or something flew out and hit me, it felt like getting shot in the face. 'Cat scan determined it to be a metallic object in my sinus cavity.' Parker (above) is taking antibiotics to prevent infection and said he plans to find someone else to mow his lawn . 'I'm grateful to be alive. Several doctors were completely amazed at what had happened to me and stressed how lucky I really am,' he continued. 'The metal had somehow made its way through a tangle of really important nerves and arteries and finally rested about a millimeter from both carotid artery and my jugular vein. 'Guess it just wasnt my time yet.' The metal wire was sent to a pathology lab and Parker is taking antibiotics to prevent infection. He was back at work by Wednesday, albeit a little bruised. He said this Sunday, he plans to relax with his fiancee and seven-month-old daughter Sophia — and find someone else to mow his lawn.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

We made it possible by calling the police in Dubai and asking for their assistance.’ Mr Raj once united a guest with a Rolex watch that he forgot he had ordered. He said: ‘There is one guest I took care of who ordered a Rolex watch in one of our shops at Atlantis, The Palm but by the time the watch was delivered the guest had already checked out. ‘So I called the guest and sent an email to get his information and was able to send him his Rolex.

"Suspected rogue trader Navinder Sarao lived in his parents' modest home because it gave him a split-second advantage worth millions of pounds - and a potential £40million offshore nest egg. His family's semi-detached house in suburban West London is closer to an internet server used by one of the major financial exchanges, giving him a nanosecond advantage over rivals in the City. His thousands of high-frequency trades could be processed faster than those from dealers in Central London, giving him a massive commercial advantage. Sarao, 36, was dubbed the 'Hound of Hounslow' after it emerged he lived at home with his parents, despite allegedly making £26.7million in just four years of dealing from their home. Suspected rogue trader Navinder Sarao (circled) lived in his parents' modest home because it gave him a split-second advantage worth millions of pounds . Sarao's family's semi-detached house in suburban West London (pictured) is closer to an internet server used by one of the major financial exchanges . He was arrested on Tuesday at the request of US authorities, who have accused him of helping to trigger the Wall Street 'Flash Crash' of 2010, in which almost a trillion dollars was wiped from global share prices. The former Brunel University student allegedly made £550,000 in five minutes on the day of the 'Flash Crash', the biggest one-day collapse in Wall Street history. He is accused of using computer programs to create 'spoof' transactions on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and faces charges which could carry a 380-year prison sentence. Arrest: Navinder Singh Sarao is accused of making £26million by 'spoofing' the stock market from his parents' semi in Hounslow, west London . He spent a third night in custody last night after failing to pay the £5million surety demanded by the courts to grant him bail. Neil Crammond, who in 2002 helped train Sarao in his first trading job at Futex in Woking, Surrey, said he had quickly become one of its most successful traders, and that the family's home in Hounslow was perfectly located for Sarao's operation. He told the Daily Mail: 'One of the exchange servers is based at Slough. The nearer you are the faster your order travels. 'He could overtake orders from the City, meaning he was better placed to profit on tiny fluctuations in the market. It's only nanoseconds but these minuscule amounts of time are literally worth a fortune to traders. Every nanosecond counts.' There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Sarao during his time at Futex, which he left in 2008. According to The Times his company accounts show that he paid £23million to an employee trust plus another £15million 'guarantee fee' - a type of security - was also paid in, taking it close to £40million. A former colleague  told MailOnline today: 'He was a super human trader - we were in awe of his ability to make money. When he left Futex he took £2.5million from his account with him. That was unheard of. 'We were all encouraged to set up offshore accounts. If he has as much money as people think then that's where it'll be'. Sarao (pictured in court) spent a third night in custody last night after failing to pay the £5million surety demanded by the courts to grant him bail . Sarao allegedly masterminded – from his home computer – the Wall Street ‘Flash Crash’ of 2010 in which almost a trillion dollars was wiped from global share prices. But the whereabouts of his alleged £26million profit is a mystery. Sarao once wrote to a trade magazine claiming he made between £30,000 and £88,000 each day, but former colleagues said the trader had scant regard for the trappings of his success, living a frugal life. He is said to have 'loved making money, not spending it', and friend told MailOnline he would make £250,000 a day trading. Despite his alleged wealth he would travel to work late so he could buy off-peak tickets, only have lunch if he could find cut price sandwiches and shunned drinking in pubs for pints of milk at his desk. Sarao, who was scruffy and dishevelled in the dock during his extradition hearing on Wednesday, was able to offer a £5million surety to secure conditional bail - but it is yet to be paid. The Brunel University graduate is said to be 'scruffy', 'not flashy' and does not own a car so uses a fold-up bike - but is sometimes seen in his parents' Vauxhall Corsa. Adam Whiting, a fellow trader who sat next Sarao for eight months, said: 'One thing I will say is Nav used to wear a tracksuit every day even when an early millionaire!' He added: 'Everyone banging on about his s***** Hounslow house. From what i remember Nav only loved making money, not spending it'. First job: Sarao started his trading career at this office in Woking where former colleagues described him has a 'legendary' trader who made huge sums of money . Panic: Traders at the New York Stock Exchange watch in disbelief as the markets tumbled during the 'Flash Crash' five years ago . Mr Whiting revealed that Sarao had spent £100 on clothing Sports Direct but he later made £15,000 on a single deal . He said: 'When the trade came back he took all his clothes back.' Another former colleague told MailOnline: 'Nav is a bit like Rain Man. He would never come out drinking, never socialise, I'm not sure he had friends, but he was quite brilliant at his job. 'In six months in his last job before going it alone I know he made up to £4million in six months and at Futex he made £250,000 a day at times. People were in awe of him and his brain. 'But he was also known for being tight, he would wear the same shell suit, had a fold up bike because he had no car and would drink milk from a bottle at his desk. However, school friends said Sarao had briefly lived a flashier lifestyle when he began making money in his mid 20s. Aman Singh, 36, a former classmate, said: 'He used to go to strip clubs where he would flash his cash and pay for dances. 'I don't think he's ever had a girlfriend. He didn't seem interested in meeting girls unless it was strippers in these bars.' In a 2014 email to the UK Financial Conduct Authority, Sarao said: 'I am a trader who changes his mind very, very quickly, one second I'm prepared to buy the limit of 2,000, the next second I may change my mind and get out. 'This is what is unique about my trading, I trade very large but change my mind in a second.' Sarao described himself as 'an old school point and click trader', saying he used his computer mouse to place each trade – which appears to contradict US allegations he used computer programs to manipulate markets.","Navinder Sarao lived in parents' modest  home in suburban West London .

"Richard Hammond has ruled out returning to Top Gear, becoming the final presenter to leave the motoring show as he vowed: 'I won't quit my mates'. In yet another major blow to the BBC, the presenter took to Twitter to reveal he would not be returning to the hugely-popular series. The announcement came as the show's former executive producer Andy Wilman launched a scathing attack on 'meddling BBC executives' in a Top Gear Magazine editorial, published today. Yesterday, Mr Wilman, who is a childhood friend of Clarkson, sensationally quit the Corporation - fuelling speculation that the team is gearing up to launch a similar show with a rival broadcaster. The men were also seen holding talks at Clarkson's west London home, in their first public appearance since the presenter was axed from the show over a  'fracas' with a producer. Later last night, Clarkson was seen enjoying a drink with friends in a west London pub. Scroll down for video . Richard Hammond (pictured meeting his former co-stars yesterday) has ruled out returning to Top Gear, becoming the final presenter to leave the motoring show . Hammond took to Twitter to announce that he would not 'quit my mates' Jeremy Clarkson and James May . Jeremy Clarkson was seen out for a drink with friends last night, stopping at pub in west London after meeting with former Top Gear co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May, as well as producer Andy Wilman . Clarkson (seen enjoying a drink with a group yesterday evening) and Mr Wilman were put under pressure to hire a female presenter in 2002 by the BBC, the producer said . Mr Wilman (pictured with Clarkson,  Hammond and May yesterday) has launched a scathing attack on the 'meddling' BBC just a day after he quit the show . Following the spate of high-profile announcements, Hammond today broke his silence, tweeting: 'To be clear amidst all this talk of us 'quitting' or not: there's nothing for me to 'quit'. Not about to quit my mates anyway.' Top Gear Magazine, which is owned by BBC Worldwide, today published an editorial by Mr Wilman, in which the producer branded the decision to sack Clarkson a 'tragedy'. He said: ‘[The BBC] hasn’t just lost a man who can hold viewers’ attention in front of a camera, it’s lost a journalist who could use the discipline of print training to focus on what mattered and what didn’t, it’s lost an editorial genius who could look at an existing structure and then smash it up and reshape it in a blaze of light bulb moments’. He said chiefs at the corporation also originally vetoed hiring May, claiming the three were all ‘middle-class public-schoolish blokes of a similar age’. The astonishing feature ends speculation as to the reasons behind Mr Wilman's decision to quit the BBC - which was announced by corporation bosses yesterday evening. Mr Wilman also criticised attempts by the BBC to second-guess decisions about Top Gear's return in 2002 despite not being interested in the show’s subject matter. He said: ‘The BBC grown-ups were adamant a woman should be in the line-up. 'Now, I'm a big, big fan of the Beeb, but, my God, do they stretch your patience when they start “applying their marketing logic”, or to use another word, meddling. Clarkson - who is a childhood friend of Mr Wilman - and his friends appeared to be reading something in the pub . Night out: Clarkson (pictured at the pub last night) was sacked from the BBC after his 'fracas' with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon . Mr Wilman, who is a childhood friend of Clarkson (pictured with Hammond and May yesterday), also branded the BBC’s decision to sack the presenter a ‘tragedy’ Mr Wilman said the BBC originally vetoed having Clarkson, Hammond (pictured shaking hands yesterday) and May as the Top Gear line-up . ‘Their theory behind a female presenter was that if you want women to watch something, you need women presenting it. 'The problem was that most of the grown-ups in the BBC management didn't care about the car world, and basically there's this weird logic whereby the less their interest is in the subject, the greater their compulsion becomes to meddle.’ Mr Wilman sensationally resigned from the BBC yesterday, following a meeting with the three former presenters at Clarkson's flat in west London. It means he is now free to reunite with the team on a rival channel, in what would be a nightmare scenario for the corporation. Clarkson, who presented the original Top Gear series up until 2001, and Mr Wilman auditioned a series of women for the role but eventually refused to compromise on their vision of their programme. The producer said: ‘[We] had already started to realise that bloke banter was going to become an important part of the show’. They pitched the new-look programme to Jane Root, then head of BBC2, as a ‘journey into that massive black hole that is the male brain’, complete with all-male presenting line up. Root, who now runs an independent production company, said she had no problem with the lack of a woman, which Mr Wilman said displays ‘a classic case of BBC management playing their favourite game of Second Guess The Person In The Bigger Office.’ Even after winning this battle, the pair faced further problems trying to hire the team they wanted. The BBC said the Clarkson, 55, Hammond, 45, and May, 52, were ‘a bit cheese and cheese’, meaning they were too similar in age and background. Bosses blocked May’s appointment, instead opting for Jason Dawe, who Mr Wilman points out ‘was fairly middle-class and of a similar age’. He was replaced by May the following series. Mr Wilman, a childhood friend of Clarkson (pictured meeting yesterday), said the BBC pressured the pair to hire a female presenter . Clarkson, Hammond and May could reunite with Wilman to start a new motoring show on a different channel . The producer (left) said there was also a dispute over whether The Stig (right) should be named The Gimp, but this was with with racing driver Perry McCarthy . The original idea was to call him ‘The Gimp’ after the sex slave character in film Pulp Fiction but Mr Wilman revealed that McCarthy, who was the first person to take on the mantle of The Stig, insisted on this being changed. Yesterday, May ruled out returning to Top Gear without Clarkson, insisting it would be 'lame' with a new presenter in place of his sacked co-host. The 52-year-old said the BBC would be ‘stupid’ to try a version of the programme with 'a surrogate Jeremy', Hammond and himself - adding that the idea was a ‘non-starter’. His comments mean that if the show does return next year, it will likely be with an entirely new presenting team. Both May and Hammond saw their contracts finish last month. May told The Guardian: ‘Me and Hammond with a surrogate Jeremy is a non-starter, it just wouldn’t work. That would be lame, or “awks” as young people say. ‘It has to be the three of us. You can’t just put a surrogate Jeremy in and expect it to carry on. It would be forced. I don’t believe they would be stupid enough to try that. ‘It doesn’t mean I won’t go back - we may all go back in the future. It might just be we have a break from it. I don’t know. It would be a bloody tough call to do Top Gear without Jeremy.’ Former X Factor host Dermot O'Leary, model Jodie Kidd and Great British Bake Off host Sue Perkins have all been named as possible replacements for Clarkson. Speaking after the meeting yesterday, May said he had just been 'having a pint' with his co-stars and Mr Wilman, adding that he still didn't know what he would do in the future. While the three presenters have all now left Top Gear, they will still reunite for their live stadium tour later this year - now called Clarkson, Hammond & May Live. A BBC spokeswoman said: 'These comments from Andy Wilman were made in an article published last week before his resignation. Furthermore, the comments refer to events more than a decade ago.' DERMOT O'LEARY (6/4) Bookmakers’ favourite O'Leary, 41, is currently being lined up to host a different prime-time BBC One motoring show - after ending his eight-year stint as host of ITV's The X Factor last month. PHILIP GLENISTER (11/4) Car enthusiast Glenister, 52, known for playing a politically-incorrect police detective in TV series Life on Mars, is presenting the second series of For the Love of Cars on Channel 4. JODIE KIDD (5/1) The 36-year-old model owns a number of cars, co-presents The Classic Car Show on Channel 5 and achieved one of the fastest lap times as a Top Gear 'Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car'.

Favourites: Presenter Dermot O'Leary, actor Philip Glenister, model Jodie Kidd and motorcyclist Guy Martin . CHRIS EVANS (8/1) BBC Radio 2 host Evans, 49, another well-known car enthusiast, has been tipped as a favourite - but told listeners last month that claims he would replace Clarkson were 'absolute nonsense'. SUE PERKINS (10/1) Great British Bake Off host Sue Perkins, 45, was named as the favourite a fortnight ago, but this prompted a barrage of abusive tweets from ‘blokes wishing me dead’, which saw her quit Twitter. STEPHEN FRY (14/1) QI presenter Stephen Fry, 57, has appeared on Top Gear twice - but has been repeatedly prosecuted for speeding and managed to crash and write off the Reasonably-Priced Car.

"The Apple Watch is officially going on sale today - but none of its stores will have them in stock . Apple launches its first smartwatch today - but anyone turning up to buy one from a store will be disappointed. For although the Apple Watch is officially going on sale, none of its locations will have them in stock. Instead, consumers willing to shell out between $549 to $17,000 - for the gold edition - have to pre-order the watches online and wait for their arrival until June. Usually, Apple launches generate long lines outside stores. But analysts believe the company feared the lines might be embarrassingly short and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang. In fact, despite the high price and some skepticism that consumers are eager to adopt a new generation of wearable technology, pre-orders have far exceeded expectations. As a result, the company's initial production run is simply not large enough to ensure that watches will be available in stores from today. Analysts believe Apple is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year. The watch includes a host of personal trackers, including a heart rate monitor, and is being billed as a personal doctor that will help users to lose weight and improve their health. However, Apple also wants it to be seen as style statement and fashion accessory, with customers able to choose from any of 38 variants depending on the case and watch strap. As a result, limited supplies have been given to six designer outlets around the world, which will apparently be sold to a few select customers by appointment today. The launch of the watch into stores is being handled by Apple retail chief, Angela Ahrendts, who is very familiar with the world of designer labels. She told Apple staff via video message earlier this week that the decision to make the watch only available through online orders is because demand has exceeded supply. In it she said: 'We know that you have been bombarded with questions from customers. 'Luckily, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We know they are excited about the Watch ...but there are a lot of questions about availability and timing etc. 'Last week we announced that due to the high global interest and the initial supply that we would only be taking orders online right now.

"Kansas City Royals match against rivals the Chicago White Sox descended into a mass brawl yesterday. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight in the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field,  Illinois. A heated exchange between Royals starter Yordano Ventura and White Sox outfielder Adam Eaton sparked the brawl which saw players from both dugouts and bullpens flood the field, reported New York Daily News. Chicago White Sox's Jeff Samardzija, center, in the brawl with Kansas City Royals players during the seventh inning of Thursday's game . Several punches were thrown and  Ventura, along with fellow teammates Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez, was sent off along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija. Thursday's match began to get scrappy after the White Sox's Jose Abreu was hit in the arm by  Ventura's pitch in the fourth inning. The very next inning, Royals' Mike Moustakas was also hit in the arm, this time by a pitch from Chris Sale, leading to a warning for both teams. But things continued to escalate until Eaton hit a comebacker (a ball batted directly back to the pitcher) at Ventura in the seventh inning. The Royals starter picked up a ground ball but instead of throwing it to first for the out, he appeared to stop for a moment and stare at the pitcher. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight after the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field, Illinois . The pair exchanged words, and Eaton is alleged to have shouted an expletive at Ventura, who was said to have shouted one back before he threw to first base to end the inning. Things quickly turned ugly and both players had to be kept apart by teammates and umpires. But the whole of both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches. The fight was beginning to calm down and Moustakas was escorting Ventura back to the dugout when Samardzija charged at Cain. However, he missed knocked over coach Mike Jirschele instead. Ventura told ESPN Chicago he regretted the way he'd handled himself. 'It was a messy situation, I got the ground ball and was unable to control my emotions in that play, and it turned out ugly,' Ventura said. Several punches were thrown and Kansas City's Ventura, Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez were ejected along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija (pictured going down) The whole of both teams ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and even a few punches in the brawl . '(Eaton) said something to me. I responded back to him,' he said. 'It wasn't my intention, but maybe he interpreted it from the way I fielded the ball, but it was a hard comebacker, kind of put me off-balance, at which point I took those steps that incited him and he responded back, clearly emotional.' Royals won the game 3-2 in 13 innings, which is the first of a four-game series. This is not the first time the Royals have had tensions with other teams. Last weekend, their clash with Oakland Athletics landed scrappy Ventura with a fine for his actions. He was also  involved in the team's disagreements with the Los Angeles Angels. In the three-game series against the Athletics, the teams clashed almost every match until five players and coaches were thrown out of the finale. They included Royals reliever Kelvin Herrera, who threw that fastball behind the head of Brett  Lawrie and pointed to his own head in a threatening manner. He received a five-game suspension.","Thursday's match between  two baseball heavyweights turned into a brawl .

"Are you partial to a prawn mayo sandwich, drawn by the lure of a shrimp cocktail on a menu? Once only enjoyed by the affluent, prawns are now a healthy, cheap option filling supermarkets, sandwich bars and restaurants across the world. But have you ever stopped to think about where the ones you're eating have come from? Forget sun-kissed seas and a lone fisherman casting his nets into the Indian Ocean to haul in his catch. For a new report shows that idyllic picture could not be further from the truth. A new study by experts at Consumer Reports in the US has found 60 per cent of packaged prawns tested were found to contain traces of harmful bacteria . Experts in the US found the majority of the shrimp sold on supermarket shelves arrive there after starting life on vast prawn farms in south east Asia. Many prawns sold in the UK also come from places such as Thailand and Indonesia. They tested 342 packages of frozen shrimp - 284 raw and 58 cooked samples - from large, chain supermarkets and natural food stores in 27 cities across the US. And their investigation revealed 60 per cent of the prawns were found to have traces of  harmful bacteria, including E.coli, which can cause violent food poisoning. Furthermore, in 11 samples researchers detected antibiotics, and seven samples tested positive for MRSA - an infection that is resistant to a number of antibiotics. Other traces of bacteria included salmonella and vibrio, both of which can cause serious food poisoning. Dr Urvashi Rangan, executive director of Consumer Reports Food Safety and Sustainability Centre, warned: 'Bacteria and algae can begin to grow and disease can set in, prompting farmers to use drugs and other chemicals that can remain on the shrimp and seep into the surrounding environment. 'Vibrio is the most common cause of food poisoning from eating raw oysters. 'And even though most bacteria on shrimp would be killed during the cooking process, our test results raise real questions about how shrimp is raised, processed, and regulated.' Scientists found traces of E.coli, MRSA, salmonella and vibrio - a major cause of food poisoning . Responding to the discovery of MRSA, Dr Michael Crupain, director of the Consumer Reports Food Safety and Sustainability Centre, said: 'It's spread through contact, so if MRSA gets on your skin while you're preparing raw shrimp, it can potentially cause an infection, especially if you have an abrasion or cut.' A medium-sized shrimp farm in South-East Asia can produced close to a million pounds of prawns every year, a 'powerful incentive for farmers to maximse production', the report notes. The vast majority of prawns eaten on these shores come from such farms in India, Indonesia and Thailand. There, prawns are 'farmed' in huge industrial tanks, or shallow, man-made ponds that can stretch for acres. In some cases, 150 shrimp can occupy a single square metre. They are typically fed commercial pellets, some of which contain antibiotics to ward off disease. If the ponds are not carefully managed, 'a sludge of faecal matter, chemicals and excess food can build up and decay'. And wastewater can be 'periodically discharged' into nearby waterways. The experts advise wild shrimp, a number of samples of which were also tested, appear to be worth the higher prices. The report reveals: 'Of all the shrimp we tested, they were among the least likely to harbour any kind of bacteria or contain chemicals.' But, it is worth considering the effects on the environment, marine scientists warn. Amanda Keledjian, from the not-for-profit conservation group, Oceana, said: 'Nets dragged along the ocean floor can severely damage the sea bottom and anything that lives there.' The report goes on to state, that while estimates vary, between one and three pounds of other species, including endangered sea turtles, can be killed for every pound of shrimp caught in the wild. A large number of the prawns available on supermarket started life in vast prawn farms in Thailand, India and Indonesia. They are farmed in huge industrial tanks, or in shallow ponds, like those pictured in Krabi, above . If the ponds are not carefully managed, 'a sludge of faecal matter, chemicals and excess food can build up'. Experts said on the face of their findings it is better to opt for wild prawns over their farmed cousins . So faced with the facts, how can consumers make the right choices when it comes to which shrimp to put in their cocktail? Marianne Cufone, an environmental solicitor and executive director at Recirculating Farms Coalition, explains how you can spot a farmed prawn from their wild cousins. 'Wild shrimp often vary in size, shape, and colour because they don't all have identical genetics,' she said. 'Batches of farmed shrimp often all hatch at the same time, eat the same food and live in the same environment, so they're more likely to look the same.' And her second tip, is to look for evidence of prawn faeces. 'Look for poop, or what is politely called a 'vein',' she added. 'Frequently, shrimp farmers stop feeding shrimp before harvesting them so that the vein empties. 'If you see a dark line there's a better chance it's a real wild shrimp.'","Study found 60% of prawns tested had traces of harmful bacteria .

"Samantha Crossland escaped a custodial sentence after the £22,000 she admitted stealing from her employer and friend had been repaid in full . The daughter of a millionaire lottery winning couple who stole over £22,000 from a children’s nursery has escaped jail - after the cash was paid back. Samantha Crossland, 30, was pocketing parents’ fees being paid to the Child’s Play day nursery she worked at in a trusted position. She had been told she faced a custodial sentence unless the money was paid back and Crossland - whose parents made over a million on the lotto - handed back the cash. Nursery owner Lynda Quigley confirmed that the amount stolen - £22,642 - had been paid into her bank account on from an “S. Crossland”. It was not clear whether this was Samantha - or her mother Susan Crossland. Crossland had even been promoted to manager at the nursery by its owner who knew her and trusted her. Much of the money was taken from a cash box on the wall that parents left their fees in. Leeds Crown Court court heard that only Crossland and Mrs Quigley had keys to this. It was only when Mrs Quigley returned to the nursery in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire in early 2014, that she became aware of discrepancies in the accounts. In total these came to £22,642. Crossland was arrested and gave four no comment interviews. She later pleaded guilty to one count of theft. The court heard today that Mrs Quigley had received £22,643 via bank transfer on April 22. Crossland, of Mirfield, West Yorkshire was sentenced  to a 12-month community order and 180 hours unpaid work. Recorder Ray Singh said: 'You were in a position of significant trust by Miss Quigley. You were left alone to deal with the money, it is therefore a breach of trust. 'Staff parents and the like were no doubt finding it very difficult to understand what was happening.” Mrs Quigley, who has had the nursery for 14-years, said after the hearing: 'I feel really relieved that I’m finally going to get closure now that the court case has finished and the money taken has been repaid in full. 'I’m happy that justice has been served after what has been a very difficult year. 'But I still have no idea why she did this to me - why a good friend would betray me like this.' Crossland's parents Michael and Susan won more than £1.2 million on the lottery back in July 2008 . The money was stolen by Crossland, pictured,  from the Child's Play nursery in west Yorkshire . Crossland refused to comment on her sentence while leaving court. Crossland’s parents, Susan and Michael, hit the headlines after winning £1.2 million on the lottery in 2008. At the time of their win, mum-of-four Susan said she believed her £1,218,618 windfall was down to her late father Barrie - as she played his numbers each week in the two years since he had died. Speaking in July 2008, she said: She said: 'My win must be fate which is why I saw the feathers and won on his number line. 'During the week before the draw, I was seeing white feathers everywhere and I never know where they come from. 'Just two-days before the win, we were tickling my dog Ruby at home and a white feather just floated down from nowhere and landed on her tummy. I knew it was dad trying to say something. 'I feel he is looking out for me and he would have been so pleased for us. It’s a real shame he isn’t here to share the winnings with us after he helped us to get it.'","Samantha Crossland admitted stealing more than £22,000 from her friend .

"If all your hashtags, retweets and favourites seem overwhelming, Twitter has a solution. The site has today rolled out a new feature dubbed 'Highlights', aimed at helping users sift through the large number of tweets on their feed each day. The service provides a twice-daily summary 'of the best tweets for you, delivered via rich push notification,' Twitter's Gordon Luk said in a blog post. Twitter has rolled out a new feature aimed at helping users sift through the large number of tweets on their feed each day. Highlights is limited to English-language readers with the Twitter app installed on an Android device. To enable the feature on your account, launch the official Twitter app and bring up the three-dot icon in the top-right corner of your screen. Select Settings from the drop-down, and then press on your account name. Tap on Mobile Notifications. Scroll down until you find the new option titled Highlights and press on it. The check box should display a check mark, marking the feature as active. Twitter users who opt into the service on their Android device will see a new Highlights section in a push notification. A push notification leads to an area where users can browse popular tweets from people they know, as well as trending stories. 'We want to help you get the most out of Twitter, no matter how much time you spend with it,' said Luk. 'While your home timeline is a great place to browse through and engage with tweets, we know it can be challenging to find the time to get through everything.'

Select Settings from the drop-down, and then press on your account name. Tap on Mobile Notifications. Scroll down until you find the new option titled Highlights and press on it. The move is the latest by Twitter to boost engagement for its members amid growth which is slower than some rival social networks. 'We look at things like the accounts and conversations that are popular among people you follow, tweets from people you're closely tied to, topics and events that are trending in your area or within your network, and people that are popular or trending among people you follow,' Luk said. Highlights is being rolled out first in English for people using Android-powered devices, which can be activated in user settings. 'We're refining the experience on Android first and will consider bringing Highlights to other platforms in the future,' Luk added. Earlier this week, Twitter announced that abusive accounts will now be temporarily locked until a phone number or similar is added. The move is the latest by Twitter to boost engagement for its users amid growth which is slower than expected . An algorithm will also automatically remove abuse before you even see it. Twitter already asks users who violate its abuse guidelines to delete content, and can suspend accounts permanently if they don't. But under the new changes, Twitter has added a middle-ground. Its new enforcement option lets the support team temporarily lock abusive accounts for a set period of time, up to 12 hours. In its last quarterly update, Twitter said the number of active monthly users of the San Francisco-based one-to-many messaging service monthly grew to 288 million. This is just four million more than in the previous quarter. Twitter reports its results for the first quarter next week. Twitter's chief executive Dick Costolo recently said his site 'sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls'. In a memo, Mr Costolo said  he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action. In December, a blog post titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed  Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. For months Twitter has been rolling out features designed to rid the site of the scourge of trolls . The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, auto-populated fields, and it now requires less initial information. It has also improved the ways in which abuse can be reported to law enforcement. Last month, the site took aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the social network. Its rules now say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. Twitter said an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent. From today, Twitter users can now report indirect threats, offending accounts will be temporarily locked until a phone number or similar is added, and an algorithm will automatically remove abuse before you even see it. Twitter already asks users who violate its abuse guidelines to delete content, and can suspend accounts permanently if they don't. But under the new changes, Twitter's new enforcement option lets the support team temporarily lock abusive accounts for a set period of time, up to 12 hours. Elsewhere, Twitter has begun testing a product feature to help identify suspected abusive tweets and limit their reach by automatically removing them from a person's notifications. It has also updated its violent threats policy to include indirect tweets, or the 'threats of violence against others or promoting violence against others.'","It only works for English-language readers using an Android phone .

"Celebrities have eaten kangaroo testicles in the jungle and injured themselves while jumping off ski slopes. But B-list stars will be breathing a sigh of relief after a Spanish TV station announced it would be shelving plans to make them face their worst ordeal yet - being chased by rampaging bulls. State broadcaster RTVE has axed plans for a reality show which would have seen celebrities pitted against each other to outrun fighting bulls in Pamplona. Scroll down for video . Fifteen people have died since records began in 1924 and dozens are injured each year in the annual event . The corporation caved in after the town's authorities said they would refuse to cooperate with their proposed programme. The bull running takes part during the annual San Fermin Fiesta, and the mayor said he feared the broadcasters would turn the world famous festival into something out of Big Brother. Enrique Maya told local media outlets: 'I am completely opposed to such a programme, and if it goes ahead it will be with zero co-operation from the City Hall.' He said that city hall had been working to try and give the traditional encierro event more 'artistic and cultural value'. The town's mayor said he feared the reality TV show would turn bull running into Big Brother . He added: 'Turning San Fermin into something like Big Brother would be terrible.' Fifteen people have died since records began in 1924 and dozens are injured each year in the annual event, known as the encierro. In 2014 two people were severely injured after being gored by a frightened bull. Held since 1591, the fiesta attracts tens of thousands of foreign visitors each year for nine days of revelry, morning bull-runs and afternoon bullfights. Ernest Hemingway propelled the San Fermin fiesta to worldwide fame after writing it about it in his 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises. Held since 1591, the fiesta attracts tens of thousands of foreign visitors each year for nine days of revelry, morning bull-runs and afternoon bullfights . Alexander Fiske-Harrison, co-author and editor of 'Fiesta: How to survive the Bulls of Pamplona' dismissed the plans as 'laughable'. He told The Local, 'Imagine trying to film a B-list celebrity running with the bulls in all the madness of the fiesta. It's laughable.'","Celebrities would have competed to outrun rampaging bulls in Spanish show .

"No mechanical faults have been found on a plane that was forced to make an emergency landing when three passengers passed out and others felt sick. SkyWest Airlines flight 5622 was flying from Chicago to Connecticut when the pilot was alerted to a potential loss of cabin pressure. As an increasing number of passengers began to complain of dizzyness, and three lost consciousness, the pilot plunged the aircraft into a terrifying dive to drop 30,000 feet in just eight minutes - before landing in Buffalo, New York. But despite the calamitous events, an investigation has discovered nothing unusual about the mechanics of the plane. Scroll down for video . Emergency responders came onboard SkyWest Flight 5622 after it made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday following a reported loss of cabin pressure . Mary Cunningham, a nurse, who was on board the flight assisted one passenger who passed out, getting her oxygen. She said that the plane did not land because of just one person's medical emergency as a lot of people on board began to feel dizzy and unwell . Passenger Frank Angelo said he immediately feared for the safety of his wife and kids as the plane 'nosedived' 30,000 feet in just eight minutes . 'You could feel something in the air, something just wasn't right,' recalled one passenger before the plane plunged miles in mere minutes. Passenger Larry Johnson, right, said: 'A lot of people with their heads down praying. It just felt like a re-enactment' While federal safety officials had no explanation for what happened on the aircraft on Wednesday, aviation experts said the flight crew did the right thing by quickly descending to an altitude with life-giving oxygen levels. The situation arose about an hour after take-off, when three passengers on the Embraer 175 twin-jet from Chicago to Connecticut  lost consciousness and others began feeling dizzy and sick. Emergency nurse, Mary Cunningham, said she helped treat an unconscious passenger when another passed out beside her and others nearby started feeling faint. 'The flight attendant and myself started not feeling very well while we were in the middle of the flight helping out. I had to sit down. I was short-of-breath, light-headed [and] didn't feel great,' said Cunningham to NBC Connecticut. Initially, reports came in that a cabin door had opened during the flight, leading to dramatic loss in cabin pressure. When the plane landed at 11.40am, the FAA issued a statement saying the crew 'reported a pressurization problem and declared an emergency', shortly before landing in Buffalo. However, in a second statement the FAA put out on Wednesday afternoon, there was no mention of a 'pressurization' issue. When contacted by the LA Times to explain this, a spokesperson for the FAA would not say why the change was made. However, an official with knowledge of the incident told the LA Times that crew members did report that a door had come open at 38,000 feet and was causing 'rapid depressurization.' When the plane landed, SkyWest initially claimed that the aircraft landed 'out of an abundance of caution' because of one sick passenger and denied there was any mechanical malfunction - which conflicted with reports from people on the plane. Late on Wednesday, the airline said new information from medical personnel confirmed that 'a total of three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight'. On landing this was declared untrue and SkyWest airlines said they were examining what happened on the aircraft midflight. SkyWest spokeswoman Marissa Snow said: 'There were no reports before the unconscious passenger prior to the initiated descent, but I can't speak to what may have been the specific cause of their feeling ill.' SkyWest added that there was no indication of any problems with the doors and that its mechanics were inspecting the aircraft. Nose dive: Emergency vehicles surround a SkyWest Airlines plane, operating as United Express, that made an emergency landing at Buffalo Niagara International Airport on Wednesday . Flight 5622, from Chicago to Hartford, made an emergency landing in Buffalo . Passenger, Dave Barkley, 46, told the LA Times that he was sat near the front of the aircraft and he saw a flight attendant race to the cockpit and tell the pilot passengers were falling unconscious. Suddenly, the pilot announced the plane was going to begin an emergency landing over Detroit. 'They said there was a pressure problem with the plane,' he said. 'There was no door flying open or anything like that. It was something very gradual.' Barkley said that while the passengers were calm, he was annoyed about with public statements the airline has made. 'The way SkyWest is reporting it is that someone got sick, and they had to land,' he told the LA Times. 'But the way we understand it, they got sick because of the lack of oxygen or lack of pressure in the plane.' A nurse flying on the Embraer 175 twin-jet described a growing sense of panic and hysteria as she herself began to feel ill while treating two women who had passed out. It was at that moment the pilot took decisive action and put the plane into a steep dive rather than take any risks. 'The passenger was lethargic. She was responding but her color was off. She didn't look good. We got her some oxygen. She was much more alert after getting the oxygen,' the nurse, Mary Cunningham, tells NBC Connecticut. Cunningham says she returned to her seat once the woman felt better. It was then when she says the woman sitting behind the first passed out, as well. Then Cunningham, herself, took a turn.

I was short-of-breath, light-headed [and] didn't feel great.' Passenger Larry Johnson said, 'A lot of people with their heads down praying. It just felt like a re-enactment.' While another passenger said, 'you could just feel something in the air, something just wasn't quite right.' For nearly eight minutes, the plane descended at a very steep incline, dropping as fast as 7,000 feet per minute, while flying over Lake Erie, flight tracking service FlightAware said. The flight originated in Chicago and had been bound for Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. It landed at Buffalo Niagara International Airport in Buffalo at about 11:40 a.m. SkyWest Inc., which is based in St. George, Utah, said the jet landed safely and a passenger received medical attention before being released. An additional 15 adults and two children were evaluated upon landing, but none required treatment outside the airport, airport spokesman C. Douglas Hartmayer said. 'Anyone who said they didn't feel well was treated at the gate,' he said. 'We want to understand the circumstances and what SkyWest knows before we decide what, if any, action we would take,' said Kelly Nantel, spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board. Snow said the plane's oxygen masks did not release. According to WKBW, one passenger said the plane 'nosedived' and crew told fliers that there was a loss of cabin pressure, but that turned out not to be true. SkyWest has 29 Embraer 175s in its fleet. The aircraft seats 76 passengers with two flight attendants. In a statement, the FAA said: 'SkyWest Airlines Flight 5622, an Embraer E170 aircraft, landed safely at Buffalo International Airport at 11.40am after the crew declared an emergency.

"Conrad Clitheroe, left, and Gary Cooper, right, were thrown in jail after being arrested for writing down aircraft registration numbers in Dubai . Three British planespotters who have spent two months in prison in the United Arab Emirates after they were arrested on national security grounds have been released. Conrad Clitheroe, 54 and Gary Cooper, 45, from Stockport, along with their ex-pat friend Neil Munro were stopped by police for writing down aircraft registration numbers at Fujairah Airport. They were taken to a police station and, despite being told they would not be detained, were put into prison. Clitheroe's wife Valerie had written to British Prime Minister David Cameron to ask him to intervene in the case, raising concerns about her husband's health due to his heart murmur and high blood pressure. They were finally told earlier this week that they could return home after charges of espionage would not be brought against them. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: 'We can confirm the release of three British nationals detained in Fujairah, United Arab Emirates on February 21. 'We are providing consular assistance.' Attorney Nasser Hashem previously said the men would be free to go after the court accepted a defense argument that they were pursuing their passion for plane spotting and had no ill intent. Mr Clitheroe will now be able to return home to celebrate his first wedding anniversary with his wife  on May 9. Speaking earlier this week, Mrs Clitheroe said: 'I am absolutely ecstatic. Apart from our wedding and the birth of my children this is the best day of my life. 'I just can't wait to see him, to hug him, to hold him. 'We got a call from the lawyer to tell us he'd been in court and the case had been dropped. 'We then confirmed it with the consulate. 'I am just so happy, we've been ringing everyone to let them now. I'm in a bit of shock too, I don't feel like it can be real. 'How can you hold someone for that long with no charges? I don't understand it but I'm so so glad.' Earlier this month, Mrs Clitheroe had raised concerns because her husband had run out of blood pressure medication. Valerie Clitheroe (pictured with her husband) said both he and Mr Cooper had been keen plane spotters since boyhood and pleaded for their release . The men had travelled to Dubai for a four-day holiday on February 18. All three friends were keen to see Fujairah Airport, which is used by older and rarer aircraft. They drove the 70-mile journey there on February 21, but were stopped by an off-duty policeman after they slowed down to note the registration numbers of planes. Mr Clitheroe has always insisted they never took any photographs. Although plane spotting is not illegal in the United Arab Emirates, it is not understood and is frowned upon. The men were taken to a police station, where they were allegedly told they could only leave if they signed a form in Arabic saying they would not practise their hobby there again. But after signing the document, without asking for a translation, they were kept in custody overnight. They were brought before a prosecutor the next day and then moved to Fujairah Prison. Mr Clitheroe posted this picture on February 19 as he pursued his hobby at the Sheraton Deira Hotel in Dubai . Their case was escalated to a matter of 'national security'. Sharing a cell with over 20 others, eating on the floor and forced to stare at the four walls for most of the day, the families were concerned about their welfare - particularly as Mr Clitheroe needs medication for his heart condition. A judge last month extended their custody licence, which was up again on April 12, but an admin error delayed the hearing until this week. Mrs Clitheroe added: 'Conrad was beginning to think the worse and that they would never be released. 'Things had seemed to be so against them from the start that they thought it was going to end badly. The men were held after being seen by police writing down aircraft registration numbers at Fujairah Airport . 'We thought they would be charged with something and fined so it's come as a shock that there are no charges at all. We had started planning to go out there to deal with the lawyers face to face.' Mrs Clitheroe said the men had been keen plane spotters since they were children. The families of Mr Clitheroe and Mr Cooper were helped by charity 'Detained in Dubai' to pay £9,000 for a lawyer to fight their case. A crowd-funding site set up by the men's work colleagues has raised more than £5,000. Earlier this week, Radha Stirling, the founder of Detained in Dubai said charges of espionage against the trio had finally been dropped at the Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi. 'The charges are being dropped with no fines or penalties.

"Imran Uddin used a keyboard spying device to hack into university computers and up his exam marks . A student who tried to cheat his way to a better degree by hacking into the university computers and changing his marks has been jailed. Imran Uddin, 25, who was studying science, bought keyboard spying equipment on the internet which he then connected to a number of university computers. Through the software, which recorded key strokes, he was able to find out the passwords that staff were typing in to log in to the computers. He then used those passwords to log on to their accounts himself. After hacking into the university computer system, Uddin changed the marks that he had been given for previous assessments. On one paper, he upped his mark from 57 per cent, a lower second grade, to 73 per cent, a first. He carried out his plot using keyboard ‘shadowing’ devices which look like a USB stick and can be bought for as little as £49 on the internet. He plugged these into the back of a number of staff computers at the University of Birmingham where he was studying. The device records everything which is typed into the keyboard and saves the data. Uddin, from Birmingham, was in his final year of a bio-science course. At the time of the hacking he was expected to achieve a 2:2 degree. He was jailed for four months at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday after admitting six charges which were in breach of the Computer Misuse Act. Sentencing him, Judge James Burbridge said it was unclear why Uddin had tried to change his grades. Judge Burbridge said: ‘For reasons not entirely clear to me, whether it was monetary, or pride, or a desire to outperform others, you decided to cheat and you formed a settled intention to do that. I consider your actions were planned and persistent.’ He warned that Uddin’s behaviour could have undermined public confidence in the degree system. The judge added that he felt compelled to put Uddin behind bars as a ‘deterrence’ to others. Judge Burbridge said: ‘This kind of conduct undermines, or has the potential to undermine, public confidence in the degree system, set up by this university. I have decided I cannot pass a suspended sentence because there needs to be an element of deterrence.’ Uddin was found out after staff discovered the devices when several computers were upgraded on October 7 last year. When they removed the protective casing from the computers in the bio-science building, the spying devices were discovered. Staff then began checking other university computer equipment and a further three spying devices were found. Madhu Rai, prosecuting, said: ‘It is effectively a case where the defendant has hacked into a number of computers at the university where he was studying for a degree in bio-science.’ Miss Rai said one tracker had been attached to a computer in a ‘staff only’ area to obtain the password of employee Christine Chapman, who had access to exam grade software. Uddin (police mugshot, left, and outside court, right), who is married, was yesterday jailed for four months after admitting six breaches to the Computer Misuse Act. Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) heard how Uddin attached a 'shadowing' keyboard device at the back of a number of university computers in order to steal staff passwords . An investigation by university staff revealed that Uddin had changed the marks on five pieces of his coursework. His home was searched by police and analysis of his computer revealed that he had carried out searches for keyboard cheating devices on the online marketplace eBay. Balbir Singh, defending, said Uddin had felt pressure because he was the first person in his family to have gone to university. As a result of the need he felt to succeed, ‘he could not see clearly’, Mr Singh said. He added: ‘It is very unlikely that any other university will touch him after this. This is not a case where he was hopelessly failing and was not going to be able to succeed.’","Imran Uddin, 25, used a keyboard spying device to obtain staff passwords .

"A couple from Louisville Kentucky shared the tragic story of how they accidentally killed their 18-month-old son on Thursday. Brian Bayers tearfully told WAVE how he was preparing to take his son back to day-care on February 13 when he went outside to warm up his truck and drive it closer to the house. Bayers thought his son Jackson was playing inside but when he got out of his truck he noticed that the back door of his house was wide open. Scroll down for video . Tearful memory: Brian Bayers tearfully recalled how he accidentally backed over his 18-month-old son . Shattered: Brian and Amanda Bayers are heartbroken after accidentally killing their son Jackson in February . Crushed: Jackson was hit by the front wheels of the vehicle backing up and when the front wheels back around, he essentially walked right into the side of the vehicle . After going back inside his house to find he son missing, he made the horrifying realization that he backed over Jackson with his truck. Jackson was hit by the front wheels of the vehicle backing up and when the front wheels back around, he essentially walked right into the side of the vehicle. 'When I got out of the truck, I hopped out of the truck to run to the back door and hopped up on the stoop and the back door was wide open,' Brian said. Bayer said he wishes he could have done something to prevent his son's cruel fate and describes himself as the kind of father who would check the floor to make sure there was no change or small objects his son could accidentally swallow. 'I went flying out the back door basically to see him on the driveway, and um…he had already been hit at that point in time and I had backed over him,' he added. 'I never saw him at any point in time. Jackson was hit by the front wheels of the vehicle backing up.

Amanda told WAVE she rushed home and held her sons lifeless and bloodied body for hours. 'I immediately wanted to hold him and held him for hours,' Amanda told WAVE. 'I think just kissed him and rocked him, we took him back to his room. I just kept saying, ""Why?""'she added. The Bayers say they are sharing their story so that other parents don't make the same mistake. They say that parents should have some kind of safety lock and not leave door open if their child is unattended, even momentarily. 'If we can save one child’s life by this and prevent one family from the kind of devastation that we have faced, that will be his legacy,' Brian said.

"Some people like to run with a dog as a companion, while others use a ‘smart’ accessory to keep track of the progress they’ve made. But now a team of researchers has devised a new jogging buddy - a drone that flies with you to keep you company. And they claim robotic companions could be used for a variety of other physical activities such as cycling, cross-country skiing and rowing. Scroll down for video . Australian researchers have tested their drone running companion. Called Joggobot (shown) it is designed to float in front of jogger when they run. The technology could allow it to track the speed and direction of the runner. And it could be used for other sports like cycling and rowing . The research, by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia, reported Popular Science, was presented at the Computer-Human Interaction Conference in Seoul. In their paper, the researchers explained how they asked 13 joggers to run for an average of 26 minutes with a drone - specifically a quadcopter - as a companion. The goal was to see if a drone could motivate a runner to keep their pace up, and provide a companion that helped them stay fit. In this experiment, the quadcopters were programmed to follow a set path and speed, which the joggers also followed. The drone was designed to fly 13ft (four metres) in front of the jogger at a height of 10ft (three metres). Each participant was fitted with a Go Pro camera and, after finishing their run of between 15 and 40 minutes, gave their thoughts on having a robot companion. Most said that they found it was a good ‘pace keeper’, especially on straight sections of their run. Technology has been developed where a drone could lock onto a pattern on a runner’s shirt in order to track their speed and direction, although this hasn't been implemented yet. However, the researchers said their’s was ‘the first system that has been successfully deployed in an outdoor setting.’ ‘It forces you to go a certain pace, pushes you a bit further,’ said one runner. ‘If I was running by myself, I think my pace would vary a bit more, this is a more set pace.' Ultimately, it seemed that the runners felt a sense of ‘peer pressure’ similar to how one might feel if they were running with a human companion. In this experiment, the quadcopters were programmed to follow a set path, which the joggers also followed. However, technology has been developed where a drone could lock onto a pattern on a runner’s shirt in order to track their speed and direction (shown) There were some concerns from the runners, though; occasionally the quadcopter would deviate from its path, leading them to question their safety. And it also wobbled in the wind, which one runner likened to it having a personality of its own. One also noted that they ‘felt a bit awkward with a camera on my head and jogging with a robot.’ But they added: ‘I’m jogging with a robot, and people think it’s rad.’ The researchers think their study could help design flying robots that support joggers, and it could even be used for other sports as well such as cycling, cross-country skiing, rowing or even fun runs. Some runners may have dogs as jogging companions now, but will be using robots in the future? The team hope their research could inspire new ways to perform such activities . In a cycling scenario, the researchers say the drone could create a draft, ‘providing a psychological and maybe even physical boost.’ Other drones could display encouraging messages to keep motivation high. ‘Overall, our work aims to inspire other designers to utilise robotic systems to support exertion activities,’ the researchers concluded. There's no news yet on when - or if - this technology will be available to the public, though.","Australian researchers have tested their drone running companion .

"Aussie the dog had always been very protective of his owners Kai, seven, and Sophie, 10. But now their beloved pet is being remembered as a hero after he saved the two children from being electrocuted to death in a puddle in the aftermath of the New South Wales storms. Their family home at Caves Beach, near Lake Macqurie, had lost power so on Wednesday the children's mother Natalie Crane-Hayes decided take Kai, Sophie and Aussie for a walk in a nearby park. Scroll down for video . Aussie the dog (centre) saved his owners Kai (left) and Sophie (right) from being electrocuted in a puddle . The family were walking near their home at Caves Beach, near Lake Macquarie, when he was killed suddenly in a puddle that was connected to a fallen live electrical wire . Aussie – who the kids brought home on Australia Day this year - was always protective of the children . The park was full of large puddles and they didn't know it at the time, but the wild weather had caused a power line to fall down into one of the puddles meaning all the water in the park was live with electrical current. Five-month-old Aussie was walking just ahead of the kids and when he stepped into the first puddle he was electrocuted and died instantly. 'Honestly those kids were only a metre away,' their grandmother Deanna Addicoat told Daily Mail Australia. 'It would have been both of them because they would have followed the other one in. 'Aussie's our hero, he saved their lives.' Ms Addicoat said the kids were traumatised. Their grandmother Deanna Addicoat said the children were traumatised after seeing their dog die . Kai and Aussie shared a special bond and he is buried under a tree outside Kai's bedroom window . 'It wasn't something nice to see… Seeing an animal killed is not nice but for him to be electrified in front of them,' she said. They had to wait for emergency services to come and cut the wire before they could move Aussie from the puddle. 'The SES were excellent because they've got so much work on up here,' Ms Addicoat said. 'Once they knew there was a live wire and danger, Ausgrid came out and they were just so compassionate.' Ms Addicoat said the family hoped the tragedy would remind people about the danger of fallen power lines.

"A Wisconsin judge denied a request Friday to move a 12-year-old girl, accused of stabbing a classmate to please the horror character Slender Man, to a psychiatric treatment center. Morgan Geyser, along with her friend Anissa Weier, 13, are being tried as adults for attempted first-degree intentional homicide in the attack on Payton Leutner, who survived 19 stab wounds in Waukesha in May 2014. Geyser's attorney, Anthony Cotton, applied to have her $500,000 bail reduced so that she could get out of jail and seek treatment for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. However the Waukesha County circuit judge said Geyser was a flight risk, and even though she is young, she was capable of plotting a sophisticated plan to murder someone. Scroll down for video . In need of treatment: Morgan Geyser, 12, has been remanded on $500,000 for attempted murder charges. Her lawyer's motion to have the bail reduced so that she could move to a mental hospital was denied Friday . Charged: Morgan Geyser is seen here in a Wisconsin court room in June 2014 as she was arraigned for the attempted murder of Payton Leutner. Geyser's attorney's now say she is schizophrenic . Cotton said his client has no way to get anywhere and that any allegations of violence have been limited to the stabbing and are connected to her mental illness. 'She has no transport, no car, no friends, no money,' he said. 'She's not any sort of flight risk.' The judge did, however, say that Geyser's long term placement in an appropriate facility should be considered, but no hearing or action was set for that. Cotton said his client's parents were sad at the outcome of the hearing and that he would look for a more secure mental health facility for his client. Cotton's client has a hearing in June to determine if her case should be moved to juvenile court, where Cotton said there is more funding available for mental treatment. A similar hearing for Anissa Weier is set for next month. Eerie This is one of Morgan Geyser's sketches. The frightening picture is of a girl, who appears to be cat-like and armed with a scythe, standing over a dead girl while saying 'I love killing people' Satanic symbols: Geyser's dolls, displayed in court in Waukesha in February, were marked with cuts and had Slender Man and Satanic symbols on them . Strange embrace: The Slender Man character is known for stalking and abducting children and became popular after fans of the creation did their own drawings of him . State of mind: This sketch will be used by the defense to claim that their client was and is mentally unfit and should stand trial as an adult for murder . Wisconsin law requires anyone accused of certain serious crimes to be charged as adults if they are 10 or older. According to a criminal complaint, the girls plotted for months before they lured Payton, their former friend, into some woods after a sleepover in May 2014 and attacked her. They told investigators they hoped it would please Slender Man, a fictional online ghoul they had read about in horror stories. During a preliminary hearing in February, a notebook in which Geyser would draw disturbing pictures and messages, was presented to the court. One of the grotesque cartoons depicts a young cat-like girl armed with a scythe standing over a dead girl with a speech bubble that says, 'I love killing people'. Other writings and cartoons profess her admiration and devotion to the Slender Man urban myth. The sketchings will be a central part of the defense team's claim that Geyser is mentally unfit to stand trial as an adult. If the two girls are tried as adults and found guilty they will face up to 60 years in prison. Consequences: If convicted, Geyser (left) and Weier (right) could face up to 65 years in prison. But if tried in juvenile court, they would not be held past age 25 . Victim: Peyton Leutner was able to drag herself out from the woods where she was stabbed 19 times and has since recovered. Emergency responders said it was a miracle she survived . Decision: Circuit Judge Michael Bohren ruled Friday that Geyser is a flight risk and should remain in jail . Along with the sketches, the court was also presented with the mutilated body of one of Geyser's Barbie dolls, which had its hair and limbs cut and what appeared to be satanic markings drawn onto the torso. In addition to that was a list of 'supplies necessary' which included a 'map of forest' and 'weapons (kitchen knife).' Neither of the suspects has entered a plea as the attorneys attempt to get the charges changed. The two girls' attorneys have never denied they attacked and stabbed Leutner, but claim they were so disturbed they truly believed the Slender Man - a popular online urban myth - would kill their own families in three seconds if they did not do his bidding. Psychologist Deborah Collins testified that she has interviewed the Geyser several times and concluded she honestly believes Slender Man exists. '(Her belief) hasn't wavered and it's been unyielding to a rational perspective,' Collins testified. Collins also testified that the girl told her she uses Vulcan mind control to keep negative emotions at bay and believes Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort visits her when he's not away on business trips. Mentally ill: A court-appointed psychologist testified in August that Geyser, who told police she stabbed the victim more than a dozen times, heard voices and believed she could communicate with Slender Man and other fictional characters, especially ones from Harry Potter . In December, Anissa Weier was cleared for trial. A psychiatrist testified that she understood her charges and was mentally competent. According to court documents, the girls told detectives they had been planning to kill Peyton Leutner for months. They are accused of luring her to a park in the Milwaukee suburb of Waukesha on May 31 and stabbing her 19 times. Leutner barely survived; one stab wound just missed her heart. The alleged attackers were found walking toward the Nicolet National Forest, where they say they thought they would join Slender Man. All three girls were 12 years old at the time of the incident. The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009. Unnerving: The Slender Man with one of his chosen victims as depicted in a popular online meme . The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit. The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia. It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport. It is understood to have originated in a Photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009. It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'. The character has developed its own life online, with two feature-length films funded in part by Kickstarter appearing in 2012. The meme that appears most is that of a tall malevolent figure, who silently stalks down his prey. Over the past six or so years, the Slender Man meme has mutated liked all good scary stories into one that haunts the minds of those who become obsessed with it.","Morgan Geyser, 12, is remanded on $500,000 bail for the first-degree attempted murder of Payton Leutner in Waukesha May 2014 .

"Sirloin, topside and fillet are best saved for the roasting pan, chuck flank, rib-eye and skirt on the grill and when stewing go for brisket, shoulder and ribs. If you're roasting a joint this Sunday, remember that thyme and red wine make perfect partners and don't forget to scrape the roasting dish for juices to make a fresh delicious gravy. And when looking for a good cut of meat to grill or use for steak and fajitas, you want cuts that have a good marbling of fat. Research by Asda has found that rump, fillet and T-Bone are the most popular cuts of meat when eating out but when we cook at home the majority of us (55 per cent) rely on burgers or mince. The supermarket's study also showed a showing lack of beef knowledge in the under 35's, which was highlighted further by the extensive knowledge of their senior counterparts. One in four youngsters think pocket and Y-bone are cuts of beef, whereas only a mere 3 per cent of over 55s fell for the fake cuts. In addition, this age bracket correctly identified shin (78 per cent) and skirt (72 per cent) as cuts of beef widely available across the UK but for the younger folk, those figures more than halved. Over a quarter of under 35's avoid trying unusual cuts of beef because they assume it will be too expensive while 30 per cent admitted they had never been shown how to cook a cut of beef. A fifth of 18-34-year-olds also admitted they find larger cuts of beef daunting to cook. Although half of Brits in their 20s would happily choose rump steak on the menu at a restaurant, they lack the confidence or know-how to cook it at home and therefore rely on the staples of mince and burgers to feed their beefy cravings. Neil Moorcroft buying manager for beef at Asda said: 'It's probably fair to say our grandparent's generation are more likely to have been brought up on a varied diet of beef cuts depending on what was available from the local butcher. 'However busy lifestyles and a shift in family mealtimes has altered this over the years, which is why it's become easy to fall into the same old shopping and cooking routines. 'But it's never too late to experiment and beef up those cooking skills, so if you get stuck just ask for tips at your local butcher's counter'. 'Bigger cuts of meat can be daunting, but they have great versatility, value for money and are definitely worth getting to grips with.' Best for Roasting . Preparing a roast can be daunting, but the cuts below are always a safe bet for any Sunday roast. Sirloin . Topside . Top Rump . Fillet . Get your roast on: . 1. Allow it to reach room temperature before cooking. 2. On a medium to high hob heat, seal the beef joint in a large frying pan with a touch of oil ensuring all sides are sealed by turning the joint every two to three minutes. 3. Transfer to a oven roasting dish and seasoning with salt and pepper, place into a preheated oven (190c/fan 170c) and allow to cook for 20 minutes per 500g for a juicy medium cooked joint. 4. Remove meat from roasting tray and allow to rest on a plate in a warm area for 15-20 minutes before serving use the roasting dish and juices to make a fresh delicious gravy. 5. Thyme and red wine is a perfect partner for roast beef. Best for Grilling . When looking for a good cut of meat to grill or use for steak and fajitas, you want cuts which have a good marbling of fat and also a tender joint which doesn't need to be beaten or stewed in order to bring out the flavours. Go for: . Flank . Skirt . Sirloin . Ribeye bone-in . Become a grill master: . 1. If you've bought a cheaper cut such as flank or top blade then marinating these meats first (overnight if possible) will really help to tenderize them . 2. Use a red hot grill pan which sizzles when you add the steak and try not to push it around or turn it too quickly if you want to create those famous griddle marks . 3. Similarly to a roast, let the steaks rest for five minutes before eating to allow meat to relax and become more tender. Best for Stewing . These cuts of beef are often the most cost effective because they require that extra bit of love and care in the kitchen, but don't let the time put you off. The flavours are well worth the wait for a tasty bubbling stew. Brisket . Shoulder . Beef ribs . Shank . Stew your way to success: . 1. Low and slow is the key phrase here, so get yourself a heavy bottomed casserole pot or slow cooker, and plenty of stock to allow for a long slow cook . 2. Preparation is easy, any veg can simply been thrown in at the start and left to bubble away . 3. Four hours should result in tender chunks of beef ready to accompany sides such as mash, dumplings or Yorkshire puds .","Rump, fillet and T-Bone most popular cuts of meat when dining out .

"Petrol heads, take note. The world's best road has just been announced. There are few things as thrilling as accelerating past breathtaking countryside views, and now we know where to find the most thrilling stretch of tarmac possible. The N-222 road from Peso de Regua to Pinhao in Portugal has been awarded the prestigious honour. The N-222 road from Peso de Regua to Pinhao in Portugal has been awarded Best Road in the World . The highway has been named the best in the world for its location, cutting through the heart of the stunning Douro Valley and the spectacular views it provides of the wine region below. The road takes drivers along the River Douro and the picturesque regional wine towns of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Stretching for 27 km, the road includes heart-stopping 93 bends and jaw dropping scenery. If you can't make the trip to Portugal there are, apparently, many roads in the UK to get the pulse racing. A591 from Kendal to Keswick offers beautiful views of the banks of Lake Windermere . Avis, a car rental company who collated the data, found the A591 from Kendal to Keswick in the Lake District to be Britain's best road. The spectacular 30-mile stretch in the Lake District National Park features a winding section, offering beautiful views of Lakeland fells and the banks of Lake Windermere and Lake Thirlmere. The road was a frequent source of inspiration for poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, and whilst en route, it is even possible to see two of Wordsworth's former houses, in the pretty village of Grasmere.

USA - Highway 1 from Castroville to Big Sur, California . USA - The Overseas Highway from Long Point Key to Florida Keys . USA - Tail of the Dragon, North Carolina . Other celebrated UK roads include the B3515 in Somerset and A535 in Cheshire. The B3515, which runs from Cheddar to Ashwick, features 14 miles of glorious Somerset countryside, with cliff faces rising either side of the road and twists and turns a-plenty due to the gorge dictating the route. The UK's third best road, the A535, runs from Holmes Chapel to Alderley Edge in Cheshire, on which drivers pass the iconic 76 metre-wide, 90 metre-tall, Grade I listed Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank. The road continues with some long straights to finish, allowing drivers to relax zoom along the final portion. According to them, there are a number of factors to take into account when determining the  best driving road. They call it the Avis Driving Ratio (ADR). Italy did well in the list scoring points for Portofino Vetta to Italy Portofino and The Amalfi Coast route . In order to create the ratio, Avis recruited experts from across quantum physics, F1 track design, high performance cars and even a world renowned British designer of rollercoasters. 'There are four key phases of a drive,' said eminent quantum physicist, Dr Mark Hadley, who led the research. 'Bends, acceleration, cruising and braking.' 'A great driving road strikes just the right balance between the phases so you get the exhilaration of speed and acceleration whilst corners test your driving capabilities and long stretches allow you to enjoy the scenery.' 'In creating the Avis Driving Ratio (ADR) we have calculated the optimum balance between those components, to scientifically establish the world's best driving roads.' The ratio has been designed to  end longstanding debate amongst car enthusiasts. The US featured on the list  and won plaudits for the Big Sur in California and the Overseas Highway in Florida . To inform and develop the ADR Dr Hadley used the geometry of the road and driving style together with the average acceleration, lateral acceleration, braking times and distances of a range of the cars on offer in the Avis Prestige fleet: Porsche Carrera 911, Jaguar XKRS and Mercedes E350. The ADR was then tested with legendary F1 track designer, Hermann Tilke and world renowned roller coaster designer, John Wardley. 'Our winning road gives drivers the right balance of tight corners with longer stretches of road. This creates a thrilling and varied driving experience that tests the driver's capabilities and provides opportunities to experience the performance of the car, whilst also giving the driver time to enjoy breathtaking panoramic views,' commented Mark Servodidio, Managing Director, Avis UK, who commissioned the research. In second place overall was Big Sur in California.

"These images show a bizarre ritual in eastern India where villagers, including children as young as 10, roast themselves above an open fire in the hope it will bring them good luck. Revellers in the remote village in Jharkhand state tie themselves upside down onto a wooden pole that hand hangs just feet above a raging fire. Seconds later they throw themselves into the flames. Locals believe that the unusual practice helps protect the village from drought and disease, adding that criticism over the safety is misguided and there are no reports of those taking part ever being injured. Unusual: Villagers, including children as young as 10, roast themselves over the open fire in the hope it will bring them good luck . Show of strength: Locals believe that the unusual practice helps protect the village from drought and disease, adding that criticism over the safety is misguided and there are no reports of those taking part ever being injured. The annual fire festival lasts for 11 days and sees dozens of participants dangle over the flames while a Hindu priest uses oil to stoke the blaze as he chants religious hymns. 'It is done to protect the village from natural calamities like famine, drought, and spread of deadly diseases. It brings good luck to the village,' said Arun Nayak, 16, one of the participants. 'Anyone between 10 and 65 years of age is eligible to participate in the ritual,' he added. 'We are not scared. My parents and friends have been doing it for years now. No one ever has been hurt...,God Shiv and Goddess Parvati watches over us,' the villager went on to say. Mr Nayak said he enjoys the thrill of hanging over the fire and feels proud to be one of the participants. The ritual, locally known as Chutiya Manda Puja, is organized every year to 'protect the village from natural calamities and epidemics'. Burn: Revellers in a remote village in Jharkhand state tie themselves upside down onto a wooden pole that hand hangs just feet above the fire . Raging: Seconds later the participants throw themselves into the flame while a Hindu priest (left) throws oil to intensify the inferno . An ardent participant, 52-year-old Munna Kirkey, said that participants have to adhere to a strict diet to prepare for what is known as Agni Pareeksha, meaning trial by fire. 'We start consuming Bengal gram and jaggery sorbet 10 days before the trial starts and stay away from sinning,' Mr Kirkey said. 'Hanging over the fire is the ultimate test of our austerity...If participants don't follow the rules they will vomit during the fire test and may even get burns,' he added. However, Mr Kirkey pledges that so far, there has been no such incident. Those who pass the hanging fire test are eligible to proceed on to the next state - to walk on ambers. Raju Sahu, 40, who has been participating in the ritual for last 40 years, believes the ritual is important for the betterment of the community. 'If we don't perform the rituals anything can happen. In my lifetime I have never missed to participate and my children will follow me,' says Sahu. Challenge: Those who pass the hanging fire test are eligible to proceed on to the next state of the ceremony, walking on ambers . Religious: The annual fire festival lasts for 11 days and sees dozens of participants dangle over the flames while a Hindu priest uses oil to stoke the blaze as he chants religious hymns . Devotees from all over eastern India flock the venue. Baffled on-lookers gather around the fire to catch a glimpse of participants performing this 'miracle'. The villagers claim the festival is being celebrated from thousands of years, however they say now the duration has been trimmed because of rapid urbanisation in the area. 'In fact, they have also made amendments to the ritual. Earlier a participant was hanged with an iron hook inserted into his flesh, which now has been replaced with tying with a cloth,' said one of the villagers who had come to watch the ritual. Vijay Kumar Sahu, 63, who has been organising the festival for the past 52 years, also fears that there had been too many changes made in the ritual. 'People are making it easier now and follow only what suits them. I fear this ritual would gradually be phased out or at worst invite god's wrath,' said Sahu.","Locals in the remote area of Jharkhand state believe the ceremony has the power to protect their village .

An official police statement claimed Bolina was attacked by prisoners when she was seen performing a sex act on herself in her cell and that officers were forced to intervene. It added that the injuries were the result of a struggle in which, police claim, she bit an officer on the ear.

Outraged supporters of Veronica Bolina (pictured) have set up campaign groups on the internet demanding the right for LGBT people to be treated fairly . The 25-year-old had previously been arrested over an alleged attack on her 73-year-old neighbour, it has been reported . The photos of her badly swollen eyes and mouth have been widely shared on the internet with outraged supporters setting up campaign groups on the internet demanding the right for LGBT people to be treated fairly. One supporter, Susane Montalvo Sarabia, said: 'It is just sickening that in this day and age such things as this still happen. 'They have pulverised that poor woman's face and are now trying to cover it up. Whether she is innocent, guilty, transgender or straight doesn't matter. 'The police should not be allowed to do this to anyone.' Authorities in Sao Paulo say they are now investigating the matter. A spokesman for the prosecutors office said she had been moved to a detention centre where she has an individual cell until the court case. Brazilian police officers kill on average six people every day according to the Sao Paulo-based Forum on Public Safety. The NGO collated figures between 2009 and 2013 which showed police killed more than 11,000 people. In comparison, police and law enforcement officers in the United States took 30 years to kill 11,000 people. According to a report released by the organisation: 'The empirical evidence shows that Brazilian police make abusive use of lethal force to respond to crime and violence.' However, Brazil is an incredibly violent country with one murder approximately every ten minutes. Many of those killed by Brazilian police are recorded as being shot 'while evading arrest'.","Pictures show Veronica Bolina face down on the ground in a Sao Paulo jail .

"No video captured what happened to Freddie Gray inside the police van where officers heaved him into a metal compartment after pinning him to a sidewalk. The cause of his fatal spine injury has not been revealed. But a troubling detail emerged as hundreds of protesters converged on City Hall again Thursday: He was not only handcuffed and put in leg irons, but left without a seat belt during his trip to the station, a police union's lawyer said. Unbelted detainees have been paralyzed and even killed by rough rides in what used to be called 'paddy wagons.' It even has a name: 'nickel rides,' referring to cheap amusement park thrills. 'Deadly nickel ride': Gray, 25, was arrested on April 12 in Baltimore and died a week later from a severe spinal injury that may have been caused when he was shackled and driven to the police station in a paddy wagon without being strapped into a seatbelt . 'Nickel rides' have caused spinal injuries in the past and Baltimore police epartment rules were updated nine days before Gray's arrest stating that all detainees shall be strapped in by seat belts or other device . Police brutality against prisoners being transported was addressed just six months ago in a plan released by Baltimore officials to reduce this misconduct. Department rules updated nine days before Gray's arrest clearly state that all detainees shall be strapped in by seat belts or 'other authorized restraining devices' for their own safety after arrest. Gray was not belted in, said attorney Michael Davey, who represents at least one of the officers under investigation. But he took issue with the rules. Gray died on Sunday, April 19, after he 'had his spine 80 per cent severed at his neck' while in police custody . 'Policy is policy, practice is something else,' particularly if a prisoner is combative, Davey told The Associated Press. 'It is not always possible or safe for officers to enter the rear of those transport vans that are very small, and this one was very small.' Assistant Police Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said Gray was secured by 'leg irons' after he became agitated during the trip, but the department hasn't said whether he was buckled in with a seat belt. The Gray family's lawyer, Billy Murphy, said 'his spine was 80 percent severed' while in custody. It's not clear whether he was injured by officers in the street or while being carried alone in the van's compartment. But if it happened on the way to the station, it wouldn't be the first such injury in Baltimore: Dondi Johnson died of a fractured spine in 2005 after he was arrested for urinating in public and transported without a seat belt, with his hands cuffed behind his back. 'We argued they gave him what we call a `rough ride,'' at high speed with hard cornering, said Attorney Kerry D. Staton. 'He was thrown from one seat into the opposite wall, and that's how he broke his neck.' Staton obtained a $7.4 million judgment for the family, later reduced to the legal cap of $200,000. It also has happened in Philadelphia, where police in 2001 barred transportation of prisoners without padding or belts after The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the city had paid $2.3 million to settle lawsuits over intentionally rough rides, which permanently paralyzed two people. Two arrests: Demonstrators block Martin Luther King Boulevard as they march to the Western District Police Station to protest the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore on Thursday. As evening turned into night on Thursday, two protesters had been arrested for disorderly conduct . Rally continues: Protesters on Thursday night were continuing a rally at Baltimore Police station just blocks from where Freddie Gray was arrested . Charges: Demonstrators gesture towards police as they protest the death of Freddie Gray, an African American man who died of spinal cord injuries in police custody, possibly as a result of misconduct on the part of six city police officers . Members of the Baltimore Police Department stand guard outside the department's Western District police station during a protest for Freddie Gray on Thursday . Angela Hazel (C) reacts near City Hall during a protest against the death of Freddie Gray Hazel said 'I lost my child to the streets, too. My only child...' Gray fled on foot and was captured on April 12 after an officer 'made eye contact' with him outside a public housing complex, police said. Videos show Gray screaming on the ground before being dragged, his legs limp, into a van. Witnesses said he was crying out in pain. Kevin Moore, a friend of Freddie Gray's who recorded video of his arrest, told The Baltimore Sun that police had Gray's legs bent 'like he was a crab or a piece of origami.' On Thursday, demonstrators briefly scuffled with police while some threw bottles of water and debris at officers. Police said  one man was arrested for assault, and another for destruction of property during the noisy march from City Hall to the Western District police station. The march snarled rush-hour traffic and drew onlookers in Baltimore's Inner Harbor, its premier tourist attraction. Chanting 'Tell the truth! Stop the lie! Freddie didn't have to die,' protesters ended outside the Western District station facing off with police behind metal barricades. Protesters for Freddie Gray stand outside the Baltimore Police Department's Western District police station. The protest was peaceful, though some in the crowd hurled insults at the officers behind the fence, who stared back stone-faced . More than 50 officers manned a barricade surrounding the station, separating them from the protesters . Demonstrators march to the Western District Police Station to protest the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore on Thursday as the days-long protest continued . The Southern Christian Leadership Conference said it would investigate Gray's death, and the local head of the civil rights group said it lacked confidence in a police probe. Police procedures require officers to get immediate medical help if detainees need it, and to avoid aggravating any injury. In Gray's case, he repeatedly asked for help during the trip, but the driver instead diverted to another location to pick up another prisoner. For the first time, the fire department released a timeline for paramedics' response. Gray was arrested at 8:42 a.m. Paramedics received a call for an unconscious male at 9:26 a.m., Baltimore City Fire Department spokesman Captain Roman Clark said. Medics arrived at the police station at 9:33 a.m., but didn't leave for the hospital until 9:54, arriving roughly an hour and 20 minutes after his arrest. Clark didn't say why it took more than 20 minutes to leave for the hospital once paramedics arrived. 'How did his injuries occur?' said Robert Stewart, a former chief who consults with police and the Justice Department on use of force. 'These guys are picking up someone who is obviously injured.' In video footage of Gray's arrest, he appears to be dragged to a police transport van by officers including bicycle cops . Not strapped in: The Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 and lawyer Michael Davey, center, are facing criticism after  released a statement that described the citizens protesting the death of Freddie Gray as a 'lynch mob'. On Thursday, Davey admitted that Gray was not strapped into a seatbelt while he was being transported . Gray died on April 19  at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center from his spinal injuries . Many protesters have taken issue with the original reason for police stopping Gray, that he was running away . Demonstrators pretend to be arrested in front of the Baltimore Police Department Western District station to protest against the death in police custody of Freddie Gray . Captain Erik Pecha of the Baltimore Police Department exchanges words with young demonstrators . Demonstrators speak with law enforcement officers. The U.S. Southern Christian Leadership Conference will independently investigate the death . The driver also has a responsibility to refuse to take a seriously injured prisoner to the station if he belongs in a hospital, Stewart said. 'If I'm the officer in the wagon, if the guy's hurt, I'm not taking him,' he explained. All six officers involved in Gray's arrest have been suspended with pay while under criminal investigation. Davey, whose firm is on contract with the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3, said five of the six officers gave voluntary statements the day of Gray's arrest, and one - he didn't say who - declined to speak with investigators. It's quite common for prisoners to yell and complain, saying they've been injured or feel sick or that their handcuffs are too tight. 'You have to make a judgment call: is this a tactic, something to distract me?' said Lt. Luis Fuste of the Miami-Dade Police Department. 'You're taught that these things are often done with an ulterior motive.' Tensions: Protesters gathered in front of the Baltimore Police Department Western District station . Hundreds took part in a demonstration in Baltimore overnight to make their voices heard . The march snarled rush-hour traffic and drew onlookers inBaltimore's Inner Harbor, its premier tourist attraction . Yet Fuste and other law enforcement experts say rough rides aren't typical, and aren't worth the trouble to officers. 'Once he is a prisoner he is absolutely your responsibility,' said Peter Moskos, a former Baltimore officer who teaches law and police science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. 'Even if there was no malign intent, even if there was no assault, he's your prisoner. He goes into the wagon alive, he can't come out dead.' The Department of Justice is investigating whether Gray's civil rights were violated, and an internal police investigation will be delivered by May 1 to the state's attorney's office, which will consider filing any criminal charges. But some details have already been made public as authorities try to restore trust with a community demanding transparency and justice. Commissioner Anthony Batts said Monday that officers repeatedly ignored Gray's requests for medical attention before he was hospitalized in critical condition. 'He asked for an inhaler, and at one or two of the stops it was noticed that he was having trouble breathing,' Batts said. 'We probably should have asked for paramedics.'

"A Manhattan judge has delivered a blistering sentencing speech to a banana mogul who ignored a woman's seizures after feeding her cocaine at an all-night three-way sex romp and then tried to cover up her death, while putting the 'selfish' and 'self-pitying' millionaire away for 12 and a half years. Thomas Hoey Jr., 43, who was sentenced Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan federal court, showed 'callousness and indifference' during the party in January 2009 at Midtown hotel The Kitano and even more when the victim, Kimberly Calo, 41, died from a lethal mix of cocaine and alcohol. Castel said that distributing cocaine to friends was 'integral to the lifestyle of cocaine, sex and parties' of Hoey, who ran a lucrative banana importing business on Long Island he inherited from his father and grandfather. 'He wasn't going to take a chance that his cocaine-based lifestyle was going to be exposed,' Castel told the court, NBC New York reported. Self-absorbed: Thomas Hoey Jr., 43 (left) was sentenced to 12.5 years prison Wednesday after refusing to help, Kimberly Calo, 41, who died from a lethal mix of cocaine and alcohol, during a sex party at Midtown hotel The Kitano in January 2009 . Hoey, who finally plead guilty to the charges in August after long denying them, stopped the other woman in the hotel room, Nicole Zobkiw, from 911, and also prevented hotel security coming into the room as Calo - a mother of two - foamed at the mouth, bled from the nose, turned blue and died. He even confessed to continuing to supply friends with cocaine following Calo's gruesome death as he helped hamper authorities' efforts to bring him to justice through 2010. Hoey coerced Zobkiw to lie about what happened to a grand jury. Castel said Hoey had used his supplies of cocaine to 'social and sexual favors' between 2005 and 2010. 'In truth, Thomas Hoey Jr. is a self-absorbed, self-pitying, selfish man who is a danger to the community,' Castel said, The New York Daily News. Hoey apologized for what he did, but still managed to compliment himself, bringing up his life achievements and how he was made class president in the sixth grade. He also said he will forever regret that his arrest destroyed his banana business after all the years and work his family had put into building the empire. 'We were thinking time together in a safe classy hotel between consenting adults can be OK,' Hoey said. 'I hope it provides comfort to (Calo's family) knowing I'm in hell, literally.' Threesome: Hoey pressured the other participant in the sex romp, Nicole Zobkiw (pictured), his then-girlfriend, to lie in court. She was later found guilty of lying to a grand jury . Luxurious: The millionaire banana mogul received over 12 years prison for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiracy to suborn perjury and obstruction of justice relating to the incident at Manhattan's ritzy Kitano Hotel (pictured) Hoey's guilty pleas last year were the culmination of years of speculation and . accusations regarding the importer's hard-partying and callous ways. Calo . collapsed and began 'frothing at the mouth' that night after consuming . the high-quality cocaine the $700-a-night suite at The Kitano hotel on . Park Avenue. Hoey allegedly wasn't alarmed by Calo's condition and said 'he'd seen this before' and that she 'was going to be fine.' The . banana mogul had sex with Zobkiw and then set his attention towards . Calo, a personal trainer, retired NYPD detective Edward Boyle, who . investigated Calo's 2009 death, said on the stand last year. Calo . had first snorted the coke laying on a coffee table and when she went . back for more, she began overdosing and 'her head dropped to the table . with a thud,' Boyle told jurors at Manhattan federal court, where Zobkiw . was on trial for making false statements and perjury. Zobkiw was later found guilty of lying to a grand jury about the fatal party. Happier times: Thomas Hoey, pictured here not long after the incident in 2009, will spend the next 12 years behind bars due to his cocaine-fueled party lifestyle, which lead to the death of a woman . The . court was told Zobkiw attempted to get Hoey to call the emergency . services but he refused, allegedly telling her that Calo would be fine. Zobkiw is seen in a security video going to the hotel reception three times to try and get help, Boyle revealed. Boyle told the court that Hoey assured Zobkiw that a 'doctor friend' was on the way. Zobkiw's lawyer Leonard Lato admitted his client had to tried to hide what happened on the night. But she was intimidated two days before her grand jury testimony in 2011 by a 'corrupt lawyer' allegedly linked to Hoey, Lato said. Zobkiw has not yet faced sentencing. Under his new plea deal, Hoey faces 11 to 13 years in prison on federal charges. For the state charges he tampered with evidence by trying to clean up Calo's blood, Hoey faces four years. He's due for sentencing on the state charges next week. On the federal charges, Hoey will be sentenced Dec. 15.","Thomas Hoey Jr., 43, was sentenced to 12.5 years Wednesday on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, perjury and obstruction of justice .

"A prosecutor is calling for an investigation into allegations the reserve deputy accused of shooting a suspect dead instead of reaching for his Taser received preferential treatment when he was recruited. A memo from an internal police inquiry which surfaced earlier this week revealed colleagues expressed concerns about Robert Bates, 73, when he arrived at the Tulsa Sheriff's Office. Documents suggested the department also violated training policies when they employed Bates. He has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in relation to the death of Eric Harris during a botched sting on April 2. Scroll down for video . A memo has revealed that Robert Bates,73, who has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Eric Harris, was given special treatment when he was admitted into the Deputy program. He is pictured leaving his arraignment in in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Tuesday . According to Tulsa World, District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler has begun contacting outside law enforcement agencies for further investigation after new information surfaced. He said on Friday: 'I am highly concerned about recent allegations that have surfaced and I have been in contact with independent law enforcement agencies regarding further investigation into these matters.' 'To protect the integrity of these investigations, I will not give details or comment further on any investigation that is underway,' he added. The memo concludes Bates didn't receive special treatment for admittance into the deputy program, but that he received special treatment once admitted. He was said to have used his personal car while on duty and made unauthorized vehicle stops. The inquiry came to the conclusion that high-ranking officers created an atmosphere where employees were intimidated about reporting violations of department policy. The report says it was prepared for former Undersheriff Brian Edwards, who says he doesn't remember its details. Dan Smolen, the attorney for Eric Harris, claimed that if the investigation's findings had been acted on in 2009 Harris might still be alive. He told CBS News: 'I think there are so many people who look on at so much corruption it's more than just a couple of people.' Sheriff's office spokesman Maj. Shannon Clark says he can't confirm the report but the department is preparing a statement. Bates appeared in Tulsa district court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter in the death of Harris, who was killed during a botched sting. Charged: Bates (left in his mug shot) shot Harris (pictured right) and faces four years in prison if convicted . Sheriff Stanley Glanz said this week he believes that Bates received his required training. Bates, a Tulsa County volunteer, shot Harris, 44, after the man was confronted during an undercover gun-sale operation and ran past him. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after Harris. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the disturbing clip, which was released by the sheriff's office, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him! I'm sorry.' The fatally-wounded father can be heard saying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' Earlier this week the Harris family expressed their anger after learning that retired insurance executive Bates, who is out on $25,000 bond, would be allowed to take a month-long vacation to the Bahamas. A statement released by the family read: 'Whether intended or not, Mr. Bates' vacationing in the Bahamas at this time sends a message of apathy with respect to the shooting and Eric's life,' they said. This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Harris' son Aidan Fraley (pictured right with his uncle Andre Harris a week after his father's death), has said the police officers who allowed Bates to become a cop should be held accountable for his death . 'At a time when we are still mourning the death of a loved one that he shot down in the street, Mr. Bates will be relaxing and enjoying his wealth and privilege.' It is not clear when he is leaving for the holiday but Bates will next appear in court on July 2. He has previously visited the Bahamas with the sheriff, Stanley Glanz, and another reserve deputy and paid for part of Glanz's trip. In separate news conferences on Monday, the county sheriff and lawyers for Harris' family disagreed on whether the reserve officer should have been allowed to conduct police work. Sheriff Stanley Glanz said Bates, his long-time insurance agent and former campaign manager, had been properly trained and passed annual firearms certifications required by the state. Dan Smolen, the lawyer for Harris' family, said the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office violated a number of its internal policies by letting Bates carry his personal handgun after training with another weapon. Smolen also said the department failed to keep a permanent record of Bates' training, in violation of local policies. Records Bates released during the weekend showed that the volunteer officer was trained on a .45, not the weapon used in Harris' death. Bates, who sold his insurance business for $6 million in 1999, was trained to be a Tulsa Police Department patrolman in 1964 but left in 1965. He was out of law enforcement for 35 years, returning for volunteer work in Florida in 2000 before joining the Tulsa County force in 2008 and making a number of donations to the agency. He also was Glanz's campaign manager during the 2012 election.","Investigation shows colleagues expressed concerns about Robert Bates .

"What was supposed to be a day spent visiting a famous earthwork sculpture soon turned into a massive rescue effort as 20 strangers joined forces to help rescue a dog out of a tar pit. With no cell phone reception to call for help, owner Tom George had to leave his dog Shelby stuck in a pool by  the Great Salt Lake's Spiral Jetty and drive an hour out to the nearest  town. But, lucky for George, a family was willing to stay with Shelby - and only more and more strangers followed as they heard his story. Scroll down for video . Twenty strangers joined forces to help rescue a dog named Shelby out of a tar pit he had gotten stuck in near the shoreline of the Great Salt Lake . As more people came, they began bringing  items to try and help get Shelby out, using grocery bags, car floor mats, tarp, garbage bags, a straw hat and even bare hands . 'The whole time I was driving I kind of figured there was already a really good chance he was already gone,' George told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. And at first the situation looked 'pretty hopeless', according to Max McGregor, whose family stayed with the dog. 'I was pretty sure that the back legs, the way they were positioned, they were going to snap right where the knee was,' said McGregor's daughter Chloe. Todd Tanner, a Fox 13 reporter who was supposed to shoot video of the Spiral Jetty that day, said only Shelby's head was visible from the pit. He thought the dog was dying. But then a family who was visiting the shoreline with a photography group came over to help. And a huge group of friends from Salt Lake City jumped in as well. As more people came, they began bringing  items to try and help get Shelby out, using grocery bags, car floor mats, tarp, garbage bags, a straw hat and even bare hands. With no cell phone reception to call for help, owner Tom George had to leave his dog Shelby stuck by the Great Salt Lake's Spiral Jetty and drive an hour out to the nearest town . But the group was able to separate the dog from the tar, piece by piece, as they continued to put objects in to pit to keep Shelby from getting stuck again or from continuing to sink lower into the pool of tar . Shelby still couldn't move after he was freed from the pits, so five people helped carry him to the road and saw that George had come back just in time . Max McGregor said that as they separated the dog from the tar piece by piece, they would continue putting objects in the pit to keep Shelby from getting stuck again or continuing to sink. According to Tanner, no one in the newly-formed group 'knew exactly what to do', but they worked for over an hour together to find a way to get Shelby out. 'Total strangers talked, and worked, shoulder to shoulder, and figured it out,' he wrote in an exclusive for Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'They didn't know each other’s names, and they didn't care. They ruined their clothes, they interrupted their plans, and they made a memory to last a lifetime. And yes, they saved Shelby.' Shelby still couldn't move after he was freed from the pit, so five people helped carry him to the road and saw that George had come back just in time. Veterinarians had to work on Shelby for 6 to 8 hours that night and had to shave most of his hair off to remove more than 40lb of tar . George said that Shelby's brother Rue stuck to his side, even sleeping next to him that first night after the accident.Shelby (right) has since recovered and his once 'splendid coat' is growing back as well .

"'Evil': The Duchess of Cambridge's uncle Gary Goldsmith took to Twitter after his beloved chihuahua Cheech was run over by a 'speeding' cyclist in Regents Park . The Duchess of Cambridge’s uncle hit out yesterday at a ‘speeding’ cyclist who ran over his dog and ‘left him for dead’. Gary Goldsmith, the controversial brother of Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, posted a picture of the alleged culprit who hit his chihuahua, Cheech, on social media. His accompanying message included the words: ‘Evil s***… Coming to get ya.’ The flamboyant millionaire businessman, who was once caught up in a tabloid sting in which he was alleged to have offered a reporter drugs and prostitutes, was with his wife Julie-Ann in Regent’s Park at 8.30am yesterday. As he went for a cycle ride, Mrs Goldsmith took six-year-old Cheech and their other dog Keela, four, for a stroll in the Central London park when a cyclist, listening to music on his headphones, ran straight over Cheech. Mr Goldsmith, 49, told the Mail: ‘The dogs were a few feet away from her when a cyclist, wearing headphones, just came out of nowhere. He was going far too fast and didn’t slow down. ‘Suddenly he went over Cheech with both wheels. Cheech yelped and did a parachute roll before lying down on his side. He looked dead.’ Although both his wife and a witness challenged the man, he merely abused them before riding off. ‘Julie-Ann yelled to the bloke to get off his bike but he just ignored her,’ Mr Goldsmith said. ‘Then an American lady, who witnessed everything, walked over and said to him, “You were going far too fast. Give me your details”. ‘She told Julie-Ann that she thought it looked almost deliberate. But the cyclist just said to her, “Don’t get hysterical, you American”. By this time Julie-Ann was crouching by Cheech and he coughed up some blood. ‘The bloke then turned to her and said: “I haven’t killed your dog.” The American then grabbed Julie-Ann’s phone and took a photo of him but he just turned away and sped off out of the park. ‘I was on the other side of the park when Julie-Ann called me, completely distraught. I immediately cycled over and found Cheech completely limp.’ Cheech is being treated by Bruce Fogle, father of TV presenter Ben, at The London Vet Clinic. He is on a drip awaiting further tests. Search: Mr Goldsmith released a picture of the alleged culprit  after his dog was run over and 'left for dead' Mr Goldsmith, who regularly puts pictures of his two chihuahuas on social media, posted a picture of the man he claims was responsible on his Twitter feed with the message: ‘Know this man?? ‘Racing through @theroyalparks Regents Park this morning ran over our dog and just left him for dead!’ Mr Goldsmith told the Mail that he was disgusted at the cyclist’s callousness and wants him to be prosecuted. ‘Most people, if they hurt an animal, would want to help. That’s your natural reaction,’ he said. ‘I’m not going to let him get away with it. I’m making it my personal mission to find him. I have called the Parks Police. He should not have been riding around with headphones on oblivious to the world around him, causing damage and riding off. ‘I want him to pick up the vet’s bill and make a public apology. Julie-Ann is in bits. She keeps bursting into tears. Dogs are an important part of your life. ‘They are a big part of your family. It’s incredibly traumatic when something like this happens.’ Hunt: Mr Goldsmith was walking with his wife Julie-Ann when the incident took place, and has vowed to make it his 'personal mission' to find the man who left the couple's dog needing veterinary care . According to The Royal Parks, which manages Regent’s Park, cycling is allowed on the pathways on designated routes – it is not clear whether the spot where the accident occurred is one – but there is a code of conduct for cyclists. They are required to be considerate and keep to a ‘sensible speed’ on pathways, while pedestrians always have priority. Police officers are able to issue £60 penalty notice fines for cyclists who do not adhere to the rules. Do you know who the alleged culprit is?

"A fugitive who taunted authorities by taking selfies outside police stations while he was on the run has finally been jailed. Aaron Bee was wanted by Lincolnshire Police over an alleged domestic violence and assault. After fleeing his home, the 22-year-old  goaded officers by sharing photographs online which showed him standing outside the force's headquarters. He was eventually arrested in November in a cafe after posing outside five different police stations over two weeks and was this week jailed for eight months. Aaron Bee went on the run for two weeks last year, taunting the police officers who were chasing him with selfies taken outside their headquarters. He has now been jailed for eight months . But after spending less than five months behind bars since his arrest, the 22-year-old has already been released. Last year Bee taunted officers by captioning photographs 'come catch me if you can' and bragging that he was 'always playing hide and seek'. He visited five different police stations without being apprehended and even flashing his genitals outside one. The father of one had been wanted by police for breaking a non-molestation order against his former girlfriend after showing up at her house in the middle of the night. Lincoln Crown Court heard how he had been 'threatening and abusive' towards the woman when he 'kicked her door down' last October. The father of one pictured outside Lincolnshire Police headquarters in November. He was eventually arrested in a cafe . Before his arrest Bee said he was taunting police 'as a bit of fun'. He was jailed yesterday for eight months but has been released after spending less than five months behind bars since being arrested . When police couldn't find him after the assault they released his mugshot to appeal for his whereabouts. In response, Bee took to Facebook to mock their efforts. Among pictures he shared online was one of a police officer standing in the street which he captioned 'is it me you're looking for'. He also posed outside Lincolnshire Police HQ, looking towards the camera and giving a thumbs up. In other posts he said the justice system 'is really f****d up' and bragged about buying a doughnut in Tesco without being caught. At the time, he said he was taunting police 'because it's funny.' He told reporters: 'It's really funny, I wanted to do it to show how ridiculous this all is and how they obviously aren't that bothered about me,' without disclosing his whereabouts. The 22-year-old made several jibes on Facebook, joking that he needed new hiding places after being hunted for breaking a non-molestation order against his former girlfriend . While on the run Bee mocked police officers by uploading a photograph of one with the caption 'hello is it me your (sic) looking for'. He was arrested in mid November and remanded into custody . Before his arrest Bee bemoaned being hunted by police for 'a poxy assaut'. Lincoln Crown Court heard how he grabbed his former girlfriend by the throat when he broke a non-molestation order to turn up at her house . He was eventually arrested in a cafe in Lincoln before being brought before court. Sentencing, Judge Michael Heath said: 'The non-molestation order was made in April 2013 by a County Court judge. 'He did not make it for fun. He made it to afford protection to the person who applied for it who was your erstwhile partner. 'When a judge makes a non-molestation order he expects that it will be obeyed. 'If it isn't you go inside. If you breach the non-molestation order again the sentences will get longer and longer.' Bee was jailed for eight months but is likely to be released imminently after being kept behind bars since November.","Aaron Bee, 22, spent two weeks on the run from Lincolnshire Police .

"It is the ground on which their husbands fought during the First World War. One hundred years on, these war widows are visiting the battlefields in Gallipoli - many of them for the first time. The war widows - who were much younger than their returned servicemen husbands - will be the guests of honour at the Gallipoli dawn service on Saturday. Among them is Jean Pockett, who experienced a little heart scare as she arrived in Turkey on Thursday. As she landed, she didn't feel so well and had to see the doctor. Scroll down for video . Jean Pockett, the widow of Private Arthur Herbert Pockett , is one of 10 war widows brought to Gallipoli by the Department of Veteran's Affairs for Anzac Day this Saturday on the Gallipoli Peninsular . Mrs Pockett (left) is the widow of Private Arthur Pockett (right), who fought with Australian forces on the Western Front during the First World War . Married life taught Mrs Pockett about the difficulties faced by war widows, who have often given so much to support men left damaged by war . 'He said ""I'm sure you've got a heart murmur"". I said what a load of garbage,' Mrs Pockett said, sitting in an armchair at her hotel in the southern Turkish city of Canakkale. Mrs Pockett is the widow of Private Arthur Pockett, who fought with Australian forces on the Western Front during the First World War. She's one of 10 World War One widows who have travelled to Gallipoli - a group who between them have a deeper understanding of the sacrifice and hardship of war than all the 10,500 Australians and New Zealanders who will see the dawn service on the historic battlefields. Arthur Pockett lost both legs as a result of his wounds at Passchendaele. He and Jean met and married after the war, when Jean was his neighbour and began helping the much older Arthur to look after his cat. Married life was difficult as Arthur suffered continually from his injuries. 'He was on morphine all the time and it was not a very happy union really because he spent more time in hospital than at home.' Ruth Littler - widow of Lieutenant Burnett Littler - arrived at Gallipoli on Thursday, April 22 . Ruth Littler's husband Lieutenant Guy Littler (right) was sent from Egypt to the Western Front where he collected a lifelong souvenir - shrapnel in his neck . Seeing the Gallipoli cliffs for the first time was an emotional experience for Mrs Littler. 'I was blown away,' she said . But married life also taught Jean about the difficulties faced by war widows, who have often given so much to support men left damaged by war. She is deeply involved in the War Widows Guild of Queensland, the Gallipoli Medical Research Foundation and volunteers at hospitals. With her commitment to the legacy of soldiers, Mrs Pockett has a special reason for being in Gallipoli this year. 'I was on the spot where we're going for Anzac Day over 40 years ago, when it was a paddock with sheep grazing on it and men going around with metal detectors pulling bombs out of the ground,' she said. 'Now I want to see it when it's all finished and I'm glad that he's up there looking to see that I am.'

Happy family: Palmira and her late husband Domenico with their now grown-up children, Celestina and Rino . Mrs Silva moved to London from her native southern Italy with her husband Domenico six decades ago . Several of the victim's relatives, including her daughter Celestina, were in the courtroom to witness the plea. Mrs Silva moved to London from her native southern Italy with her husband Domenico six decades ago. They married and had a daughter, Celestina, and a son, Rino. The widow ran a successful cafe, Silva's Cafe, in Church Street, Edmonton - where members of the public laid floral tributes after her murder on September 4 last year. Mr Silva died in 2008 but the family continued the business. Mrs Silva had only recently stopped working full time at the cafe that she and her son ran. Salvador, an only child, is thought to have left home at the age of around 13 or 14 after arriving in the UK from Nigeria with his parents. Police were forced to stage a dramatic evacuation operation to save neighbours during the incident, and an armed squad Tasered the suspect. The house in the busy street where the Italian widow's body was found was the scene of a major police operation after officers were called initially to reports that a man had beheaded an animal. Scotland Yard said that its officers distracted a man after he was seen going through back gardens in Nightingale Road while they evacuated people from nearby homes.

"If a golf course were to be created in Hell it might resemble the now serene landscape of Gallipoli, where the blood of thousands was spilled a century ago in one of World War I’s most spectacular Allied failures. An eerie serenity pervades the rolling landscape of this peninsula and, in the bright spring sunshine, there could scarcely be a more peaceful spot for a Sunday afternoon stroll. But a chill is never far from the spine, whatever the temperature. Scroll down for video . Sulva Bay, Gallipoli Peninsula, Turkey, where in the World War I there were nearly 400,00 Allied casualties . In the early hours of today, 25 April 2015, a bugle sounded a haunting dawn chorus to mark the moment when, at 0430, Allied troops landed at a point where Asia meets Europe, Anzac Cove, to commence the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign. Thousands of visitors from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, India and France have gathered to honour the fallen at one of the biggest commemorations of the Great War. Today this beautiful Turkish isthmus, facing the Aegean to the west, the Dardanelles Straits and the Sea of Marmara to the east, is a patchwork of monuments and memorial stones linked by country lanes, mountain tracks and undulating greenery. Allied soldiers land and begin the attack at Gallipoli, sometimes known as the Dardanelles Campaign . People have been gathering the graves at Beach Cemetery at Gallipoli to mark the campaigns's centenary . Allied cemeteries at Gallipoli are kept immaculately by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission . A cross left by a visitor at a graveside in Gallipoli bearing a personal thanks to the one of the soldiers killed . On a visit ahead of the poignant anniversary, we wandered among Anzac’s sea-facing white headstones before heading down to the tip of the peninsula. Here stands one of the most magnificent of the cemeteries, the Helles Memorial to the British. Troops are remembered in row upon row of immaculate Commonwealth war graves and huge expanses of dazzling white marble, etched with the names of the fallen, which circle the cemetery. Accompanied by a feral dog and her puppies, we strolled down the dirt track to V Beach cemetery where the sea laps below the walls and where two Irish battalions were laid to rest. The mighty ruined fortress of Seddülbahir, brought to its knees by Allied naval firepower in 1915, overlooks the cemetery. The ruins of the fortress at Seddülbahir in Gallipoli - its name in Turkish means 'barrier to the sea' Seaside homes dot the flat sands and yellow sandstone bluffs rise out of the Aegean. In the valleys between the cliffs, olive and tamaris trees grow down the steep escarpments. We stopped for a stiff coffee at a modest coffee house on the square, opposite the mosque at Sedd al Bahr, and watched the fishermen’s tiny rowing boats bobbing in the slack waters of Cape Helles. A far cry from the fateful morning of April 25 1915, when one of the bloodiest and most ill-conceived campaigns of the First World War kicked off, a campaign which almost brought to an end the career of its main instigator, Winston Churchill, and which witnessed almost 400,000 casualties. The Allied plan was as brilliantly simple in conception as it was hopeless in execution: secure the Straits and take Constantinople, giving access to the Black Sea to supply the Russians in order to free up a new line of attack on the Germans. It would also pull in the Greeks and Bulgarians, ancient enemies of the Ottoman Turks, and hey presto, the stalemate of the Western Front would be suddenly transformed into a glorious victory from the East. Churchill, who was First Lord of the Admiralty, had underestimated the strength of the Turkish troops, under the command of modern Turkey’s founding father, Kemal Atatürk, and had overestimated the potency of his own superannuated fleet, which fell easy prey to the mines and coastal gun batteries. Churchill (left) had been a soldier, but in 1916 underestimated the Turkish  forces led by Atatürk (right) If the naval thrust was a failure, his attempt to consolidate on land was a calamity, and after nine months of blistering summer heat and frostbitten winter nights the ragbag army of dysentery-ridden men was evacuated the following December and January, and Churchill was forced to resign his post. The easiest way to access the peninsula is from the port of Canakkale, which is a quick ferry ride across the narrowest section of the Straits. The Gallipoli War Museum (Canakkale Destani Tanitim Merkezi), is well hidden from view but well worth finding. This 5,600 square metre visitor centre, on the road to Kabatepe, was commissioned by the army and the Ministry of Defence and was only recently finished. It is an architectural triumph that does justice to its subject. The Gallipoli War Museum has many relics from the campaign from both the Allies and Turkish sides . In addition to 11 rooms, with cinema screens shockingly simulating what it was like in the trenches of Gallipoli. There are also some rather more prosaic offerings which carry poignant memento mori: bullets with bullet holes in them as well as Atatürk’s waistcoat and dress shoes. There are also letters, watches, mangled boots and water canteens that would be inadequate for a summer school trip to Longleat safari park. Items of clothing worn in battle by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk who commanded the Turkish forces at Gallipoli . The battle sites and 31 memorials to the 130,000 dead covers a surprisingly small area. This is because Allied troops were unable to make much headway against the ferocious onslaught of Atatürk’s men. Heat, exhaustion, illness and difficult terrain also dogged every step. With an impressive flourish of national pride, the Turkish government has declared the whole area a Historic Park, to show the futility of war. Up at Chunuk Bair, where the Allies enjoyed a shortlived victory, the trenches have been preserved. You can look down on Suvla Bay 540m below, where British troops landed, and walk a few hundred metres along the preserved dug-outs in the footsteps of New Zealand’s Wellington Battalion, before visiting the New Zealand monument. Here, a statue to Atatürk, the Allies’ nemesis, celebrates the moment when a fob watch covering his heart prevented a bullet from possibly changing the course of modern history. From the Australian monument at Lone Pine there are views across the peninsula, from the Aegean to the Dardanelles. Nearby is Kiliçbayiri, the memorial to the Turkish 57th Infantry Regiment, which was wiped out following the Allied landings at Anzac. Atatürk, the 19th Division commander, famously told his men: ""I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. During the time before we die other forces and commanders will take our place."" The great man, of course, lived to tell the tale. Before taking the 10-minute ferry back across the Straits to Canakkale we walked through the French Memorial at Morto Bay. Lined by rosemary bushes, baytrees and well-ordered flowerbeds, this is perhaps the biggest and most atmospheric of them all, with 3,236 graves and four ossuaries containing the bones of 12,000 unidentifiable soldiers. It surprises many to learn that more French soldiers were killed at Gallipoli than Australians and New Zealanders combined. Mark Porter was a guest of the Turkish Culture and Tourism Office.

While the 100th anniversary itself is going to be a tad too busy for most, the museum and Historic Park are open to all 365-days a year.

"Sprinkles the 33-pound cat is so fat she can't even roll over and she's comparatively as obese as a 700-pound human, say rescue workers. The neglected cat from Sea Isle City in New Jersey was handed over to the rescue agency S.O.S Sea Isle Cats by a family facing a foreclosure on their home. Luckily for Sprinkles who is too fat to even groom herself, she is being cared for by pet rescue volunteer Stacy Jones Olandt. Fat cat: Sprinkles the 33-pound cat is so fat she can't even roll over and she's equally as fat as a 700-pound human, say rescue workers . 'Whatever position she’s in, she’s stuck. She can barely move,' said Olandt, a helper at the non-profit S.O.S. Sea Isle City Cats. When coming to collect Sprinkles, the volunteers at S.O.S were unable to carry her. They had to put her in a crate and get a man to carry her up the stairs, reports Press of Atlantic City. 'We’re a bunch of old ladies. We had to get a young man to get her up the steps,' said Olandt. Sprinkles is a four-year-old spotted black and white cat who won the affection of the women working at S.O.S. Not only is Sprinkles overweight but when she was rescues she had an awful flea infestation, ear mites, and an ear infection. A healthy weight for Sprinkles would be 10 pounds which is 20 pounds less than she currently weighs. Olandt said that Sprinkles heavy weight can be compared to a person weighing 700 pounds. New hope: Cat rescuer Stacy Olandt, of Sea Isle City, plays with Sprinkles, a 33-pound female domestic short-haired cat on Thursday following her rescue . 'We’ve seen fat cats at 20 to 25 pounds but this is just obscene. Cats, by and large, don’t overfeed themselves. This is similar to a 600 or 700 pound human that should weigh 180 pounds,' said Olandt. Luckily for Sprinkles, she is expected to survive. Her fleas and mites are gone and her ear infection is being treated with antibiotics. She will hopefully lose a pound a month after being placed on a special diet. The next move is to find Sprinkles a loving home. 'She’s sweet, sweet, sweet. I’ve never seen so many people broken-hearted and hopeful at the same time,' said Olandt. Olandt told Phillymag.com that Sprinkles has a beautiful face, 'like a pretty fat girl.' 'She's letting us clean the red, raw spots, and she's so sweet. The lovingest, most precious cat. She's happy now. And she has a beautiful face, which I guess is what they say about fat girls,' said Olandt. She also said that when Sprinkles loses the weight she will need a tummy tuck so that her skin doesn't drag on the floor. Those who wish to adopt Sprinkles the cat can apply here.","Sprinkles the 33-pound cat is so fat she can't even roll over and she's equally as fat as a 700-pound human, say rescue workers .

"Exeter has been dubbed 'too posh for Monopoly' after game makers were told there is nowhere low-rent enough to fill the space of Old Kent Road . It's the most popular board game in the world, with hundreds of versions springing up in far-flung cities across the globe. But Monopoly-makers planning a special Exeter edition have been told there is nowhere low-rent enough to fill the space of Old Kent Road. Thousands of voters have suggested landmarks across the city in Devon to fill the more expensive slots, which are taken up on the London version by the likes of  Mayfair and Park Lane. But no one has come forward with ideas for which streets should fill the brown sections of the board, which cost $60 in Monopoly money. High-end game zones have been easily filled with locations like the city's Gothic cathedral, Exeter castle, the Guildhall and modern shopping centre. But Exeter has outdone all previous cities to get their own board - including Oxford, Cambridge and York - in the posh stakes, with no suggestions for the lower end. Game-makers say they have developed boards for cities across the country but have never come across the current dilemma. Exeter City Council Leader Pete Edwards said there were no areas suitable for the brown spots, which are taken up in London by Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road. He said: 'I think they will have a problem - there is nowhere cheap in Exeter that would be suitable for the Old Kent Road spot. 'I don't know about being the poshest - but it is such a nice city that no-where really deserves to occupy it. Thousands of voters have suggested landmarks across Exeter to fill the more expensive slots, such as the cathedral . No one has come forward with ideas for which streets should fill the brown sections of the board, which cost $60 in Monopoly money . 'The board was designed on the streets of London and it is a nigh on impossible task to replicate that in Exeter. 'Whoever does get Old Kent Road will be castigated for it - and will not deserve it.' Exeter recently for opened some Britain's poshest student flats in the city centre - costing £1,000 a month - and there are several more luxury developments planned. The influx of well-to-do students - together with the arrival of big name shops and restaurants such as John Lewis and Jamie's Italian in recent years - has seen a resurgence in the city centre. Resident Nicola Taylor, 32, of Exeter, said: 'Exeter has certainly got posher over the years and I don't think there is anywhere that deserves the tag of Old Kent Road. 'I think the influx of rich students has had a lot to do with it with a lot of luxury developments and money being brought in. 'I wouldn't say that most locals are particularly posh - but just proud of the area they live in.' Exeter City Council Leader Pete Edwards said there were no areas suitable for the brown Monopoly (board game pictured) spots, which are taken up in London by Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road . The makers of the game have launched a second appeal for recommendations for any Exeter landmark that can replace Old Kent Road, and bosses were sent to the city today to hunt a location down. Dan Taylor, Head of Custom Games at Winning Moves UK said: 'Over the years we have produced boards for perceived well-heeled places - such as Oxford, for example - but we have never come across a situation like this. 'We have had a dearth of suggestions for an Exeter equivalent of Old Kent Road compared to every other location so Exeter could well be the poshest place in Britain. 'But we have to fill this space. As we do every one of the 22 locations from the London original is handed over to an Exeter landmark or address.'","Exeter is getting its own special edition of classic board game Monopoly .
But residents can't think of anywhere to fill low-rent spaces on the board .

"A Texas English high school teacher has been arrested after being accused of having an improper relationship with a male student older than 17 years old. Mary Todd Lowrance, 49, a teacher at Moises E Molina High School, turned herself into Dallas Independent School District police on Thursday morning, according to Dallas ISD Police Chief Craig Miller. Miller said the teacher had been in a relationship with the student for a couple of months. Officers learned of the alleged relationship after Lowrance disclosed details to a coworker who then alerted a Dallas ISD officer. Mary Todd Lowrance (above), 49, a Texas English high school teacher was arrested after being accused of having an improper relationship with a male student over the age of 17, according to authorities . If the student had been a juvenile, the case would have been handled by the Dallas Police Department, Miller told The Dallas Morning News. 'When you get 160,000 students and 10,000 teachers, you hear a lot of rumors, and you have to investigate all of them,' said Miller. 'And in this case, there was something to it. The student has been offered counseling. We're doing everything we can for him as well.' Miller said that after Lowrance's coworker alerted authorities, it prompted an investigation where interviews were  conducted with Lowrance, the student and two witnesses. The Dallas ISD police then got an arrest warrant. Miller said Lowrance has been on leave for several weeks while investigators worked on the case, according to NBCDFW. After she turned herself into authorities, she was booked into the Dallas County jail around 11am on Thursday on a $5,000 bond and was released at 4.40pm, according to county records.

"The Irish tourist who left his brother fighting for life in an alleged one-punch attack has avoided jail. Barry Lyttle, 33, has been given a 13-month suspended jail sentence after he pleaded guilty earlier this month to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm to his younger brother Patrick. Patrick, 31, was rushed to hospital and spent six days in a coma after he was allegedly struck by his brother, Barry in Kings Cross in Sydney's inner-city on January 3. But on Friday, Patrick had his arm around his brother, who was crying when Magistrate Graeme Curran handed down the sentence in the Downing Centre Local Court. Scroll down for video .

Patrick spent nearly a week in an induced coma in January following his brother's alleged attack before making his remarkable recovery at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner suburbs. Appearing outside of court on Friday, Patrick told reporters his brother has been through an 'awful lot throughout this whole process'. 'Just delighted to go home with the family now,' Patrick said. Mr Curran said Patrick appeared to have recovered well since the incident and probably didn't require further treatment. While the brothers had been drinking during their out night in Kings Cross, Mr Curran found alcohol was not a significant factor. He said Barry was of good character, remorseful and unlikely to re-offend. Supporters in the court gasped as Barry was told he was being sentenced to jail but were hugging minutes later when the entire sentence was suspended.

Barry Lyttle was charged with punching his brother Patrick outside a Kings Cross night club . Barry  has avoided jail time in Sydney after pleading guilty to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm . The Sentence comes after Downing Centre Local Court was told of the guilty plea during a brief mention, where Barry was supported by family, including his younger brother Patrick. Barry's legal team had tried to negotiate a lesser charge over the attack, with Patrick publicly speaking out in support of his brother and calling for the charges to be dismissed. But prosecutors decided to go ahead with the original charge and that Lyttle agreed to plead guilty. The hearing was expected to include CCTV footage of the attack and evidence from criminologist John Braithwaite, an expert in 'restorative justice', which covers sentencing options other than imprisonment.

"A wartime scientist has revisited the secret underground factory where she helped build aircraft engines 70 years since the end of the Second World War. Mary Cartwright was 20 when she was called up to work in the laboratory at Drakelow Shadow Factory in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, in 1943. She spent two years testing metal for Bristol aircraft engines in the site's underground laboratory, working as the only woman in her department. Now,  70 years after leaving her position, the 91-year-old great-grandmother has revisited the now defunct factory. Mary Cartwright revisited Drakelow Underground Factory in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, where more than 700 people worked during the war (right)  to produce aircraft engines. Now 91, the great grandmother tested metal for aircraft engines . Revisiting the site with her son, David, Mrs Cartwright said it was 'strange' to see it so quiet. She worked as the only woman in its laboratory between 1943 and 1945 . Built in 1943, the factory became known as Drakelow Tunnels for its vast network of underground paths spread over three-and-a-half miles. It was one of 26 'shadow' sites set-up to mass produce engines and parts for military aircraft and tanks that were built underground or into hillside so that production could continue if bombed. Designed by Rover at the behest of the Air Ministry, Drakelow employed 700 people when Mrs Cartwright began working there. Arriving every day at 8.30am, she used scientific formulas to analyse the ratio of metals in shavings given to her by 'the men'. Spanning more than three miles, the site became known as the Drakelow Tunnels for its vast network of secret passageways . The entrance to one of the tunnels which are built into hillside beneath Kingsford Country Park, Kidderminster . Another of the tunnels' entrances in Kingsford Country Park. While built at road level it is 300ft from the top of the hill . Set up by Rover under the instruction of the Air Ministry, Drakelow was one of 26 'underground' factories established to allow production lines to continue if the country came under fire . With more than 700 people working at the site at a time it was one of the largest underground factories during the war . Mrs Cartwright was sent to work there in 1943 after being called up at the age of 20. She had wanted to join the Civil Service beforehand . A stretch of offices in the underground factory. Their windows were high up so that staff would not be distracted by co-workers walking by . The kitchen where staff would have eaten during one of the long, underground shifts. Mrs Cartwright had no previous experience when she was called up, but said she 'just got on with the job' Mrs Cartwright said while the tunnels were built to protect production lines from bombing, by the time she began working at Drakelow the worst of the raids had already hit the country. Right, a newspaper cutting from 1941 detailing the deaths of three men killed when one of the tunnels collapsed during 'excavating operations' 'I'd had no experience at the time, someone, I think my sister-in-law, just gave me a book which told me how to do it and I just got on with it,' Mrs Cartwright told MailOnline. 'The metal could come in and it would be one of the men who would drill it into shavings. I'd dissolve it in acid and then put something on it that would allow me to analyse it so I could find how much nickle, chrome etc was in each part.' The only woman in the laboratory, Mrs Cartwright had wanted to serve in the army before being called up. 'In a way it was luck of the draw an din a way it wasn't. I wanted to go into the forces but parents in those days told you what to do and mine said: ""no, you'll go into industry.""' Earning £3 a week, she was also tasked with taking photographs of the metal for developing in a dark room next door. While the factory's design was so carried out to avoid raids, the worst of the bombing across Britain had already occurred by the time Mrs Cartwright took up work, she said. 'They started building the tunnels in 1941, quite late in the war. Around that time we were being badly bombed but never when I was there.' The site was restored in the 1980s by the Ministry of Defence which installed two KW generators . Tunnel 4, one of the main passageways used during the Second World War to shuttle workers to their stations . After the war ended, Mrs Cartwright trained as a teacher and spent years teaching P.E. in Worcester. She met her late husband, Cecil Cartwright, after the war had ended and the pair married in 1953. Revisiting the Drakelow Tunnels with one of her sons, John, the great-grandmother said it was 'strange' to see it so quiet. In 1936, the Air Ministry approached the car manufacturer Rover, asking them to help with wartime production. By 1939, all motoring production had ceased and the company had begun working solely on aircraft parts and engines. But when its Coventry factory was blitzed, bosses cited the need for a more secure setting to allow production to continue. Shadow Factories were then created. Built underground, safe from the shelling of Hitler's army, workers were free to work on engines for military aircraft and tanks. A canteen that was reused  during the Cold War when Drakelow Factory became a Government bunker . The Drakelow site was one of the largest, spanning more than three miles. Built into Kingsford Country Park, the factory is 300ft from the top of the hill but is in fact at road level. It was used to produce aircraft engines specifically for four models of Bristol aircraft; the Pegasus, Hercules, Centaur and Mercury. When demand wavered at the end of the war some staff were kept on to continue working on tanks. Production of the Meteor Tank Engine continued until 1952 when parts became surplus to requirements. All production stopped indefinitely thee years later when the site was handed over to the Ministry of Works. In 1961 the Government converted half of the tunnels to become a nuclear-safe bunker known as Regional Seat of Government. By the 1980s it had been modernised again with new blast doors fitted to meet updated requirements. It was decommissioned and sold to a private company in the early 1990s and remains in their ownership. 'All my memories are of a bustling hive of activity. I did enjoy my time there, it was certainly an experience. I just got on with it.' The Drakelow Tunnels or Shadow Factory was one of 26 of the same kind across the UK, built into the ground or landscape. During the war it was used to produce engine parts for four Bristol aircraft - Hercules, Pegasus, Centaur and Mercury. For a short while afterward the war production continued but to create parts for army tanks. The site is owned by a private Swiss company, though historians are eager to turn it into a permanent museum.","Mary Cartwright worked at Drakelow Underground Factory from 1943-1945 .

"The savages of Islamic State have stepped up their use of teenage suicide bombers in recent weeks, even using their leader's alleged cousin to blow himself up at a checkpoint in Iraq. Named as Abu Hafs al-Badri, the youthful teenager is claimed to be the cousin of Abu Bakr al-Bagdadhi, the extremist group's self-styled caliph. It appears ISIS's growing strategy of using teenage suicide bombers indicates their continued focus on indoctrinating impressionable local teenagers and turning them into deadly bombers. Not even old enough to grow a beard, teenage suicide bomber Abu Hafs al-Badri is claimed to be one of the cousins of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Abu Basir al-Shami (left) and Abu Yaqoub al-Iraqi (right) both blew themselves up in Iraq. Both boys appear to be be older than 16-years-old. al-Badri's martyrdom photo was released recently alongside fellow teenage suicide bomber Abu Yaqoub al-Iraqi. The teenage duo carried out joint suicide missions in ISIS's latest offensive on the Baiji oil refinery in Salahuddin province, Iraq. Little is known about Abu Yaqoub al-Iraqi except like Abu Hafs, he was an Iraqi national. Both fighters appear to be little older than 16-years-old. Another teenage suicide bomber Abu Basir al-Shami blew himself up in Anbar province, near the Iraqi city of Ramadi. Wearing a ISIS branded hat and awkwardly holding an AK 47 in his hands, the teenager stares emptily into the camera. Abu Qaqa al-Shami (left) and Abu Hassan al-Shami, (right) both Syrian nationals, carried out suicide lorry attacks in Iraq last month. Abu Qaqa al-Shami appeared in an ISIS video, shouting a torrent of jihaid slogans and practicing his shooting with an AK 47. al-Shami blew himself up at a checkpoint in North Baghdad. The teenager is shown singing as he drives a vehicle packed full of explosives towards a military checkpoint in Iraq. The trio of teenage suicide bombers come after another teenager was shown in a video, criticising the West before he carried out a suicide bomb attack. Known as Abu Qaqa al-Shami, the Syrian national drove a truck laden with explosives into a checkpoint in northern Baghdad. The boy has been named as Abu al-Hassan al-Shami, a Syrian fighter who appears to be no older than 14 years old. In a photo series, entitled 'Battle of Vengeance for the Mother of the Believers (Aisha)', the youngster is thought to be one of two Syrian fighters, who carried out a suicide truck bombings in the Iraqi province of Salahuddin. He is shown sitting in the driver's seat of the large lorry filled with barrels of explosives. The vehicle has been reinforced with plated armour, leaving the young driver with only a small rectangular window to navigate the final journey for his deadly vehicle. Abu al-Hassan al-Shami, who appears no older than 14, is thought to be the Islamic State's youngest suicide bomber . In a series of pictures, the young fighter appears to be playing with a hand grenade before the huge explosion of the lorry in January 2015. In his hands, the young fighter appears to be playing with a hand grenade and the barrel of his AK-47 rifle can be seen resting near the steering wheel between his legs. A final image shows a huge explosion after the detonation of the lorry, killing him and a number of Iraqi security forces. The attack happened near the ancient Iraqi city of Samarra, currently still held by the Iraqi army. It also shows a big ball of fire erupting into the orange sky, with pieces of shrapnel flying in all directions across the arid landscape. One ISIS supporter on social media commented: 'Abu al-Hassan al-Shami the martyr. His youth doesn't stop him from supporting his religion.' Australian fighter Jake Bilardi, 18, from Melbourne, detonated a van filled with barrels of explosives near Iraqi armed forces in Ramadi last month. Bilardi's suicide mission reportedly failed to hit its intended target with General Tahssin Ibrahim confirming that no one had been killed and just a few vehicles had been damaged by the attack.

The attack was reported as a rare failure, with General Tahssin Ibrahim confirming that no one had been killed and just a few vehicles had been damaged by the attack. Islamic State supporters on social media later paid tribute to the Australian teenage fighter, with one blogger writing: 'He started fighting in Baijī against the ISF Rāfidha and was a lion on the battlefield although he was at a young age and with a weak body, he was like a mountain.'","Teenage suicide bomber Abu Hafs al Badri is referred to as the cousin of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi .

Another camera shows the officer putting Ariana in a chokehold and dragging her across the floor . The young fashion designer said she 'became extremely anxious' and struggled to breathe during the 'attack' 'He then threw Ariana to the ground and maintained Ariana in a choke hold and actually drug Ariana by the neck across the floor outside of 1 Oak for several feet,' claims the lawsuit. The young woman, it says, 'became extremely anxious' as she struggled to breathe. After she broke free from his grip, she punched him. She said she had no idea he was a police officer because he hadn't identified himself to her. 'When he came behind me I didn't know who was attacking me from behind, and all I did was try to defend myself,' she added. 'I feel as if the way he reacted was completely unnecessary, and it shouldn't have happened like that. 'He should have had more control under the situation, instead of escalating it and making it ten times worse.' After breaking free from his grip she punched him (left) - but says she had no idea he was a police officer . Ariana's legs are seen around the officer's hips in the right of this video still as her face is pressed against the glass-topped table - upon which rests a giant vase of pink and yellow flowers . In the CCTV footage obtained by Ariana's lawyer, Officer Izzo and others are seen handcuffing her hands behind her back and leading her to a round, marble table with a glass top. She is made to bend over it, and her face is pushed against it several times by a man standing between her outstretched legs. At one point her legs end up around his waist while her head is pressed on the table. Her face was rammed so hard on to the glass that it shattered - and shards embedded in her chin. Two of her teeth were broken, too. A photo of her injuries was shown to reporters by Mr Bryson yesterday. He said his client had needed several operations to repair her face. He added: 'Once Ariana was handcuffed with her hands behind her back, she was not a threat.' Ariana cried throughout yesterday's appearance. She claims the color of her skin was a factor in the incident . Ariana had been charged with battery on a protected person but prosecutors dismissed the case last month. She filed an internal affairs complaint but police ratified Izzo's conduct. Records show that Ariana was one of two people arrested on felony battery on a police officer charges in the incident. Six others were arrested on misdemeanor charges. She admitted she was 20 at the time but said she had 'only two drinks' during the night out. She added that she hadn't been asked for ID when she arrived at the nightclub with her boyfriend. The club's operator has yet to comment. Ariana's lawsuit against Izzo and his police department alleges civil rights violations and excessive force and claims he lacked proper training and supervision. Officer Izzo didn't respond to requests yesterday for a comment. Police spokesman Michael Rodriguez said the department didn't comment on litigation.","Shawn Izzo is alleged to have used 'excessive force' on Ariana Mason .

"A  man arrested by counter-terror police investigating the murder of a Syrian-born cleric has been remanded in custody after appearing in court accused of possessing an explosive substance and ammunition . Khalid Rashad, 61, appeared at Camberwell Magistrates Court today, charged with possession of an explosive substance for an unlawful purpose, and possession of ammunition for a firearm without a certificate. The charges were brought yesterday by officers investigating the death of Abdul Hadi Arwani, 48, an outspoken critic of the Assad regime in Syria, whose body was found in his parked Volkswagen Passat in Wembley, north west London, on April 7. Killed: Police investigating the alleged murder of Syrian-born imam Abdul Hadi Arwani (left) have charged Khalid Rashad (right) with possession of an explosive substance for an unlawful purpose, and possession of ammunition for a firearm without a certificate . Rashad was born Burnell 'Bernie' Mitchell - the brother of Liz Mitchell, lead singer with 1970s hit group Boney M - but changed his name after converting to Islam. The Jamaican-born builder, who was raised in a strict Christian household, is the director of the An-Noor community centre in Acton, where father-of-six Mr Arwani used to preach until 2011. Scotland Yard confirmed today they had finished searching the centre, one of several locations they searched in the wake of Mr Arwani's death. A spokesman said:  'Officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, SO15, investigating the murder in Wembley on Tuesday April 7 have charged a 61-year-old man.

"The tragic death of a seven-week-old baby in his mother’s bed has led a coroner to demand new guidelines to warn parents of the dangers of sleeping next to newborns. ‘Well cared-for and loved’ Efan James was found lying face down and unresponsive the morning after Hannah James, 26, took him to bed. At the baby’s inquest this week, a coroner in Pembrokeshire said new parents were given ‘confusing’ advice over how tired they could be when they slept in the same bed as their child. Tragedy: Efan James, who was described as 'well cared-for and loved', was sharing a bed with his mother Hannah James (pictured together) when he died in his sleep last October . Co-sleeping: Mrs James had taken her son to bed with her at the family home in Milford Haven, West Wales but the next morning he was 'lying face down and unresponsive', an inquest heard . The Welsh government’s ‘reducing the risk of cot death’ leaflet, which offers similar advice to the NHS in England, says parents should not share a bed with a young baby if they ‘feel very tired’, take drugs, smoke, or have drunk alcohol. But coroner Mark Layton said: ‘The advice is that it is not wrong to share a bed with your baby – but you should refrain from doing so if you are “excessively tired”. This is very confusing. It is a fact of life that parents or carers of a young infant would be very tired because of the baby’s erratic sleep pattern. ‘It suggests that it’s okay to go to sleep with your baby if you are not very tired. But very few people will sleep unless they’re actually tired.’ The bedsharing guidance does stress that the safest place for a baby under six months to sleep is in their own cot in the same room as its parents. But new mothers sometimes struggle with this – especially if they are breastfeeding – because the easiest place to do this is in bed. Miss James had been to a party and had ‘a little to drink’ before she, her baby and a friend all shared the bed at the family home in Neyland, West Wales, in October last year. The next morning Efan was found ‘face down and unresponsive’. Pembrokeshire Coroner Mark Layton said the current advice on 'co-sleeping' is 'confusing' Pembrokeshire Coroner’s Court heard how attempts were made to resuscitate Efan but he could not be saved. Tests later showed his brain had been starved of oxygen.Home Office pathologist Richard Jones told the inquest there was no specific cause of death but it was typical of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death or ‘cot death’. He said: ‘The cause of death might be sudden unexplained death in infancy while bed sharing. Examination showed a suggestion that the brain had an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood shortly before Efan died.’ The coroner recorded an open conclusion and said the death could not be explained on pathological grounds, adding: ‘There is no doubt that he was well cared for and loved by his family. Sadly it is not uncommon for a baby to die with no obvious cause of death.’ The Welsh government said it will consider the coroner’s comments, but said its guidance was ‘very clear’ and was reviewed by experts last year. Chief Medical Officer for Wales Dr Ruth Hussey said: ‘We will consider the coroner’s correspondence to us and respond appropriately in due course.’ A spokesman for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which issues health guidelines in England and Wales, said: ‘Sharing a bed with your baby at night can aid breastfeeding and in some cultures, co-sleeping is seen as perfectly normal. But the Department of Health advises that the safest place for a baby to sleep is in a cot.’ The clinical director of the NHS watchdog has admitted guidelines for preventing cot deaths are ‘confusing’. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published advice for England and Wales in December which told parents there was a strong link between co-sleeping and cot death, or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. But guidelines do not tell women they shouldn’t bring their babies into bed – even though it makes the risk of death five times higher. The watchdog stopped short of telling women not to take babies to bed in case the advice interfered with breastfeeding guidelines. Professor Mark Baker, NICE clinical director, said: ‘It’s quite a confusing message, it is not clear. We’re not telling people not to co-sleep, we know that could get in the way with breastfeeding, but there is an association there with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.’ He added: ‘We are between a rock and hard place. The only recommendation we could have made would be to avoid co-sleeping, but it would be seen as incompatible with breastfeeding guidelines.’ There are currently around 300 cot deaths in the UK every year. However Professor Bob Carpenter, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has estimated that around 120 cot deaths could be prevented every year in the UK if parents were advised not to co-sleep. Inquest: Mr Layton recorded an open conclusion and said Efan's death could not be explained on pathological grounds - but a pathologist said it was typical of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death or 'cot death'","Efan James died in his mother Hannah's bed in October last year .

"Incredible footage has emerged of a mysterious pair of white lights seen hovering perilously close to to the Chilean volcano eruption. Volcano Calbuco, which has laid dormant for more than 40 years, suddenly erupted on Wednesday causing a thick plume of ash to cloud the sky while thousands of people living in its shadow were forced to flee the 'apocalypse-like' event. Hundreds filmed the eruption, near the southern port city of Puerto Montt, Chile, and its deadly ash cloud which caused all nearby flights to be grounded for safety. But one amateur cameraman was surprised to see what appeared to be white lights close to the enormous plume of ash and smoke rising from the mouth of the volcano. Scroll down for video . Mysterious white lights have been spotted hovering near Chile's erupting Calbuco volcano on Wednesday . A pair of strange glowing white lights were filmed floating perilously close to the smoke and gas clouds from the eruption . The pictures have since gone viral with internet user suggesting the lights were either police helicopters, an optical illusion or an alien aircraft . The footage shows the unexplained pair of lights floating dangerous close to erupting volcano before disappearing. Tens of thousands of people have speculated on what the UFO could be, suggesting everything from police or emergence services helicopters, to a kind of optical illusion or even an alien craft. One YouTube user, Perkoff, believed it was time travelers. He wrote: 'Most UFOs are not aliens like a lot of people think. They are in fact time machines from the future. The reason you see so many UFOs at historic events is because people from the future want to come back in time and witness history. A lot of these UFOs are filled with students and are just going on a futuristic version of a field trip.' Bud Ekins wrote: 'It wants to be filmed! Drones and planes don't disappear like that.' Others argues it was something a little more mundane. One YouTube user wrote: 'For me, chances are it's a drone.' While Francisco Javier Segurasaid: 'It's a airplane, come on! Up in smoke: Volcano Calbuco, in southern Chile, has erupted forcing 1,500 residents from Ensenada, about 10 miles away,  to flee their homes (pictured, a view of the eruption from Puerto Montt, a small city around 20 miles from the volcano) Smoke and lava can be seen spewing from the Calbuco volcano in this picture taken from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas . An electrical storm lights up the night sky as a huge column of ash and lava shoots out of the volcano. The eruption sparked a red alert in the port city of Puerto Montt . Volcano Calbuco, believed to be among the three most dangerous of Chile's 90 active volcanoes, had erupted for the first time at 6pm local time on Wednesday. An estimated 1,500 people were forced to flee the nearby town of Ensenada after the eruption, while several smaller townships were also cleared. Experts said the main risk was now now of a pyroclastic flow - a superheated current of gas and rock that can destroy nearly everything in its path and travel at speeds upwards of 200 to 300 kilometers per hour. Gabriel Orozco, a vulcanologist with Chile’s geological and mining service, said: “In this situation, with the eruption column so high, the main risk is that it collapses, falls due to gravity because of its own weight and causes a pyroclastic flow,” . Locals described an apocalyptic scene as ash clouds were shot six miles into the air creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night's sky. Another unexpected eruption in the Los Lagos Region yesterday heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated, residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded. The ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway. Previous and equally violent eruptions at Calbuco have continued for up to a week, according to a volcanologist from Oxford University who told MailOnline it is impossible to predict what will happen next. The volcano is located near the tourist town of Puerto Varas and the city of Puerto Montt, a little more than 620 miles south of Chile's capital, Santiago. The National Mining and Geology Service issued a high alert, setting up an exclusion zone of 12.5miles around the volcano, barring access to the area. Trevor Moffat, who lives in Ensenada, some six miles from the volcano, said the eruption happened without warning. Volcano Calbuco's last major eruption happened in 1961, with a weak eruption following in 1972. He said: 'It sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road, rattling and shaking, guttural rumbling ... we left everything there, grabbed my kid, my dog, got in the car with my wife. Mr Moffat, who was originally born in Canada, said he was now driving his family to Puerto Varas. He added: 'All the neighbors were outside, a lot of young people crying. Armageddon type reaction.' Dusted: A car covered in ash at the Ensenada locality, on the outskirts of Calbuco volcano .

Boats dusted with volcanic ash deposited from the eruptions of the looming Calbuco volcano, background, sit parked in front of a home . Television pictures showed a spectacular mushroom-shaped column billowing into the sky with occasional lighting bolts shooting through it. The eruption was seen up to 100 miles away in neighbouring Argentina. Derek Way, a resident of Puerto Varas, said: 'There are a lot of people out in the streets, many heading to the gas stations to fill up on gas. A friend told me to fill everything we have with water.' Chile, on the Pacific 'Rim of Fire', has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active. In March, volcano Villarrica, also in southern Chile, erupted in spectacular fashion, sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky, but quickly subsided. Volcanoes occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust, either where these plates are moving toward or away from one another. Eruptions occur when magma from the Earth's core forces its way to the surface, exploding through weak points in the crust. Unexpected: The volcano last erupted in 1972, and while it is widely believed to be among Chile's most dangerous, it was not under observation before it erupted today (the eruption pictured from Puerto Varas) Explosion: Residents in nearby Puerto Varas go about their business while in the background the ash cloud from Volcano Calbuco is seen .

"Kevin Bowes, 53, lost several teeth and had nine 'avoidable' dental procedures at the hands of Dr Nicholas Crees at his Guisborough practice . A man whose teeth were reduced to 'apple cores' has won £30,000 in damages from his former dentist, after suffering more than a decade of dental neglect. Kevin Bowes lost several teeth, had four 'avoidable' root canal treatments and five 'avoidable' crowns fitted at the hands of Dr Nicholas Crees at his practice in Guisborough, North Yorkshire. The semi-retired teacher at a specialist children's unit said his life had been changed forever, revealing he will need years of remedial treatment to fix the extensive decay. The 53-year-old, from Guisborough, said: 'I feel completely let down by Dr Crees. 'I was devastated, I had no idea my teeth were in such a bad condition. 'He allowed my teeth to deteriorate so badly over the decade I visited him and all the time with a smile and a friendly demeanour which made you feel you were in good hands. 'How wrong I was.' His family had been patients of Mr Crees for more than 10 years when in January 2013, a friend suggested his wife visited a different dentist for a second opinion. And when Mr Bowes went to see the new dentist, he was given a devastating diagnosis. He added: 'The other dentist told me that I had decay in a number of teeth and would need lots of treatment to repair them. 'I had more X-rays than I care to remember and my teeth were so decayed the dentist described them as 'apple cores'. 'Before becoming a teacher I had been a successful entertainer and singer, full of confidence. 'However I have been advised that my treatment does not end here and I am likely to need ongoing treatment for years. 'It's really knocked my confidence and has changed my life forever.' After the extent of the decay was revealed, Mr Bowes instructed specialist dental negligence solicitors, the Dental Law Partnership, which secured a £30,000 payout following a two-year legal battle with Dr Crees. Mr Bowes has won £30,000 in an out-of-court settlement after a two-year battle with Dr Crees . Kate Chadwick, associate solicitor at the Dental Law Partnership, said: 'Kevin has been the victim of mistreatment by his dentist for years. 'This decade of neglect was a real catalogue of errors with Dr Nicholas Crees failing to diagnose and treat decay and carrying out extractions without informed consent. 'Fortunately he visited another dentist for a second opinion who immediately spotted the problem, otherwise, left untreated Mr Bowes may well have lost more of his teeth.' Dr Crees, who, despite the out of court settlement has not admitted liability, said that due to patient confidentiality it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the case at this time.","Kevin Bowes lost several teeth, had four 'avoidable' root canal treatments and five 'avoidable' crowns fitted by Dr Nicholas Crees over a decade .

"More than a dozen people were injured on Thursday night after a stage collapsed during an Indiana public high school theater performance, sending students plummeting 10 feet into an orchestra pit. One of the victims suffered critical head trauma as the stage fell half-way through a song during a sold-out showing of American Pie at Westfield High School. The calamity occurred at the worst possible time - just as dozens walked on stage for the finale. 'All of a sudden, everyone was gone,' one parent from the audience told RTV. Terrible: Tragedy struck Thursday night at an Indiana high school's performance of the musical American Pie . Buckled: Just as the entire cast danced on-stage for the finale, the platform beneath them collapsed . Shocking: The performers plummeted through the wooden riser in a spectacle so unbelievable that some audience members initially believed it was choreographed . Nicola Gruszka, a student who was singing in front of the stage when the platform behind her gave way, said they had previously practiced the song with the same number of people with no issue. 'We thought the worse thing that could happen on that song is that someone could miss their cue,' she told Good Morning America on Friday. After the students behind her plunged into the orchestra pit, she was so shocked that she was unable to move, she said, and was still holding the microphone 30 minutes later. Another student, Sam Greathouse, told GMA that he jumped into action. 'As soon as the stage went down I just hopped up and started pulling people out of the hole,' he said, adding that students 'really came together as a unit in that moment'. More than 12 people were hurt and least one person was critically injured, a spokesman for the Westfield Police Department said on Thursday evening. But the two students told GMA that they had heard the critically-injured student was doing much better by Friday. 'The worst ones are comparatively mild to what could've happened,' Miss Gruszka said. Some performers walked out of the pit, which was estimated to measure some 10 feet, but others required more serious medical care . The packed house, seen before the tragedy, was asked to keep calm during the confusing aftermath . The drop from the top of the wooden riser to the floor was likely around 10 feet. Many of the witnesses who'd never seen the show weren't initially sure if it was part of the performance. The confusion didn't last, however, as it soon became clear that a terrible accident had occurred. Screams and gasps can be heard in video taken of the incident, which shows all but the lead singer vanish in the middle of the song Don't Stop Believin'. 'Some parents rushed the stage area,' audience member Mandi McKinley Brown told IndyStar. 'Most of us stayed in our seats to stay out of the way. People were lifting large pieces of the stage out of the pit from on top of the kids.' According to student Zach Rader, an administrator then addressed the crowd and asked for calm before asking any healthcare professionals to come forward. Witnesses: Nicola Gruszka, left, was singing in front of the stage when it collapsed behind her, while Sam Greathouse, right, helped to pull students out of the hole. They appeared on GMA on Friday morning . 'We have some seriously injured people,' Westfield fire chief Joe Lyons. The musical's lead guitarist, Blake Camden, was not among them. He said he stepped away after noticing something about the stage wasn't right. 'When all the performers rushed the stage, I saw the floor was starting to bow a little bit and I stepped to the left and the stage collapsed,' Camden, a senior, told RTV. 'I saw 20-30 of my friends fall in.' Chris Baldwin, who works in human resources for the high school about 20 miles north of Indianapolis, said the students fell into the orchestra pit below. Cameron Snyder, 18, a senior at Westfield, was watching the show. When the stage collapsed, a mass of people ran toward it, trying to help their loved ones, Snyder said. Scene: The incident occurred at Westfield High School, pictured on Friday as students head back to class . Back to school: Police said on Friday that the dozen students hurt in the collapse are 'doing really well' 'I was just in a state of shock,' he said. Injured students were taken to at least three different hospitals, Hollowell said. School officials aid class would be held as usual on Friday but that counselors would be on site for students who might need counseling. The incident evoked memories of a 2011 stage collapse at the Indiana Stage Fair that killed seven people and injured nearly 100. High winds toppled rigging and sent the stage roof onto fans awaiting the start of a concert by the country duo Sugarland.","An Indiana public school performance of American Pie ended in tragedy Wednesday when a riser buckled just as dozens danced on-stage .

"The mother of a pregnant woman who woke up from a four-month coma earlier this month said she knew doctors were wrong when they told her that her 20-year-old daughter wouldn't wake up. Anna Moser's daughter Sharista Giles of Sweetwater, Tennessee, was driving home from a concert in December with friends when a car accident sent her to the hospital with injuries so bad doctors believed she would never recover. She was five months pregnant at the time and in January doctors were forced to deliver the baby early, a little boy the family has named Leighton Isiah Giles. Scroll down for video . Twenty-year-old Sharista Giles (left) of Sweetwater, Tennessee, went into a coma in December after a car accident. Her mom, Anna Moser (right), said that she believed her daughter would wake up even when doctors said she had a two-per cent chance of recovery . Giles (right) opened her eyes earlier this month. Though she is still nonverbal, Moser (left) talks to her daughter every day . Though Giles was given a two-per cent chance of recovering, Moser was confident her daughter would wake up. When Giles finally did open her eyes, Moser said her daughter wasn't herself it appeared that she wasn't sure what was going on around her. But she soon began following her father's movements around the room. Then, her father showed her a photo of her son. 'He showed her a picture of her baby, and she followed the picture,' said her mother, Beverly. 'When he turned around to put it back on the bulletin board, she turned her neck, her whole head trying to follow and find the picture again.' And Moser remained hopeful, but not entirely optimistic, until she started speaking to Giles a few nights ago. 'I said, ""If you could get out of that bed right now, I could take you home,"" and her head come up. And she had never did that, it was plumb off the bed,' Moser told WATE. 'That's when I knew.' Giles was five months pregnant when she fell into the coma. In January doctors were forced to deliver the baby (pictured in utero, right) early, a little boy the family has named Leighton Isiah Giles . Moser said she now speaks to her daughter every day and shows her pictures of Leighton. And though Giles is still nonverbal, Moser believes her daughter hears her. 'I finally have not a doubt in my mind. And I needed that,' she said. 'It's a process. But I know, I know, it's truly a miracle. It's truly a miracle.' Giles has yet to meet her baby in person because doctors do not want him entering the rehab facility, her aunt, Beverly Giles told ABC. Moser said Leighton has finally left the NICU and believes that Giles will make a full recovery and will be able to raise her son. 'We never gave up,' said her mother. 'She's fought this hard.' Moser said that she believes her daughter hears her when she talks to her, and she believes that Giles will make a full recovery so she will be able to raise her son .","Sharista Giles of Sweetwater, Tennessee, went into a coma after a car accident in December .

"The country’s biggest network of foodbanks charges volunteers £1,500 to hand out free food in its name, it emerged yesterday. The Trussell Trust asks for the ‘donation’ from churches and community groups which open new foodbanks. The money, volunteers are told, is needed to pay for the Trust’s staff, branding materials, PR advice and relationships with supermarkets such as Tesco. Setting up costs: Trussell Trust asks for a 'donation' of £1,500 from churches and community groups . But the hefty bill has come under scrutiny following controversy over the false Trussell Trust claim that it fed more than a million hungry people last year. In fact, the one million figure was the number of food parcels handed out – so did not account for repeat visitors. One critic accused the network – which charges foodbanks £360 for each subsequent year after the initial fee – of taking money that could be used to pay for food. The Trust, which has links with the Church of England, hands out parcels containing three days’ worth of donated food to people referred by doctors, social workers and other agencies. The number of Trussell Trust foodbanks has risen eight-fold in just five years, to 445. Its most recent accounts show an annual income of nearly £3.4million. A pitch to prospective volunteers says: ‘We’ll provide you with all the tools, training and know-how that you need to start a foodbank so that people in crisis in your town don’t have to go hungry.’ They are told they will be given a website, publicity materials and ‘opportunities to talk to the Press’ among other benefits. The Trust says: ‘Foodbanks are asked to make a £1,500 donation towards these costs.’ PR and branding: Critics accuse the charity of taking money which could be better spent on food . But the charge has sparked criticism from other charities and community groups. One foodbank volunteer leader said he saw ‘no benefit paying £1,500 upfront to TT which could be used to buy food’. Last night, Trust chief executive David McAuley said: ‘The cost to the Trussell Trust of helping to start a new foodbank is higher than the contribution that the foodbank makes.’ He said last year the Trust gave its volunteers ‘cash grants and in-kind goods which totalled double the amount that foodbanks contributed financially’.","Trussell Trust asks for 'donation' from churches and community groups .

"BBC presenter Charlie Stayt has been blasted after he misspelt the word 'education' during a live report on the issue. Viewers took to Twitter to complain after he missed out the letter 'c' when he scrawled the word on a whiteboard at a primary school in Southampton, Hampshire. Viewer Hardy Lion tweeted: '#bbcbreakfast ha ha spelt education wrong!!! Back to school!' Back to school: Eagle-eyed viewers spotted Charlie Stayt's embarrassing spelling error during a live broadcast . The presenter left out the letter 'c' when he wrote the word for the third time on the whiteboard this morning . The presenter later described the gaffe as 'one of those things,' after being alerted  to it by colleagues . Whilst Mike Knowles tweeted: 'If you're presenting a live report about education on #BBCBreakfast maybe double check how you spell education.' Viewer John Morley added: 'Fantastic, #bbcbreakfast presenter can't spell education.' Crafty Monkey wrote: '@BBCBreakfast C-!! Could do better!' Afterwards, Bill Turnbull told Stayt he had started a Twitter frenzy and made him spell out the word education live on air. He said: 'There we go, it was a typo, we'll forgive him.' Presenter Sally Nugent added: 'I don't think that spelling mistake was that bad.' Stayt said: 'Let's just call it one of those things.' But Turnbull added: 'You've only caused a Twitter frenzy in two-and-a-half minutes.' Nugent said: 'I don't think anyone's noticed.' Stayt was discussing the issue of education at Highfield Primary School as part of the programme's UK sofa tour in the run up to the election. Blunder: Stayt was broadcasting from Highfield Primary School in Southampton, Hampshire . Afterwards, colleague Bill Turnbull made red-faced Stayt spell the word 'education' US politician Dan Quayle was mocked when he misspelt the word 'potato' on a school blackboard on June 15, 1992 when he was visiting a school in Trenton as part of his official duties. He took part in a spelling bee when students had to write words on a blackboard. When it was 12-year-old William Figueroa's turn he had to write the word 'potato'. But Quayle pointed out: 'You're close, but you left a little something off. The e on the end'. In December last year, police in South Yorkshire were left embarrassed after taking delivery of a new patrol car with POLCE emblazoned on the side. In April 2013, council workmen somehow managed to spell 'school' wrong outside Innellan Primary School, near Dunoon in Scotland. They painted 'sckool' on the road instead. Bungling workers were slammed in February 2013 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, after they put up a sign for a historic Welsh bridge - but misspelled it 'Whelsh'. In March 2012, Oxfordshire council workers misspelled 'SCHOOL' as 'SCHOUL' in traffic markings outside Wolverton Primary School. A sign made by Hertfordshire Highways in February 2012 instructed motorists to 'Keer Cleap'.","Charlie Stayt made the error during live broadcast from Southampton .

"For the first time this year, Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has spotted its robotic companion on the surface of the red planet. The orbiting spacecraft captured a shot of Curiosity near the base of Mount Sharp in Gale Crater. But interestingly, the rover’s tracks are not visible - possibly because they have been swept away by the Martian weather. The HiRise camera is able to take images of the surface with a resolution of 10 inches (25cm) per pixel, allowing it to spot the rover on the surface. It is seen here in the full image, circled. The rover is parked over dark sand in a valley with light-toned outcrops of rock . The image was taken using the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRise) camera on the Martian satellite, from a height of 187 miles (300km) above the surface. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 900kg (2,000lbs). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. It is not the first time it has spotted Curiosity, or indeed other rovers, on the surface - but it is the first time in 2015. The HiRise camera is able to take images of the surface with a resolution of 10 inches (25cm) per pixel, allowing it to see Curiosity, which is the size of a car. In this image the rover is parked over dark sand in a valley with light-toned outcrops of rock. These rocks are part of the Pahrump Hills in the Murray Formation, which is an area of sandstones, siltstones and calcium sulphate veins on the surface. They are the lowest exposed rocks of Mount Sharp - also known as Aeolis Mons - which Nasa is planning to send Curiosity up at some point. In the image the rover had recently completed a drive of about 75ft (23 metres) during its 949th day on Mars - also known as a sol. North is towards the top in the image, with the entire view spanning about 1,640ft (500 metres) across. Curiosity has been driving a route through an area called Artist’s Drive, on its way to the higher layers of Mount Sharp after examining Pahrump Hills. Its ultimate science destination, Logan Pass, is at the bottom left of the image. Nasa scientists in California have revealed a distant image of Curiosity (shown). It was taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter from 187 miles up. One interesting aspect is that the rover's tracks cannot be seen. This may be due to Martian weather or they blend in with the surface . Here's the view from the surface: Curiosity took this image of Artist's Drive around a similar time that the MRO spacecraft spotted it from orbit. The rover is now on its way to a region called Logan Pass . Aside from keeping track of the rover, this image also allows scientists to monitor nearby sand dunes. And the absence of the rover’s tracks also hints at one of two possibilities. It may be that Martian wind has swept them away, or it could be that the dark sand dug up by the wheels as they move is a similar colour to the surface, and thus indistinguishable. The last time Curiosity was spotted from orbit was more than four months ago. Another benefit of taking this sort of image is to find upcoming landmarks that might be of interest for the rover. Curiosity has now been on Mars for almost 1,000 days, having landed on 6 August 2012. Shown here is a mosaic of images creating a self-portrait of the rover, which makes it look like someone else has taken it .","Nasa scientists in California have revealed a distant image of Curiosity taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .

"Former Royal Marine Bobby Burnett beat his girlfriend and banned her from wearing revealing clothes in a two-year-long campaign of terror . A controlling Afghanistan veteran who beat his girlfriend and banned her from wearing revealing clothes has been jailed for a two-year-long campaign of terror. Royal Marine Bobby Burnett forced Samantha Chudley to stop wearing make-up because he wanted to make her less attractive to other men, and forced her to hand over the passwords of her e-mail and social media accounts so he could monitor them, Exeter Crown Court heard. The 30-year-old installed a tracker app on her smartphone and brutally attacked her when she visited him at the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone, Devon, and at her home. His violence and the stress of his controlling behaviour led her to have two miscarriages, one of which happened days after he punched her in the stomach when she was ten weeks pregnant, the court was told. The otherwise exemplary Marine's personality changed because he was taking a powerful illegal steroid normally given to beef cattle to make them increase body mass, the court was told. He told police she was lying about his repeated assaults but inquiries showed he had asked the Marines for help to control his domestic violence. And checks on his mobile phone showed hundreds of texts in which he begged her to forgive his attacks and promised to stop hitting her. Burnett was a Marine with an exemplary service record who has been thrown out of the Corps after a routine drug screen showed he was taking steroids. Burnett, 30, who has been in custody since leaving the Commando Training Centre, admitted aggravated harassment and making threats to kill and was jailed for two years and two months by Judge Phillip Wassall. He told him: 'Miss Chudley lost all confidence in herself. She was even having to check with you what she could wear and you began to chastise her for wearing make up. 'If she ever questioned you, your response was to attack her, grabbing her by the neck, holding her up against walls, putting her to the floor and telling her to shut up. 'She says the assaults happened on a weekly basis although you say there were longer periods between attacks when you could control your temper. 'This was a relationship where you set out to control her by violence to the extent her will was completely broken and she became completely subservient to your control over the best part of two years. 'You were not only abusing alcohol but taking steroids at the time and it is well known they can cause bad temper and cause violence. The 30-year-old installed a tracker app on her smartphone and brutally attacked her when she visited him at the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone, Devon, and at her home, the court was told . 'This was a protracted history of very serious domestic violence. The aggravating features are the continued and repeated threats and extreme domestic violence. 'You now acknowledge your responsibility and I believe you have had a change of heart and are far less dangerous than you were. It is an attribute of your steroid abuse that it played some part in your behaviour.' The judge made a restraining order banning Burnett from contacting Miss Chudley ever again. Miss Emily Pitts, prosecuting, said texts recovered from Burnett's phone showed the domination he asserted over his partner. One said: 'I won't change. You will always have to live by my rules and do what I say.' She only left him after two years of repeated assaults and his increasing domination in which he would attack her and call her a s**g if she wore make up or attractive clothes. Miss Pitts said his attacks and bullying led to Miss Chudley becoming a shell of her normal self and feeling worthless and enslaved. Miss Pitts said: 'She went through months and months of torture. He would go out of his way to make her feel like she was nothing. 'She says she felt worthless and he destroyed all her confidence. Friends told her they did not recognise her as the same person while she was under his control. 'He would constantly question her about where she was and who she was with and installed a tracking app on her phone. She felt sick and trapped. 'She is petrified that when he is released she will become the focus of his rage at the fact that his life has fallen apart and will find her and hurt her or even kill her.' Mr Barry White, defending, said that since acknowledging his guilt Burnett is a changed man who is determined to address the issues which led him to treat Miss Chudley as he did. He provided references from Burnett's previous partner and a new girlfriend, both of whom say he has behaved well towards them. He also provided testimonials from the Marines showing an unblemished 11 year record in which he saw action in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the 2011 operation in Libya. He said: 'He went off kilter. This relationship was toxic and dysfunctional and he knows he carries the burden of responsibility for that.'","Afghanistan veteran Bobby Burnett regularly beat partner Samantha Chudley and forced her to hand over passwords for e-mail and Facebook .

Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) said earlier this week it planned to take the animals away on Friday.

Asked whether the department would consider seizing the animals he replied: 'We have that idea but in our actions so far it has not reached that process yet.' Unlike previous visits, the monks did not object to officials entering the sanctuary, an AFP photographer on the scene said.

In February, wildlife officials said they conducted a raid and discovered dozens of hornbills, jackals and Asian bears that were being kept at the sanctuary without the correct permits. 'I think a lot of the people here are very motivated, I think they really love the animals, but they're doing it absolutely the wrong way,' Edwin Wiek, founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, which has campaigned to have the tigers removed, told AFP. 'Wildlife management, whether that's in the wild or captivity, comes with a lot of knowledge, a lot of rules, a lot of dos and don'ts. And walking around with adult tigers like this, that could snap their mood at any time, is an accident waiting to happen,' he added. Temple authorities were unavailable for comment Friday.

"A woman who had stars tattooed on her face says she has no choice other than to claim benefits worth £14,000-a-year because no one will employ her. Kay Bennett, 33, from Swindon, says the tattoos, which were done when she was 24, have turned her into a jobless recluse. 'Until they are removed, I won’t be able to find a job and will be stuck on benefits,' says Miss Bennett, who resigned from her last role because she felt 'left out' by colleagues, and is now hoping someone will step forward and offer to pay for her to have laser removal. Benefits: Kay Bennett, 33, from Swindon, says she can't get a job because of her six facial tattoos . ‘I can’t afford to have it done but I’m absolutely desperate to get rid of them,' says Miss Bennett, who claims she has applied for 40 jobs in the last year but without success. 'I hope my nightmare will make anyone think twice about having such visible tattoos especially on your face, neck or hands,' she says. 'I am well spoken but as soon as people see me they think I’m rough and common. People take one look at me, see the stars and automatically think I’m a criminal or on drugs. 'I’ve applied for 40 jobs in the last year alone. But as soon as I turn up for an interview I can see that person looking at the stars on my face. 'As soon as they see those stars, and the other tattoos on my neck and hands, their mind is made up. They are not going to employ me.’ Tough: She says she has applied for more than 40 jobs but has had no success because of her 18 tattoos . Embarrassed: Her six facial tattoos have left her embarrassed and as a result, she suffers from depression . Removal: She says she wants a well-wisher to pay for laser treatment - and will have to stay on benefits until then . Her handouts, which total £14,000 a year, include an employment and support allowance of £360 a fortnight and housing benefit of £400-a-month. She also gets sick money because she suffers from depression, the result, she says, of tattoo-related comfort eating that has caused her go up three dress sizes from a 12 to an 18. Another great upset is caused by being unable to find a boyfriend, which Miss Bennett says is also down to the inkings. 'I only attract bad boys,' she admits. 'Nice guys don’t fancy me because of my tattoos.’ In an ironic twist, the 33-year-old, who has 18 tattoos in total, says she got her first one as a means of boosting her confidence, which had been knocked by school bullies. 'I thought if I had tattoos I would look hard and people would think twice before picking on me,' she explains. Old life: Miss Bennett pictured before getting the tattoos and before gaining six stone . Changing shape: She blames the tattoos for causing her to shoot up from a size 12 (left) to a size 18 (right) Over the next six years she got further tattoos done on her arms and neck, but  easily found work as a security guard. Then, aged 24, she decided to have six stars tattooed on her face - much to her parents and her employers' horror. It took her eight years to find another job, this time as a dog sitter. But after a few months, she resigned when other staff failed to invite her on a night out. ‘I started off working as a volunteer and people got to know me,'  explains Miss Bennett. 'But other staff were wary of me because of how I look. 'I didn’t get invited out with them and I was so upset I had to resign.’ Since then she has been unable to find another job and has spiralled into depression. ‘I can’t go out because I feel everyone is staring at me,’ she says. ‘I come from a middle class family. My dad is an estimator, my sister is a social worker and my mum works in admin. [But] people judge me on my looks and rarely bother to get to know me.’","Kay Bennett, 33, says she has been turned down for 40 jobs in the last year .

"A psychiatrist treating the man who shot Ronald Reagan said the patient wants to start a band and should be allowed to publish his music anonymously. Dr Giorgi-Guarnieri testified on Friday during court hearings in Washington, D.C., that will ultimately determine whether and under which conditions John Hinckley Jr. will be allowed to live full time outside a mental hospital. Giorgi-Guarnieri said Hinckley should be allowed to start the band but not perform publicly. One of Hinckley's interests is music, and he sings and plays the guitar. He also participates in music therapy. John Hinckley Jr, in 2014, the would-be assassin of President Ronald Reagan, pictured for the first time since a court ruled he can spend 17 days a month away from a mental home where he has been for the last three decades at his mother's Virginia home . Secret Service agents and bystanders attend to those injured in the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan by John Hinckley Jr on March 30, 1981.  Hinckley's lawyers said mental illness drove the then 25-year-old Hinckley to shoot the President in an effort to impress actress Jodie Foster . Hinckley's lawyer and treatment team say he's ready to live full time at his 89-year-old mother's home in Virginia under certain conditions. Hinckley has been allowed freedom in stages. He spends 17 days a month at his mother's Williamsburg home. If the man who shot President Reagan is allowed to leave a mental hospital for good, he should have to live under strict conditions, wearing an ankle monitoring device and driving a car with a GPS tracking device, government lawyers said on Thursday. Hinckley's attorney, Barry Levine, said on Wednesday on the first day of hearings that Hinckley is 'clinically ready' to live permanently outside the hospital, a position supported by his treatment team. Levine said that the mental illness that drove the then 25-year-old Hinckley to shoot the president in 1981 in an effort to impress actress Jodie Foster has been in 'full and stable remission' for more than two decades. But Levine and government lawyers disagree about the conditions Hinckley should have to comply with if he is allowed to live full-time outside of St. Elizabeth's mental hospital in Washington, his home since a jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting. Prosecutors have proposed about three dozen conditions if Hinckley lives permanently at his mother's home in Williamsburg. Hinckley in his police mugshot in 1981 after he shot President Reagan. He has been allowed his freedom in stages following the assassination attempt . President Reagan with wife Nancy at George Washington University Hospital four days after the assassination attempt on him in 1981 . Those restrictions include monitoring software on the home's computer and a ban on searching for information about: himself, Reagan, Foster, and Reagan press secretary James Brady, who also was injured in the shooting. Prosecutors also want him prohibited from setting up social media accounts on sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn, at least partly because he has been diagnosed with a narcissistic personality disorder, though his doctors say its effects have diminished. Hinckley's lawyers and the hospital oppose many of the restrictions. VJ Hyde, one of the people involved with Hinckley's case at St. Elizabeths, testified on Thursday that it could be helpful for Hinckley to explore information about himself, including news stories and information about the shooting and the people he hurt. Hyde also said the hospital 'adamantly opposes' requiring Hinckley to wear an ankle monitor. Hyde said 'many people don't recognize' Hinckley anymore, and he said the monitor would further stigmatize him. The judge overseeing Hinckley's case, U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman, previously rejected prosecutors' request to have Hinckley wear an ankle monitor during the 17-day visits to his mother's home. Freedom for Hinckley, who turns 60 next month, has come gradually. For a dozen years, Friedman has allowed him increasing freedom, with the purpose of reintegrating him into society. Friedman first agreed in 2003 that he could have day visits with his family in the Washington area, then local overnight visits. Visits with his parents in Williamsburg followed. Those were expanded to 17 days by the judge in late 2013. It will ultimately be up to Friedman whether to let Hinckley live full time in Williamsburg and, if so, under what conditions. Some of the conditions attorneys are discussing are ones Hinckley already complies with while in Williamsburg and which both sides agree on: carrying a GPS-enabled cellphone, not talking to the media, and attending individual and group therapies. The U.S. Secret Service also keeps watch on Hinckley now and then, but it's not a condition of his release. Scott Hinckley, brother of John Hinckley, arrives at the federal courthouse in DC on Wednesday for the hearing on whether his sibling should spend more time outside the mental institution that he was sentenced to after shooting President Reagan .","Dr Giorgi-Guarnieri testified at hearing that will ultimately determine whether Hinckley will be allowed to live full time outside a mental hospital .

When the Washington couple's three-year-old had first began complaining of someone talking to him at night, his parents had put it down to their toddler's over-active imagination, reported CBS New York. That was until one night when they heard a strange man's voice come over the monitor to tell their son: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you.' A couple heard the terrifying message: 'Wake up little boy, daddy's looking for you' come through their 3-year-old son's baby monitor (stock image) And the horrified parents, who do not want to be named for fear the unknown man could track them down, believe it is not just the audio monitor that has been hacked. They believe the stranger has also got into the camera on the device. After the first creepy message, the boy's mother had walked into the room and overheard the hacker saying, 'Look someone's coming' or 'Someone's coming into view.' The mother said she broke down in tears after the realization hit home that a total stranger was able to control the camera to watch their son and spy on them. The stranger had managed to hack the baby monitor and the family says the hacker was even able to remotely control the camera on the monitor (stock image) She told CBS New York: 'Well, I started to cry in there, because it all started coming back to me, and I started figuring things out.' They reported the incident to Foscam, the company where they bought their monitor, who admitted it was possible the device's cameras were being controlled remotely but they could not say from where. Technology experts have now warned that it is becoming easier for hackers to infiltrate family's baby monitors as many of the newer devices connect to the internet. 'It's basically like they're standing next to you in your house,' Lance Ulanoff, chief correspondent for the digital media website Mashable,CBS. He warned that parents should change the passwords on the devices to make it more difficult for people to guess. Because some new baby monitors connect to the internet and come with a smartphone app, it has become easier for hackers to infiltrate them and listen in or speak to children . 'If somebody else has your login information, they can go to that same app, and log into your webcam, which is what happened here,' Ulanoff said. Earlier this month, another couple - this time from Rochester, Minnesota - discovered their baby monitors and cameras had been infiltrated after they found footage from the nanny cam posted online, according to Redbook. They first became suspicious after they heard music coming in from their baby's room. 'We were sleeping in bed, and basically heard music coming from the nursery, but then when we went into the room the music turned off,' she told KTTC. When she tracked down the IP address which was streaming the music, she found a web link to a page with thousands of pictures from baby monitors all over the world, including several from her own child's nursery. 'There's at least fifteen different countries listed and it's not just nurseries—it's people's living rooms, their bedrooms, their kitchens,' she explained. 'Every place that people think is sacred and private in their home is being accessed.'","Washington couple's son began complaining of someone talking to him .

"The daughter of Second World War Nazi strongman Hermann Goering has failed in her bid to get the state of Bavaria to return family money confiscated after the collapse of the Third Reich. Goering, who cheated the hangman at Nuremberg by committing suicide shortly before he was due to be executed for war crimes, was deputy to Hitler and the regime's greatest art thief. The infamous military leader plundered private collections and museums wherever the swastika flew but his daughter Edda, 76, has always refused to criticise him. Scroll down for video . Edda Goering has always refrained from criticising her father for his part in the mass extermination of Jews . Showing his soft side: Hermann Goering appears on the front cover of a magazine with daughter Edda in 1940 . Ms Goering petitioned the Bavarian parliament's Legal Affairs Committee for compensation for her 'father's legacy expropriated in the year 1948'. The exact sum she was seeking was not disclosed but the petition was refused by lawmakers. She claims the posthumous expropriation of his assets two years after his death was illegal. Edda, born out of his second marriage with actress Emmy Sonnemann, tried back in the sixties to have a painting - looted by her father and presented to her at birth - returned to her. This attempt also failed. Hitler's goddaughter: Edda Goering, pictured at her christening with Hitler in 1938, has failed in her bid to get the state of Bavaria to return family money confiscated after the collapse of the Third Reich . Infamous military leader: Goering, who cheated the hangman at Nuremberg by committing suicide shortly before he was due to be executed for war crimes, was deputy to Hitler and the regime's greatest art thief . Today she lives in Munich and talks fondly of her father as a 'loving man,' refusing to criticise him for his role in ordering the Blitz on British cities or for ordering the extermination programme against the Jews which led to the deaths of six million people. Edda was famously pictured stroking the cheek of Hitler, her godfather, at her christening. The ceremony took place in November 1938 - ten months before the outbreak of the Second World War. The christening gown given to her by Hitler and embroidered with swastikas was rumoured to have gone on auction in 2010. The 3ft-long gown came from one of the Luftwaffe chief's maids and fell into the hands of a collector who is thought to have sold it in the UK.

"A German language teacher has been suspended in France after suggesting that panzers should invade the country again so as 'subdue unruly pupils'. The Frenchwoman also used her classes to defend Adolf Hitler's domestic record, and his plans for overseas expansion. 'He was a good man who built motorways and liked music,' she is alleged to have said, before being suspended from the Auguste Remoir college in Limoges, west-central France. The German language teacher suggested that tanks (pictured is a panzer during the Second World War) should be used to invade France again to subdue unruly pupils . Hundreds of German tanks rolled into the country in May 1940 as their Blitzkrieg led to France becoming part of the Third Reich. Yet, according to complaining parents who passed on the comment to other teachers, the woman said she hoped 'German tanks come to Renoir to subdue unruly pupils'. Seventeen of the 20 pupils in her class signed a petition against the teacher, and it was quickly acted on by the authorities. Parent teacher association president, Maurice Sourdioux, said: 'In my experience, this kind of procedure is extremely rare in national education. I have never seen it anywhere else.' She has since been suspended from the Auguste Remoir college in Limoges, west-central France (pictured) The teacher, who has been at the school since September, has denied any wrong doing, saying she was 'very shocked by the extent of the case'. References to the Second World War are particularly sensitive in France, where a collaborationist government worked with the Nazis. State institutions including the SNCF railway company and police in major cities such as Paris assisted in the Holocaust too. Despite this, there are regular cases of far right sympathisers expressing support for the kind of racism and anti-Semitism championed by the Nazis. Last month, a music teacher in Berlin was questioned by police after forcing pupils to march up and down singing a Nazi song. Germany had been forbidden from producing and using tanks because of the Treaty of Versailles. But under a secret program  code named the 'Traktor', they began developing armored military vehicles and artillery. The early tanks which were mostly used for training were then tested in the Soviet Union. The early German panzer force's success was mainly down to tactical innovation rather than the quality of the vehicles. But many of their later tanks outclassed Allied armor, delivering more casualties than they took in most engagements during the Second World War. A parade of German tanks crossed the desert plans of Libya in the Second World War in May 1941 . Production of the first tank, the Panzer I, began in 1932 and mass production began in 1934. It had been intended only as a training tank to introduce the army to armored warfare but the Panzer I  saw combat in Poland, France, the Soviet Union and North Africa during the Second World War. The army went onto to produce the Panzer II to fill the gap after the construction of medium tanks,  Panzer III and IV, fell behind schedule. Along with the Panzer I, the II made up the bulk of German tank forces during the invasion of Poland and France. The final Panzer, IV, was the workhorse force during the war making up half of all German tanks. It was also the only German tank to remain in production for the entire war- with a total of 8,800 produced.","Teacher suggested German tanks should invade France to subdue pupils .

"Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed for a year after orchestrating a scam to steal £15,000 of goods from the Asda in Basildon, Essex, where he worked . An Asda manager orchestrated a scam that used the supermarket's own delivery service to steal goods worth more than £15,000 - then managed to land a job at Lidl after he was sacked. Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed after running the scam where stock including alcohol, cigarettes, DVDs, computer games and consoles were taken from the store in Basildon, Essex, where he worked. Southend Crown Court heard how the conspiracy was uncovered, following a period during which Gridley and colleague Jay Reed were under suspicion. Thomas Daniel, prosecuting, told the court that goods, ranging from televisions to baby formula, were delivered to Reed's address and presumably sold on. He said: 'Two anonymous reports were received by Asda, one of which suggested Mr Gridley was involved in selling items believed to have been stolen, such as TVs and baby formula. 'When Mr Gridley was ill for a certain period of time, those deliveries stopped, and when he recovered they started again. 'Another email suggested stolen goods being delivered to the address of Mr Gridley's cousin.' But shockingly, after being sacked from the store, Gridley managed to land a managerial role at Lidl in Romford, Essex. Gridley, who was former home shopping manager of the store, was sentenced to 12 months for his leading role in a conspiracy to steal £15,852.46 worth of goods between November 2013 and April last year. The court heard that Reed and another defendant James Munyard had been pressured into taking part in the scam by Gridley, who was their superior. Stock including alcohol, cigarettes were taken from shelves and delivered to addresses using the supermarket's own home delivery service. File photo . Section leader Reed, 23, and Munyard, 21, both avoided prison, but were given suspended sentences of eight and four months, respectively. Mitchell Cohen, representing Munyard, told the court that his client, whose role was confined to taking items off shelves and putting them in a crate, had attempted to be transferred from the store in order to escape Gridley's control. James Munyard (pictured) avoided jail for his part in the scam . Reed was deemed to have been in a position of trust and responsibility in the criminal enterprise, but Recorder Gerard Pounder said he had a lesser role than Gridley, 26, and Munyard even less so. Despite hearing Gridley, of Tilbury,  financially supported his former partner and their two-year-old child but also his own father and grandparents, Recorder Pounder said he had no choice but to send him to prison. He said: 'You were in a position of supreme trust and you say you started this because of threats made regarding a drug debt of your cousin's, you continued even as those threats faded, and brought other people in, too.' Sentencing Reed to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, and 200 hours' unpaid work, he said: 'You were in a lesser role than Mr Gridley but you were a section leader and had responsibilities. 'In that respect you were somebody who knew the system and it was to your premises these items were taken - without that and your part in the enterprise, it would not have worked.' Munyard, who Mr Cohen said 'didn't have the spine to stand up to what he was being asked to do,' was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months, and 100 hours' unpaid work. A spokesperson for Lidl told MailOnline they are unable to comment until an internal investigation has been conducted.","Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed after running the scam at store in Basildon .

"A couple who spent a lifetime paying off their mortgage have said it was a waste of time after a council scheme to sell neighbouring homes for just £1 has turned the street into a 'ghetto'. Linda and George Hunter, who raised their four children in their home in Garrick Street, Wavertree, Liverpool, became mortgage free around 15 years ago. But eight years ago, the street became part of a regeneration scheme and the council bought properties and boarded them up ready for demolition. Estate agents say the couple would now struggle to sell their home for much more than £1 as other houses in the street are being sold off at that price by the council. Scroll down for video . Linda Hunter (pictured) who lives on Garrick Street, Wavertree, Liverpool, says she is stuck in a 'ghetto' after Liverpool city council offered to sell homes in her street for £1 . Despite their neighbours moving out, the couple stayed put as they had elderly parents living close by who relied on them. They thought that what the council was offering for their home at the time - around £85,000 - was too low and believed it was worth closer to £120,000. Mrs Hunter, 62, a retired careworker, told the Liverpool Echo: 'As the street has become a horrible place to live and my parents died last year we thought ""enough is enough"" and decided to take the council's offer and move to a home that was similar in price to ours.' She picked out houses worth around £120,000 and the council said they would look into it for her in October, but months later the couple were told the offer had fallen through as their street was now part of Liverpool's 'Home for a Pound' scheme. Now the Hunters feel trapped as property prices have dramatically fallen in the area. An estate agent from Abode in nearby Allerton said: 'I would estimate a three-bedroomed house like one in Garrick Street would be worth around £60,000 at the moment but they would struggle to get even close to that. 'It would be very hard for them to sell their home when other properties in the road are being sold for £1.' Linda Hunter, 62, feels trapped in the area as property prices in neighbouring houses have dramatically fallen . As the couple are unlikely to sell their home, they want the council to put its original offer back on the table. Mrs Hunter told the paper: 'We've spent our lives paying off a property that is now worth virtually nothing. 'Who's going to buy our house for thousands when they can get the house next door for £1?' She added: 'The council created this ghetto that we are now trapped in and they feel they owe us nothing at all. 'We watched our lively and friendly road turn into a ghost town. 'There's junk everywhere and we're plagued with rats and fly tipping. We also have security cameras at the back and front of our house because of anti-social behaviour. 'I'm so frustrated as there's nothing we can do about it and the lack of communication from the authorities makes it feel like we keep hitting a brick wall. 'Even if things do regenerate, it could take years, which means we are still stuck for a long time.' Liverpool city council said the fact some vacant properties in the area are being offered for £1 so that they can be renovated does not mean that other houses which are occupied are only worth £1. A spokesman said: 'Homes for a Pound will see properties in this area which have long lain empty, derelict and rundown completely transformed, helping make this part of the city a thriving and sustainable community again. 'This is really good news for existing property owners as it will mean the area is a far more desirable place to live. 'The houses that are part of the Homes for a Pound scheme require significant work and financial investment so can't be compared with other properties. We are in discussions with existing local residents to explain our exciting plans for this area.'","Linda and George Hunter became mortgage free around 15 years ago .

"Opera isn't normally a field associated with animal cruelty, but the two worlds have collided in China after a singer posted pictures of herself wearing a headdress made from kingfisher feathers. Web users and conservationists quickly criticised her indifference towards animal welfare after it emerged the accessory was made from the feathers of no less than 80 of the colourful birds, according to the People's Daily Online. Outcry: Opera singer Liu Guijuan is heavily criticised for showing off her headdress (pictured) made with feather from 80 kingfishers . Peking opera singer Liu Guijuan wrote in her post on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, that she had bought the rare headpiece more than a decade ago for 120,000 yuan (£10,775). 'It is made with the feathers from under the wings of 80 kingfishers,' she said the post. Miss Liu, a well-respected opera artist from Tianjin city, said the current market price for the headdress is no less than 400,000 yuan (£42,583). She added that she is often envied by fellow artists at the backstage for wearing such pieces. The post immediately attracted attention of Chinese animal lovers, who said art shouldn't come at the cost of sacrificing innocent birds. 'I feel like these people should step down. Who wants to see you if you build your art upon animal's suffering. We would rather you get out!' Commented one web user. In the name of art: Miss Liu, an established opera singer in China, is seen on stage (right) in the headdress that landed her in hot water . But there were some supportive voices too. 'Liu Guijuan has followed industry rule and the headdresses are just for performing purpose, it has nothing to do with environmental protection,' wrote one unnamed web user. Others suggested that artists could just as easily use fake feathers to create realistic costumes. Victim: Two of the 11 types of kingfisher in China are protected species . Faced with public outcry, Miss Liu initially didn't back down. She replied in her comments: 'I'm doing this in respect to art. In order to buy the best (headdress), I'd rather spend more money and use more kingfishers.' She also indicated that Chinese Peking opera master, Mei Lanfang, used to collect headpieces with feathers from  kingfishers. However, she took down her original post not long after. Two of the 11 types of kingfisher in China are protected species. People's Daily Online reported in the same article that the police authority in Guangdong seized nearly 60,000 dead kingfishers last October. But no further information was released on what these kingfishers had been killed for.","Liu Guijuan shared pictures of the headdress on Chinese social media .

"The ex-partner of disgraced Queensland politician Billy Gordon has opened up about the years of abuse she suffered, including three months where she and her children were essentially held hostage and forced to live in fear. The Queensland government was plunged into crisis after when details of the Cook MP's criminal past emerged, leading the Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk to call for his resignation. After Mr Gordon's dark past was revealed he resigned from the Labor party but refused to resign from parliament. Until now, the mother of his two children, Kristy Peckham has been in hiding. The ex-partner of Queensland politician Billy Gordon has opened up about the years of abuse she suffered . Cook MP Billy Gordon was told by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to quit after the explosive details of his dark past were revealed . She has finally spoken out in an interview with A Current Affair, detailing the domestic violence she suffered through, as well as the disappointment she feels as a result of how the Queensland government have handled the situation. 'I was basically like a hostage to him, I wasn't allowed to go anywhere and there was just so much violence,' Ms Peckham said. 1987: Breaking and entering, and stealing in Innisfail . 1990: Breaking and entering with intent, attempted breaking and entering, and stealing in Atherton . 1992: Breach of probation in Atherton . 1996: Public nuisance in Normanton . 1999: Breach of bail conditions, stemming from not attending a court summons from the 1996 incident . 2004: Driver's licence suspended for unlicensed driving . 2006: Again, he had his driver's licence for unlicensed driving . 2008: Served an apprehended violence order (AVO) as a result of a complaint by his mother . 'There were times when I was holding our son and he'd hit me and I'd be curled over, trying to protect him.' Ms Peckham said she and her partner started dating in 2001 before finally splitting in 2012. The violence began when she fell pregnant with their daughter and only escalated after their second child, a boy, was born. 'The first time that I actually saw Billy go off he abused me physically. He went off and threw some things around, broke some stuff and it was at that point that I thought 'who is this person and what's going on?',' said Ms Peckham. Their whole relationship was marred by Mr Gordon's controlling, intimidation, obsessive ways and quick temper. 'To me, he's a monster,' said the single mum from North Queensland. She is intensely protective of her children – the children that she claims her partner never sees. In 2006, she and her two children moved to a home in Dubbo in NSW's central west while Mr Gordon went to Canberra for his political career. Ms Peckham alleges that when he returned to Dubbo his appalling behaviour became worse than ever. For three months she was a prisoner in their home and was prevented from contacting the outside world. 'It was like a sick cycle of three months of hell. We were locked in, the doors were dead bolted, there was security on all the windows,' she said. Ms Peckham alleges that when Mr Gordon returned to Dubbo his appalling behaviour became worse than ever . Until now, the mother of his two children, Kristy Peckham has been in hiding . The phone line had physically been cut to ensure there was no way out for Mr Gordon's trapped partner. 'Unless I threw something through the window and broke the window, I couldn't leave. Even then, he would have caught me before I got out.' The politician has spoken out publicly, denying any allegations of violence. 'That made me very, very angry,' admits Ms Peckham. 'I thought, 'How dare you? You know what you've done!' There are other people that know what he's done too.' Ms Peckham is intensely protective of her children – the children that she claims her partner never sees . The Queensland government was plunged into crisis after when details of the Cook MP's criminal past emerged . Fortunately, his traumatised partner kept every letter, email and text and now has a damning case against him. A letter written by Mr Gordon in 2006 after his wife finally managed to flee the home serves as a confession of his disgusting abusive behaviour. 'I want to say sorry for the hell I put all through for our time together in Dubbo. I hope in time you can forgive me for the abuse. I've treated you bad and hurt you deep,' the letter reads, according to the Nine Network. 'I've bullied you through our whole relationship. I've acted like an animal.' Although Ms Peckham is now free of her abusive partner, it is a constant battle to receive child support payments from Mr Gordon despite his wealth. In parliament in March, Mr Gordon gave his word that he no longer owed child support. As he made his speech in parliament, he was $24 in arrears. He had owed his wife $5300 in child support just three days before. Knowingly lying to parliament is a criminal offence in Queensland, carrying a maximum jail term of seven years. Today he is still indebted by $732.97. His ex-partner claims he is also lying about his income to the tax office. Ms Peckham said her ex-husband still owes $732.97 in child support . The violence began when she fell pregnant with their daughter and only escalated after their second child . According to documents, Mr Gordon is registered with the child support agency as only earning $70,000. In actuality the politician earns in excess of $160,000 every year. 'All I care about is my children,' Ms Peckham said. 'He doesn't deserve to have that type of position and power that he's got. 'He should resign.' Ms Peckham doesn't like the way Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk handled the allegations either. She said the premier had never contacted her. 'You've done nothing for me, you've done nothing for my children,' Ms Peckham added. Ms Palaszczuk earlier refused to comment on abuse allegations, but said deceiving parliament was also a very serious issue. 'That's a matter for Member for Cook and that's a matter for people to raise,' the premier said. 'If someone has misled the parliament that is very serious.' Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg called for Mr Gordon to make a full and proper disclosure about the fresh allegations. 'He can't hide behind the police investigation in regards to non-payment of child support or non-return of tax returns,' he said. Ms Peckham said she and her partner started dating in 2001 before finally splitting in 2012 . Mr Gordon hasn't returned AAP's calls, but earlier described the A Current Affair as 'a kangaroo court' Mr Springborg also demanded to know how Ms Palaszczuk was sure Mr Gordon was telling the truth when she questioned him about the allegations. 'How did she satisfy herself about that, did she ask to see the records or didn't she,' he asked. On April 8, as Mr Gordon announced he would stay in parliament, he vowed to take care of his family and right his past wrongs. 'My focus now is on demonstrating to my family, my children and my community that I am a good man and that I will honour their vote for me,' he said in a statement. 'Some people, even MPs, may think they have a perfect past. Mine has not been. I have remorse for past events, but I have learned many lessons since I was a young man. Mr Gordon hasn't returned AAP's calls, but earlier described the A Current Affair program as 'a kangaroo court'. 'Unlike that program and other media outlets, I respect the current police investigation into certain allegations against me,' Mr Gordon said in a statement. 'I will thus make no comment until it is completed.'","The ex-partner of disgraced Queensland MP Billy Gordon has opened up .

"A controversial US pastor has defended trying to buy a $65million private jet with worshippers' donations and responded to critics by claiming 'the devil is trying to discredit' him. Reverend Creflo Dollar, 53, launched an appeal last month for 200,000 people to each donate '$300 or more' so that he could purchase a Gulfstream G650 to replace his current damaged aircraft. The wealthy televangelist, who is known to own two Rolls Royces and multi-million dollar homes, came under heavy criticism for the appeal but has insisted he needs the plane for preaching work. Scroll down for video . Defends private jet appeal: Reverend Creflo Dollar has defended trying to buy a $65million Gulfstream G650 with worshippers' donations by claiming 'the devil is trying to discredit' him . The appeal: This notice was posted on the church's website, pleading for donations so that Dollar could 'continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ'. It has since been taken down . Dollar, who is one of the most prominent African-American preachers in the United States, launched the private jet appeal via a five-minute video on his website. Shortly afterwards, he shut the website down but worshippers could still donate to the cause via the World Changers donation site which remains open. In a newly posted five-minute clip on YouTube, the Atlanta-based pastor responded to his critics saying: '(The devil thinks) I got to discredit that man before he starts showing people Jesus! 'I'm on my sabbatical, and the enemy's trying to discredit me. I never one time came to you and asked you for a dime for this airplane, did I? Damaged: Dollar says the church's current plane, bought in 1999, is broken and needs to be replaced, or he will be unable to continue working around the world . 'The (critics) don't know what we do. That's why they asked the question, what does a preacher need with an airplane? If you knew what we did, then you wouldn't ask that question. 'Just because the world doesn't have it, doesn't mean that you can't.' Dollar is the head of the World Changers Church International, a Christian ministry centered around the prosperity gospel, which preaches that God wants to bless the faithful with earthly riches. His original appeal for the Gulfstream G650 - which claims to be the fastest plane ever built in civilian aviation - was so that 'World Changers Church International can continue to blanket the globe with the Gospel of grace'. A Gulfstream G650 can fly 18 passengers and four crew members, according to gulfstream.com. The jet comes with two Rolls-Royce engines, high-speed Internet and two multichannel satellites and allows for a four-and-a-half-hour commute from New York to Los Angeles. 'The G650 is the biggest, fastest, most luxurious, longest range and most technologically advanced jet -- by far,' according to the site. Among the billionaires who own a Gulfstream G650 are Steve Jobs' wife Lauren Powell Jobs, Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn add Nike co-founder Phil Knight. There is a long waiting list for the aircraft, with the next round of planes not due until 2017. Couple: Dollar and his wife, Taffi (pictured together) were married in 1985 and have five children . Wealthy: Dollar and his family primarily live in this multi-million dollar in Fayettville, Georgia, south of Atlanta . According to the Creflo Dollar Ministry's website: 'The ministry's current airplane, was built in 1984, purchased by the ministry in 1999 and has since logged four million miles. 'Recently on an overseas trip to a global conference, one of the engines failed. 'By the grace of God, the expert pilot, who's flown with Creflo for almost 20 years, landed the plane safely without injury or harm to any passengers.' The Christian Post first reported that Dollar insisted that he needs the jet to continue sharing the word of Jesus. He preaches all over the world, but primarily works out of a 8,500-seat amphitheater in Atlanta called the 'World Dome', sending the sermons to churches all over the country via satellite. The website pledge continued: 'Believe it or not, there are still millions of people on this planet who have never heard of Jesus Christ and know nothing of His greatness.' Arrested: The Reverend was charged in 2012 for allegedly attacking his teenage daughter . 'Our hearts desire to see precious lives changed and snatched out of darkness and thrust into His marvelous light! 'We need your help to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ,"" the appeal continued before asking supporters of the ministry to sow a $300 seed into the airplane fund, billed Project G650.' According to Financial Juneteenth, a Report of the Senate Finance Committee, Minority Staff Review of WCCI, found that Dollar's current jet had also been used for a variety of vacation flights, including stops in Las Vegas, Nevada, Miami, Florida and Hawaii, citing Federal Aviation Administration figures. Dollar has refused over the years to disclose his salary, but has an estimated net worth of $27 million. He has five children to his wife, Taffi, who he married in 1985. In June 2012, his 15-year-old daughter called 911, saying her father repeatedly punched and choked her at their Atlanta home. The teenager also said it wasn't the first time something like that had happened and that she felt threatened living in the house. Dollar was arrested and charged with family brutality and juvenile cruelty. The charges were later dropped, but he was required to complete a three-month anger management program. At his next sermon, two days following the arrest, Dollar spent several minutes addressing the incident, starting with: 'I will say this emphatically: I should have never been arrested.' Dollar has strenuously denied the accusations, saying it was a family argument with 'heightened emotions'. The goal: Dollar wants a $65million Gulfstream G650 business jet, a plane favored by billionaires that bills itself as the fastest plane built in civil aviation . Influential: Dollar is the head of the World Changers Church International, a Christian ministry centered around the prosperity gospel, which preaches that God wants to bless the faithful with earthly riches . Dollar's wife Taffi has been known to introduce her husband at his sermons. During her address, she claims Dollar comes 'face to face with God, like Moses'. She also includes an admonition saying that 'every tongue that rises up against' (Dollar) 'will be struck down', Financial Juneteenth reported. The World Changers Church International (WCCI) has about 30,000 constituents.","In March Atlanta-based Reverend Creflo Dollar launched private jet appeal .

"When Adam Lyons' story was published last week, many were stunned by his polyamorous relationship and how he gets to share his life - and his bed - with two beautiful women. Now his girlfriends Brooke Shedd, 26, and Jane Shalakhova, 25, have spoken out to say they are just as fortunate as the 34-year-old who hails from East London. The women say they do not 'share' Adam but are in a 'unique' situation where they both love him - as well as each other. Scroll down for video . Brooke, right, and Jane appeared on today's This Morning with boyfriend Adam to explain how their polyamorous relationship works and makes them all happy . The trio appeared on today's This Morning to set the record straight about their relationship after it caused a stir when it hit the headlines last week. 'I don't look at it as me sharing Adam, it's me sharing myself with Adam and Jane,' Brooke told intrigued presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. 'It's three people who fell for each other and into this unique situation.' Brooke has a five-year-old son, Oliver, from a previous relationship and has just had another baby, Danté, with Adam. They will raise the boys in Los Angeles with Russian-born Jane, who joined their open relationship after the three of them hit it off so well. The trio explained their open relationship to presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford via a video link from their home in LA . Brooke, from Texas, explained: 'We're weren't looking to add a third person to our relationship when we met Jane, we just enjoyed going out and meeting women. But Jane fell in perfectly and it was serendipitous.' The trio all live together and share a super king-sized bed and Brooke said there's no jealousy between them as they are all in love. Jane agreed that if she ever feels jealousy, it's never over Brooke spending time with Adam but because the pair are having fun without her. She explained: 'When I get jealous, it's me jealous of missing out if I'm at work and not physically with them, it's my two best friends hanging out and I'm not there.' Adam said their relationship works because all parties knew where they stood at the outset. Jane and Brooke say they do not 'share' Adam and are as much in love with each other as they are with him . He said: 'Brooke and I knew when we first met we were open to the possibility of having other women in our relationship. 'It's not that I have two girlfriends, it's that there are three of us in a relationship.' He added: 'I get to hang out with my two best friends every day. We get questioned a lot about whether we're intimate all together. Most of the time it is all three of us. We like to enjoy the benefits of our unique relationship.' Adam revealed his friends and family in the UK are astounded at how he's transformed into a charming lady's man - as at his East London school, he was a 'loser' once voted the least likely to get a girlfriend. The unconventional family are raising two children - Brooke and Adam's newborn, Dante, and Brooke's son Oliver from a previous relationship. Jane is keen to have a baby with Adam in the future too . But he said he gained in confidence after becoming a dating coach and learning techniques to help make himself more attractive. As a result, he says he's not worried if his open relationship leads to Brooke or Jane leaving him for someone else. 'One of the cool things about the journey I have taken is I now have the confidence to meet other women if my partner moves on, so I will move on,' he said. The trio admitted that all their families find their situation bizarre but all are supportive because they know they are so happy and in love. Jane said: 'Imagine you meet your soul mate, now multiply that by two! It's twice the love.' Following the interview Eamonn joked to wife Ruth that perhaps they should consider introducing a woman into their relationship - but she told him it would never happen.","Adam Lyons, 34, from East London, is in a relationship with two women .

"The owners of an Oregon goldmine have called in gun-toting right-wing militiamen amid a bitter land use dispute with the U.S. government. Tensions have remained high at the Sugar Pine Mine near Medford after the facility was served with a federal stop-work order. The owners summoned  armed guards from the conservative Oath Keepers activist network ahead of a major protest outside local offices of the Bureau of Land Management yesterday. Together: Three Oath Keepers are seen armed Wednesday defending the mine . Protests: A Sugar Pine Miner supporter holds a anti-BLM sign at a rally outside the Bureau of Land Management's offices in Medford on Thursday . Ready to go: A member of the Oath Keepers is seen at the Sugar Pine Mine on Wednesday . Co-owner Rick Barclay acted after receiving a stop-work order last month when officials said they found equipment on site indicating operations inconsistent with standard mine development requirements. The miners have since appealed the order and spokesman, Kerby Jackson, confirmed paperwork had been filed to keep officials from 'burning or breaking anything' on the property - but gave no more details. The owners insist they want to avoid a high profile stand-off while BLM officials say they want to resolve the dispute peacefully.

But armed Oath Keeper activists have maintained a constant presence around the mine in recent days. According to the Mail Tribune, miners feared the BLM would destroy some of their cabin and equipment before they could appear in court for the appeal hearing. 'We appreciate and share the mining claimants’ interest in peacefully resolving the matter through the normal regulatory and administrative processes that are in place for such matter,' Bureau of Land Management spokesman Tom Gorey said in a statement, confirming the appeal had been received. Miners and supporters, some flocking from other states, gathered on Thursday at Oregon BLM offices.

Protest: Joseph Rice of the Oath Keepers (R) holds a copy of the U.S. Constitution while speaking alongside Sugar Pine Mine owners George Backes (L) and Rick Barclay (C) At issue is a dispute over mine ownership records, Oregon BLM spokesman Jim Whittington said. The owners argue they have exclusive surface rights and need not follow federal regulations. But Whittington said while the owners have mining rights, the surface rights were ceded to the BLM in 1961 by the then-owners. The miners say they want to avoid a standoff like last year's fight between Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and the federal government in which the BLM sought to seize cattle because Bundy refused to pay grazing fees. Federal agents ultimately backed down. Gear: An Oath Keeper is seen with a vest that reads 'US Patriot' on Wednesday .

The BLM said it had also told employees to avoid the mine because of the armed activists. 'The safety of our employees and the public continues to be our top priority,' Gorey said, urging demonstrators to remain peaceful. Oath Keepers spokeswoman Mary Emerick said more supporters were en route to fill jobs for a long-haul protest, from security to cooking. Cliven Bundy's son, Ammon, said two family representatives had traveled to Oregon, and the family was monitoring the situation.","Owners of Sugar Pine Mine called in armed guards to protect their claim .

"The killer of Daniel Morcombe could get out of prison early due to a email to Queensland's top judge from a child protection worker that a 'smiley face'. Lawyers for Brett Peter Cowan, who was convicted for the murder of 13-year-old schoolboy Daniel Morcombe in 2014, will file an application to have Chief Justice Tim Carmody disqualified from hearing his appeal, citing a potential bias in the case. Cowan received a life sentence for murdering, indecently dealing and dumping the Sunshine Coast teenager's body in 2003. Scroll down for video .

Cowan's barrister, Peter Davis, said Mr Carmody had met with Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnson shared an email, in which she referred to him as 'Tim' and included a smiley face. Mr Davis said Bravehearts' interests were contrary to Cowan's, which created the conflict. 'It's not suggested for a moment that Bravehearts is a dubious organisation, however it's a lobby group and Mr Cowan is someone who has been directly targeted by that very lobby group,' Mr Davis said. Mr Carmody denied he had any sort of relationship with Ms Johnson, and said the meeting was standard practice. 'None of these meetings impede my neutrality or impartial discharge of my judicial function,' he said. 'Ms Johnston and I do not have a relevant, close and continuing relationship that would impact on the impartiality of my decisions or processes.' Director of Public Prosecutions Tony Moynihan said the situation was unprecedented and there should be no ""next step"" until the application is actually filed.

"Currently showing in cinemas, the new documentary Montage of Heck claims to offer the most intimate glimpse yet into the life of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. But one Los Angeles resident can offer fans an even more intense taste of the singer's life, by letting them sleep in his house. Cobain lived in this two bedroom apartment on Spaulding Avenue in L.A.'s Fairfax district during the height of Nirvana-mania. Scroll down for video . The two-bedroom apartment is inside a 1920's building on Spaulding Avenue L.A.'s Fairfax district. A picture taken of Kurt Cobain in the early 90s, sitting on the end of the double bed he shared with Courtney Love. And with a parrot resting on his head, of course. The graffiti, however, has long since disappeared . Now its current owner, Brandon Kleinman, 31, has listed it on Airbnb. He wrote on the page advertising it: 'The place is the perfect combination of comfort, style, location and...rock n' roll history. 'Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love lived in the home during the height of Nirvana's musical influence 91-92 to be specific. 'At the time, Kurt was focused on song writing and his artwork, much of which was created in the apartment. 'He (Cobain) was particularly into painting during this time and even decorated the walls in the living room and bedroom.' 'His favourite spot in the house: the bathtub. In it, he wrote the song 'Heart-Shaped Box.' The couple lived in the apartment in 1991 and 1992, just before Frances Bean Cobain was born . It is described as 'beautiful, decorated and clean' - a far cry from the squalor revealed in photographs taken when Cobain moved out in 1992 . According to Charles R. Cross's 2001 Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven, the singer and his wife rented the unit for $1,100 (£727) a month. During the time they lived there, Love was pregnant with Frances Bean Cobain, while Cobain was focusing on song writing and his artwork, much of which was created in the apartment. Current guests will have to pay a little more to enjoy the central LA location, with Mr Kleinman offering the apartment for $4,5654 (£3,016) a month, or $1,142 (£754) a week (which works out at about $163/£108 per night). Current guests will have to pay a little more to enjoy the central LA location, with Mr Kleinman offering the apartment for £3016 a month, or £108 a night . Up to three guests can stay in one bedroom of the 1,500-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath flat. One of four homes inside a 1920's building, it offers a large living room with seating, a dining area and a small but fully stocked kitchen. It is described as  'beautiful, decorated and clean' - a far cry from the squalor revealed in photographs taken when Cobain moved out in 1992, which showed graffiti on the walls and rubbish scattering every available surface. The rooms where Cobain stayed have undergone a full renovation since he lived there . Cobain moved out when Love was eight months pregnant after a leak in the bathtub damaged the guitars, music and other possessions he stored there. Since then the place has been fully renovated and much of the idol's artwork has been covered up. Mr Kleinman told Vulture magazine: 'There's latex painting over the fireplace' It's owner suspects art painted by Cobain is hidden under layers of paint on the apartment's walls . 'I know there's tons of art painted on the actual mantel of the fireplace. I want to see if there's a way to get under the layered paint, to see what he painted under there.' 'I tried to get to the original hardwood floor in the hallway, but I can't,' he said. 'It's damaged because the bathtub leaked while Kurt and Courtney lived here. That's why they moved out.' The apartment is located in the middle of LA, five minutes from shopping mecca The Grove .","Cobain lived with Courtney Love in the two bedroom apartment on Spaulding Avenue in L.A.'s Fairfax district .
