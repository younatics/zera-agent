"Pep Guardiola hit his critics for six as Bayern Munich trounced Porto to reach the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday night. It was an emphatic statement of intent: the German juggernaught is steaming towards the final in Berlin on June 6. The six goals smashed past the hapless Portuguese pretenders in the quarter-final second leg at the Allianz Arena now takes Bayern's goals total for the season to a spectacular and barely believable 115. And they're not done yet, not by a long way. Bayern still have five Bundesliga matches to play as they march towards a third consecutive title, the German Cup semi-final against Borussia Dortmund on April 28, and potentially three Champions League matches, should they reach the final. If Guardiola's goalscoring machine churns them out at their current rate of 2.61 per game, that would mean an eyewatering total of 141 goals for the season. It isn't Guardiola who should be feeling the pressure - it's the rest of Europe. Here is a breakdown of Bayern's staggering goalscoring so far this season .

"UEFA has published Champions League regulations for next season confirming a seeding change to reward national league winners. Top-seeded teams in eight groups will be the defending Champions League winner plus title holders in the seven highest-ranked countries. On current standings, Arsenal, Atletico Madrid and Porto will drop in status in the August 27 draw. Arsenal, who were knocked out by Monaco this season, could drop down in the pots for the group stages . Chelsea look to be marching towards the Premier League title so would stay in pot 1 . If Real Madrid don't win La Liga or the Champions League they will be in pot 2 next season . If things stay as they are in Europe... Champions League winner . Barcelona . Bayern Munich . Chelsea . Juventus . PSG . Zenit . Benfica . Real Madrid would also drop down if Barcelona wins the Champions League and Spanish league. If the Champions League winner also wins its national title, then the eighth top-seeded team is the Dutch champions. That is PSV Eindhoven, which is only 30th in UEFA's club standings. Currently, top-seeded teams are the eight highest-ranked in a five-year results cycle in UEFA competitions. The new system should elevate league-leading Juventus and Zenit St Petersburg, plus France's champions. Porto are trailing Benfica in Primeira Liga so would also miss out on pot 1 in the Champions League . PSV would benefit if the winners of the Champions League also won their domestic title .","Top-seeded teams in Champions League groups will be title holders .

"Manchester United have begun the search for Michael Carrick's long-term replacement, with Ilkay Gundogan a prime contender to fill the role.

United will seek to sign Carrick's successor this summer as part of another huge spending frenzy. Dortmund's ball-playing midfielder Gundogan has been watched extensively by United. Van Gaal has an intrinsic knowledge of the Bundesliga and believes the 24-year-old has the ability to take over from Carrick on a long-term basis.

"It was one of Barcelona's easier nights in the Champions League as Luis Enrique's team brushed aside Paris Saint-Germain 2-0 at the Nou Camp to reach the semi-finals. The 5-1 aggregate victory never looked in doubt as the Spanish side showed signs of returning to their brilliant best, with a combination of experienced stars and blossoming talent in their ranks. Here Sportsmail looks at the five things we have learned from Barca's crushing victory over PSG. Neymar (left) celebrates opening the scoring for Barcelona along with Dani Alves (centre) and Gerard Pique . Neymar is a blend of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi . He’s just a child, said Juliano Belletti in the week. Some child. Let’s not go overboard; there’s no way of knowing whether Neymar will reach both the level and consistency of Ronaldo or Messi. But his skill-set and talents seem a combination of those two players, which means he has the potential to be very dangerous indeed. Neymar chases for the ball during the win against Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League quarter-final . Neymar has the blend of Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Lionel Messi in his skillset . Neymar has Messi’s close control when dribbling, he has the flair which Cristiano used to display as a badge of pride – and winds up opponents in the same way. Both the Real Madrid and Barcelona legends are lethal finishers and Neymar is getting there, as he showed here. There are still parts of his game which he has to improve; his crossing and final pass sometimes leave a little to be desired. But he is in the right place to hone his skills and barring injury, he will be on the Ballon d’Or podium sooner, rather than later. Luis Enrique has strong chance of matching Pep Guardiola’s treble-winning debut season . Barcelona look like genuine treble contenders. They are in the Copa del Rey final, against Athletic Bilbao. They have a two-point lead in La Liga and only six games remain. And three more victories in the Champions League would see them lift the trophy for the fifth time in their history. There are tough games to come; none of the semi-finalists will be pushovers. But the brutal way they dismantled a PSG side that knocked out Chelsea, the English champions-in-waiting, in the previous round, shows the level they are at right now. Luis Enrique celebrates with his coaching staff after Neymar's opening goal at the Nou Camp . They have gone from winning nothing last year to being on the cusp of emulating Pep Guardiola's treble-winning first season. There's life in the old dog yet . Lot of reasons have been given for why Andres Iniesta hasn't been at his best over the past couple of years. The most recent is that Barcelona's new style of play hasn't allowed him to flourish. He's having to play in a deeper role, to allow Neymar more space on the left, and offer a bit more protection in a side that features three totally attack-minded forwards. Andres Iniesta charges at the PSG defence for Barcelona as the Spaniard played close to his best . But it was from deep that Iniesta started his run, shimmying away from Edinson Cavani, beating two more PSG players for pace and then feeding in Neymar, who scored, killing the tie. Iniesta may still be acclimatising to the new methods at Barcelona and changes to the way he has played the game for the past decade, but his immense talent will find a way to adapt. PSG project needs more investment – as long as it’s sensible investment . Having been knocked out of the Champions League 5-1 on aggregate by Barcelona, it’s easily believable that PSG chief Nasser Al-Khelaifi will ready the big bucks to bring a new world star to the club in the summer. Edinson Cavani stands dejected for PSG during the second leg defeat at the Nou Camp . Cavani goes to ground on the touchline in front of PSG boss Laurent Blanc . That really isn’t what they need. Bringing another big name into the mix won’t be helpful; they need to build a squad. They need to sign players appropriate for positions, rather than trying to crowbar stars into the side. Edinson Cavani is a good example. He was a brilliant centre-forward, right now he’s low on confidence and an ineffective foil for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Sign, by all means, but sign smart. Barcelona's big guns blowing apart the landscape . Perhaps then, it wasn't helpful for PSG to see the potency of Barcelona's attacking trio first hand. It took a bit of sculpting, with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez switching places, but now the terrifying trio up front are flying. Luis Suarez (left) Neymar (centre) and Lionel Messi celebrate a goal against Atletico Madrid in January . They're on course to record the highest goal tally for a Barcelona front-line in the past decade. Back in 2011-12 the Messi, Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez attack managed 101 - including 75 from Messi himself. So far this season Messi, Neymar and Suarez have 95 in all competitions. And if they reach the Champions League final, they have 10 games in which to do it.","Barcelona cruised into UEFA Champions League semi-finals .

"Roy Keane described Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz as 'lost' following his woeful first-half performance against Barcelona on Tuesday night. The £50million former Chelsea man was at fault for both goals as Neymar sent the Ligue 1 side bowing out of the Champions League with little more than a whimper. Keane, known as one of punditry's scariest characters, isn't usually one for holding back when it comes to opinions, but even he had some sympathy for the Brazilian international. PSG defender David Luiz (right) had a torrid time marking Barcelona forward Neymar on Tuesday night . Luiz was at fault for both of Neymar's goals as PSG crashed out of the Champions League quarter-finals . ITV pundit Roy Keane offered his sympathy to Luiz, describing the defender's performance as looking 'lost' 'I actually feel sorry for him,' the 43-year-old told ITV. 'He just looks lost again; we spoke about him before the game. 'He doesn't smell danger and the stuff there is literally schoolboy stuff. 'You've got to give the boy sympathy, a little bit. Because he doesn't look like he knows what he's doing. It was fellow Brazilian international Neymar that stole the headlines as his double sealed Barcelona's progression. Neymar set the tone for the game when he slotted home the opener following some fine work from Andres Iniesta before later heading a second past Salvatore Sirigu. And Luiz was quick to admit that his side got what they deserved across both legs of the fixture. 'They were a better team than us in both games. They controlled both games and they deserved to qualify,' he told ITV. 'We didn't take the opportunities to score in the first match. We didn't play well, but we had seven or eight opportunities. In this game, they were better than us.'

"Property portfolio: Sol Campbell and his wife Fiona . The polls might have the parties neck-and-neck – but it looks like Sol Campbell is taking no chances. For the second time this year, the former England footballer is selling a multi-million pound property – leading to speculation he wants to dodge Labour’s mansion tax if the party wins the election. An outspoken critic of the policy, Campbell has even threatened to leave the country if the tax on properties over £2million comes into force. Earlier this year it was revealed he had taken the apparently bizarre decision to sell a £20million London townhouse to a company owned by himself. Land Registry documents suggest the sale was registered the day after higher stamp duty levies came into effect. But it is possible the sale took place shortly before, meaning the increased charges would have been avoided. Now Campbell has listed a second property for sale in the same exclusive neighbourhood of Chelsea. A former home of James Bond author Ian Fleming, the luxury penthouse by the Thames is on the market for £6.75million. Campbell bought it in 2011 for £4.25million after he reportedly staged a sit-in at an estate agents’ in the hope of securing it for his family – his wife Fiona Barratt-Campbell and their children Isabella and Ethan. It has since been extensively renovated by his wife, an interior designer and granddaughter of Barratt Homes founder Sir Lawrie Barratt. An advert for the property states: ‘There are few properties within Chelsea that can offer the combination of views, spacious accommodation and exquisite finish.’ Yet Campbell, 40, seems to be keen to rid himself of the flat before the election. Eye for detail: The living room inside Campbell's £6.75million Chelsea flat boasts lavish furnishings . Nice touch: The former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur defender's kitchen is filled with marble . Sumptuous: Gilded mirrors line the hall in Campbell's luxurious flat, which is in an exclusive neighbourhood . Last year the former Arsenal and Tottenham defender blasted the proposed mansion tax, describing it as a ‘cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well’. He told The Times: ‘With a mansion tax, you’re taxing me for being prudent ... If Labour gets in, I’d leave. I’d have to say, “Sorry, I want to ship out”.’ Campbell has also said: ‘I’m not earning what I was earning five years ago.’ Experts have said that properties worth between £5million and £10million could incur an annual charge of up to £25,000 under a Labour government. Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property commentator, said: ‘Sellers like Sol Campbell face a financial dilemma: to take a certain hit now or await the potential tax bill that a Labour or Lib Dem Government may generate.’ Since 2009 Campbell has also owned Grade II-listed Hallington Hall, an 18th Century mansion in Northumberland. Fortune: Campbell accumulated a number of properties before and after his football career but has since said 'I don't earn what I used to' Campbell recently featured in a hard-hitting campaign to encourage ethnic minority Britons to vote .","Sol Campbell has put his flat in Chelsea on the market for £6.75million .

"West Ham are confident that the deal to move into the Olympic Stadium does not contravene domestic or European legislation and 'categorically' stated that it does not constitute state aid. The Premier League club are set to move into the London 2012 showpiece venue for the start of 2016-17 season, but the journey there has been a tortuous one, fraught with controversy. Fresh questions were raised about the award of the 99-year lease to West Ham on Tuesday, when it was suggested the deal may contravene European state aid law.

West Ham trio Diafra Sakho, Winston Reid and Mark noble smile for the camera at the Olympic Stadium . The report suggests the failure of London Mayor Boris Johnson and the London Legacy Development Corporation to obtain prior approval from the European Commission before signing the deal opens up the possibility of challenges from anyone who feels disadvantaged. That could leave West Ham facing a large compensation bill, but the club defended their position in a lengthy statement about the Olympic Stadium deal. A West Ham spokesman said: 'West Ham United is confident that its agreement with the LLDC complies with all relevant UK and European legislation and categorically does not constitute state aid. 'Indeed, the European Commission looked into a complaint in relation to our move to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in 2013 but 'decided not to further pursue' the matter. 'The club was selected as anchor concessionaire following a fair, transparent and robust process that was open to any group or organisation in the country.

'The worldwide draw of hosting the most popular and watched football league in the world in such an iconic venue will add value to any sponsorship and commercial agreements related to the Stadium, which the public purse stands to further benefit from.

'It is clear that the linking of the naming rights to West Ham United generates real cash value for the LLDC. 'Without West Ham United, the Stadium would continue to cost the taxpayer millions of pounds a year. 'With us, the public purse will see a return on the hundreds of millions of pounds that were committed to build the Stadium, long before West Ham's association had begun.'

"Pep Guardiola was left purring at Bayern Munich's first-half performance against Porto as the club put a turbulent week behind them to storm in to the Champions League semi-finals. A 3-1 first leg defeat in Portugal last week followed by the dramatic resignation of long-serving club doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt had turned the spotlight on Guardiola heading in to the tie. But the Bayern boss reminded the watching world why he is considered by many to be the best manager in the business as his side raced in to a 5-0 lead before half-time on Tuesday night. Bayern Munich players celebrate in front of their fans after the 6-1 demolition of Porto on Tuesday night . Pep Guardiola looks animated as he issues instructions from the touchline at the Allianz Arena . 'It's easy to love my players now,' said Guardiola. 'I am the coach of extraordinary players. I didn't expect such a first half.' Typical of the man though, Guardiola found faults in Bayern's second half performance as Porto pulled back to 5-1 before Xabi Alonso added a late sixth. 'We can still play better,' he added. 'We lost the ball here and there and we can improve on that. We had a few problems in the second half. 'They had only a few chances but you should never relax in the Champions League.' Guardiola talks to captain Philipp Lahm (third right) as Mario Gotze (far left), Thiago and Thomas Muller listen in . It is believed that Muller-Wohlfahrt and his team resigned as they felt they were blamed for the first-leg defeat, though neither the doctor, the club or Guardiola have said as much in public.

"Alexis Sanchez is developing a fondness for Wembley Stadium. Two goals for Chile against England were followed by two goals in the FA Cup semi-final against Reading. It is a stage that suits him and Arsenal will expect even more when they return for the FA Cup final next month. ‘Let us hope he keeps that up and scores twice in the final,’ said Santi Cazorla. ‘We are happy for him. He is a key player for us, in a good moment.’ Alexis Sanchez celebrates as his goals take Arsenal into the 2015 FA Cup Final . The Gunners forward wheels away after opening the scoring in the 2-1 defeat of Reading on Saturday . Sanchez slides to his knees as he keeps his impressive scoring record at Wembley going . After an explosive start to his first season in England, including a burst of 14 goals in 18 games, Sanchez has emerged from a more subdued mid-season with three strikes in his last three matches. The extra-time winner on Saturday, however, owed almost everything to a dreadful goalkeeping error by Adam Federici. Sanchez is shortlisted for the PFA Player of the Year with Chelsea’s Eden Hazard the hot favourite, but it may be the most impressive debut campaign from an overseas signing since Gianfranco Zola. Like Zola, who arrived at Chelsea in 1996-97, Sanchez can end his first season with an FA Cup win and Arsene Wenger will stress the marginal gains if Arsenal can claim second in the Barclays Premier League for the first time in a decade. The Chile international struck his second goal to save Arsenal in extra-time . Arsenal team-mates congratulate Sanchez as they head into a second successive FA Cup Final . Sanchez's second goal owed a lot to a mistake by Reading keeper Adam Federici . If so, the Chilean signed for £32million from Barcelona last summer has been largely responsible. He has been fabulous to watch, loyal to the traditions of Wenger’s flamboyant attacking style with bottomless reserves of energy and a contagious desire. He has 22 goals and there are signs of a good chemistry developing with Mesut Ozil since the German’s return from injury in January. They combined for the first at Wembley. Wenger has admitted for weeks that he would like to give Sanchez a breather but his influence has been so vital — and the race for Champions League places so tight — that the manager has found it difficult. And Sanchez just keeps going. His season started with 45 minutes in the FA Community Shield, his Arsenal debut, on August 10 and will stretch through to the Copa America in his home country. The 26-year-old also scored a brace at Wembley in Chile's 2-0 defeat of England in November 2013 . Sanchez celebrates his second goal against England before his move to the Premier League from Barcelona . He has played eight internationals since the World Cup, starting in seven, with six of them on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. ‘Of course, we are all tired and so is he,’ said Cazorla. ‘He has the Copa America, too, but he just wants to play all of the time. Now, we have to rest and finish the season with the objectives we had at the start.’ Sunday will be a test of Arsenal’s progress. Can they stall Chelsea’s title charge? Has Wenger made enough improvements to halt his terrible run of results against Jose Mourinho teams? ‘We have to show we are now on a consistent level and it is a good opportunity to do that next Sunday,’ said Wenger. ‘Let’s finish this season well. We have six games, a big game next weekend and I believe we have the spirit, which is encouraged by the results. ‘We have learned from our hiccups. We have matured a little bit. When we had a difficult moment against Reading the team kept going. We don’t feel sorry for ourselves. We just keep to our plan.’ Per Mertesacker was forced off with an ankle problem but most of Wenger’s injury worries are clearing. ‘The Cup final is better than any doctor,’ quipped the Arsenal boss. Arsene Wenger's side host league leaders Chelsea at the Emirates in their next match . Jack Wilshere (centre) was among the substitutes on Saturday as he continues his recovery . Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker was forced off the Wembley pitch with an ankle injury . Jack Wilshere was back in the squad, an unused substitute at Wembley after five months out, and Mathieu Debuchy played for the first time since dislocating his shoulder in January. In contrast to Sanchez, it has been a miserable first season at Arsenal for Debuchy, with operations on an ankle and a shoulder each ruling him out for three months. But the France defender is back and his next task will be a duel with Hazard. ‘I am so happy, it is so important to be back on the pitch with the team,’ said Debuchy. ‘It was hard for me after the second surgery but I am strong in my head. I need to work hard. I am not 100 per cent but I need to be ready.’","Arsenal defeated Reading 2-1 after extra-time to reach the FA Cup final .

"Adam Federici will put his Wembley blunder behind him when Reading take on Birmingham in the Sky Bet Championship, according to manager Steve Clarke. The Australian goalkeeper let a tame Alexis Sanchez shot slip through his grasp in the sixth minute of extra-time as the Royals were narrowly beaten 2-1 by Arsenal in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final. It was a cruel blow for Federici, who had kept the Gunners at bay with a string of fine saves, but Reading boss  Clarke is confident the 30-year-old will bounce back. Adam Federici fails to Alexis Sanchez's shot from crossing the line at Wembley on Saturday evening . The Reading goalkeeper struggles to contain his emotions after his side's FA Cup semi-final defeat . 'It's the life of a goalkeeper,' Clarke told Reading Player. 'Adam was obviously very upset because he feels responsible for the defeat. 'It's much better in a game like that, that if you have to lose you lose to a moment of brilliance. That wasn't the case. 'As I said after the game, we win together, we lose together. Adam is a strong character. All the players are 100 per cent behind him, the staff are 100 per cent behind him - he'll bounce back . 'On Wednesday night when we play Birmingham, he'll be typical Adam Federici - one of our best players.' Federici will come up against an in-form striker in the shape of Clayton Donaldson. The 31-year-old former Brentford frontman is among the favourites to be named Blues' player of the year after hitting 15 goals this season, and manager Gary Rowett admits he is 'almost undroppable'. Reading boss Steve Clarke has backed Federici to bounce back against Birmingham in the Championship . 'He's been brilliant,' Rowett told the club website. 'He's got a little bit of everything. He's decent in the air, he's got very good pace, he holds the ball up well for others, he's got a little bit of physicality and he scores goals. 'I think he's been as good as any striker in this division and I think we're very lucky to have him. I think he's the reason why we've got some very good players like Lee Novak, Wes Thomas and Nikola Zigic, who have not played very much.

"Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola weathered his first major crisis at the German club after his team crushed Porto 7-4 on aggregate on Tuesday to move into the Champions League last four. The Spaniard in his second season in charge was with his back to the wall after their surprise 3-1 first leg defeat in Portugal last week. Never had one of his teams lost before the semi-finals in the competition but that prospect suddenly seemed real. Bayern Munich celebrate in front of their delighted fans after overturning a first leg deficit to reach semi-finals . Thiago Alcantara jumps highest to head the home side in front on 14 minutes and set the Bayern on their way . Damned to succeed, Guardiola repeatedly said he was aware of what he needed to deliver at the five-time European champions for who a league and German Cup double was just not enough. He arrived at Bayern after their 2013 treble-winning season and expectations have not been lowered since. A semi-final exit last season only heightened pressure on Guardiola to deliver another treble this time round. But plagued by injuries in recent months and a rare internal strife after long-time team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt quit after 38 years, saying his medical team was blamed for the loss to Porto, Bayern had a far-from-perfect preparation. The doctor is hugely respected by Bayern players with many saying they would continue taking his advice and Guardiola suddenly in the firing line for allegedly falling out with a Bayern icon. Pep Guardiola said after the game that winning is a matter of life and death at Bayern . Robert Lewandowski made it three on 27 minutes as the Poland striker powerfully nodded the ball into the net . Failure to advance against Porto would have added to an already difficult week and would no doubt fan speculation about the coach's future in Munich despite having a contract to 2016. With Premier League clubs circling, a slip-up on Tuesday could prove decisive for both the club and the coach. But the Spaniard, who won 14 titles in his four seasons at Barcelona, thrived under adverse conditions with his team playing arguably their best game this season, even without injured Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba. Bayern frontman is congratulated by Mario Gotze (left), defender Rafinha (centre) and Thomas Muller . 'I felt it in the last few days that we would advance,' Guardiola said after Bayern fired five goals in 26 first-half minutes. 'This is about life or death and I know how very important it was,' he said. 'I know what is expected of me in this team. It is about winning just like at Barcelona.' Fans are now dreaming of a trophy on German soil in June's final in Berlin and with players gradually returning from injury, Guardiola is confident Bayern will further improve. 'We can play even better,' he said in what is no doubt a warning to other title contenders. 'After the loss in Porto the players were my heroes. Now it's easy to love them.'","Bayern Munich beat Porto 6-1 in the Champions League quarter-final .

"Andres Iniesta has responded to his critics by claiming he 'never went away' following a vintage first-half performance in Barcelona's 2-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday night. The Spaniard had failed to register a single assist or goal from 19 La Liga appearances this season, prompting critics to suggest the 30-year-old was on the decline. But Iniesta capped an impressive 45 minutes in his side's Champions League quarter-final second-leg victory over PSG with a mesmeric run and pass for Neymar to score his first goal of the evening at the Camp Nou.

We know that our presence in the semi-finals is important, though, and it's great that we made it that far.' Barcelona's No 8 goes to celebrate with Neymar after killing off the French side in the opening half . Neymar added his second of the night to make it 30 goals for the season as Barcelona cruised past PSG . Iniesta's ability to adapt his game may yet add years to his already glittering career at the Camp Nou . Iniesta has been forced to play a deeper role this season to accommodate the triple threat of Neymar, Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi. And it was from his deep-lying central position that the diminutive midfielder started his slalom through the heart of Laurent Blanc's side just shy of the quarter-hour mark, before laying the ball on a plate for Neymar to score his 29th goal of the season. Iniesta was replaced by Xavi at half-time, as Barcelona went on to complete a 5-1 aggregate victory that puts them in the draw for the Champions League semi-finals for the seventh time in eight years.","Midfielder fires a warning to his detractors that he is now back to his best .

"Crucible thoroughbreds John Higgins and Graeme Dott led the Scottish charge on Sunday at the Betfred World Championship. Four-time winner Higgins impressed with a 10-5 first-round victory over Robert Milkins, and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the title four years ago. The 39-year-old fired breaks of 77, 75, 69 and a clinching 106 in the second session as he coasted home against Gloucester potter Milkins, who took the match beyond its evening interval but was thoroughly outplayed. John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships . Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form. 'He's playing really good stuff. I think I did well to get five frames.' Dott, unseeded this year but a proven Crucible class act and champion in 2006, was a 10-8 winner earlier as he ousted Ricky Walden. Higgins has sprung back to competitive form level this year, notably in taking the Welsh Open title in February to end a two-and-a-half-year major trophy drought. He had openly expressed fears his days as a winner were over, but Higgins is daring to dream of a fifth world title. He said: 'I'm feeling relief and pride to beat Robert because he's a dangerous player. I knew I'd lost my last four matches to him. 'I thought I hit the ball well. I missed a few but I felt good in amongst them.' Asked directly whether he was a potential champion, Higgins initially said: 'Nah. There's more and more contenders out there. I probably know what it takes to win it but there's more favoured players than me.' But the desire is there, and unmistakably he does have one eye on the trophy. Higgins added: 'It would be amazing if I could win it and go level with somebody like Ronnie O'Sullivan on five titles. That would be beyond my wildest dreams. The fire is still there. 'I've had a few sleepless nights thinking I'd never get back into the winners' circle. Luckily it happened at the Welsh Open and that's given me a bit of a boost. 'You doubt yourself definitely, especially in dark times, but now hopefully there's some good times. 'Just to win this again would be incredible. Ronnie has probably outstripped me, winning more tournaments and making more century breaks, and he's obviously chasing Stephen Hendry's records. 'But there's perhaps Hendry, Ronnie and (Steve) Davis before me winning most. If it's just those three ahead of me I can't complain. It's not a bad three to have in front of you.'

"Barry Hawkins kept his nerve to clinch a final frame decider over Matthew Selt in the first round of the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield. The 2013 finalist looked set to ease through to the last 16 after resuming on Monday with a 7-2 overnight lead which he extended to 9-4 to move within one frame of victory. But Selt responded by reeling off five frames in a row - including back-to-back centuries - before a cool clearance from Hawkins saw him into the second round with a 10-9 win. Barry Hawkins celebrates after qualifying for the second round of the World Snooker Championship . Hawkins kept his composure to win 10-9 after Matthew Selt's impressive comeback at the Crucible . Selt won five frames in a row to launch a comeback, however he was unable to progress to the second round . Hawkins said: 'I can't keep putting myself through that. There's nothing worse than when someone is coming back at you like that and you can see your lead disappearing. 'You're telling yourself it's only one frame but you can see him growing in confidence and potting long balls so it is a horrible place to be.' Hawkins, who will play either Mark Allen or Ryan Day in the second round, is no stranger to Crucible drama having fended off a famous comeback from Dominic Dale in last year's quarter-finals. And the 35-year-old from Kent believes his close call against Selt will help give him the impetus he needs after a largely frustrating season by his own standards. Hawkins added: 'It's not been the best season but it's partly my own fault because I had a bad attitude in the middle of the season and I wasn't enjoying it. 'I've played a lot of snooker over the last couple of years and I think I just got fed up with it and my attitude stunk, I suppose. 'But there's nothing like getting kicked up the backside a few times and getting beaten to get the motivation back.' Former champion Neil Robertson wasted no time wrapping up victory over Jamie Jones to move into the last 16. Resuming like Hawkins with a 7-2 overnight advantage, Robertson did things the easy way with an opening break of 133 setting him up to reel off the three frames required for a 10-2 win. World number 10 Stuart Bingham trails Robbie Williams of the Wirral 5-4 after the opening session of their first-round match.","Barry Hawkins qualified for next round with 10-9 win over Matthew Selt .

"The man widely considered the leading referee in the world will be in charge of the richest fight of all time. Kenny Bayless has the honour of being the third man in the ring with Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao on May 2. The appointment will be welcomed by both camps. Referee Kenny Bayless (left) holds back Floyd Mayweather during his fight against Marcos Maidana . Bayless breaks up the tension between Mayweather (right) and Maidana during their bout in September 2014 . Manny Pacquiao conducts a training session after his morning jog in Los Angeles on Tuesday . Pacquiao is watched by a group of fans who gather to see their man in action ahead of the super-fight . Bob Arum, Pacquiao's promoter, says: 'Bayless is the best out there.' Bayless, a veteran of countless big fights in Las Vegas, will celebrate his 65th birthday two days after supervising the Fight of the Century in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. The Nevada State Athletic Commission, acutely aware that the officiating has to be of the highest order, given that the fight is likely to attract an audience well beyond those who usually watch boxing, have wisely put their trust in the large physical presence and unflappable personality of Bayless. Recent controversial results have put the Commission under pressure to bring in officials from outside Nevada for the mega-fights here and have made one concession in that regard. Glenn Feldman, a much respected judge from Connecticut, will be among the three wise men scoring a fight which most expect to go the 12-round distance. The two other judges are Las Vegas resident Dave Moretti and Burt Clements, from Reno. Serious consideration was given to including a judge from overseas and John Keane, a British Boxing Board Class A-star official from Wellingingborough, Northampton was thought to be the favourite. Bayless has refereed previous super fights involving Mayweather and Pacqiao. Recently, he was in charge of Mayweather's difficult physical battle against Marcos Maidana and Pacquiao's spectacular knock-out by Juan Manuel Marquez. He will receive $25,000 (£16,600) for the night's work in May, while the judges will each receive $20,000 (£13,300). It is still peanuts compared with the $180 million and $120 million which are the respective minimums expected to earned by Mayweather and Pacquiao but the officials are being paid somewhat more than expected.

"EVERYONE’S A WINNER . Good news for all the struggling low-paid pros who made it to the Masters. The green jackets took pity on them by announcing a 10 per cent increase in prizemoney for this year’s tournament. The winner’s share of the $10million pot worked out at £1.23m in our currency. Anyone who made the cut was guaranteed £17,000. Jordan Spieth collected £1.23million for winning the Masters - as well as the coveted green jacket . POULTER’S PURPLE PATCH . Ian Poulter improved on his previous best Masters finish by shooting a second straight 67 for a share of sixth. Wearing a loud purple number, Poulter reflected on a missed chance. ‘The way I’ve played at the weekend was a highlight,’ he said. ‘It was about the missed shots on Thursday and Friday. I left myself too much work to do.’ Ian Poulter was dressed all in purple on Sunday for his final round at Augusta . NO STONE UNTURNED .

McIlroy duly deliverd with a wonderful 66 with Tiger carding a 73. Imagine what it would cost if they were paired together in the final group? Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy were paired together for the final round at Augusta on Sunday . PHIL’S THE MAN IN BLACK . Phil Mickelson opted for an all-black outfit  on day four in an unusual bid to try and improve his performance. ‘I like to wear dark colors on Sunday,’ he said. ‘I’ve won three times wearing a black shirt so I’ll wear a black shirt. It helps me get more aggressive. Studies have shown that when NFL teams wear black they have more penalties.’ Phil Mickelson was dressed all in black on Sunday as he tried to win the Masters for a fourth time . DANNY DISAPPOINTED . When you hole a 64-foot putt on your first round at Augusta, a little disappointment is understandable if you can’t maintain those standards. England’s Danny Willett hit three rounds of 71 but his third of 76 proved his undoing. ‘It’s a bit disappointing,’ he said. ‘My ball-striking is good but I couldn’t take advantage.’ England's Danny Willett hit three rounds of 71 at the Masters but was let down by one of 76 .","Ian Poulter dressed all in purple for the final round at Augusta .

"Veteran referee Kenny Bayless has been named as the third man in the ring when Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacuiao meet in the match being billed as the biggest and richest in boxing history. Bayless will need little introduction to either fighter, having previously worked five of Mayweather's bouts and seven of Pacquiao's. In fact, he oversaw the former's professional debut against Roberto Apodaca in 1996. The 64-year-old is widely considered to be one of the best referees in the world and will pocket $25,000 for the night's work on May 2 while judges Dave Moretti, Glenn Feldman and Burt Clements will each receive $20,000. Not everyone is praising the appointment though, and Oscar De La Hoya, one of Mayweather's past opponents in a match overseen by Bayless, has suggested that the choice of official will serve as a clear advantage for the American over Pacquiao.

'I think it favours Mayweather, absolutely,' De La Hoya told Yahoo Sports, 'There is no secret about that.

He went on to explain, 'If you notice every fight Mayweather has had with Kenny Bayless (as referee), the ref should break them up if both hands are tied up and they're not throwing punches. 'If you notice, for instance with (Marcos) Maidana, when they got in close, right away Kenny Bayless would break them up. 'One hand would be free from the clinch, but he still broke them up. It's an advantage for Mayweather.' De La Hoya was defeated by Mayweather in 2007 on a split decision after 12 rounds, losing the WBC light middleweight title.

"Andy Murray tied the knot with Kim Sears on Saturday at Dunblane Cathedral, as thousands of fans waited outside to greet the couple. The tennis star, who announced his engagement in November last year, tied the knot in the 12th century cathedral before a relatively small group of their family members and close friends. Reverend Colin Renwick, led the service, was pictured outside the cathedral just after 3.00pm this afternoon with the wedding taking place at around 4.00pm. Andy Murray and his wife Kim are all smiles after tying the knot at Dunblane Cathedral . Kim shows her delight after marrying British tennis star Murray on Saturday afternoon . The happy couple are covered in confetti as they make their way out of the wedding ceremony . Murray waves to his fans after making his way out of the cathedral following his wedding . Hundreds of well-wishers gathered on the streets around the cathedral and one of the biggest cheer so far has been reserved for Judy Murray, who arrived just before 4.00pm looking resplendent in a white, to-the-knee overcoat with a detailed gold dress.The outfit was topped off with a dramatic gold hat. This morning, the historic cathedral saw florists toting huge bouquets of flowers arrive to decorate the church - as hailstones and showers battered the venue. Clearly unable to contain his excitement this morning, tennis ace Murray posted a tweet to his 2.98 million followers which shows his plans for the day - through the use of emojis. He tweeted an umbrella, a picture of a church, a ring, a kiss, cake, drinks including beer, cocktails and wine and ends with hearts, a face blowing a kiss and several Zzzz icons for sleep. Murray (left) and his brother Jamie Murray (second left) arrive for his wedding to Kim Sears . Murray waves to the crowd as he arrives for the wedding as does his mother Judy in Dunblane . Kim Sears arrives for her wedding to British tennis number one Andy at Dunblane Cathedral . Andy tweeted his plans for the day through the use of emojis and it would appear he's counting on plenty of laughter, kissing and alcohol . People continue to gather outside Dunblane Cathedral just hours before the wedding is due to start at 4.30pm . The forecast for the rest of the day isn't on the couple's side although there looks like being some respite from the rain between 3pm and 4pm as guests are expected to arrive. The heavens are likely to open again around 5pm. Andy's mother Judy discussed the bad weather on social media, initially tweeting: 'Hailstones. Marvellous,' and then a few hours later: 'Snowing. White wedding.' Fans who have set up camp outside the church have found themselves battling the elements this morning as they were battered by wind, rain and sleet in short succession. Ross Hutchins (left) was a guest at the ceremony, as was former British No 1 Tim Henman and his wife . However the wet weather showed no sign of dampening the spirits of the crowds outside the cathedral. Brenda Watson travelled from Ochiltree in Ayrshire with her friend to join in the celebrations. She said: 'We forgot our hats but we're hoping the sun will shine for Andy and Kim. We're so excited about seeing them and the atmosphere is great, it's been well worth coming.' Her friend Anne Gemmell from Stair in Ayrshire said Kim's dress might be 'something lacy and just chic.' No doubt the couple will both be hoping the weather improves before the ceremony later on today - or the guests could get soaked. Murray and his brother walk into the church as they begin preparations for his wedding to Kim Sears . Hundreds of the world's media are also in place to capture the event which has sparked interest around the globe. Murray took a moment out of his wedding preparations to chat on Twitter this morning about a pre-wedding snooker game last night. Tennis player Jamie Delgado tweeted: 'Pre-wedding snooker ended in another victory for guess who? Andy Murray, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado,' to which Murray replied: 'Jamie Delgado, Rosco Hutchins, Johnny Delgado, last night was actual carnage for those boys I couldn't believe it.' The reception is being held at the 15-bedroom Cromlix House Hotel, located just outside the town, which Andy bought two years ago for £1.9 million. Fans cheer as the British tennis number one Andy Murray arrives his wedding to fiance Kim Sears . Florists have been spotted working all morning to decorate the cathedral, wheeling in huge bouquets of white hydrangeas and full-sized cherry blossom trees. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers and have been together for more than nine years. The proud Perthshire community has spent the last few days decorating the high street with bunting in preparation for the celebration which will be reported around the globe. Murray fans have been posting their best wishes on social media and Scotland's First Minister has also offered her congratulations. Hibernian FC tweeted: 'Best wishes from everybody at #Hibs to our supporter @andy_murray on his wedding day; have a great time! First dance to Sunshine on Leith?' Murray said recently he will have three best men - his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier. Sussex-born Sears, also 27, will have four bridesmaids but the style and design of her bridal gown has so far remained a secret. Several names from the world of tennis are likely to be on the guest list, with former British number one Tim Henman among those tipped to appear. Reports suggest Murray and Ms Sears had originally planned to marry at a chapel within the grounds of Cromlix House, which Murray purchased two years ago, but later opted for the 300-seat cathedral. The couple met in 2005 through tennis circles - her father Nigel is a coach and former head of women's tennis at the Lawn Tennis Association. They moved in together in 2008 and briefly split the following year before rekindling their relationship. Speculation about their engagement was fuelled by Murray who, responding to a fan's question on Twitter last year, joked that he would marry Ms Sears after Wimbledon. He was forced to point out that he was not serious but announced his engagement for real in November. Andy Murray's No 1 fans: Linda Reid-Nevitt, 62, and Amy Moffat, 15, from West Calder, wait outside of the cathedral ahead of the wedding . Murray told BBC Sport last month: 'I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. 'So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. 'I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way.' Yesterday the pair were spotted looking happy and relaxed as they arrived at the cathedral for their wedding rehearsal. Bride-to-be Kim, 27, wore skinny black jeans, a leather jacket and blue scarf as the final preparations were made for their big day. Hundreds of locals are expected to gather outside the cathedral to catch a glimpse of the pair who met as teenagers . Andy is a hero in his native town and the residents have pulled out all the stops to wish the happy couple well . Graham Fleming puts up bunting in Dunblane's high street as shops  decorate their fronts in support of local boy Andy . Perhaps saving her legs for walking in heels tomorrow, she today stayed casual in red flats.

With an Olympic gold medal and Wimbledon title under his belt, Andy is a hero in his native town and the residents have pulled out all the stops to wish the happy couple well. The minister set to conduct the wedding ceremony said the whole town is excited as the event is 'the nearest we'll have in recent times to a royal wedding'. Reverend Colin Renwick said he expects Britain's top tennis star and his fiancee, Kim Sears, will be as 'nervous and as excited as any couple getting married'. The minister, who has been tight-lipped in recent weeks, said he was 'excited' to be part of the service, as final touches were added to the venue.

"Glenn Roeder has made a surprise return to football as part of a new management team at Sheffield Wednesday. Roeder and former Hull City chairman Adam Pearson are joining head coach Stuart Gray in a three-man task force charged with returning the Owls to the Premier League. The off-field team has been put in place by Dejphon Chansiri, the Thai tycoon who recently bought the club from Milan Mandaric. Glenn Roeder is now part of a new managerial committee team at Championship side Sheffield Wednesday . Chansiri said they would form a recruitment committee as part of full-time roles starting immediately. Pledging support for Gray, who has stabilised the club since taking over a relegation threatened team last season, Chansiri said: 'The head coach will have the final say.' Chansiri added: 'We will spend whatever is necessary to meet our ambition of promotion to the Premier League by 2017.' Roeder is vastly experienced while Pearson led Hull's first climb to the top flight. 'Sheffield Wednesday is steeped in history and the Premier League is where it should be,' said tex Watford, West Ham and Newcastle boss Roeder who has also taken charge of the England B team.

"If Bayern Munich manage to overturn the 3-1 Champions League quarter-final first leg scoreline handed to them by Porto last week, Xabi Alonso will have his eyes on a very special record. Should Pep Guardiola's side go all the way and claim this season's title as European champions, Alonso will become only the second player to win European football's top trophy with three clubs having held it during his time at Liverpool and Real Madrid. The only other player to have done so is AC Milan legend Clarence Seedorf, who lifted the famous piece of silverware for Ajax, Real Madrid and Milan. Xabi Alonso could become only the second player to win the Champions League with three different teams . Alonso in action during Bayern Munich's 3-1 Champions League quarter-final defeat against Porto last week . It is quite an achievement, and one that the Spanish maestro recently admitted to thinking about. 'There is one player who has won three Champions Leagues with three different clubs: [Clarence] Seedorf. Of course it is in my mind. The end of my career is near,' Alonso told The Telegraph. 'I don't have many years left but it is one of the targets. It is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the Champions League is special,' he added. Alonso won the Champions League in his first season at Liverpool when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005. And last season he was part of Carlo Ancelotti's side to take the title, even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to sit in the stands for the final win over Atletico Madrid. Alonso celebrates winning Europe's top club prize in his first season with Liverpool in 2005 .

At 33 and with a club as strong as Bayern on a two-year deal under Pep Guardiola, Alonso could even attempt to match Seedorf's total achievement. Thiago Motta could also equal Seedorf's record if he manages to earn a Champions League medal with Paris Saint-Germain, but the 32-year-old midfielder has his work cut-out as the Ligue 1 side trail to a 3-1 aggregate scoreline against Barcelona. Names to have retired with two Champions League medals while at two different teams include the likes of Deco with Porto (2004) and Barcelona (2006) and former Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar who had been part of the 1995 Ajax squad before holding the trophy once again with the Red Devils.

"Just ten games. That is all Tim Sherwood has needed to bring Aston Villa out from the morgue and into life. Rigor mortis was setting in when he took over the club, but now the muscles are being flexed. An FA Cup final awaits. There have been mistakes, notably in defeats to Stoke City and Swansea, but five glorious wins and a brand of football to excite and embolden far outweighs them. Having been appointed on Valentine’s Day, Villa fans have fallen in love after only nine weeks. Here, Sportsmail looks at five reasons for Sherwood’s success. Tim Sherwood has had an inspired start in charge of Aston Villa as they reached the FA Cup final . Benteke's back . Upon arrival, Sherwood recognised the area he needed to target instantly: goals. Hardly rocket science but launching Villa’s scoring figures skywards was easier said than done. Straightaway as manager he had a sit down in his office with Christian Benteke where he told the Belgian striker: ‘Two years ago, every club in Europe wanted you.’ The point being to re-inject confidence in this quiet character. Benteke is determined but responds well to arm-round-shoulder words. At the end of his reign, Paul Lambert tried stick to inspire Benteke’s best, dropping him for the visit of Chelsea. Benteke understood, but was nevertheless frustrated. He felt starved of service in Lambert’s safety-first style. Christian Benteke has flourished under Sherwood and has scored nine in his last seven for Villa . Sherwood addressed this immediately. During half-time in the FA Cup match against Leicester – the day before his unveiling – he entered the dressing room and told his players to get the ball to Benteke more often, and quicker. Villa scored two second half goals to progress. Benteke has now got nine in his last seven for Villa, having scored three in 18 under Lambert this season. There is variety, pace, and creativity in the final third and Villa have already surpassed under Sherwood the total goals managed with Lambert at the helm this season: 16 goals in 10 games, compared to 15 in 28. The Belgian international fires home the equaliser at Wembley as he helped Villa conquer Liverpool . Trust in youth . For around an hour after carrying out media duties on Friday, Sherwood stood to watch Villa’s Under-11s squad as they trained at Bodymoor Heath. The man for whom youth development is so important was able to find time on the eve of his biggest managerial test to observe a crop of potential talents who will only be senior players many years down the line. That kind of commitment breeds belief across the training pitches. His faith in Jack Grealish is the biggest illustration of his philosophy, but he also handed Rushian Hepburn-Murphy his debut as a substitute at Aston Villa aged 16. Since Sherwood’s arrival, the under-21s have been moved to train on pitches adjacent to the first-team and a number regularly join in with sessions when 11 v 11, Kevin Toner and Lewis Kinsella among them. Jack Grealish was the star man against Brendan Rodgers' side and has earned rave reviews under Sherwood . Sherwood attended the City Ground last Wednesday to witness 22-year-old Gary Gardner, on loan at Nottingham Forest from Villa, score a brilliant free-kick. The night previous he was at Rochdale v Swindon to possibly run the rule over Massimo Luongo, also 22, his under-21 captain when at Tottenham. Such an approach is with eyes on building the club over the coming months and years but short-term it has served to bring renewed energy. The former Tottenham boss is keen on youth development and watched on-loan Gary Gardner score . Delph delivering . Fabian Delph signed his new contract at Villa before Sherwood arrived – it was actually announced on the big screens at Villa Park ahead of the FA Cup clash with Bournemouth – but the 25-year-old has since been handed key responsibilities. The England midfielder, described as Villa’s Hoover by Sherwood, was given the captain’s armband permanently, taking over from Ron Vlaar and leapfrogging deputy Gabby Agbonlahor, based on his mentality and exuberant grit in midfield. He has led by example, turning in performances that make him a certainty for Roy Hodgson. Fabian Delph is arguably Villa's most important player and he's become a real leader under new management . Sherwood has asked for more forward movement too, and offensive involvement. Delph’s ability to drive past players – exhibited for both goals at Wembley – was compared to Paul Gascoigne by Sherwood and the Bradford-born player has responded to that acclaim. He has two goals under Sherwood after not finding the net once this season for Lambert. ‘When I came to the club Fabian Delph had just signed a new contract, he had an opportunity to go to some of the teams in the top four. He showed a lot of loyalty,’ says Sherwood. ‘I need characters like that, put themselves on the line. He can add goals to his game, he has so much energy he can get into the final third and score. He’s nicked a couple for me already. I just want to encourage him to do that and then he’ll be too expensive for anyone to buy.’ The England international scored the winner at Wembley to send his side into the FA Cup Final in May . Sound staff moves . Sherwood acted swiftly in the backroom department too, bringing in Mark Robson as first-team coach, and Seamus Brady as performance analyst before his first official game in charge. He knows these guys from working at Tottenham and values their input. Tony Parks, former goalkeeping coach at Spurs, arrived in the days after the loss to Stoke, curtailing a move to Norwich to join up with a manager he respects greatly. Parks is a trusted friend and vocal presence on the touchline, the one who bear-hugged Sherwood from behind, lifting him off his feet, when Benteke rolled in the stoppage time penalty to beat West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League. As assistant Sherwood made a smart move, offering Kevin McDonald the chance to renew his Villa relationship. The 54-year-old was the club’s hugely successful reserve team boss and has developed younger players during a 17-year association that ended during the early days of Lambert's reign in June 2012. He was also caretaker manager after Martin O’Neill left and nearly got the job permanently. ‘I wanted someone who knew the fabric of the club,’ says Sherwood. Tony Parks (left centre) was one of many new staff members brought in to help save Villa from relegation . Stiliyan Petrov has also been into the dressing room to offer words of advice, although he is yet to formalise any coaching arrangement. Training is sharp and intense, largely tailored to replicate matchdays and goal-scoring situations. Inspiring confidence . Sherwood said after the victory over Liverpool that the players believed they would win and the fans did too, suggesting many had already booked their hotels for the final on May 30. It is clear confidence is coursing through this Villa team now, the shackles not being so much thrown off as plunged to the bottom of the ocean to collect rust. The 46-year-old has added a new found confidence to his sides game and is reaping the benefits . Sherwood divides opinion with his outspoken comments but from within the club such positivity has spread to form a confident collective unit. 'He sits and he chats to people. He treats people like men,’ says Parks. ‘The guys have responded to that – sitting them down, treating them with respect, letting them know when they’re playing well, letting them know when they’re not playing so well. ‘I look around, he’s the manager and I believe what he tells me. I think the players believe what he tells them as well. He’s a good leader.'","Tim Sherwood has had an instant impact since taking over at Aston Villa .

"Sam Allardyce has revealed the reason behind his furious rant at fourth official Robert Madley towards the end of West Ham’s defeat at Manchester City on Sunday. The Hammers boss was incensed that Eliaquim Mangala was not penalised for a foul against Stewart Downing, who managed to stay on his feet despite a late challenge from City’s £32million defender. Referee Anthony Taylor took no action as the ball ran out of play and an animated Allardyce vented his fury towards Madley on the touchline.

Allardyce snarls in frustration alongside Manuel Pellegrini from the touchline at the Etihad . The Upton Park boss launched a tirade at the fourth official before eventually sharing a smile with him . Allardyce cannot resist taking an extended pop at Madley from the sidelines . It was highlighted on Match of the Day but the 60-year-old later questioned whether Downing had paid the price for his honesty instead of taking a fall and earning his team a freekick. ‘Everybody goes on about simulation and players cheating and doing this and that,’ said Allardyce. ‘Mangala comes out and tries to clean out Stewart Downing. ‘Downing stays on his feet and the assistant is one yard off and doesn’t flag for the foul. So what do I say to Stewart Downing? “For God’s sake dive on the floor and get a freekick?” Because we could put the freekick in and get a goal.’ Allardyce was unhappy with Downing for giving away possession in the build-up to City’s second goal scored by Sergio Aguero, having already conceded an own-goal from James Collins. Allardyce was aggrieved because a foul by Eliaquim Mangala on Stewart Downing (not pictured) was missed . Sergio Aguero finished off a fine move to hand the Champions a 2-0 win to get their season back on track . He added: ‘The disappointing thing in the first half was the goals we gifted to City and the amount of possession we allowed ourselves to lose. ‘The two mistakes we make for the goals, one was pretty bizarre and the other unexpected from a player as experienced as Stewart Downing. ‘In the second half eventually changing the system got us going forward, and when we create as good chances as those for Enner Valencia and Kevin Nolan we have to convert them. But the most disappointing thing was the goals we gifted City.’","Manchester City defeated West Ham 2-0 in the Premier League on Sunday .

"West Ham are determined to ensure their season does not end with a whimper, according to defender Carl Jenkinson. The Hammers' once promising campaign has tailed off, with a run of just one win in 11 Barclays Premier League games seeing the club slip from Champions League contention to mid-table. Their latest disappointing result came at Manchester City on Sunday as they went down to an insipid 2-0 defeat. Carl Jenkinson holds off the challenge from Jesus Navas during West Ham's 2-0 defeat by Manchester City . West Ham defender Jenkinson challenges Aleksandar Kolorov during the clash at the Etihad on Sunday . With Europe now not realistic and relegation not an issue, the Hammers would now seem to have little to play for but Jenkinson insists the remaining five games are not meaningless. The 23-year-old, who has enjoyed a successful season-long loan from Arsenal and could make the switch permanently, said: 'People in our dressing room are fired up. If you came in the changing room after the game you'd see that. 'People aren't resting on their laurels, people ain't happy finishing mid-table. We want to kick on. We have got something to prove now because we have been on a bad run of games and we want to put that right. We owe that to ourselves and the fans.' West Ham were never in the game at the Etihad Stadium, losing after a bizarre own goal from James Collins and a swift counter-attack strike from Sergio Aguero before half-time. James Collins scored a comical own goal to give Manchester City the lead on Sunday . Enner Valencia and Kevin Nolan did have late chances after City lost momentum following injury to David Silva but they were generally lacklustre throughout the contest. Jenkinson felt the visitors paid the price for their mistakes but does not feel the team are much doing much differently from the early part of the season. He said: 'I wouldn't want to blame it on luck but a few things haven't gone our way lately and we have conceded some late goals. 'I think this was a different story - we made a couple of mistakes and got punished. Sergio Aguero doubled the lead for the champions as they ran out comfortable winners . 'Of course we have got to work on our performances but if you look at the last 10 games, our performances haven't been bad at all. 'We have had some really good performances but teams have scored late goals against us and we have ended up getting a point instead of three. It has been a bit frustrating. 'I just think early on in the season we were finishing everything. Everything we got was going in the back of net and at important times of the game. 'We have gone ahead in recent games but never killed the games off and have ended up conceding cheaply towards the end of the game. Of course that is a real kick in the teeth. 'It is not nice blaming things on luck - you make your own luck - but that has been the story of our last couple of months.'","West Ham were beaten 2-0 by Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday .

"Txiki Begiristain was on the 10.30am Lufthansa flight out of Manchester for Munich on Tuesday morning. It’s the week of the Champions League quarter-finals, therefore the Manchester City director of football would have expected to be on the move. This week, however, just like last year, Begiristain is on the outside looking in. City succumbed meekly to Barcelona last month leaving him to plan his schedule only as a voyeur. The thought of Begiristain and his favourite coach, Pep Guardiola, in the same stadium as Bayern Munich attempt to turn over a 3-1 first leg deficit to Porto certainly provides some appropriate imagery. Guardiola is the man Begiristain would like to install at City in the summer of 2016. Manchester City are keen for Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola to become their new manager in 2016 . Guardiola cut a frustrated figure as he watched his  side lose 3-1 at Porto in the Champions League last week . Guardiola (right) speaks with midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger during Bayern's training session on Monday . The 44-year-old will come under more scrutiny if Bayern fail to overturn their quarter-final deficit on Tuesday . Despite winning the Premier League last season, City boss Manuel Pellegrini has come under-fire this term . City director of football Txiki Begiristain (left) and Guardiola enjoyed a successful relationship at Barcelona . These, however, are peculiar times for both men. Guardiola is facing his first Champions League exit prior to the semi-final stages of his coaching career and at the hands of relatively inconsequential opposition too. Begiristain, meanwhile, has a decision to make, along with the members of the City hierarchy, about their current manager Manuel Pellegrini. Certainly, Guardiola’s position is interesting. The Champions League – a competition he won twice in four seasons at Barcelona – is central to his identity. He has only ever lost ten matches in six seasons as a coach. Nevertheless, last season’s 5-0 aggregate dismantling at the hands of Real Madrid in the last four raised eyebrows in Bavaria. Bayern were the defending champions when he took over, after all. Now he faces even greater ignominy unless his injury-hit team can produce something special on Tuesday night, this in a week that has seen the club’s distinguished doctor Hans Muller Wohlfahrt walk out in protest at Guardiola’s methods and attitude. Such scrutiny, such criticism is relatively new to Guardiola, who is still only 44. Last week Bayern chief executive Karl Heinz Rummenigge refused to criticise Guardiola’s team. Previously, however, he had been scathing in his assessment of the Brazilian defender Dante, a player who performed horribly in Portugal last week and who Guardiola recommended for a new contract just last summer. None of this is helpful to a coach when he is trying to navigate the closing stages of a season that always asks big questions of teams and squad stretched by injuries and fatigue. In some ways, though, it may play in to City’s hands. Guardiola is facing his first Champions League exit prior to the semi-final stages of his coaching career . Last season’s 5-0 aggregate dismantling at the hands of Real Madrid is still raw in the minds of Bayern . Bayern  doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt (centre) quit last week after a reported rift with Guardiola . Dante, Sebastian Rode, Lahm and Robert Lewandowski (L-R) trudge off the pitch after defeat in Porto . Guardiola – whose team are expected to clinch another Bundesliga title this weekend and are in the final of the German Cup – has only a year left on his contract at Bayern. It is, frankly, difficult to see him extending his stay. He wants to manage in the Barclays Premier League and though he has a fondness for London, the appeal of working with Begiristain and City chief executive Ferran Soriano after their successful time together at Barcelona is clear and understandable. Can City really afford to wait for him, though? With their own squad in need of radical work after the disappointments of this season’s dismal Barclays Premier League title defence, can they really ask Pellegrini to enter the final year of his own deal at the Etihad Stadium as a sitting duck coach? History tells us that managers who know they are leaving do not generally perform well in England. Sir Alex Ferguson attributed Manchester United’s disappointing 2001-02 season to his own publicly declared intention to retire – subsequently reversed – while this year West Ham’s form has fallen off a cliff after the club’s decision to not to renew Sam Allardyce’s contract this summer became clear. If City have real intentions to make up ground lost to Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea next season then they will need a playing squad driven and motivated fully. It is hard to see that happening if they are still playing for a man who cannot influence their careers beyond the month of May 2016. Guardiola only has a year left to run on his current contact at the Allianz Arena after this season . The ex-Barcelona boss is on course to win another Bundesliga title  and Bayern are in the  German Cup final . Having enjoyed success in first Spain, and now Germany, Guardiola's next destination is set to be England . City know all this, of course, but their options are limited. Patrick Vieira’s name has been mentioned as a short-term option. The club’s current academy head wants to manage and would like it to be at City, where is highly regarded by those who matter. Why, though, would City expect their first team players to work for an interim coach any more than they would a man, Pellegrini, who has, after all, won a Premier League and League Cup during his time in Manchester? It is, sadly, a conundrum, without a clear solution. A rather old school course of action would be for Begiristain to knock on Rummenigge’s door on Tuesday evening and offer Bayern an awful lot of money to buy out Guardiola from his contract at the end of this season. If Bayern go out of the Champions League on Tuesday, it may not cost City as much as they think. In football, timing is everything. Maybe it’s time for City to be brave.

"Fifteen-times grand slam champion Martina Hingis made a courageously impressive return to big-time singles tennis in the Fed Cup on Saturday but was eventually outplayed by Agnieszka Radwanska. Hingis was persuaded to play her first tour-level singles for nearly eight years because of injuries in the Switzerland team for the World Group playoff encounter against Poland. The 34-year-old brought back memories of her heyday in a thrilling 48-minute first set before capitulating 6-4 6-0 to world number nine Radwanska after 76 enjoyable minutes.

Smiling a lot and clearly enjoying the experience of being back in the spotlight against a player with a similarly attractive style, Hingis played some exhilarating tennis early on but her effort eventually took its toll. Half a step slower in the second set, she could only win 11 points as Radwanska upped her game to give Poland a 1-0 lead in the tie. What was most eye-catching was the way Hingis fought in the opening set, twice coming back from a break down to level the scores until the pressure exerted by Radwanska finally told. Hingis, who only plays doubles on tour those days, was making a Fed Cup return for the first time since the 1998 final because she has to play in the competition to qualify for next year's Olympics.

"Bayern Munich have joined Manchester United and Liverpool in the race to sign Memphis Depay. The PSV Eindhoven star's talents have been compared to those of a young Cristiano Ronaldo by Ronald de Boer, who also claims United could have the edge over Liverpool in a battle for the Holland forward. The 21-year-old Dutch international has played a starring role in PSV's Eredivisie title success this season. He is the subject of offers from Liverpool and Paris St Germain while United have also made contact. Liverpool are making a rival push for Manchester United target Memphis Depay . Liverpool hope to convince 21-year-old Depay that he would get more regular football with them . De Boer has been impressed and suggested he could follow in the footsteps of one of Old Trafford's former greats and become one of the world's best players. '(Depay) is one of the biggest talents in Europe,' said De Boer on talkSPORT. 'He has skill compared to a young Cristiano Ronaldo. He is very lively, technically unbelievable, very skilful, very fast, he has a great goalscoring record, he can shoot from every distance - he has everything. 'For me, he is without doubt one of the best talents we have.' De Boer, the former Ajax, Barcelona and Holland midfielder who is now assistant manager of Ajax's youth team, believes the presence of Louis van Gaal as manager could give United an advantage. Depay played under Van Gaal during the latter's spell as national team boss. 'I don't want to say which club is more suitable for him, but if he goes to United he knows there is a Dutch coach there who knows him from the World Cup,' said De Boer. 'That is an advantage.' PSV Eindhoven won their first Eredivisie title in seven years after beating Heerenveen 4-1 on Saturday . Depay (right) celebrates the Dutch giants' success with manager Phillip Cocu after the match . Pep Guardiola and his staff are planning for the long-term with wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery growing older and picking up more injuries. Bayern are keen on Wolfsburg's Kevin de Bruyne too and Real Madrid's Gareth Bale. The latter wants to stay in Spain but De Bruyne, a firm target for Manchester City, could be sold at around £40m while PSV want £20m for Depay. Liverpool hope to convince Depay that he would get more regular football with them but their qualification for the Champions League could be crucial to the 23-goal winger choosing them over United. PSV value Depay at £25million and rejected a £14million bid from Tottenham for him last summer. PSV Eindhoven general manager Toon Gerbrands said: 'We have given an indication of the price for Depay, which is probably more than €25m. Therefore we can have no quibbles with Depay's management [over the price]. Gerbrands added: 'Depay must first reach an agreement with a club and if that club are willing to pay the transfer fee then he can leave quickly.' Early years and PSV Eindhoven . Born in 1994, Depay started out at hometown club VV Moordrecht - a Dutch amateur side in south Holland - at the age of six before joining Sparta Rotterdam three years later. The son of a Ghanaian father and Dutch mother, Depay moved to PSV at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in September 2011 having impressed during a trial. Depay signed his first professional contract in June 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the Dutch giants. Playing style . Pacy, with neat close control, Depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire Eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign. Adding more goals to his game this season, the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot. Often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside, Depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents. However, still at a young age and learning the game, the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long. Talent to one day match Arjen Robben... and already better than a young Cristiano Ronaldo? While Depay has been tipped to become as good as Dutch star Arjen Robben by PSV manager Phillip Cocu, one man believes the Holland youngster could one day rival Cristiano Ronaldo. Ed van Steijn, the man who scouted Ronaldo for Manchester United, believes Depay is better than the Real Madrid star was at the same age. Speaking to Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, Van Steijn said: 'If I compare him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time, then Depay has more strings to his bow. I like him better. 'Ronaldo did the same things wrong at Manchester United as he did when he was 17.' Meanwhile, former Holland midfielder Cocu said of Depay: 'Whether he can be as good as Arjen Robben? I think so. 'They are different players, but they are both fast and have a good shot. And both always have the urge to learn. 'But Memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn.' Depay's PSV team-mate Stijn Schaars is also a fan and told Helden Online: 'He's doing everything to reach the top. 'He has a body of a true athlete, power and flair. I'm not afraid of him losing his head. His drive is huge. I like him a lot.' International star and World Cup goalscorer . Depay was handed his first Oranje call-up by Louis van Gaal in 2013 and was selected for Holland's World Cup squad a year later. The energetic frontman scored the winning goal in Holland's 3-2 victory over Australia, before coming off the bench to net against Chile and help Van Gaal's men seal top spot in Group B. Having impressed in Brazil, Depay was nominated for the tournament's 'Best Young Player' award but lost out to France midfielder Paul Pogba.

"The relationship between the FA and Premier League — never great at the best of times — has deteriorated further with the ridiculous clash of fixtures on Saturday. Both organisations blame each other for their respective rights holders, Sky and the BBC, scheduling the marquee Chelsea vs Manchester United league match against the FA Cup semi-final between Reading and Arsenal. The Cup game attracted a peak audience of 6.9 million, over treble the 2m rating for the PL game on Sky. But both viewing figures would have been higher had they not coincided. Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final victory over Reading on Saturday clashed with a top Premier League fixture . With star quality including Wayne Rooney and Eden Hazard on show, Manchester United's visit to Chelsea took viewers away from the game at Wembley, bringing the Premier League and FA into another dispute . The FA say that the dates of the semi-final were known at the start of the season, while the Premier League point to the Sky fixtures for the weekend having been set last February — a month before the BBC announced their semi-final schedule. To add to the muddle — with the TV armchair fan the big loser — the Premier League purposely chose to broadcast fixtures involving top-four clubs on semi-final days. They do this because the FA Cup takes precedence and the league postponement means Sky often then have the bonus of a blockbuster live televised midweek game close to the end of the season that could have a bearing on the title race. But Chelsea and Manchester United both being knocked out of the Cup prevented that happening this season. Hazard celebrates the only goal of the game in the Premier League showdown, but viewers missed out . Luke Shaw, who has had weight problems since joining Manchester United, enjoyed one of his better games against Chelsea in a season when he rates his own performances as C minus. Coincidentally, hard-line United boss Louis van Gaal has banned his players from stopping at the permanent fast food van on the road leading to United’s Carrington training base. The van has been a favourite pit stop for United stars, including David Beckham, down the years. But having no choice but to lay off their tempting bacon sarnies could be the making of Shaw, it seems. Luke Shaw was in impressive form at Stamford Bridge, and he might owe his form to a change in diet . Joe Root's football-style celebration of his two wickets in the first Test added some impetus to England’s bowling team, with Root looking more like the next Test captain with every game. But not everyone was impressed, including former Crystal Palace manager Alan Smith, who is following England in the Caribbean and who tweeted his disapproval, adding that he was ‘old school’. But Smith is canny enough that when he sold his cricket agency Arundel, he kept hold of the wealth management business that still looks after a good proportion of the England side. Joe Root celebrates the wicket of Darren Bravo, but his exuberance has been criticised by Alan Smith . Kevin Pietersen is the elephant in the room, even at England’s sleepy Sugar Ridge Hotel on the day after the first Test. Alastair Cook could be seen in a long conversation with Test Match Special’s Jonathan Agnew. It transpired this was a clear-the-air chat between the sensitive pair after Cook was upset with Agnew for being so positive about Pietersen’s World Cup stint with the programme. Quite why this should annoy Cook is hard to understand. Alastair Cook seems unable to get past the continuing rumours about an England return for Kevin Pietersen . Pietersen has expressed a desire to play Test cricket again, and is trying to prove himself at Surrey . Clarke back for more . You might think the ECB’s preposterous president, Giles Clarke, would be keeping his head down after making such a fool of himself at the 2015 Wisden launch by haranguing guest speaker Ehsan Mani and almanack editor Lawrence Booth. Instead he wants ‘Sale’, as he addresses your Sports Agenda columnist in an email, to make clear that he missed the Test in Antigua not because of anything to do with his doomed five-year deal for T20 matches on the island with serial fraudster Allen Stanford, but because he was attending ICC board meetings in Dubai. Giles Clarke attends an ICC Board meeting in Dubai, which was his reason for not being at the Test in Antigua . Ironically, Clarke’s replacement as ECB representative in Antigua was Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove, who loathes Clarke. One thing has remained reassuringly constant during all the turbulence of England cricket abroad over the last 16 years — veteran team operations manager Phil Neale always has the best suntan. However, colleagues point out how hard former Worcester captain Neale works when he’s not sunning himself around the pool.","Football Association and Premier League fall out over clash .

"So the farewell tour will fizzle out rather than end with a bang. Steven Gerrard hoped his Liverpool career would end at Wembley but now the curtain will fall in Stoke. The dream was for Gerrard to end his 25-year association with Liverpool by lifting the FA Cup on his 35th birthday before starting his new adventure with LA Galaxy yet now the prospect is nothing like so glamorous. Losing to Aston Villa in Sunday’s semi-final will take time to get over. ‘We didn’t play, we looked very nervous,’ said Gerrard on talkSPORT. ‘We’re a team built on passing and playing it quickly but we were very disappointing in that aspect.

"There was a mild tremor felt in the room when Louis van Gaal banged a fist on the table to reinforce his point after Manchester United had lost 1-0 at Stamford Bridge. The eruption follows next season. Van Gaal revealed that he had 11 disappointed faces looking up at him in the dressing room, with the sunken eyes of United's players pleading with him to explain how they had come to be beaten. They dominated possession, completing nearly three times as many successful passes than the champions-elect and yet they were unzipped by a goal in the 38th minute from Eden Hazard. Life can be cruel. Despite United's defeat there were signs on Saturday, what with the slick passing and their range of movement, that the battle lines have been drawn ahead of a proper title race next season. Van Gaal's team are coming for Chelsea and this is what English football needs. United will be a serious challenger. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (left) jostles for possession with Manchester United's Juan Mata on Saturday . Manchester United midfielder Ander Hererra is sent hurtling to the ground following a challenge on Saturday . There is a growing sense, based on this performance, that Mourinho and Van Gaal will be locked in full combat mode when the fixture list for the 2015-16 season is released in June. This is undoubtedly Chelsea's year, starting off with the Capital One Cup in February and moving on to become the effective team in the Barclays Premier League. They are ten points ahead of Arsenal with six to play. Should Chelsea go on to win at the Emirates next Sunday and grab another three points at Leicester the following Wednesday they will be crowned deserved champions. This used to be United territory. In the summer they will spend more serious money again, fully intent on assembling a powerful squad to threaten Chelsea, a re-energised Manchester City and possibly even Arsenal over a 38 game season. There is work to be done, mainly through the middle, and Van Gaal will prioritise central defenders (Mats Hummels and/or Marquinos), an attacking midfielder (Paul Pogba) and another winger (Memphis Depay) in the summer. For now he can reflect on a promising performance, particularly with Ander Herrera dictating the tempo of the game so impressively in his posting just in front of the back four. He really looks a player. When Michael Carrick returns to United's team from injury, his partnership with Herrera will continue to flourish in the centre of that midfield. Luke Shaw, who has missed United's previous four games in the Premier League, returned at left-back because of an injury to Daley Blind. He looked solid, if short of fitness. United are considering an approach for Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba (centre) in the next transfer window . The Red Devils are also keeping tabs on Borussia Dortmund's highly-rated defender Mats Hummels (right) United still need to address a problem in attack, where Falcao is patently short of confidence and lacking the sharpness that one elevated him into the elite category of strikers with Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco. He will not be staying. Van Gaal's methods and his regime, brutal as it is at times, is clearly having a positive effect on the majority of this squad. The captain Wayne Rooney, playing in a deep-lying midfield position just in front of Herrera because of the injuries to key players, spoke of 'dominating the football match'. United's on-loan striker Radamel Falcao has struggled for form ever since joining the club last summer . United captain Wayne Rooney is deployed in an uncomfortable midfield role at Chelsea on Saturday . Luke Shaw (right) returns to the Manchester United first-team against Chelsea but looks to lack match fitness . Hazard shoots to score the opening goal against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . The Belgian forward slides on his knees in front of delighted Chelsea fans after giving his side the lead . Crucially Chelsea won it, but there was an obvious undertone to this fixture as Van Gaal's team snapped at Matic in the centre of midfield and made life uncomfortable for the creator Cesc Fabregas. 'In terms of the way we moved the Chelsea players about, making them work, it was excellent,' added Rooney. 'Over the last few months it has all started to click and the players understand what the manager wants. That's showing in the performances. 'I've rarely seen a team come to Stamford Bridge and dominate so much. All that was missing was the goal.' The target is topple Chelsea, to re-emerge as a genuince force in the English game after being left behind by City and Chelsea in the last two title races. It is true that Mourinho negated the threat of Marouane Fellaini, one of United' s goalscorers at Old Trafford during their convincing 4-2 victory over Manchester City the previous weekend. Chelsea's Kurt Zouma puts in a solid performance in midfield to stifle the threat of United's Marouane Fellaini . There was an element of doubt whether he would even be playing when his lookalike brother Mansour arrived at Chelsea's team hotel on Saturday morning to collect some match tickets from Eden Hazard, who is Fellaini's Belgium team-mate. 'I had to Google him,' explained Mourinho after a bum steer from the doorman. In any event, Chelsea's manager had a plan to keep the United midfielder quiet, and by and large it worked. 'Zouma played to stop Fellaini playing in the box,' added Mourinho.' He is doing amazing jobs for us. 'Mentally he is very strong. Not just physically, but mentally. He has learned a lot from a tactical point of view. He is 20 years old, so we can imagine Chelsea will have him for 10 years.' This was an important victory for Chelsea, extending Mourinho's undefeated run to 11 games against teams in the top four since his return to English football. 'Louis is my friend, but we had them in our pockets,' claimed Chelsea's manager. Next season, though, promises to be very different.

"Jose Mourinho claims Eden Hazard has joined Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as one of the best three players in world football.

With my experience, I succeed to manage the strong and weak moments in a game better. 'Last year I played a good season, but I disappeared in some games. 'This season I can't really remind a game where I really wasn't into. It's impossible to be top in 40 or 50 games in a season, but I've been the best player of the team for several times. 'My stats? People are talking more about me, but what pleases me the most, is that I'm doing better than last season.'

"Michael Conlan was on the verge of pulling out of his must-win bout in the World Series of Boxing before opting to fight and claiming a dramatic win to book his place at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games alongside team-mate Paddy Barnes. Both Belfast boxers (bronze medallists at London 2012), were in action for the Italia Thunder franchise in Venezuela on Saturday night, with the pair needing victories to book flights to Rio. Barnes delivered in style, extending his undefeated WSB record this season to 7-0 with a split-decision points win over native light-flyweight Yoel Finol. Michael Conlan has booked his Olympic place after results went his way in Venezuela on Saturday night . The two-time Olympic medallist dropped his opponent in the first round en route to claiming a 49-45 victory on two of the judges’ cards while the remaining judge questionably scored the fight 48-47 in Finol’s favour. The spilt-decision win was enough to help Barnes top the 49kg WSB rankings, with the Ardoyne native leapfrogging Uzbekistan’s Hasanboy Dusmatov to claim the only Olympic qualification spot on offer through the competition. Conlan’s mission was a far more complex affair, however. Not only did the Falls Road fighter need to win — which he did, earning a 49-46 unanimous points win over Venezuelan opponent José Vicente Azocar — but he also had to rely on a shock result elsewhere. The 23-year-old leapt to No 2 in the WSB bantamweight rankings, claiming the second 56kg Olympic spot on offer thanks to his win and the fact that Azerbaijan’s Magomed Gurbanov lost to Luis Mora Hector Garcia in Puerto Rico. Garcia had Gurbanov down in the fifth and final round of their bout as the Puerto Rican became a cult hero for Irish boxing, akin to Scottish footballer Gary Mackay who booked a place at Euro ’88 for Jack Charlton’s Ireland side thanks to a goal against Bulgaria. The domino effect left Conlan in shock. The Belfast bantamweight was close to pulling out in frustration at his qualification limbo, and had all but made up his mind to turn professional in the near future before a dramatic U-turn. Conlan’s brother, Jamie, himself a promising professional boxer, was just one of the confidantes who contacted him to convince him to fight. Coaches Billy Walsh and John Conlan (Michael’s father) also played key roles in helping the boxer into the ring, continuing their sterling efforts throughout the competition. Both Conlan and Barnes won bronze at London 2012, and will now represent Ireland again in Rio . ‘It hasn’t sunk it yet. I couldn’t believe it. I wasn’t really up for it [the fight] at all because I didn’t think the Azeri would lose,’ said Conlan, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail. ‘I was thinking about pulling out [on Friday]. If I had’ve pulled out I would have been shattered now, lucky enough I didn’t. ‘If I hadn’t have qualified, I would have turned professional. I couldn’t be bothered going to [qualify through] the European Games after going through all of this. ‘When I got out of the ring, Paddy ran over and jumped on me and shouted, “you’ve qualified” and I said “you’re lying to me, stop lying to me!” I nearly felt like crying, I just couldn’t believe it.’ Conlan dedicated the result and his achievements to his girlfriend, Shauna and four-week old daughter, Luisne. ‘I really wanted to qualify to have time with her and my kid. I’ve been looking forward to doing the night feeds and all! The main reason I’ve done this is for her, I’m just so happy it all paid off.’ Barnes, meanwhile, has created history by becoming the first Irish boxer ever to qualify for three Olympics. The 28-year-old had battled his fear of flying throughout his WSB mission, with Barnes and Conlan travelling over 34,000 miles over the course of seven WSB bouts. The ex-European champion now plans on taking an extended break until later in the year after an exhausting campaign which ended in glory. ‘I’m over the moon, can’t get any better. I won’t even care about the flight because I know I’ve done it now — I won’t be flying around the place any more anyway!’ he said. Barnes, in quite colourful language, also told Sportsmail that both he and Conlan had to overcome upset stomachs to compete. Despite that, the pair’s glory run continues unabated.","Michael Conlan and Paddy Barnes both win to reach Rio 2016 games .

"Out there in the desert, the mirage continues to shimmer for Amir Khan. The identity of the challenge becomes blurred in the haze. First it looks like Floyd Mayweather. Now he glimpses Manny Pacquiao. And in which oasis in the sand might he finally touch gloves with one of the two best boxers on earth? The initial lure has been Mayweather in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now the siren call is Pacquiao in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. For two years Khan has been so close to fighting Mayweather that he could smell the resin and hear the roar of the crowd. Yet each time he reaches out, the tantalising illusion fades and slips away like so many fantasies along the Vegas Strip. Now the image of Pacquiao dances before him and there is reason to believe that a tale which might have been told by Scheherazade could become reality one starlit Arabian night. After waiting and waiting for Floyd Mayweather, Amir Khan could be set to face Manny Pacquiao . A fight with Pacquiao, preparing to face Floyd Mayweather on May 2, is on the cards for Abu Dhabi . The handsome young prince of British boxing will pay a flying visit to Vegas on May 2, there to watch the PacMan and the Money Man dispute the richest fight of all time. Win or lose, Pacquiao could await Khan come winter. Sportsmail's Jeff Powell with Amir Khan . Bob Arum, the PacMan’s vintage promoter, has to hand a treasure trove of an offer for a fight in Abu Dhabi this November or December. Khan, the stand-by for Pacquiao had Mayweather refused the Fight of the Century, is Arum’s first choice for that extravaganza in the Middle East. Once Pacquiao’s sparring partner, now Khan says: ‘I want this fight. I would love to box Manny. We’ve been looking at an event in Dubai and Abu Dhabi is only a short drive away. It’s a dream of mine to fight in that part of the world.’ As a hero of the Muslim world, Khan would be a huge attraction there. He now has initials which are the Pakistan equivalent of a CBE behind his name. His father and mother have just returned from Islamabad where, on their son’s behalf, they received from President Mamnoon Hussain the PAPID - the President’ s Award for Pride In Performance. Arum is aware of that box office potential but also recognises the boxing qualities of the ‘nice young man’ from Bolton: ‘Amir has great speed. Maybe the only guy as fast as Manny. And his recent performances have been impressive. This would be an outstanding fight.’ Assuming that Khan wins his interim bout with Chris Algieri in New York next month, all that would appear to stand between him and his long-awaited mega-fight is the outside chance of a re-match between Pacquiao and Mayweather. Promoter Bob Arum (left), with Pacquiao and Roach after the 2009 win over Miguel Cotto, rates Khan highly . Floyd Jnr seems to have no great appetite for a second edition of May 2nd, even though a return bout might bank the man who nicknames himself Money another couple of hundred million dollars. Either way, Mayweather will conclude his enriching six-fight contract with the Showtime cable network in America in September. That timing rules out Khan as his opponent - yet again after two broken promises - because his strict observance of Ramadan would not end in time for him to prepare fully. But if it’s not a re-match and Mayweather finds another opponent, Pacquiao-Khan is a natural for both of them. Pacquiao prefers an early winter date for his second fight of a year and Khan says: ‘Late November or December is perfect for me.’ Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that if Mayweather beats Pacquiao he will want to risk his cherished unbeaten record for a second time against the most dangerous of all his opponents. Floyd Mayweather will end his six-fight deal with Showtime in September, which won't work for Khan . Pacquiao works out with trainer Freddie Roach at their base at Wild Card Boxing in Los Angeles . And Khan suspects that will be the upshot in Vegas: ‘I actually think that once Mayweather gets through Manny’s assault in the first few rounds it will become an easy win for him. ‘Manny has speed and power but Floyd has the defensive skill to avoid him and the brain and accuracy to keep picking him off as he comes in. ‘The longer it goes the harder it will get for Manny and if he is to win he will have to keep up the pace through every minute of every round.’ Khan has affection as well as respect for his old spar-mate, so it puts him in a curious position to realise that defeat for his pal would benefit himself. Khan believes Pacquiao will struggle more with Mayweather the longer their mega-fight goes on . So he says: ‘I’ll just watch it with a professional eye. And there is a chance that if Floyd’s legs really are slowing down that Manny will catch up with him - and he can punch.’ By way of further irony, Khan has been working lately to add to his high-speed aggression exactly the kind of patience he would need if he ever did fight Mayweather. Hidden away in a unit in a business park in Oakland, across the Bay from San Francisco, is the gym in which trainer Virgil Hunter hones the talents of Khan and his long-time protege Andre Ward, who will shortly make his own comeback from a long lay-off. Khan has to first overcome Chris Algieri (left), who was decked six time by Pacquiao, on May 29 in New York . But as his higher education continues under Hunter, he is buckling down. Partly in the knowledge, at 28, that these are his prime years and they must not be squandered. He says: ‘I’ve wasted the best part of a couple of years waiting for Floyd because I would love to be the man who beat the man considered the best pound-for-pound in the world. Now I have to make the most of every day because soon it may be too late. ‘Floyd and Manny are getting closer to retirement and if I don’t fight one of them soon it may never happen.’ That is one of the reasons why Khan puts on hold a Battle of Britain with Kell Brook, preferring to focus on selling himself in America and thereby stay at the front of the queue for a shot at Pacquiao or Mayweather. Kell Brook (left) is fighting Frankie Gavin (right) in the 02 Arena and Khan says he has to wait to face him . Does his May 29 fight with Algieri - recently floored six times by Pacquiao in Macao - help that crusade? ‘Algieri’s a better fighter than Frankie Gavin (Brook’s world title challenger next month). He’s world lightweight champion and he’s fought at a far higher level than Frankie. Kell can wait.’ Khan says: ‘Being at ringside (on May 2) will be a bit frustrating but I accept that this is the fight the whole world has been waiting to see. So no. I won’t be feeling any resentment.’ It is not much more than a half-hour’s flight from Oakland to Vegas. Amir Khan is hoping that the next time he takes to the air it will be on a magic carpet — to Arabia.","Amir Khan could be set to face Manny Pacquiao in Abu Dhabi, UAE .

"Juventus monitoring Raheem Sterling's situation at Liverpool. Interest from the Italian champions elect will come as little surprise as they look to strengthen further this summer, however, Liverpool still intend to hold onto their England international winger.

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League. 1. Frank Lampard’s role at Manchester City was always planned as being just a bit part player – but maybe the 36-year-old should have started more games. The 2-0 win over West Ham was his 38th appearance of the season but only the eighth time Manuel Pellegrini included him in the first eleven. Of those matches City have won seven – including the 3-2 over Bayern Munich – drawn one and not lost any, scoring 22 goals with just six conceded. Mind you, Lampard was always going to do well against The Hammers. In the last ten years he’s played 15 against his old club whose fans love to hate him, won 13 and drawn twice. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini should have given Frank Lampard (left) more game time . 2. In an era when yellow cards get dished out to defenders like confetti, Phil Jagielka is five games away from going a complete season without getting a single booking on club duty. The 32-year-old did get his name taken during England’s 3-1 win over Slovenia in November, but the 1-0 win over Burnley was his 46th appearance in all competitions for Everton without getting into trouble despite being in the thick of the action, making 16 clearances. Jagielka is the only central defender in the Premier League not to have been shown at least one card. Phil Jagielka (left) is five games away from going a complete season without getting a single booking . 3. Tom Cleverley has found a steely edge since Tim Sherwood took charge at Aston Villa. While Fabian Delph and Jack Grealish were the creative stars in midfield in the 2-1 FA Cup semi-final victory over Liverpool, it was the former England ace who created the platform for them. Cleverley, still on loan from Manchester United and out of contract in the summer, made seven tackles – two more than Liverpool’s midfield put together. Tom Cleverley has found a steely edge since Tim Sherwood took charge at Aston Villa . 4. Marc Albrighton is emerging as a key weapon for Leicester in their fight for survival after spending most of the season as a barely used sub. The winger, who moved from Aston Villa on a free transfer last summer in search of regular football, has instead had to go until the last two games before boss Nigel Pearson has given him 90 minutes on the pitch. It’s been worth the wait. At West Brom last week he set up one of the goals in the 3-2 win, and he made four chances in the 2-0 victory over Swansea. Marc Albrighton looks to get past Nelson Oliviera during Leicester's 2-0 Premier League win on Swansea . 5. Tony Pulis always insists there is no additional incentive when he’s facing former clubs, but he still finds something extra in his teams against them. The 2-0 win for West Brom at Crystal Palace made it three wins out of three in reunion games without a goal conceded. Pulis got a 1-0 win when he was Palace boss against Stoke last season, the same score by which he beat Stoke again as West Brom boss this year before then going to Selhurst Park to end Alan Pardew’s run of four wins in a row. Tony Pulis shouts instructions to his players during West Brom's 2-0 victory against Crystal Palace . 6. At 37 years old Didier Drogba may not be the force he once was, but the Chelsea centre forward can still put in a shift for Jose Mourinho when he needs to. According to the EA Sports performance data the giant Ivory Coast star ran 6.7 miles in Chelsea’s 1-0 win over Manchester United, only a tenth of a mile less than the distance covered by rival striker Radamel Falcao. He also covered more ground at sprint speed than the Colombian, who is eight years younger than him. Didier Drogba covered more ground at sprint speed than Manchester United's Radamel Falcao on Saturday . 7. It’s been a long wait for Mesut Ozil to live up to his £42.5million transfer fee but the German World Cup star is now finding his true form at just the right time. The 26-year-old provided the assist for both of the Alexis Sanchez goals against Reading that took Arsenal into the FA Cup Final. It’s the second time this season he’s provided two assists in a game, both occasions coming since the start of March. Since the end of January when Ozil recovered from a knee ligament the Gunners have won 13 of the 15 matches he’s played. Mesut Ozil (right) was in fine form as Arsenal earned a place in the FA Cup final on Saturday . 8. With three points separating the top four clubs in the Championship, the race for a place in the Premier League is the tightest ever with two games left. And it’s not much easier for those trying to get into the top flight via the play-offs, either. Ipswich still need to win at least one game to be sure of finishing in the top six despite the 1-1 draw at Wolves taking them to 75 points – a total which would have been enough to guarantee a play-off spot in all of the last 14 seasons. Mick McCarthy's Ipswich still need to win at least one game to be sure of finishing in the top six . 9. MK Dons banked £5million for selling teenage midfield star Dele Alli to Tottenham in the January window but must be thankful they borrowed him back for the rest of the season. The 19-year-old took his haul for the campaign to 16 goals as got the last in a 6-1 demolition of Leyton Orient which means Karl Robinson’s side have now scored a club record 90 League One goals. If Dons get promotion they’ll be hoping to borrow Alli for another year to continue his development at Championship level.

Gary Johnson is in danger of having two relegations in one season on his CV unless he can get some points from Cheltenham’s last two games against promotion chasing Shrewsbury and at Wimbledon. The 59-year-old, in charge until February at Yeovil who are already doomed to drop out of League One, took a big gamble agreeing to try to rescue the Robins from losing Football League status after a chaotic season.

"Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat has put the club under scrutiny and guaranteed this campaign will be judged a failure. The burning ambition at Anfield is for Liverpool to be Champions League regulars with the potential to win the Barclays Premier League. But, after a wretched day against Aston Villa, they are clearly some way from realising that dream. Are Liverpool heading for mediocrity? Or is there sufficient talent to ensure the mistakes are corrected and progress can be resumed? A huge summer beckons and there is no margin for error. Philippe Coutinho opens the scoring for Liverpool against Aston Villa with a smart chipped finish at Wembley . Christian Benteke (centre) scores for Aston Villa to make it 1-1 and start Tim Sherwood's side's recovery . England midfielder Fabian Delph fires in Villa's second goal to win the game and book a place in the Cup final . For all the praise that came Brendan Rodgers’ way last season, when he masterminded an unexpected and thrilling challenge for the title, the manager must accept criticism. Like his team, he has underperformed. Yes, he deserved credit for arresting a mid-winter slump. It was smart to change Liverpool’s formation to 3-4-3, sparking an impressive 13-game unbeaten run in the league. But he has not made a mark on the games that matter. At Wembley we saw a prime example. He switched systems (from 3-4-2-1 to 4-3-3 to 4-1-4-1) but Liverpool never found a rhythm. This was not an isolated case. Changes had to be made after a poor start during the 1-1 draw with Basle that led to Liverpool’s exit from the Champions League. There have been other issues. Picking an experimental line-up in the Bernabeu against Real Madrid last November was perplexing. He was outwitted by Louis van Gaal when Manchester United visited in March — it was a mistake not to start Steven Gerrard — and Mario Balotelli’s signing has given Rodgers a problem that he has not been able to solve all season. Rodgers is innovative, thorough and, crucially, still learning his trade. His teams can have style and he has absolute faith in his ability. So, too, do Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owners. His future isn’t even up for consideration. But that doesn’t mean the pressure is off. Managing Liverpool comes with great expectation and Rodgers must provide the right answers come August. Then there are questions about the club’s transfer committee. It grates at Anfield how much focus is put on the committee, which comprises Rodgers, chief executive Ian Ayre, Dave Fallows, the head of recruitment, chief scout Barry Hunter, Michael Edwards, the director of technical performance, and FSG investor Mike Gordon. Yet of the 17 players they have bought at considerable cost over the last two summers, only three — Simon Mignolet, Mamadou Sakho and Emre Can — could be said to have delivered. Tiago Ilori and Divock Origi, on loan at Bordeaux and Lille respectively, remain unknown quantities but many have been duds, such as Iago Aspas, Luis Alberto, Balotelli and Lazar Markovic. Others — Dejan Lovren and Adam Lallana — look overawed. This is another world to Southampton. Brendan Rodgers looks dejected as Liverpool crash out of the FA Cup after a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa . Liverpool manager Rodgers (far right) addresses his players during Sunday's game at Wembley Stadium . Wasting money in the market is not a new failing — Gerard Houllier, Rafa Benitez, Roy Hodgson and Kenny Dalglish made mistakes — but this is on a new level. If Rodgers is under pressure, then so are the men recommending players. FSG do not accept failure lightly. They have dispensed with two managers (Hodgson and Dalglish) and one director of football (Damien Comolli) since taking over in 2010 and will not hesitate to act if they feel things are going askew. Gerrard is going, Glen Johnson will follow, Brad Jones, Brad Smith, Jon Flanagan and Kolo Toure are out of contract. Fabio Borini has no Anfield future and nor does Balotelli. Rickie Lambert must leave to get regular football. Lucas Leiva may choose to pursue a new challenge. Raheem Sterling is at loggerheads with Liverpool over the new deal he has been offered. Jose Enrique, Martin Skrtel and Jordan Henderson have 12 months left on their contracts. Liverpool have agreed a new deal with Henderson but Skrtel is thinking about what he has been offered. Simon Mignolet is one of only three players signed over the last two years that have impressed this season . Emre Can has played with a mature head that belies his tender years since joining from Bayer Leverkusen . Put all that together and it doesn’t paint a settled picture. Rodgers did not want another window like last summer’s, with a raft of new faces, but that looks unavoidable. Signing the right players is key but in the likely event of not being able to offer Champions League football, how easy will that be? Concluding deals has been a serious problem. In the past two years, Liverpool have tried to sign Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Diego Costa, Willian, Yevhen Konoplyanka and Alexis Sanchez without success. James Milner is on their radar, as is PSV Eindhoven’s Memphis Depay, the 21-year-old Holland winger valued at £25million. Sami Khedira’s wages are out of Liverpool’s range. They will also look to bring in a striker, but do clubs in upheaval make smooth progress? No. Absent at Wembley, just as he has been for much of the season, was Daniel Sturridge. It has been a wretched campaign for the England forward, one decimated by calf and thigh issues. Missing the semi-final will have done nothing to help his mental state. Without Luis Suarez, this should have been the year Sturridge took centre stage. Can he do it next season? He has the ability and goalscoring instinct but he will be no use to Rodgers if he is not fit for the major games. Mario Balotelli (centre) is one of a number of Liverpool signings that have failed to impress this season . Glen Johnson was sent on as a late sub for Joe Allen on Sunday is expected to leave the club this summer . Rodgers is keen for Milner, pictured in 2012, to help fill the void left by the outgoing Steven Gerrard . And finally there is the squad’s spirit and attitude. Jamie Carragher has said one of the qualities of Liverpool’s greatest sides was ‘finding a way of winning’ when the chips were down. That, however, was then, and now it is different. At Wembley, it was clear the travelling Kop doubted the character of this squad. Much focus has been put on Gerrard but it is risible to pin any blame on him for the defeat by Villa. He didn’t have the swagger of youth but, even at 34, he still looked the one who would save Liverpool, with a late header that was cleared off the line and a pinpoint ball to Balotelli. He has set the example, so who will do it when he leaves? There is a flaw in Liverpool’s mindset. Unless they toughen their resolve, they will continue to fall short. Rodgers has declared that losing can be a catalyst for success. In 12 months, he must hope his words are proven prophetic. Daniel Sturridge has spent much of the season watching from the stands due to a succession of injuries . Liverpool's players, including their captain, were outclassed by Villa at Wembley and deservedly lost .","Brendan Rodgers needs a positive summer to restore confidence at Anfield .

"Wayne Rooney and Louis van Gaal took consolation in defeat after Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 loss at Chelsea. Injury-depleted United slipped to defeat despite enjoying the better of much of the play against the Premier League leaders, who are now 11 points clear of the third-placed Red Devils. Yet the visitors' performance at Stamford Bridge on Saturday has given Rooney and Van Gaal cause for optimism. United ace Wayne Rooney was happy with his side's display at Stamford Bridge despite the negative result . Louis van Gaal labelled his side's performance against rivals Chelsea as their best display of the season . 'I thought it was excellent, we dominated from start to finish,' Rooney told MUTV. 'We created some good chances, but unfortunately didn't take any of them. 'I felt that if we got a goal, even with five minutes to go, we would have gone on to win. 'We can take great confidence from this result as I've rarely seen a team come to Stamford Bridge and dominate so much, all that was missing was a goal. 'On another day we could have scored two or three goals, but it wasn't to be. 'We have to move on now and look forward to facing Everton next weekend.' Van Gaal, who deployed Rooney in midfield after injuries to Michael Carrick, among others, was pleased with the chances created, but rued missing them. 'We were always in the half of the opponent,' the Dutchman said. 'In spite of the compact defence and the defensive organisation of Chelsea, we have created in the second half more chances. 'That is an unbelievable performance, I think. But you need to score. 'Normally we are more effective. I think we played a fantastic match, but we lost.'

"Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini has been terrorising opposition defences of late, but goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has revealed Chelsea have a plan to deal with him. United travel to Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon hoping to put a spanner in the works of Chelsea’s Barclays Premier League title charge, with Fellaini the danger man in midfield. But his countryman Courtois says the Blues have been working on a way to combat the unorthodox midfielder after he starred in recent wins over Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City. Marouane Fellaini (pictured) has been in brilliant form for Manchester United in recent weeks . The 27-year-old controls the ball with his chest during United's 4-2 victory against Manchester City . 'Manchester United have a lot of other good players to decide a match, so we are not completely focused on Fellaini,’ Courtois said. ‘But we know that when he comes into the box, he is very dangerous. ‘I will probably have to come out to collect crosses into the box. Of course, we know about him and hope to keep him out. ‘Of course, (the exact way we deal with him) has to be kept private. I cannot say exactly how we will do it, but of course we know to keep an eye on Marouane.’ Fellaini has emerged as one of the Premier League’s most effective performers recently, flourishing under Louis van Gaal’s management after being cast as a joke figure under David Moyes last season. Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois believes his side will be able to combat Fellaini's style of play . Courtois in action during Chelsea's 1-0 Premier League victory against Queens Park Rangers last weekend . Courtois has played alongside the big-haired 27-year-old for Belgium, with whom he has also become a key figure, scoring in their last two European Championship qualifiers. ‘You have to use Marouane's qualities,’ Courtois told Sporting Telenet. ‘If you do not play him in the right position, he might not play as well and could come across as a bad footballer. Courtois celebrates Chelsea's last minute victory with Cesc Fabregas and John Terry . ‘But if he is used the right way, I think he has more technical ability than people think. Beyond that, he is obviously very strong and dangerous with his head. He's a real box-to-box player, he can be in defence and five seconds later upfront and scoring. You have to be very attentive.' Despite Fellaini’s abilities, Courtois is confident of winning the Premier League title and feels Eden Hazard will double it up with the PFA Player of the Year award, even if he admits that teams have found out a way to stop Chelsea. ‘I think at the start of the season, teams did not really know how to play against us,’ he said. ‘Now they know and they try to stop the way we play as much as possible. ‘Eden has been decisive for us and if we are champions, a lot of credit goes to him,’ he added. ‘In that area, he still has an edge over his competitors.’ Eden Hazard (left) has propelled Chelsea to the top of the Premier League with his brilliant displays .

"Eden Hazard has been the best player in the Premier League all season and on Saturday he demonstrated just how much he has grown as a player and how important he has been to Chelsea’s imminent title victory. He is now the player you look to in a crisis. He is the man who has been eking out wins when the team hasn’t been at its best. He did it last week at Queens Park Rangers, winning the ball from the goalkeeper’s kick and driving into the box to set up Cesc Fabregas, and he did it on Saturday with his finish. He’s dragging them over the line at the minute. You wondered when Jose Mourinho came in whether Hazard would be the kind of player who would work hard enough for him. And he would have taken the hint when he saw Juan Mata moved out that there would be no special favours from the manager for his creative players. Eden Hazard fires past David De Gea following a storming run from the Belgian star into the box . Hazard celebrates in front of the Stamford Bridge faithful following his 38th minute strike . The Chelsea forward's first-half strike proved crucial as the Blues eked out a 1-0 victory . He perhaps looked at that and responded. You will see in certain games against lesser teams he might have a licence not to track back — but not today, not against the best teams. Then he is required to do the requisite defensive work. And he does now. But the big change for him in the last 18 months has been in his finishing — and that was evident again on Saturday. He’s now on 17 goals for the season. He’s always been a player who could assist and create but now you look to him for goals. He is the danger man, he draws people to him and creates space for the rest of the team. He’s not in the top three players in the world at the moment but he’s creeping ever closer. What he will need to reach that level is for Chelsea to make a Champions League final and for him to be decisive. Hazard tries to guide a deflected shot into the United goal as Ander Herrera tries to snuff out the danger . He is improving every season, which is a good sign, and if he keeps doing that he has a chance of being that good. Chelsea will win the league now. I don’t think they’re at their best at the moment but managing a league campaign is not about playing well all the time. It’s about surviving the difficult periods — and Chelsea haven’t lost games when they’ve struggled in the same way that Manchester City or Manchester United did. Now they look a little tired as they get towards the finishing line and Mourinho would feel he has very strong squad of 13 and 14 but he will probably try to bring in people so he can give Nemanja Matic or Cesc Fabregas a couple of weeks rest at times to recuperate. As for United, for all their dominance in possession, they lacked enough clear-cut chances. In fact they needed something like the magic of Oscar’s back-heel and Hazard’s finish. Louis van Gaal will have been pleased that they controlled long periods of the game with their passing but they did lack that bit of punch. Wayne Rooney takes on Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Hazard at Stamford Bridge . With Wayne Rooney not being able to play at centre forward because of the injuries, it did neuter them somewhat. I thought he did well in midfield and proved that he can drop back into that position — his passing and play was excellent. But he’s been the thrust of the team in recent times. Maybe two years ago Radamel Falcao or Robin van Persie could have provided that, but at the moment United need Rooney to give them that impetus in the really difficult games. When Sir Alex Ferguson left, you would have said it might take a couple of seasons to establish a new identity and build a new foundation. It’s been a bumpy ride and they wouldn’t have expected another change of manager, but at least, two years on, it looks as though they are now in that place.

"Two more games; that’s all it will take. Two more games and Jose Mourinho will have confirmed his mastery of the Premier League with a third title in five attempts at the trophy and Chelsea will be crowned champions. The clue that this was the decisive game was in the manic nature of the second half. Not on the pitch, but on the touchline. Mourinho and his assistant Rui Faria were up and down with unusual intensity, even for them, waving players back with the most extravagant gestures when they lost the ball. Hold on to this lead, was the implicit message, and a huge step will have been taken to the ultimate goal. In fact, as One Step Beyond played at the end of the game and the players congregated in the centre circle, there was a sense that the celebrations were already in swing.

Two more games of course have to be won and that includes a visit to Arsenal next week. But there can be little doubt as to the destination of the title after this result. The hard work of the winter has been done. Mourinho was haveing none of it of course, rightly so, insisting they need eight points. They need nine, actually, to be sure, but beat Arsenal next week and then they will need just three more. ‘If the celebration is because we beat one the biggest clubs in the world, I understand that,’ he said. ‘If the celebration is because the players gave everything to win that game and they feel the result of the work they did this week, then I also understand that. ‘But if they are celebrating something more than that – not at all. It’s three points. Every point we get is one step in the title direction but no more than that.’ Yet though Chelsea were on the back foot for much of the game, though Manchester United did play well, the champions elect were worth their win not least in the fact that they were more or less in control of their destiny and they had the outstanding player on the pitch in Eden Hazard. When he nut-megged David De Gea for the opening goal, it was as though the race to be player of the season – they are both shortlisted for the award - had become a personal feud. The finish was both ruthless and decisive, an indication of how far he has grown. But he was not alone. The team approached their task with the cold, quite professionalism required of champions; not all titles are won at a canter with a spring in the step. Sometimes getting across the line is enough hand. Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera is sent flying by a tackle from Chelsea star Oscar on Saturday evening .

Lone striker Didier Drogba bursts past United defender Chris Smalling as Chelsea continue their pursuit of the Premier League title . Louis van Gaal felt his team, shorn of Michael Carrick, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind, deserved more. ‘I’m very proud of my team,’ he said. ‘We played the best match this season but in football you can lose in spite of you being the better team. ‘It's amazing how we have played here. When you have seen the statistics, it's unbelievable that the result is 1-0. We count it that we have made a big step forward in our process. But for the fans, they have lost. And Manchester United have lost. ‘We were always in our opponent's half. In spite of the difference and despite Chelsea's defensive organisation, we have created more chances. That's an unbelievable performance – but, read the score.’ Mourinho had the perfect riposte to that. ‘The game was exactly what we wanted. When we manage to play the game we want to play, it's fantastic. The game was exactly what we were working for the game to be. The team was fantastic.’ The truth was somewhere inbetween those two analyses. Mourinho would not have wanted the challenge Gary Cahill made in the final moments of added time, in which Andre Herrera trailed his leg into the clumsy tackle and fell. Herrera received a yellow card for diving – and Mourinho made much play of how his players might have been accused had they done the same – but another referee might easily have given a penalty.

Likewise when Luke Shaw, a constant worry to Branislav Ivanonic, played in Radamel Falcao and he smashed the ball against the post on 76 minutes, that would not have been in the Mourinho game plan. Nor the moment when Shaw found Rooney in the fourth minute and the captain curled the ball wide when he really should have scored. That said, though United dominated midfield with Ander Herrera and Wayne Rooney, Chelsea had the better chances. Having conceded much of the possession, John Terry muscled Falcao off the ball – a foul according to van Gaal – and found Oscar on 37 minutes, whose impudent back heel saw Hazard set off like with an intent that would not be denied. His touch and finish was that of a man wholly sure of himself. Herrera then blotted his copy book, with a wayward pass on 53 minutes, seized on by Didier Drogba, sprinting goal-wards. Chris Smalling made enough of a nuisance of himself to ensure that shot was deflected over David de Gea. Hazard was on hand, tearing in at far post, but, unable to break his stride for a simple finish, he instead flicked the ball and hit the post. Nevertheless, you were left marvelling at the Belgian. He reminds you of Robert Pires when Arsenal were closing in on the title in 2002. It isn’t just that his speed terrorises or that his skill is above that of almost every player on the pitch. It is his state of mind that is so dangerous, that intuitive confidence great players possess; the knowledge that they have the capacity to change the game at any point. He did just that.

"Jose Mourinho reignited talk of a campaign against Chelsea, even after taking a huge step towards the Barclays Premier League title on Saturday. Eden Hazard’s first-half goal gave the league leaders a 1-0 win over Manchester United, but there was controversy when United were denied a late penalty. Ander Herrera went over under the challenge of Gary Cahill but referee Mike Dean adjudged the Spaniard to have dived.

Replays showed some contact between the two players during stoppage time but Herrera looked to have moved his leg to provoke a collison. And Mourinho took the opportunity to pick at an old wound in his long-running feud with Sky Sports. ‘I am happy that it was not a Chelsea player,’ he said. ‘If it was a Chelsea player, in this moment on Sky it would be “somebody's crimes, cheating, the champions of the team without fair play” and this kind of things.’ Mourinho was angered earlier this season when Sky used the headline ‘Diego Costa crimes’ in their analysis of Chelsea’s Capital One Cup semi-final win over Liverpool in January.

He also hinted in his pre-match press conference that Chelsea were disliked and abused because they were making the Premier League ‘boring’ by leading from start to finish. ‘Because it's a Man United player tomorrow nobody remembers,’ Mourinho added. ‘The conspiracy doesn’t go on, I'm happy it's not a Chelsea player.’","Chelsea beat Manchester United 1-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday .

"Chelsea moved to the brink of winning the title with a 1-0 win over Manchester United on Saturday, but Jose Mourinho says the race is not over yet. Eden Hazard scored the only goal at Stamford Bridge to move the league leaders within two wins of being crowned champions. John Terry led the celebrations on the field at full-time, with his team clear in the knowledge that they are almost there in the hunt for a first title in five years. John Terry leads the Chelsea celebrations after Saturday's victory against Manchester United . Wins in their next two games against Arsenal at the Emirates and against Leicester City would wrap up the Barclays Premier League crown with room to spare. But Mourinho shot down any talk of celebration and has said he will not allow his players to believe they have crossed the finish line until the maths say so. ‘In football is not about if it's not about almost, it's about mathematics,' Mourinho said. ‘When mathematically it's done, we celebrate. Until that moment we need two victories  to be champions. ‘We need to win matches. What we can say is that we play nine points at home. We can be champions just at home with the matches we play at home. Obviously if we can get points away, it's better. ‘I am too old on this. I think I will be ready to work again next week and to make the players feel that there is still a long way to go.’ Chelsea need just two more wins to clinch the championship . Chelsea were forced to defend on the edge of their own penalty area for much of the game as United took the initiative with 70 per cent of the possession. Centre back Kurt Zouma was paired with Nemanja Matic in midfield as Mourinho sought to stop Louis van Gaal’s side who have been in rampant form of late. The Portuguese coach had nothing but praise for his entire team for the way they fought to keep the visitors at bay. Manager Jose Mourinho has warned his players they still have work to do . ‘The team was fantastic,’ he said. ‘I'm the one that knows how fantastic it was. The game was exactly what we want. When we manage to play the game we want to play, the game was fantastic. ‘Eden had that magic that the top ones have, especially in big matches. Obviously it was fundamental for us, but I think (Gary) Cahill made an amazing block on a (Radamel) Falcao shot. JT was amazing. The keeper was great. ‘(Cesar) Azpilicueta was, for me, the best player on the pitch. (Nemanja) Matic worked like an animal. (Kurt) Zouma put (Marouane) Fellaini outside the game. The number 11 (Didier Drogba) was another animal fighting against two kids with age to be his son. ‘Oscar worked fantastically well, Ramires came in and gave what we need, even (John Obi) Mikel came in and he holds the ball. And Willian was in bed for two days and comes here directly from his house and put himself available to give a little help. It’s fantastic.’","Chelsea beat third-placed Manchester United 1-0 on Saturday .

"Chelsea captain John Terry is adamant that there is still work to be done if they are to clinch the Premier League title. Jose Mourinho's side moved 10 points clear at the top of the table after Eden Hazard's goal was enough to beat Manchester United, meaning they require two wins from their last six matches to claim the league.

"They like to play a bit of Queen at Bournemouth’s little home in the minutes before their matches start. They might be better served singing The Grand Old Duke of York. Only those 10,000 men on that hill could possibly relate to the absurdities of Bournemouth’s afternoon engagement with Sheffield Wednesday. In sequence, they went from top to third to second to top to second again in the space of one 2-2 draw. They are neither up nor down; they are neither falling apart nor running away with the loot. How delightfully fitting in this remarkable season of Championship football that a team unbeaten in 10 before Saturday’s kick-off would draw at home to a side with nothing to gain or lose. Chris Maguire converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court . Maguire celebrates his late, late strike as the Owls held Bournemouth to a draw on their home turf . The battle for automatic promotion to the Premier League is hotting up with three points covering four teams and with two games to play. 1 Watford 85pts To play Apr 25 Brighton (a), May 2 Sheff Wed (h) 2 Bournemouth 84pts Apr 27 Bolton (h), May 2 Charlton (a) 3 Middlesbrough 84pts Apr 25 Fulham (a), May 2 Brighton (h) 4 Norwich 82pts Apr 25 Rotherham (a), May 2 Fulham (h) And how. They dominated, then they trailed, then they levelled and had a man sent off. Then their fans got mocked by a Wednesday player and then they led and then the player that did the mocking scored a penalty in stoppage time that irritated the home crowd all over again. Brilliantly bonkers. How significantly will Chris Maguire of Wednesday feature in Bournemouth’s final analysis? How serious was Eddie Howe when he indicated that the referees feel Bournemouth, at 15 kicks, have reached their quota for penalties this season? He was unhappy, to put it mildly, that Lewis Buxton was cleared of fouling Callum Wilson in the second half, telling a radio station: ‘It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said, “Don’t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don’t want them to have any more”.’ Kieran Lee (second right) celebrates with his team after his 36th minute header put the visitors ahead . He toned down his sentiments by the time he met the written press and that is probably for the best. Howe is a good and rational man; certainly one of the most upwardly mobile and promising of all English coaches. A sign of the pressure of this incredible promotion race, then? Who could blame him if it was? Middlesbrough had beaten Norwich on Friday night to take Bournemouth’s place at the top and at 3.36pm on Saturday Kieran Lee put Wednesday in front. When Craig Cathcart scored a magnificent volley for Watford against Birmingham — the only goal of the match — Watford were top and Bournemouth were third. The natives grew restless. Then Yann Kermorgant equalised, lifting Bournemouth back up to second, and a home fan screamed into a camcorder held by a policeman. Senses take leave at this time of a season, which might also explain how Simon Francis quickly landed himself a second yellow card. Maguire turned to the home fans and motioned for them to dry their eyes. Alas, Matt Ritchie then hit the top corner and put Bournemouth top again but in stoppage time Adam Smith fouled Atdhe Nuhiu for a penalty. ‘No-one will blame Adam,’ Howe said. ‘We will tell him how much we love him tonight.’ Yann Kermorgant (second left equalises for the Cherries with 20 minutes of the contest remaining . Bournemouth's Simon Francis is dismissed by referee Paul Tierney in the 78th minute . Which is nice, though Maguire did score the penalty and Bournemouth did fall. Again. Howe said he felt ‘heartbroken’. Over the course of two spells at Bournemouth he has led them from League Two to this precipice, occasionally spending his own money in the darker days when the club was broke. Today, in their tiny stadium where parking costs £1 and stewards are encouraged to say hello, they are so close to something incredible. Tommy Elphick, Bournemouth’s captain, gave something of an insight into what his manager has been going through. ‘He is probably the first one every day in at 6 or 7 and probably leaving at 6 or 7 at night and the players follow suit,’ he said. ‘We realise how much he does for us. When a single person gives that much of their life towards you, you only want to repay them.’ But the best intentions can only do so much in a race like this. Promotion is worth somewhere in the region of £120million and, as of the weekend, eight teams are in the hunt for three spots. Multiple narratives, multiple charges and multiple futures on the line. It’s crazy but it’s brilliant. With only two games to play it has been a magnificent race up the hill. Matt Ritchie races away to celebrate after his 85th minute free kick put the home side ahead for the first time .","Bournemouth are now second in the Championship following their draw .

"It is a cold, spring night in the heart of Liverpool at a football ground bordering Huyton, where Steven Gerrard grew up, so Paul Scholes is in unfamiliar territory. But he is reluctant to leave. Most of the rest of his party have gone but he lingers as the final minutes are played out, with the score 0-0. It has been a frustrating night for Salford City, the club Scholes co-owns with former Manchester United team-mates Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt. A draw here at Prescot Cables means automatic promotion will become only an outside possibility. Gary Neville and Paul Scholes attending the Salford City game at home to Clitheroe Town on Saturday . (Left to right) Scholes, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs co-own the club with Gary Neville (not pictured) Salford are attacking the far end of the ground and the view is obscured but, with 90 seconds remaining, the ball breaks for substitute Gareth Seddon about 10 yards out with only the goalkeeper to beat. And even from Scholes’s long-distance view the ripple of net is immediately visible as the ball beats the keeper and Seddon turns away to celebrate. Scholes, too, punches the air, his face beaming as it once did when he scored a last-minute goal against Manchester City in April 2010. ‘We had to win,’ he says, a look of real relief in his eyes. This must compare to watching United in a title run-in. ‘It’s the same,’ he replies nonplussed, before reconsidering. ‘Tonight it has been worse.’ Seddon’s late goal set the wheels in motion for a fantastic run that has seen Salford win six on the bounce, their latest victory away at Burscough on Saturday. It takes them five points clear of Darlington, who have a game in hand, at the top of the Evo-Stik League First Division North (four tiers below the Football League). With one week to go promotion is well and truly in their hands. Win at home to Ossett Town on Saturday and they are up. Remarkably, Salford City are the team who have happened upon five of the biggest names in English football as owners. The former United players, otherwise known as the Class of ’92, are products of the Premier League era which has propelled the game into a celebrity culture. Here, though, they seem in their element and none more so than Scholes. Earlier Phil Neville was with him. ‘This is going to ruin my week, this is,’ he mutters as another chance is wasted. This is near the base of the football pyramid: clearly the players are a lot better than Sunday League footballers but the culture is closer to Hackney Marshes than Old Trafford. Scholes sits in one corner with a friend, while Phil Neville, across the table with his father, Neville, informs him that they will be pairing up with One Direction at a forthcoming Pro-Am Golf Day so Scholes might need a stylist to keep up appearances. Scholes pulls a face while the rest of the group laughs at his expense. Meanwhile, the Prescot committee members quietly discuss a promising first half. The Salford owners are scarcely given a second glance, though there is the occasional photo to pose for. A queue of fans wait for food duing the Evo-Stick League Northern Premier match . Jimmy Birtwhistle, pictured with his grandsons, is a committee member and has looked after the turnstile for the past six years . Although yesterday’s 2-1 win at Burscough extended Salford’s lead at the top, the season has been anything but a smooth ride. The original manager Phil Power was sacked in January and left complaining that the decision was delivered by chairman Karen Baird, with the owners failing to contact him. Both Gary and Phil Neville say they did contact him to talk through their reasons but the offer was refused. ‘That was a low moment and not something we want to do often because there are good people at this level and you don’t want them to lose their job,’ said Phil Neville. ‘This season has been a massive learning curve. The biggest lesson we have learnt is we have to take a step away from the playing and coaching side. Let the managers manage and players play. At this level, they are the experts, not us.’ The club are now managed by the duo of Anthony Johnson and Bernard Morley, who won promotion from this league last season with Ramsbottom United. When Power was in charge, Scholes and Phil Neville attended training and helped out with sessions but, under the new managers, that has come to an end. ‘We had become the meddling owners, everything we didn’t want to be,’ said Phil Neville. Gary Neville takes up the story. ‘Phil and Paul became quite involved in the first three or four months and we found that what might have been seen as a positive didn’t work out that way,’ he said. ‘The players would hear different voices — one week they would be there, the next they’re not there. With coaching, it’s about consistency and repetition. What was seen as being assistance for the previous manager and creating a buzz just didn’t work. ‘The sadness of it all is that we did lose a manager and it was not something we wanted to do. It was not something that we felt good about.’ There have been other adjustments to the non-League level. ‘You never win away games at night in midweek,’ said Phil Neville. ‘Players are tired after a day’s work; often they’ve rushed to the ground sometimes without eating properly; naturally they fade late on.’ Former Manchester United striker Danny Webber now plays for Salford City . Salford City's game against Clitheroe Town on Saturday was free admission for fans . Captain Christopher Lynch works a night shift loading gas bottles, physically demanding work, and usually has to come off after 70 minutes in evening games to go to work. The owners have tried to address the fatigue problem, with the team meeting in a hotel for salad, pasta, chicken and salmon a few hours before their matches. ‘At the start of the season we had a perfect vision that we’ll have the manager now for the next 20 years and we’ll have a set of young players and they’ll see us all the way to the Football League,’ said Phil Neville. ‘But as time has gone on, we’ve learnt from speaking to teams that have come through the divisions, like Fleetwood, Fylde and AFC Wimbledon, that you have to be ruthless.’ If there has been a loss of innocence, there is at least a better understanding of an owner’s lot. ‘You can understand how, when emotions are running high, owners can make bad emotional decisions like bringing players in on big money and putting yourself under financial pressure,’ said Phil Neville. ‘I can see how it runs away with you. When you lose a couple of games you think: “Oh, we need a new player. Let’s just push the budget out a little bit and we’ll make it back here.” But you never make it back.’ LEFT TO RIGHT TOP ROW - Phil Neville, Robbie, Savage, Raimond Van Der Gouw, John O'Kane, Mikael Silvestre, Quinton Fortune . LEFT TO RIGHT BOTTOM ROW - Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Raphael Burke, Ryan Giggs Paul Scholes line up for a Class of '92 v Salford City match last August . Gary Neville added: ‘When we jumped into this we thought this is going to be a big challenge and a lot of people are going to be looking at how this goes. But actually, no matter what happens, if we’re still watching this level of football in five years’ time, we’ll be disappointed because we won’t have progressed, but we’ll still be happy every week. ‘It brings us back down to earth.We might be coaching with England or United or doing a Premier League game or Champions League game in Barcelona. Then three days later you’re at Brighouse away or Ossett Town and there’s a tea lady at half-time saying: “Do you want a cup of tea, love?” It’s just real. People at this level do it for the passion of their clubs and their communities. And though Giggs and Butt haven’t been able to attend as much, because of their coaching duties at Manchester United, Scholes and Phil Neviile clearly feel the same. ‘At the start we asked ourselves why we were doing it,’ said Phil Neville. ‘But when you come down to training, go to matches and mix with the supporters, it just feels real. ‘There’s a simplicity at this level. It’s exciting to watch. I know we want the game to be played in a beautiful way but there is also something beautiful about the style at this level. The roots of English football are actually in the Evo-Stik League.’","Class of '92 owners of Salford City discuss their non-league club .

"You don't have to be an avid follower of Manchester United to know that Radamel Falcao has struggled badly at Old Trafford this year. Goals have been hard to come by for the Colombian, with just four being netted by the striker this season in a United shirt having signed on a season-long loan from Monaco. But not only has Falcao failed to score since January 31 against Leicester, he has also failed to have a shot on target in the Premier League - featuring in 10 games since.During that period he has collected £3,080,000 in wages.

Falcao stands dejected with Wayne Rooney at the final whistle following United's 1-0 loss at Chelsea . Falcao looks on with Marouane Fellaini waiting to kick-off following Eden Hazard's strike . Granted, Falcao has not always featured for the Red Devils but the striker's £280,000-a-week wages are a massive burden for United, making a permanent move this summer even more unlikely despite the uncertain future of strike partner Robin van Persie. Falcao started in Manchester United's 1-0 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday, but despite playing the full 90 minutes for a side that bossed over 70 per cent of the ball, he struggled to get involved in the game. The striker saw a shot blocked by Gary Cahill and had another two shots fly wide in the second half. But otherwise the Colombian's biggest impact was a negative one as he lost the ball following a John Terry challenge in the build up to Eden Hazard's winning goal at Stamford Bridge. Following another failed audition in front of manager Louis van Gaal, Falcao's Premier League adventure is set to go down as a costly mistake for the Red Devils. John Terry had the upper hand on Falcao in their personal scrap, with the Chelsea captain winning the ball off the striker to start a move which led to Hazard's goal in the Premier League clash .

Van Gaal was Barca manager when Iniesta made his debut for the Spanish club during the 2002-03 campaign, and the Spain international has admitted he is grateful to Van Gaal for placing trust in him to make his senior debut. 'I think my first team debut was the most important day, Iniesta told Barcelona's YouTube channel. 'It was the most important because I'd been dreaming about it for so long. Louis van Gaal gave Andres Iniesta his Barcelona debut during the 2002-03 season . Iniesta reflected on his impressive career while speaking to Barcelona's YouTube channel . 'I'm grateful to [Louis] van Gaal for his trust and to all the coaches that I had before that taught me and helped me to get the nicest moment that I'd been chasing up to that time.' Iniesta also admitted he took great joy in defeating Chelsea and Manchester United during Barca's run to Champions League success in 2009, admitting his winning goal at Stamford Bridge was one of the highlights of his career. 'I consider the Rome final to have been one of the best finals of all time because of what the final was like and how we got there, Iniesta added. 'Especially after Stamford Bridge and the personal moment I lived with one of the most incredible experiences of my whole career. 'And also because of the circumstances leading up to the game, I had missed the cup final a week and a half before and I was injured, but I always remember that I wanted to play in that final for definite. We got the treble and that led on to achieving more things.'

"Steve Clarke sprang up and pumped the air with his fist. All of a sudden, there was a little extra bounce in his box-fresh training shoes and a fire in his belly burned a little more fiercely. As a Chelsea player and coach, Clarke has fought hard across the capital with Arsenal over the years but through the first-half at Wembley, his Reading team struggled to match their illustrious opponents. They were flat. They backed off and defended, and offered a little too much respect to the team with the best form in the Barclays Premier League since the turn of the year. Steve Clarke applauds fans after his Reading side were narrowly beaten by Arsenal at Wembley Stadium . Arsenal have been irresistible since they improved at the back and supplied a stronger base for the flair of their many attacking stars to perform upon. Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez, bought for a total of more than £70million, combined to open the scoring. What could Reading do with that sort of money? Ozil and Sanchez swaggered down the tunnel for the start of the second-half, deep in conversation, planning more damage but Reading stirred, found an equaliser and were able to add urgency to their game. Clarke sprang up and threw a punch of delight into the air on the touchline. His team were back in the contest and they contributed to a thrilling FA Cup semi-final. It was their first since 1927, so it would have been a shame to go home without a fight. As for Clarke, this must have felt good. He has been away from the cut-and-thrust of football’s elite since he was sacked by West Brom, but here he detected an FA Cup final as Wojciech Szczesny was unable to keep out a deflected volley from Garath McCleary. The Reading boss won the FA Cup with Chelsea in 1994, a game he considers a defining moment in the history of the West London club. Reading's Garath McCleary (bottom right) celebrates after scoring a shock equaliser against Arsenal . But Adam Federici's goalkeeping error enabled Arsenal to regain the lead in extra time . Clarke consoles his dejected keeper following the full-time whistle at Wembley . They barely looked back and were tightening their grip on a fourth Barclays Premier League title as Reading took Arsenal in extra-time. For all their quality, Arsene Wenger’s team still have vulnerabilities. Clarke, having learned much at the shoulder of Jose Mourinho, will have been aware of that. He will have been disappointed with the first-half display but hugely proud of their response and the desire they showed. In the end, Reading were unable to wreck Arsenal’s defence of the trophy or Wenger’s drive towards becoming only the second manager in history to win it six times, after George Ramsay with Aston Villa, all prior to 1920. But, as Clarke goes back to the Championship and a home game against Birmingham, he will take strength from this display and use it to inspire his return to the top-flight. Despite the defeat, Clarke will hope the performance will inspire a Premier League return .","Reading lost 2-1 against Arsenal in FA Cup semi-final at Wembley .

"Manchester United are to introduce the living wage at Old Trafford in July. At a recent Premier League meeting clubs agreed to adopt the policy, which sees in-house staff paid £7.85 an hour (or £9.15 an hour should they be based in London), from the 2016-17 season. But United officials have decided to implement the salary a year early. Staff at Old Trafford will be paid at least £7.85 an hour after Man United decided to introduce living wage . A spokesman said: 'During last month's Premier League shareholders' meeting, the clubs agreed to adopt the Living Wage for all full-time employees by the start of the 2016-17 season. 'Manchester United is fully supportive of this initiative and will be implementing this policy from July 1 2015, a year earlier than agreed.' A group of United and City supporters had planned to demonstrate about the issue at Sunday's Manchester derby. Chelsea became the first professional club in England to pay a living wage to all their staff while supporter-owned FC United of Manchester were the first club in Britain. All Premier League clubs have agreed to pay the living wage from the start of the 2016-17 season . City are also committed to paying their full-time staff the living wage. 'Since May 2013 Manchester City Football Club has paid the Living Wage to all directly employed staff,' a spokesperson said. 'The club also has a robust sustainable procurement policy for capital works that includes a requirement that suppliers already pay the living wage or are working towards it, and whether suppliers pay the living wage is part of the selection process for all new contracts. 'City engages employment and procurement practices that are robust and socially aware. These take into account of the need for affordable living, best care in welfare, training and skills development, and local opportunity including apprenticeships and new skills programmes. 'There is a huge amount being undertaken to ensure there is a positive impact of any club investment for local people and the local economy overall, with sustainable outputs and outcomes.'","Man United will pay their staff at least £7.85 an hour from July .

"Wayne Rooney wants to put a smile back on the faces of Manchester United fans by claiming victory in Sunday's derby against City at Old Trafford. Rooney has enjoyed a good record against Manchester City since he joined United in 2004. The 29-year-old is the leading United scorer in derby history with 11 goals, the most famous of which came in 2011 when he scored an acrobatic late winner in a 2-1 victory for United at Old Trafford. Wayne Rooney knows Manchester United will be playing for 'pride' against rivals Manchester City . Rooney celebrates scoring during United's 3-1 Premier League victory against Aston Villa . He has had to get used to being on the losing side in recent years, though. United have lost their last four meetings against their biggest rivals, but Rooney is determined to put an end to that sequence this weekend. 'You play for Man United, you want to win these derby games,' the United captain told MUTV. 'We want to give United fans something to smile about when they go to work on Monday morning, we want them to be the ones to be able to give out the banter to Manchester City fans at work. Sergio Aguero (right) scored the winning goal as City beat United 1-0 last November . United boss Louis van Gaal will be hoping his side can earn a four-point gap over City . 'I think it's a very important game for Manchester United and Manchester City... for the fans and, for me, it's a massive game of pride.' As well as pride, Rooney knows victory would put United four points clear of City, who dropped to fourth in the table following a 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday. Rooney scored a stunning volley in last week's 3-1 win over Aston Villa and is certain to start against City on Sunday. Louis van Gaal has the option of welcoming back Robin van Persie after he returned to training following an ankle injury. But the United boss is more likely to stick with a front three of Rooney, Juan Mata and Ashley Young, who have served him so well in Van Persie's absence.","Manchester United take on rival Manchester City on Sunday .

"Jose Mourinho might have called it poetic justice as Ashley Barnes was sent off on the stroke of half-time to deliver a major blow to Burnley's prospects of staying in the Premier League. Burnley were left feeling hard-done-by as referee Mike Jones denied them a couple of possible penalties and more significantly allowed Kevin Mirallas to stay on the pitch for a tackle worse than anything Barnes did. All that would be called karma in Mourinho's book. The Chelsea manager condemned the Burnley forward for a 'criminal challenge' on Nemanja Matic at Stamford Bridge in February when he escaped unpunished and Matic was sent off for retaliation.

On Saturday, Barnes wasn't so lucky, getting a first yellow card for an attempted sliding tackle on James McCarthy and a second for a foul on Seamus Coleman. 'It was just two silly challenges, not malicious,' said Dyche. 'But at least the referee got that one right.' That was a pithy way of explaining he was less than happy with Mr Jones for denying Burnley penalties for a John Stones challenge on Barnes and an attempt by McCarthy to bring down Scott Arfield. And he was furious that Mirallas stayed on the pitch for a high lunge on George Boyd early in the second half. 'That was the biggest one. It's impossible he stays on the football pitch for a challenge like that,' said Dyche. 'High, late. I've no clue why it wasn't a red card. 'I don't want to see players surround referees. We don't. Maybe we should because other teams would have done after the Mirallas challenge. 10 v 10 is a lot easier than 10 v 11 and we would have fancied our chances.' Predictably, Everton boss Roberto Martinez had an opposite viewpoint. 'I don't think it was a red card at all. He stands on his feet in the challenge. It was well-controlled,' he added before slightly contradicting himself. 'It was a typical striker's challenge.'

Burnley No 1 Heaton blows a sigh of relief after preventing Everton from taking the lead . Decisions aside, it was clear Everton were the better team on the pitch and deserved the victory given to them after 29 minutes when Arouna Kone dummied Seamus Coleman's cross and Mirallas finished at the second attempt for his 10th goal of the season. They had already missed a penalty from Ross Barkley by that stage. Burnley's Tom Heaton was by far the busier of the two goalkeepers and when the visitors had a late chance to equalise, it fell to out-of-sorts Danny Ings who headed Kieran Trippier's cross wide. Burnley's brave battle against the drop is in danger of running out of steam, perhaps due to Dyche's policy of naming unchanged teams. Leicester's win leaves The Clarets bottom of the table having scored only one goal in seven matches. They face Leicester next weekend and it's a must-win, . If they been spurred on by the record-breaking Test cricket achievements in the Caribbean of Burnley fan Jimmy Anderson, it didn't show. After ten minutes, David Jones pulled down Aaron Lennon on the edge of the box and they both fell inside. Baines, whose Premier League record from the spot is 15 out of 16, didn't take it. Barkley did and the effort was saved by Heaton with Martinez unconvincingly stating afterwards he applauded the youngster's confidence for stepping up. At least it didn't deny Everton a win as Mirallas had done when he grabbed the ball of Baines against West Brom in January and missed his penalty. 'I was very pleased with the overall performance. The scoreline shows you a clean sheet and we had 20 attempts to score,' said Martinez whose side could still finish a moderate season in the top half of the table. Burnley would bite your hand off at 17th and Dyche still believes in the great escape. 'I thought we were decent in the first half and excellent in the second when we were a man down.'

"Rotor Volgograd, one of Russia's leading clubs in the 1990s and who famously beat Manchester United in the UEFA Cup 20 years ago, have been wound up after going bankrupt. The team from the Volga region of Russia were competing in the second division in the southern zone, which is effectively Russian football's third tier.

Manchester United drew 0-0 with Rotor in Russia before their elimination from Europe's second tier competition on away goals. The English side crashed out of Europe despite Paul Scholes and Peter Schmeichel's goals at Old Trafford. 'The Volgograd Region's administration have signed an official document concerning the bankruptcy of Rotor,' the club's website stated (www.rotor-fc.com). In April a 'new' amateur club, which will also be known as Rotor Volgograd, will take part in the Russian third division. 'Over time, the Volgograd Region's administration plan to turn Rotor Volgograd into a legally binding structure, which will allow them to compete at a professional level,' the club added. Rotor, founded in 1929, finished runners-up in the Russian Premier League in 1993 and 1997. In September 1995 they knocked a United side containing the likes of David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane, out of the UEFA Cup at the first round stage. After a 0-0 draw in Russia, Rotor drew 2-2 at Old Trafford to go through on away goals. In 2005 Rotor lost their professional status but were reformed a year later and have since been competing in the lower divisions.

'My dad is a social worker and I grew up in a small village which had a very good and strong community that's about helping people in need.

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez sees a fearlessness in relegation-threatened Burnley similar to that displayed by his Wigan team in surviving against the odds in the Premier League. The Clarets head to Goodison Park having beaten Manchester City, drawn against Tottenham and being narrowly defeated by Arsenal in the last month. They remain two points from safety but Martinez believes the fact they have been scrapping to get out of the bottom three all season - much like his Wigan side in the four seasons he spent with them before joining the Toffees - gives them an advantage over teams who have been dragged into the race for survival. Roberto Martinez (left) says Burnley's player remind him of his old Wigan side when they avoided the drop . 'You always see similarities,' said the Spaniard when asked for comparisons with his experience of the Latics' relegation battles. 'I don't think there is any fear of relegation and that is the biggest difference Burnley have over other teams who are not in the relegation zone who are starting to think they have something to lose. 'Burnley have shown to every team they play on the front foot. 'Physically they do not show they have been involved for nine months in this competition; it is the opposite as they are getting used to the demands of the Premier League and they look a strong team physically. The Spaniard masterminded Wigan's escape from relegation which seemed an almost impossible task . 'When you are in a situation as clear as the one they have now with the points they have, they are only one step away from getting away from the bottom three and that is an incredible incentive.' Martinez was criticised for not changing his approach during Everton's difficult run a couple of months ago but he stuck to his principles and he believes Sean Dyche's clear plan will help Burnley survive. 'Sean has been an incredible leader and has set very good direction for his team,' he added. 'When you get into a new league you sometimes don't get positive results after having a successful season in the Championship and you can start having doubts and wanting to change week after week. Sean Dyche has installed a fearlessness into his squad and Martinez praised his weekend opponent . 'Your own approach becomes your biggest problem but Burnley have been an incredible source of clarity, knowing what they are and how they want to achieve success and they are enjoying the best period of their season in terms of being consistent with their performances. 'You can expect them to pick up enough points to achieve their aim.' While Burnley are fighting for their lives Everton have nothing left to play for, 12th in the table on 38 points with no chance of qualifying for Europe again. But Martinez insists there will be no easing up as they look to build on seven points from their last three matches. 'Maybe from the outside they don't see it as an important ending to the season but I can guarantee from our point of view the next six games are very important,' he said. John Stones (right) has turned into a crucial player for Everton this season and earned himself an England cap . 'We need to take advantage of the good moment of form we are in now.' Key to their recent upturn has been the elimination of defensive mistakes and Martinez said that was a result of hard work on the training ground. 'The mentality has changed. I think we have become more focused as a team. Sometimes it is unfair just to speak about defenders when you talk about defensive qualities of a side,' he said. '(Goalkeeper) Tim Howard is enjoying a good moment of form and that breeds confidence and (John) Stones and (Phil) Jagielka have become really strong with their understanding and how they are setting a clear platform for the team. 'What is important is it is something we highlighted, it was something we were not happy with and we corrected it over the weeks and that has been reflected in the scorelines.'

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club after Ross Barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against Burnley at Goodison Park. The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick – awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon – rather than Leighton Baines, who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League. Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time, it brought back memories of Everton's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed. Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch . Barkley's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park . Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday. 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch, he would have taken it. Otherwise, I am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how they feel at that moment,' argued the Everton manager. Baines (left) has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League . 'Ross showed incredible responsibility to take it. I love seeing players take control of the big moments and Leighton was happy to given him that responsibility.' Barkley's penalty was well-struck but wasn't put in the corner and Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton dived to his right to save. Fortunately for the young England player, it didn't prove costly as Mirallas went on to score the only goal of the game after 29 minutes.

"Don't expect to snag a £1,000 nosebleed ticket - or any other ticket - at the box office for the fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. Just two weeks before the bout, tickets for the most anticipated fight in recent times have yet to go on public sale, with the two camps and the MGM Grand locked in a stand-off over allotments. When they are finally put on sale, only a few will be sold at the listed price. The impasse has left fans in the dark, and ticket brokers perplexed. Floyd Mayweather performs at a media workout with his uncle Roger on the pads in Las Vegas . Manny Pacquiao was in good spirits as he showed off his skills for the fans earlier this week . 'It's bizarre, normally there's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight,' said Connor Gregoire, an analyst for Seatgeek.com. 'To our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now.' Mayweather's promoter, Leonard Ellerbe, said Tuesday that tickets would go on sale this week for the May 2 fight, but MGM officials have been tight-lipped about their availability. The hotel issued a statement Friday saying there would be a 'limited number of tickets available for sale' and that it is working with promoters to finalize a date for their release. The fight was always going to be a tough ticket, with announced prices of £1,000 to £5,000 in the 16,500-seat Grand Garden arena. But those prices have already tripled in the resale market even before tickets are available, and the two camps and the MGM have been bickering over how many seats - and at what price level - each party gets. Pacquiao's manager, Michael Koncz, blamed the Mayweather camp for holding up the ticket sales, saying they have refused to sign a term sheet negotiated months earlier that specified the allotments. 'It's a real mess right now,' Koncz said. 'I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the holdup? I'm more than a little upset they're not for sale to the public.' Millions of dollars are at stake in the dispute, because after the MGM takes its share each camp gets a certain percentage of tickets and is able to resell them with ticket brokers for higher prices. The estimated gate for the tickets if they are sold at retail prices is already a staggering £48million, far surpassing the previous gate record of £13.3million for Mayweather's 2013 fight with Canelo Alvarez. Pacquiao used Instagram to show his fans a photo of his ripped body as he continues his preparation . Promoter Bob Arum said he has heard of people cancelling their reservations to Las Vegas because they're afraid they can't get tickets. 'This is not acceptable,' said Arum, who promotes Pacquiao. 'This is a worldwide event that the city of Las Vegas is involved in. It's one of the craziest things I've ever seen.' Gregoire said the fight is one of Seatgeek's most searched events, but that only a few dozen tickets have been sold through the website. Those tickets are what the ticket industry calls 'spec tickets' because the sellers don't actually have them in hand, but expect to get them before the fight. The Filipino fighter is looking to put an end to Mayweather's current unbeaten record in the ring . The cheapest seat on the site on Friday was £3,200, and Gregoire said the average sale so far is in the £5,300 range. 'People are hesitant to buy in the secondary market before there's been an original sale,' he said. 'And you've also got the incredible prices being asked for tickets now. That means a lot of people are not buying tickets at this point.' At Stubhub there are no tickets for sale, spokeswoman Alison Salcedo said, because the ticket reseller is waiting for actual prices to be set and tickets to be printed. Music artist Liljamez posted the photo of 'Money' with just over two weeks to go until the bout . 'There's still so much up in the air for this fight that we're not allowing spec sales,' Salcedo said. 'We're not willing to take that risk now.' Tickets have also not gone on sale for the closed circuit telecast of the fight at the various MGM properties in Las Vegas. Thousands of those tickets are expected to be sold to fans that can't get into the arena itself, but no price has been set for them. Pacquiao shows off his impressive speed - which he will hope will trouble Mayweather . Earning an estimated $180million from the bout, Mayweather is confident he won't lose his perfect record . Koncz said he talked to Pacquiao on Thursday about making sure he had enough tickets to take care of people in his camp. He said there have been requests from around the world for fight tickets, but that they have been forced to put them off because of the uncertainty over how many tickets are available and their pricing. One thing that is certain, he said, is no one - including the celebrities who generally populate the ringside seats - is getting in for free. 'Nobody's getting free tickets,' Koncz said. 'Even Bob (Arum) has to pay for his ticket in the first row.'

"Tim Sherwood will consider selling Christian Benteke this summer if Aston Villa’s star striker insists he wants to leave the club. Benteke has two years left on his contract once this season is completed and harbours ambitions to play in Europe. Sherwood said the Belgium international had given no suggestion he would like a transfer away and appeared to be enjoying his football at Villa Park. But the Villa manager admitted that, were the 24-year-old to demand a move, as he did two years ago, he would be inclined to sanction it. Villa are believed to value Benteke at upwards of £25million and Wolfsburg have monitored his situation. Benteke has scored eight goals in his last six matches. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke could be sold in the summer if he wants to go, says boss Tim Sherwood . The 24-year-old has two years left on his contract but harbours ambitions to play in Europe . Sherwood said there would likely be talks over Benteke’s £50,000-a-week contract during the summer . ‘We don’t want to sell our best players,’ said Sherwood. ‘I also want players who want to play at the football club. ‘He’s made no indication to me that he wants to play elsewhere. If he does then we will assess the situation but we want to keep him at the club. ‘You can’t force any player, I’ve been one myself. You might as well take the money because you end up without the money or the player if you don’t take it.’ Sherwood said there would likely be talks over Benteke’s £50,000-a-week contract during the summer. ‘I know better how Tottenham went about their business regarding their contracts. I’m not too sure how they go about it here,’ said Sherwood. ‘But it’s certainly something that will have to be addressed. You don’t really want players going into the last 18 months of their contract, he’s someone for the long-term future and you need to protect your interests.’ Sherwood accepts winning the FA Cup, meaning a place in the Europa League, could help. ‘That would put everyone in a good mood, not only Christian,’ he said. ‘I think he is enjoying his time here and everyone is seeing that. He is a top player. We have a lot of top players in here and no-one wants to fight relegation. If we can get through this season we will build something where we are going to step upwards — we won’t be in that position again.’ Sherwood also wants to wipe any smile from Raheem Sterling’s face by causing an FA Cup shock at Wembley on Sunday. Benteke (second left) scored the only goal of the game as Villa won 1-0 at Tottenham on April 11 . That goal at White Hart Lane was the Belgium international's eighth in his last six games for club and country . Footage this week emerged showing the Liverpool forward inhaling nitrous oxide, a legal high commonly known as laughing gas because it creates feelings of euphoria. Sherwood said: ‘Let’s hope he’s not laughing after Sunday.’ The Villa boss knows his ambitions to beat Liverpool and reach the FA Cup final may rest on taming Sterling, a player he tried to sign for Tottenham’s academy as a schoolboy. The 20-year-old is enduring a tough time off the pitch, in a contract stand-off with Liverpool and coming under question for his recreational activities. Sherwood added: ‘I have a wee bit of sympathy. I am not condoning it, but he is a young man, isn’t he? He obviously has fortunes but is growing up like everyone else. It is tough in the public eye.’ Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season . Another Liverpool player Sherwood discussed on Friday was Steven Gerrard, whose birthday falls on the FA Cup final on May 30. Those associated with the Merseyside club feel an ideal silverware send-off is brewing before Gerrard heads to LA Galaxy. ‘Believe it or not it’s not about spoiling the party for Steven Gerrard,’ insisted Sherwood. ‘It’s about what we can do. To be honest we’re hoping he’s on his holiday in May.’ Sherwood played against a teenage Gerrard in his latter days and hailed the 34-year-old’s clear talent from the off. He added: ‘I’m sure Steven could still do a job for a Premier League side but I’m not sure he can go and play for anyone other than Liverpool. He can earn £1 a week or £200,000, he’ll still play the same way. That’s a dying breed — there aren’t many of them about.’ Liverpool have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for the FA Cup semi after serving a three-match ban . Sherwood has led a Villa resurgence since taking over in February, steering the club away from relegation danger and into this Wembley showpiece. They are on a run of four wins in seven. He believes his team can upset favourites Liverpool. ‘It’s a very exciting game, a great opportunity for this club to get to an FA Cup final,’ he said. ‘I’ve lost semi-finals myself, not a great feeling. ‘We’re going in with a positive state of mind. This club’s relegation is not at stake, it is about us maybe getting some glory for the football club. ‘We have the mindset to win the game, impose ourselves on a very good Liverpool side. We have a good blend of players who can play and maybe go direct at times. We’re prepared to mix it up, we have a plan.’ Sherwood has led Villa to a run of four wins in seven matches ahead of Sunday's semi-final at Wembley .","Aston Villa play Liverpool in their FA Cup semi-final on Sunday at Wembley .

"Martin Skrtel has praised the impact Steven Gerrard has had upon him since arriving at Anfield in 2008 but believes Liverpool can overcome the difficult challenge of replacing him. Reds captain Gerrard is set to feature for Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday, looking to lead his hometown side into the final against Arsenal. Should Liverpool emerge victorious against Villa, Gerrard will sign off his Anfield career in the final which takes place on his birthday of May 30, before moving to LA Galaxy. Martin Skrtel (left) says departing Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is still one of the best players in the world . Gerrard is aiming to end his Liverpool career by making the FA Cup final and beating Arsenal . Skrtel (right) has praised the impact and example Gerrard has set during his time at Liverpool . Srktel believes Gerrard is synonymous with Liverpool and that the midfielder is still one of the game's leading stars. 'In my eyes he is still one of the best players in the world,' Skrtel told Goal.com. 'When you say Liverpool it's always Steven Gerrard. It will be different next season and Liverpool will never be the same.' Skrtel was signed by Rafael Benitez from Zenit St Petersburg seven years ago and despite some indifferent form upon arriving in England, the Slovakia international has gone on to become a mainstay in Liverpool's defence. Skrtel revealed that Gerrard helped him to settle at the beginning of his time at the club. 'I can say only good things about him,' Skrtel said. 'From the first day I came to Liverpool he was here to help me. He gave me a hand every single day with everything I needed. I need to say thanks for that.'

"Brendan Rodgers has urged Liverpool to turn Wembley back into 'Anfield South' and believes an FA Cup semi-final victory over Aston Villa on Sunday would help his players develop a stronger winning mentality. Rodgers is looking to lead Liverpool to an eighth FA Cup victory and his first piece of silverware since replacing Kenny Dalglish as manager in 2012. And the Northern Irishman believes that while trophy success is imperative for any Liverpool team, success this season could pave the way for many more trips to Wembley in the future. Brendan Rodgers leads Liverpool for the first time at Wembley since arriving at the club in 2012 . Liverpool's last trophy success came in 2012 in the League Cup under Kenny Dalglish . Rodgers wants Liverpool to reclaim the form that led Wembley being called 'Anfield South' by supporters . 'The history of the competition is set here at Liverpool, with the great victories they've had in the past,' Rodgers said in an interview with The Football Association. 'And this is a club that is based around winning trophies. 'Wembley was somewhere that used to be known as 'Anfield South'. Liverpool used to visit Wembley so much it was a regular occurrence for them. 'We have some gifted young players who we want to springboard their careers by allowing them to feel the mentality of winning and that would really help us.' The 42-year-old Rodgers also spoke of his eagerness to claim his first piece of silverware at Liverpool. He took the side to brink of winning the Premier League for the first time last season but while Liverpool have undoubtedly progressed under his guidance, their last trophy win was the League Cup in 2012 under Dalglish. 'I want to be in the game for a long time, and be renowned as someone who is up there at the elite level and looking to win trophies,' Rodgers said. '(The FA Cup) is synonymous throughout the world. It's the real competition in domestic football that the players love to win.' Rodgers believes cup glory would help his players develop a stronger winning mentality for future seasons . Should Rodgers (left) guide Liverpool to victory, Steven Gerrard will have a chance to lift a cup in his last game . Rodgers has an indifferent record against Villa since arriving at Liverpool. He has beaten the club three times at Villa Park but has yet to record victory over the Midlands side at Anfield in the league in his three seasons, losing twice. Should Liverpool reach the final against Arsenal on May 30, it would present captain Steven Gerrard with the chance to sign off his era at Liverpool by lifting a trophy.","Liverpool take on Aston Villa on Sunday for a place in the FA Cup final .

"Stoke boss Mark Hughes has claimed Tom Jones is costing them a spot in the Europe League via the Fair Play League. The Potters' faithful have been singing Jones' song 'Delilah' as their unofficial club anthem since the the 1980s, though it has been criticised with claims the original lyrics promote domestic violence. And Hughes, whose Stoke side occupy 17th place in the Premier League Fair Play standings, believes his side are being harshly marked down because of the 1960s song. Mark Hughes believes Tom Jones' song 'Delilah' is costing them a spot in the Europe League . Stoke are 17th in the Premier League Fair Play table and are set to miss out on European football next year . Stoke City supporter Anton Booth, known as TJ among fellow fans, claims to have introduced Delilah after he started to sing it in a pub in the late 1980s. The hit has become Stoke's unofficial club anthem and is a regular chant at the Britannia Stadium. 'Apparently we get knocked down because the fans have a Tom Jones song,' he said. 'If the crowd are a little bit intimidating we lose marks due to the behaviour of supporters. It's unbelievable. 'But it's not just the song, it's when it gets a bit heated here, plus it's four of five criteria and small margins, it's officials, players, crowd. 'If nothing happens you get six points. But if someone sings Delilah, you get four. Over the course of the year, if you're consistently marked down, you're going to be at the bottom end of the table. 'I don't think there's a problem with them singing it. It's crazy from my point of view.' Sam Allardyce's West Ham are top of the Premier League Fair Play table and could earn a Europa League place if they finish top of the pile and England’s top flight is within the top three ‘fair-playing’ leagues in Europe – which it was on the last count. Hughes' (left) Stoke side have been singing Jones' hit since the 1980s as their unofficial club anthem . Each match is assessed by a Premier League delegate and teams are marked in five categories, with a further category relating to the behaviour of the public. This is how the points are calculated: . 1. Red and yellow cards (Maximum score = 10 - No minimum score) Teams are deducted points if a player receives a yellow card (-1 point) or straight red (-3 points). This is the only section where teams can receive a score below zero. 2. Positive play (Maximum score = 10 - Minimum score = 1) Premier League teams are encouraged to play a positive style of football. This section takes into consideration things like time-wasting tactics and positive play. 3. Respect towards opponents (Maximum score = 7 - Minimum score = 1) This section is designed to encourage players to abide by the spirit of Fair Play and it also includes offences which may have been accidentally overlooked by the officials. 4. Respect towards the referee (Maximum score = 7 - Minimum score = 1) The Premier League takes respect towards officials very seriously and players are expected to respect referees- including assistants - at all times. Positive attitude is rewarded with high marks. 5. Behaviour of the team officials (Maximum score = 6 - Minimum score = 1) Team officials, including managers, are assessed on their behaviour during a match. One aspect they are marked on is how they accept the decisions of the referee. 6. Behaviour of the public (Maximum score = 10 - Minimum score = 0) The section which has angered Hughes, teams begin with a score of five points but can lose marks for persistent abuse of officials, aggressive conduct towards rival fans and foul and abusive language. But Hughes has criticised the competition, which is designed to promote positive behaviour, and has questioned its merit. 'The Fair Play table is a waste of time,' he added. 'I was always historically at the bottom when I was Blackburn, but then I went to Fulham and we qualified. Despite a successful season in the Premier League this year, Hughes isn't happy with the Fair Play table . 'It's the perception of the club here that sometimes goes before us. 'We also have a high amount of yellow cards. 'Whether Fair Play merits a European place is open to discussion. But it's a good prize. 'We're not going to win it any time soon though are we?'","Tom Jones' song 'Delilah' is sung by Stoke fans as unofficial club anthem .

"Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has urged his players to shut the Champions League out of their minds and concentrate on extending their lead at the top of the La Liga table on Saturday. Victory over fourth-placed Valencia will take Enrique's men at least temporarily five points clear at the top of the table with title rivals Real Madrid not kicking off against Malaga until evening. But with Valencia visiting the Nou Camp in the midst of a 10-match unbeaten run Enrique has stressed the importance of forgetting Wednesday night's superb 3-1 semi-final first leg win in Paris. Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has urged his side to switch their attention back to the La Liga title race . Luis Suarez starred in Barcelona's 3-1 Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain by bagging a brace . Barcelona midfielder Andreas Iniesta has been ruled out of his side's league encounter against Valencia . Enrique said: 'We are not thinking about the PSG match, we are only thinking about the visit of Valencia. 'Mentally we will have no problems because the players know if they are not 100 per cent against Valencia things will get complicated, but physically there are one or two things we have to assess.' Andreas Iniesta is definitely ruled out for Barca after he was forced off early in the second half of the 3-1 win in the French capital with a bruised pelvis. Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo insisted he was impressed but undaunted by Barca's performance over PSG as his side look to pull off a shock win which will strengthen their grip on fourth place. Santo said: 'What we have seen confirms what we already thought. They are a great team with great players. They don't have many weaknesses, but they do have some.' Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti knows his side have plenty of reasons to be wary as they look to keep up the pressure on the leaders with victory over seventh-placed Malaga. Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been ruled out of his side's La Liga match against Malaga . Benzema rolls around on the floor during Real Madrid's quarter-final clash against rivals Atletico . Real Madrid attacking midfielder Isco is expected to replace the injured Benzema for Saturday's clash . Malaga pulled off a stunning 1-0 win over Barcelona in the Nou Camp in June and Ancelotti has warned his players they must wipe thoughts of their Champions League semi-final against city rivals Atletico if they are to avoid a similar fate. Ancelotti, who is without the injured Karim Benzema, said: 'Malaga played very well against Atletico (last week), performing with a lot of intensity and quality. They beat Barcelona at home and we need to focus on this match in order to win it.' Atletico Madrid will look to consolidate their grip on third place as they travel to a Deportivo La Coruna side for whom two successive draws has left them sitting above the relegation zone on goal difference alone.

Sunday's action switches to the relegation zone with Almeria looking to build on their potentially priceless win over Granada last week and put space between themselves and the drop zone with victory at Rayo Vallecano. Granada hunt for their first league win in six at home to Sevilla while bottom-placed Cordoba's survival hopes will be all but over if they fail to take the points at Europe-chasing Villarreal.

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Dimitri Payet have had their respective suspensions for abusing Ligue 1 referees reduced by one match apiece. Paris Saint-Germain striker Ibrahimovic will now miss three games and Marseille playmaker Payet just one after both clubs succeeded with appeals to the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF). Ibrahimovic was initially banned for four games by the French Football League (LFP) when he was caught on camera after last month's 3-2 defeat to Bordeaux launching into a tirade against official Lionel Jaffredo while walking back to the dressing room. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has had his four-game ban reduced by one match after successfully appealing . Ibrahimovic was heard swearing as he walked towards the changing room after PSG's loss against Bordeaux . The Swede reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen . He was angered by suggestions his remarks were also derogatory to France as a whole and claimed his words had been 'twisted'. Speaking in the video in English but in partial sentences, the Sweden international could be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' Marseille playmaker Payet then received a two-game sanction after aiming expletives at the closed door of the match officials' dressing room following the goalless draw with Lyon, in which Lucas Ocampos' late strike was deemed not to have crossed the goal-line. A statement from OM read: 'Olympique de Marseille received on Friday an official notification that the (LFP) has accepted the proposal of the CNOSF concerning the suspension of Dimitri Payet. 'The (CNOSF) arbitrator proposed to reduce the suspension from two matches to one match with a further one-match ban suspended.' PSG initially only reported the news in a post on their Swedish Twitter account. It read: 'Now it is clear. Ibrahimovic's penalty has been shortened by one game! He will be back in Ligue 1 away against Nantes!' That game takes place on May 2. The suspensions have led to tensions with Canal+, the network which broadcast both video clips. Dimitri Payet has also had his ban reduced by one after an appeal to the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF) The two clubs, bitter rivals of each other, put out identical press releases last Friday stating that they would no longer speak to Canal+ until May 30. LFP president Frederic Thiriez sympathised with that stance and told reporters in France: 'I understand the two clubs. This manner of using what happens in the players' tunnel simply to create a scandal creates a problem of fairness in football. 'The presence of a camera, which is not always visible, could eventually lead to a suspension. That could have an effect on the end of the championship.' OM were happy to make use of Canal+ in the fall-out over Ocampos' disallowed goal, however, tweeting a picture of the channel's 3D goalmouth simulation. They responded to Thursday's announcement that officially sanctioned goal-line technology will be used in Ligue 1 next season by tweeting a video of the incident with the words: 'Next time, the goal will be given!'","Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic picked up a four-game ban .

"UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino has warned that there will be no choice but to suspend Greece from international football unless the country's government rescinds proposed new laws. The Greek government has put forward a bill which could see sporting events cancelled due to incidents of crowd violence and teams prohibited from playing in European competition. UEFA and FIFA say that is direct government interference in football and have threatened to suspend Greece. Panathinakos' game against Olympiakos in February was marred by crowd trouble in Athens . Greek government have proposed new laws banning teams from European competitions, but UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino says they are not allowed to directly interfere with football . Infantino said: 'Sadly there will be no other choice than to suspend the Greek Football Federation if this new legislation is passed because football does not allow government interference. 'There are currently three other countries, outside of Europe, which are currently facing similar issues - Indonesia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. I think people in Greece should be very concerned because a suspension will have a serious impact on their football. 'Don't forget that it will affect more than the national team. If your clubs don't play in our competitions, their coefficient will also drop, meaning that less teams can qualify for the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.'

The 25-year-old is out of their pivotal Champions League quarter-final second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu after suffering a calf injury early on in their 3-1 win against Malaga at the weekend. And despite being downbeat on missing the midweek European encounter against Atletico, the Wales forward was all smiles as he continued his recovery to full-fitness. Gareth Bale took to Facebook on Wednesday to wish Real Madrid good luck against city rivals Atletico . Bale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on Wednesday night . The Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga in the opening stages . Accompanied with the caption: 'Gutted not to be playing tonight, but working hard to get back to fitness. Good luck lads!! Real Madrid C.F.' Bale took to Facebook to upload a picture of himself on an exercise bike at the club on Wednesday afternoon. Along with Bale, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti will also be without first-team regulars Karim Benzema and Luka Modric for the tie. The 55-year-old could start Isco, Jese and Javier Hernandez in the absence of his key triumvirate - something that doesn't faze the Italian. 'We are missing some important players but it's impossible for us to be more motivated than we are. We have to live with injuries. We did it in the past and it will not hurt our confidence,' Ancelotti said at a press conference. 'Isco has played in Modric's position before and he did very well there. We have plenty of options even without Bale and Benzema. There's James, Jese and Chicharito. James has been doing great, both on the right and in midfield. Chicharito is in fine shape as well, both physically and mentally. 'I will choose the best possible line-up. I will select players that will help the team to play like we did in the first leg. I have the best squad in the world in my opinion.'

"Robin van Persie and Jonny Evans both enjoyed gentle re-introductions into the game as Manchester United’s Under 21 side drew 1-1 at Leicester, although Rafael and Adnan Januzaj both limped off. Dutch forward Van Persie has been out of action since February with an ankle injury after leaving Swansea on crutches. But he was up and running again in the East Midlands, helping set up United’s goal for Sean Goss although his overall performance was rusty to say the least and he was replaced just after the hour. Defender Evans has been out for six games due to suspension following his spitting incident with Papiss Cisse at Newcastle back in March. Manchester United goalscorer Sean Goss (centre left) is congratulated by James Wilson (left) and Robin van Persie (centre right) Goss levelled the scoreline in the 32nd minute by wriggling past Leicester's defence before scoring past the helpless Adam Smith . Harry Panayiotou put his side in the lead after 18 minutes after getting on the end of a cross by Leicester playmaker Anthony Knockaert . Leicester forward Panayiotou runs off in celebration after finding a way past Manchester United reserve goalkeeper Joel Castro Pereira . Manchester United right back Rafael had to be taken off in the 44th minute after sustaining a rib injury during the reserve match . LEICESTER CITY (4-5-1): Smith; Sesay, Davis, Moore Chilwell; Knockaert, McCourt, Barmby (Rowley 75), Hammond (Stankevicius 68), Dodoo; Panayiotou . Subs not used: O'Hara, Fletcher . Goal: Goss 32 . MANCHESTER UNITED (4-5-1): J Pereira; Rafael (Grimshaw 44), Evans, Blackett, Kellett; Wilson, Thorpe, Love, Goss, Januzaj (Harrop 54); Van Persie (Weir 62) Subs not used: Miles, Maddison, Scott . Goal: Panayiotou 18 . Referee: Simon Barrow . And despite his frustrating absence, Evans looked solid enough in a 90 minute appearance where he went close from a set piece before the break. However he will feel he should have denied Harry Panayiotou the opener for Leicester. Van Persie and Evans along with Rafael and Tyler Blackett were all in the United side that lost 5-3 to Leicester at the King Power Stadium back in September and keen to banish the memories of one of their lowest points of the season. United could have taken an early lead with James Wilson seeing a shot deflect wide from Andy Kellet’s cross. However it was Leicester who took the lead in the 19th minute, Anthony Knockaert’s tricks out wide enabled him to cross for Panayiotou, the highly-rated St Kitts and Nevis international, who powered home. It would be harsh to blame Evans for the goal but Panayiotou was his man and he will feel he should have done better. In response United went close through Januzaj who shot wide from distance while Joel Pereira had to do well to push Leicester midfielder Jak McCourt’s effort around the post. The visitors started to press with Adam Smith’s save keeping out a Wilson effort. Van Persie, who was an unused sub at Chelsea on Saturday, had been virtually anonymous in the opening half an hour with few touches of the ball. But he played his part in the leveller laying the ball off for Sean Goss who burst through the Leicester defence and finished well on 32 minutes. Louis van Gaal was hit by another injury when Rafael was forced off just before the break with an apparent rib injury after an aerial collision with Knockaert. Rafael looks in pain as Leicester's Knockaert checks on the Brazilian defender during the first half of the draw at the King Power Stadium . Rafael had to be replaced by Liam Grimshaw shortly before the half-time interval despite managing to get back onto his feet . Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj was also taken off with an injury during the reserve encounter at Leicester's King Power Stadium . Van Persie finally got his opportunity in first half stoppage time but his effort from outside the area was well saved by Smith. And from the resulting Januzaj corner, Smith made an even better stop to push Evans’ header over the bar. Rafael’s replacement Liam Grimshaw saw a shot deflect wide at the start of the second half before Van Persie’s next involvement was a lay-off that was intercepted by Dean Hammond in the area before it reached its intended target. A frustrating evening of injuries for United continued when Januzaj went off with what appeared to be a leg injury following another seemingly innocuous aerial collision with Knockaert. Van Persie was substituted on 62 minutes, going off to warm applause from all present at the King Power Stadium which had one side opened. It may not have been the goalscoring return he wanted, and indeed he looked fairly quiet, but it was the game time under his belt that he needed as he looks to score the goals that would seal a Champions League spot for Van Gaal’s side. You would still suspect a start at Everton on Sunday would be far too early for Van Persie – but maybe not for Evans. The Northern Ireland international still had work to do late in the game as he marshalled a defence that came up against Knockaert, keen to force his way back into Nigel Pearson’s plans, who twice went close to finding the net. A ball across the box from Panayiotou also caused one or two alarms for the United back four but Evans can generally be pleased with his evening’s work. Wilson could have won it for the visitors late in the game but dragged a left-footed effort wide under pressure from Joe Davis. And he went in even closer deep into stoppage time as his effort was kept out by Smith from Kellet’s cross from the left.

"Leonardo Jardim believes Monaco's march to the Champions League quarter-finals is proof that clubs do not have to splash the cash in order to achieve European success. Four years have passed since Dmitry Rybolovlev's takeover prompted a slew of big-name arrivals at the Stade Louis II, with the likes of Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho signed for hefty transfer fees. But the Russian billionaire has tightened the purse strings in recent seasons and, with most of Monaco's expensive signings subsequently moving on, Jardim has been forced to nurture young talent after finding his options in the transfer market somewhat restricted. Leonardo Jardim says Monaco's performance in the Champions League shows you don't need to buy big . Monaco's new-found financial prudence is beginning to yield results, however, with Les Rouges et Blancs third in Ligue 1 and still in with a chance of qualifying for the semi-finals of European football's premier club competition for the first time in 11 years. The principality club host Juventus at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday looking to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the quarter-final first leg and Jardim, who replaced Claudio Ranieri last June, is proud of what he has achieved in his 10 months at the helm. 'We went from the worst qualified team in the fourth pot, to winning the group, to knocking out a European giant in Arsenal (in the last 16),' he told BeIN Sports' The Ligue 1 Show. 'Right now, you could say that Monaco's coach is very proud of his players. We've shown that we don't need to make big investments to go far in this competition. The days of the French club signing big names like James Rodriguez (left) and Radamel Falcao are over . 'The club changed its strategy and the project (in the summer). They have stayed ambitious but the onus was placed more on the development of young players.' Jardim's young guns will have to be on top form if they are to advance to the semi-finals past a Juventus side 15 points clear at the top of the Serie A standings and well poised after Arturo Vidal's spot-kick winner in Turin last Tuesday. Juve are bidding to reach their first Champions League semi-final for 12 years and boss Massimiliano Allegri is taking nothing for granted ahead of Wednesday's encounter. Arturo Vidal (left) scored the only goal from the penalty spot to put Juventus in the ascendency . Luca Marrone (from left), Giorgio Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli take part in a training session . 'The clean sheet at home gives us a slight advantage, even though it won't be straightforward,' he told his club's official website. 'We now know our opposition: they're very well organised in defence and possess technique and physicality in forward areas. 'I'm optimistic, even though we know we'll have to put in a good performance and score to reach the next round. They're a complicated side to play against. Monaco don't give you an inch out there.'

"Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone believes English football needs to ‘wake up’ after this season’s poor showing in Europe. Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City were eliminated at the Champions League last 16 stage, and Everton were dumped out of the Europa League in the same round. Simeone, who takes Atletico to rivals Real Madrid for a Champions League quarter-final second leg on Wednesday night, thinks this season’s failure should spark a response from the Premier League’s top clubs.

Arsenal's Mesut Ozil sits on the turf after his side's last 16 Champions League exit at the hands of Monaco . Click here to read Simeone's column in full . Writing in his exclusive column for Goal.com, he said: ‘I’m surprised there are no English clubs left in the Champions League. ‘English football has enormous potential with its footballers and financial clout. The fact that there is no English team left in the last eight of the Champions League or in the Europa League is a wake-up call for the Premier League to look at why it is that, despite their great economic power and with all the many great footballers playing in England, Chelsea are so far ahead of everyone else and why they have no teams left in Europe.’ Simeone believes that Spain is still home to the two best teams in Europe - Wednesday night’s opponents Real Madrid, who have home advantage after a 0-0 draw at the Vicente Calderon last week, and Barcelona. ‘For us at Atletico, we are competing against two teams with the obligation of winning the Champions League,’ he said. ‘At the very least, Madrid and Barcelona are among the last eight in Europe every season and usually the last four, so for Atletico to win La Liga last season was a tremendous achievement.’ Diego Godin (left) and Raul Garcia (centre) smile as Fernando Torres makes a point during training on Tuesday .

Carlo Ancelotti, meanwhile, resisted the opportunity to get his excuses in early ahead of the game at the Santiago Bernabeu. Despite facing Atletico without four members of his first team, he said: ‘I have the best squad in the world and it is more important to me who is playing than who is not’. Gareth Bale is Real’s biggest absentee. He was vital for them in last season’s run-in, scoring in their quarter-final win over Borussia Dortmund and in the final against Atletico Madrid. Sportsmail understands he remains committed to staying at the club beyond this summer, despite interest from Manchester United, and he was desperate to play on Wednesday night. Instead he is in a race to be fit for the semi-finals at the start of next month, should Real qualify.

"Southampton fear Nathaniel Clyne has already decided his future lies elsewhere as he continues to stall on a new contract. The England right-back enters the final year of his current deal at the end of the season and is yet to agree fresh terms. The Saints are in talks with the defender's representatives over an extension, with those discussions reaching a crucial stage. Southampton right-back Nathaniel Clyne (left) is stalling over a new contract at the club and could leave . Clyne, who is highly-rated, has attracted interest from several top clubs including Manchester Untied . But Sportsmail can reveal it is looking increasingly likely that Clyne will reject a new deal at St Mary's in search of a move to a Champions League club this summer. Southampton executive director Les Reed, who has been dealing with the contract negotiations, knows there will be a clamour for Clyne's signature ahead of next season. Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool are all interested in the 24-year-old. The trio are able to offer Clyne a more lucrative wage package, and, more pertinently, the prospect of Champions League football next season. Southampton are willing to make Clyne one of the best paid players at the club, offering him a new deal worth £45,000-per-week. But the south coast club know they cannot compete with the likes of United and Chelsea with regard to wages and feel his mind to leave is already made up. The Saints will actively look to sell Clyne this summer if he does not sign a new deal to avoid losing him for nothing in 2016.

"Brentford are considering appointing Gianfranco Zola as their new manager at the end of this season. The Italian was at Griffin Park on Saturday for the draw against Bolton and spoke with Bees owner Matthew Benham. Current boss Mark Warburton is to leave the club next month after feeling his vision did not match that of Brentford, who are to implement a continental approach to their management structure. Brentford are considering Gianfranco Zola to replace Mark Warburton at the club when he leaves this summer . The Italian was manager of Watford for a little over a season beginning in 2012, and led them to the play-offs . Zola is best remembered for the seven years he spent at Chelsea, where he scored 59 Premier League goals . Zola is one of a number of candidates on the list to replace Warburton, with Benham also sounding out coaches from Spain and France. The owner wants to follow the lead of his Danish side FC Midtjylland, who are on the cusp of winning the Superliga, sitting 11 points clear at the top. In keeping with Benham’s want for mathematical modelling, Zola would need to agree to having a statistics man alongside him should talks go well. Warburton is leaving Brentford this summer because his vision for the club did not match the owners' Rayo Vallecano’s Paco Jemez was the initial favourite to land the job. Brentford could still win promotion to the Premier League in the coming weeks but have fallen three points beneath the play-offs with two games remaining. Zola was sacked by Cagliari last month after failing to win a game during his three-month stint in charge. They are primed to drop out of Serie A alongside Parma. But the former Watford head coach does have extensive experience of managing in England and would buy into the European way to start in west London. He also enjoyed a largely successful spell at West Ham for two years from 2008. Zola was sacked by relegation-threatened Cagliari last month after a winless spell in Serie A . Brentford are still in the hunt for promotion but are three points outside the play-off places .","Mark Warburton set to leave at the end of the season .

"Sam Allardyce believes Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Rob Green is good enough to challenge England No 1 Joe Hart for a place in the national team. Green, capped 12 times, endured a famously turbulent time as England goalkeeper, with his calamitous error in England’s 1-1 draw with USA at the 2010 World Cup a particular lowlight. But after a fine 2011-12 season with Allardyce’s West Ham in the Championship, he gained his first international cap since World Cup humiliation. And Allardyce, whose side face Green and Co at Loftus road on Saturday, still holds his former stopper in high esteem and thinks the 35-year-old could once again stake a claim to be England’s main man between the posts. Rob Green trains ahead of QPR's Premier League match against his former club West Ham on Saturday . Green has won 12 England caps but made a calamitous error in the World Cup against USA in 2010 . The QPR goalkeeper allowed a speculative effort to go through his hands and was unable to retrieve it . The ball trickled over the line as Clint Dempsey's strike earned USA a 1-1 in the opening group match . ‘He could rival Joe Hart,’ Allardyce began. ‘Robert has had an unfortunate England career by the fact that, when called upon, he made a mistake that has probably haunted him for a while. ‘If he has overcome that, the experience he has gained since should make him a better goalkeeper. And after a difficult time at QPR, he has shone through because of his dedication.’ Green swapped east for west London after West Ham sealed promotion back to the Premier League with a 2-1 play-off final victory over Blackpool. And Allardyce, who was forced to let Green leave on a free transfer due to financial constraints, thinks the keeper will be crucial to QPR’s bid to avoid the drop. ‘Financially we couldn't get there – that was the key element,’ Allardyce said of West Ham’s attempts to keep Green at the club. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce says Green can rival Joe Hart for England No 1 spot . Green faces his old club at Loftus Road on Saturday as QPR bid to beat the drop . ‘It wasn't that Robert didn't want to stay – he did. But we couldn't match, at that time, his financial demands and QPR did. ‘Robert is a dedicated goalkeeper who works tirelessly on his game, and has a huge amount of experience now which, hopefully – not on Saturday – will help QPR stay up.’","West Ham take on QPR at Loftus Road in the Premier League on Saturday .

The dialogue between PSG and Depay represents a threat to the Premier League clubs with the Qatari-backed French club understood to have made a significantly better financial offer than Liverpool. United have yet to hold detailed talks with the player but have informed PSV of their wish to do so while Liverpool have established a good relationship with the club and would be serious contenders to sign the wide player if United's offer does not match their own.

"Thierry Henry has hit out at Javier Hernandez for celebrating his late Champions League winner against Atletico Madrid 'like he had just won the World Cup’. The Real Madrid striker sent home fans into raptures when he swept in a pass from Cristiano Ronaldo with just two minutes left to play after neat work by the Portugal international.

There is two minutes to go, he didn’t want to take that chance because he knows Hernandez is in a better position so you have to play that ball. ‘Ronaldo gave him that ball so that goal is Ronaldo’s goal.

The 37-year-old told Sky Sports: ‘It was Ronaldo’s goal in terms of what he did for the goal but Ronaldo is the worst in the world at things like that.

Despite scoring 31 goals for Liverpool in the Premier League last season, the prospect of proving himself in Barca's vaunted attack was intimidating. 'When I arrived I was timid with Messi and Neymar but they just said to me to play as I had done at Liverpool. Now I feel fine off and on the pitch and we have a good time together,' Suarez told a news conference on Monday. Suarez said he has concentrated on being level-headed and that his team mates have helped him fit in at the club.

"Thierry Henry has responded to critics who disagreed with his views on Javier Hernandez's celebration, by posting an 84-minute compilation video of Michael Laudrup's passing.

The three-time World Player of the Year could have shot with two minutes to go in Real Madrid's Champions League quarter-final second leg against bitter rivals Atletico, but opted instead to tee up team-mate Hernandez, who himself slotted the ball home to secure victory. Real Madrid striker Javier Hernandez earned his side Champions League victory with a late goal . The on-loan Mexican striker wheeled away in celebration by himself after firing Madrid into the lead . Hernandez is welcomed by the ecstatic Real Madrid fans following his late goal against rivals Atletico . Defending his views on Twitter, Henry said on Thursday: 'Football is a team game. Yes CH14_ scored the all important goal but the work of @cristiano made it possible. It cannot be underestimated. 'I love it when players celebrate and acknowledge the player that made the assist. The pass can be just as important as the goal.' Henry then went on to post an 84-minute video of former Barcelona midfielder Laudrup, alongside the message: 'Look at this video, you have one of the most unselfish players in the game showing the significance of the final ball. 'That is football. That is #michaellaudrup.' WATCH: The video Henry posted of former Juventus and Barcelona midfielder Laudrup . Thierry Henry was quick to criticise the Mexican striker for the way in which he celebrated his winner . Ronaldo plays the ball across the face of goal to unselfishly find his Real Madrid team-mate Hernandez . At the time, Henry had slammed Hernandez's one-man celebration, commenting on Sky Sports: 'I know he went on to celebrate alone and everything but he needs to thank Ronaldo, because for me he has to. It’s Ronaldo who chooses to change the course of the game. 'That is for me Ronaldo’s goal. There is two minutes to go, he didn’t want to take that chance because he knows Hernandez is in a better position so you have to play that ball. 'Ronaldo gave him that ball so that goal is Ronaldo’s goal. At that moment he knows he cannot shoot so he doesn’t take the risk of doing something stupid or silly.'","Javier Hernandez scored a late goal to secure victory for Real Madrid .

"As expected, Amir Khan will fight Manny Pacquiao's recent victim Chris Algieri in New York and has slammed Kell Brook for his recent comments. This confirmation sets up two successive big nights of televised boxing involving Khan and his British rival Brook. The Bolton-born fighter takes on Algieri at the Barclays Center in New York on Friday, May 29. Amir Khan will fight Chris Algieri in New York on May 29 at the Barclays Center in a televised bout . Brook defends his world welterweight title against Frankie Gavin at London’s 02 Arena on Saturday, May 30 and Sky Sports are expected to screen both events. Criticism followed initial speculation about Khan’s opponent but he has hit back now by declaring Algieri a much more significant challenge than Gavin. Scepticism about Algieri was driven by the six knock-downs he suffered during a record points defeat by Pacquiao in Macau, China at the end of last year. The New Yorker has fought some of the best boxers in the sport and most recently battled Manny Pacquiao . Algieri is the reigning world light-welterweight but is taking on Khan at full welterweight, as he did Pacquiao. He won his title with a courageous victory over fearsome Russian puncher Ruslan Provodnikov, getting off the canvas to earn rave reviews. Khan says: ‘How can Kell knock Algieri given the quality of men he has boxed, while there is no-one of note on Gavin’s record? ‘Algieri has shared the ring with some tremendous fighters. Manny is a huge, very difficult fight for anyone but I know I’ll have to be at my best on the night.’ Kell Brook is going to fight Frankie Gavin in the 02 Arena but has repeatedly called out Khan . Algieri is native New Yorker and will draw strong support to the Center but Khan says: ‘I have good feelings about fighting again in New York, where I beat Pauli Malignaggi on my debut there. I look forward to being back there.’ New York is also the home city of his wife Faryal. Khan has already been in camp with trainer Virgil Hunter in Oakland, California for seven weeks. He will make a flying visit to Las Vegas on May 2 to watch Pacquiao v Floyd Mayweather in the Fight of the Century, again hopeful of luring the winner into a mega-fight with himself.","Amir Khan fight with Chris Algieri confirmed for May 29 in New York .

"Ricky Hatton knows that Manny Pacquiao has the style to beat Floyd Mayweather in the Fight of the Century. The Hitman also considers that having Freddie Roach in his corner gives the PacMan a massive advantage over the Money Man, who is trained by his father, Floyd Snr. Still, when it comes to the half-billion-dollar crunch on May 2 in Las Vegas, Hatton expects Mayweather will 'find a way to win.' Manny Pacquiao works up a sweat shadow boxing during preparations for his clash with Floyd Mayweather . With his eyes closed and grimacing with effort, Pacquiao ramps up his shadow boxing routine . Yet he warns Floyd Jnr that if does beat Pacquiao and wants to go on to eclipse Rocky Marciano's historic record of retiring as undefeated world champion after 49 straight wins, then he should 'stay away from our own Amir Khan.' Hatton, who talks from the painful inside knowledge of having been knocked out by the men currently considered to be the two best pound-for-pound fighters in the world, says: 'We all know Mayweather has this brilliant defence but one of his greatest strengths is his ability to adapt in the ring. It is that boxing brain which is Pacquiao's big problem. 'Manny has the style to beat Floyd. The speed. The quick hands and feet. He's a fast southpaw, which is what gives Mayweather trouble. 'Roach won't tell him to go charging at him down the pipe. He'll want him to throw a lot more punches than Floyd, who picks his shots. But he'll tell him to do it by nipping in and out so he doesn't get caught by Floyd's counters.' Ricky Hatton, pictured at his gym earlier this year, says Pacquiao has the style to beat Mayweather . It was a vicious left hand from Pacquiao that left Hatton on the canvas in Vegas in 2009 . Pacquiao takes on Mayweather six years to the day after knocking Hatton out at the same venue . Hatton also says having trainer Freddie Roach (right) in his corner gives Pacquiao a huge advantage . Mayweather Snr trained Hatton for his fight with Pacquiao and the Hitman says: 'I don't want to knock him but I was shocked that he couldn't do southpaw pads. That's a big disadvantage for Floyd. 'And in Freddie, Manny has one of the greatest trainers in the world. He'll make a huge difference. 'But I still go back to my initial feeling that Floyd will work out how to beat him, somehow. He's so clever. Win or lose he will still go down as one of the best of all time. If he wins I'm sure he will want to go on to beat Marciano's record. He'll be on 48-0 and he'll probably be due any easy fight to get him level with Marciano.' And that means staying well clear of Khan. Mayweather has also been posting pictures and video of his preparation for the May 2 showdown . Mayweather works on the bag as he prepares for the Fight of the Century in Las Vegas . Hatton lost to Mayweather in 2007 at the MGM Grand when the fight was stopped in the 10th round . Bolton boxer Amir Khan could cause Mayweather problems, according to Hatton . 'Floyd will run a mile from Amir,' says Hatton. 'Amir could cause him even more problems than Manny. 'Everyone laughs at me when I say this and I wonder if I know as much about boxing as I think. But Amir's been boxing much better lately, with a lot more discipline. 'And with Mayweather dipping slightly at 38 – probably not at the peak he was when he fought Oscar De La Hoya and me – Amir could be the one who's even faster than Floyd. But Mayweather will not even think about fighting him unless he runs out of opponents before he gets to that record. 'Amir's right to keep Kell Brook on hold while he waits to see if he can get the winner on May 2. Kell would do the same. But he could have to wait even longer unless Mayweather-Pacquiao is a big anti-climax, which it could be if they're both cagey because they have so much respect for each other. 'Floyd likes to fight on the back foot so it will be up to Manny to make it a great fight by going for him. And if that happens then with all the money they can make I'm certain they'll look at the re-match.' *Mayweather-Pacquiao will be exclusively live on Sky Sports Box Office, late Saturday, May 2.

"Kell Brook has finally landed the Battle of Britain he craved, but will take on Frankie Gavin rather than bitter rival Amir Khan. Just sixty four days after the first defence of his IBF belt against Jo Jo Dan, Brook will return to action on a packed pay-per-view show on May 30 at the O2 in London. The welterweight bout has been added to a card that includes world title challenges for Kevin Mitchell and Lee Selby while Anthony Joshua faces his toughest test to date against Kevin Johnson.

Brook poses with Gavin inside the O2 arena after announcing their world title fight . Brook had been desperate to face Khan at Wembley in June but his compatriot ruled out a fight until at least later in the year. Such was the Sheffield welterweight’s desire not to rest on his laurels however, that he demanded a quick turnaround. 'I never expected to be out again so quickly but I can't wait,' Brook said. 'I respect Frankie for stepping up, he has called for this fight for a long time. I feel like I'm unbeatable right now and Gavin isn’t going to be able to cope with my speed and power on fight night. The O2 is one of the best arenas in the world and it’s an honour to headline a card like this.' Gavin had been due to face South African Chris van Heerden in Birmingham on May 9 but has jumped at the chance to fight for a world title. Brook will fight  Gavin (pictured) during an action-packed pay-per-view show in London next month . Gavin (right) beat Bogdan Mitic of Serbia on the same night in Sheffield as Brook's return last month . The 29-year-old switched to Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom outfit earlier this year, making his debut on Brook’s undercard in March. He was previously with Frank Warren who guided him to the British and Commonwealth titles but he came unstuck when suffering his first defeat against European champion Leonard Bundu last August. 'These are the fights you want to be part of and are where I belong,' Gavin said. 'I’ve dreamt of a world title and I will be 100 per cent ready physically and mentally for Kell Brook. 'Of course it’s going to be tough but I believe Kell is beatable and I've always felt that I have got the skills and the team to cause an upset.'","Kell Brook will make the second defence of his title in just over two months .

"Floyd Mayweather has claimed he is a better fighter than Muhammad Ali. Mayweather, who takes on Manny Pacquiao in their $300 million mega-fight on May 2, is widely considered to be the current pound-for-pound No 1. But he believes there has never been a better boxer in the history of the sport. Floyd Mayweather trains ahead of his fight against Manny Pacquiao next weekend . In an interview ESPN's Stephen A. Smith, Mayweather said: 'No one can ever brainwash me to make me believe that Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali was better than me. No one could ever brainwash me and tell me that. 'But one thing I will do, I'm going to take my hat off to them and respect those guys because those are the guys that paved the way for me to be where I'm at today.' When asked if he truly believed he was better than Ali, Mayweather recalled the heavyweight losing his world titles to Leon Spinks in 1978. Muhammad Ali suffered a shock defeat to Leon Spinks who had only fought seven times previously . The inexperienced Spinks celebrates his surprise 15 round split decision victory over Ali . 'Leon Spinks only had seven fights,' he said. 'Never put a fighter in there with Floyd Mayweather with seven fights.' Mayweather also criticised the 'rope-a-dope' tactics adopted by Ali against George Foreman in their Rumble in the Jungle. 'Are you going to tell me its cool to lay on the ropes and take punishment and let a man tire himself out from beating you,' he said. 'He's basically fatigued - you hit him with a few punches and he goes down and quits. You want to be glorified for that? Absolutely not, not me.'

"Manny Pacquiao has a better chance of beating Floyd Mayweather now than he did in 2010, claims his trainer Freddie Roach. The pair came close to agreeing a big-money bout five years ago but it eventually fell through, leaving the boxing world waiting and wondering whether they would ever meet. But after half a decade of speculation, the pair will finally go head-to-head in Las Vegas on May 2 - and Roach believes his man will have the advantage at the MGM Grand. Manny Pacquiao poses with his family and author Nik Vujicic in a photo posted to his Twitter account . Floyd Mayweather continues his training as he prepares to face Pacquiao after years of speculation . Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, believes his man is ready to beat Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2 . Asked whether the 2010 or 2015 version of Pacquiao would have a better chance of victory against the unbeaten Mayweather, Roach told boxingscene.com: 'That is an interesting question because there are obviously trade-offs between the two versions of Manny. But I am convinced that the 2015 model is the more formidable fighter for a few reasons. 'Back in 2010, Manny was still growing into a welterweight. His first two welterweight fights were against Oscar De La Hoya in 2008 and Miguel Cotto in 2009 where he only weighed 142 and 144 pounds respectively, and in between he dropped down to 138 to fight Ricky Hatton. 'Floyd has been campaining as a welterweight since 2005 and weighed 150 in his fight against De La Hoya so that might have given Floyd an advantage. I still like Manny's chances in that fight but I think the Manny of today has a lot more in his favour. Pacquiao is better equipped to beat Mayweather now than he was in 2010, according to his trainer Roach . Mayweather is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak when he meets Pacquiao next month . The pair will go head-to-head in a $300million mega-fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 . 'In 2010 the two-year age difference between the fighters was not significant to either, but that's not true today. Floyd at 38 is doing things he didn't do in the past. Floyd is a defensive genius but he has always depended on his legs to perform and you can see now that his legs do not have the same spring or fluidness of his earlier years. Mayweather remains the bookmakers' favourite for the $300million mega-fight next month but Roach is adamant that Pacquiao is primed to cause an upset. 'The 2015 version of Manny is more mature, smarter and less reckless than the 2010 version,' said Roach. 'He will be treating the ring like a chess board anticipating Floyd's moves - ready to cut him off and attack every time he creates an opening. 'I have all the confidence in the world that Manny is going to knock Floyd out on May 2.'","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao came close to a fight in 2010 .

"Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston took a surprising step in denying five Football Association charges for text messages during which he labelled a supporter a ‘retard’. The unpopular chief initially had until March 30 to reply, but was granted an extension. His appeal is expected to be heard by a separate FA panel next month and Oyston still faces a ban from football activities. Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston has decided to contest his FA charge for allegedly abusive text messages . Oyston - who has been the constant target of fan protests over the course of the Seasiders’ worst season for decades - is also looking at a hefty fine and mandatory four-hour FA education course. The shocking text messages, seen by Sportsmail, emerged just before Christmas when he sent a series of vitriolic volleys to fan Stephen Smith, who he told to 'enjoy the rest of your special needs day out'. Oyston later apologised for his part in the exchange, and it is understood his denial boils down to a reasonable expectation of privacy. The development comes just days after pensioner Frank Knight, a lifelong fan, was ordered to pay £20,000 in damages for alleged defamatory remarks made on his Facebook page. The footballing world rallied around Knight, with a kickstarter fund amassing the thousands he needed to pay. On announcing Oyston’s denial, an FA statement read: ‘It is alleged that the misconduct constituted five breaches of FA rules, and that during the text message exchange, Mr Oyston used abusive and/or insulting words towards a supporter of Blackpool FC. ‘It is further alleged that each of these five breaches of FA Rule E3(1) is an ‘Aggravated Breach’ as defined in Rule E3(2), as each included a reference to disability. ‘Mr Oyston has denied the charge.’ It is not the only example of foul-mouthed exchanges to have happened in a bitter campaign. The Oystons are extremely unpopular at the club, and fans have been protesting against their ownership . In a another rant from Oyston, who also had abuse hurled at him, said: 'Stop texting f******, you shouldn't have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football. Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium. 'You are banned because I think you are a p****. 'Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f******* as you.' Oyston also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see Blackpool, a Premier League side four years ago, spiral down to the Conference, with another text reading: 'I am a never-ending nightmare revenge mission'. Their relegation to League One was confirmed early last week and they are on course to tally the lowest number of points ever in the modern day second tier. There is to be a mass demonstration against their despised reign prior to the final game of the season against Huddersfield next Saturday. The content of the vile messages first emerged just before Christmas and Oyston came in for widespread condemnation. Anti-discrimination group Kick It Out registered their disgust, with local paper the Blackpool Gazette scrapping the chairman’s weekly column with immediate effect. Supporters have been protesting against the Oystons before matches and then not attending the games . Blackpool’s off-field problems have become such a distraction that the club posted an article on their official site clarifying their stance on ongoing defamation cases, one involving a national newspaper. Their lengthy statement on Tuesday read: ‘Reluctantly, the company has been compelled to take action against a number of individuals and organisations following online postings or articles that contained vile lies and abuse about the club, its directors and players. To date, three settlements have been agreed with several further cases pending against other individuals and a national newspaper. ‘Any payments from court or agreed settlements will be anonymously distributed to Fylde and North West based charities. The rationale of this policy is to avoid the adverse reaction towards such charities that accept the donations, as was the case when the club donated the first settlement to a leading, vibrant and forward thinking charity in Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre. ‘The latest settlement of £20,000 will be paid over four years in equal installments, with the charities set to benefit as and when the money is received by the club. ‘For the avoidance of doubt, the club, directors, management staff and players would far prefer not to take any defamation action against any individual or organisation, but must continue to take action where necessary to combat the false, misleading stories and lies that are being perpetuated.’","Karl Oyston will face charges next month over shocking text messages .

"Ronny Deila has called for Caley Thistle’s Josh Meekings to be spared a Scottish Cup Final ban despite his controversial handball. The Celtic boss admitted the 2-1 Premiership victory at Dundee had helped him bounce back from what he described as the toughest day of his career at Hampden on Sunday. But although his club’s Treble ambitions were shattered as a result of the Meekings’ incident in the semi-final defeat to Inverness, the Norwegian said it would serve no purpose for the defender to be given a retrospective suspension by the SFA. Inverness defender Josh Meekings' arm blocks the ball and prevents a goal to Celtic on Sunday . Meekings has been retrospectively suspended for one match, the punishment he would have got if sent off . The fall-out from the Hampden showdown has been dominated by the failure of the match officials to award a penalty after Meekings blocked a goal-bound effort from Leigh Griffiths with his hand. Caley Thistle will learn today whether they have succeeded in overturning the suspension that compliance officer Tony McGlennan offered earlier this week. And while Celtic have written to the SFA seeking clarity over the pivotal incident, Deila insisted that he hopes Meekings is cleared to line up against Falkirk in the final on May 30. ‘It does not help our situation at all and I do not think that he did it on purpose,’ said the Parkhead manager. ‘It all happened so quickly and it is a clear handball and a red card and a penalty. ‘I don’t think that is right for him to miss that match as you want all the best players to play in the final. I would hope that the ban would be overturned.’ Deila said he was unaware of any response from Hampden to Celtic’s letter but said he can understand the scale of the furore that has erupted this week. FIFA vice president Jim Boyce yesterday waded in to the debate to strongly criticise the SFA’s decision to charge Meekings. ‘It is a huge thing as we are talking about the Treble here and the Scottish cup semi-final when we were 1-0 up,’ added Deila. FIFA's head of referees Jim Boyce says the suspension of a player for an unpunished handball is wrong . Inverness is appealing the ruling that, if upheld, will deny Meekings (right) a place in the Scottish Cup final . ‘I am trying to focus on the next game and we have performed very well since Christmas and we have racked up a lot of wins and points.’ Deila admitted he had hit an all-time low after the 3-2 extra-time defeat to John Hughes’ side last Sunday. But he had his spirits restored at Dens Park last night as goals from Gary Mackay-Steven and Virgil van Dijk secured victory over Dundee, who struck a late consolation through Jim McAlister. The result pushed Celtic closer to the Premiership title as they hold an eight-point lead over Aberdeen with just five games to go. ‘It was the toughest day of my career on Sunday,’ reflected Deila. ‘I have to admit that. It was very tough. Meekings (right) celebrates Inverness's 3-2 win over Celtic in their Scottish Cup semi-final . ‘We really wanted it and we had a very good opportunity there. So Sunday and Monday was very tough. But now it has gone. ‘I just want to keep winning games and to get that league title to Celtic Park. Then we have had a good season. ‘I’m proud of the boys tonight. I told the players that they should be very disappointed but winners bounce back. ‘There is nothing in football for feeling sorry for yourself. Whoever wins the league is the best team. If you win a title you deserve it as you’ve done it over 38 games. In a cup it’s just one game. So the league is always the most important thing. ‘What did I do on Monday? I just stayed at home and I looked at the wall! I watched a bit of TV as well,’ added Deila, who has been linked with a potential move for Belgian Under-21 central defender Brandon Mechele. Meanwhile, Dundee boss Paul Hartley continued the recent referee-related theme by admitting he had been irked by some of Calum Murray’s calls last night. ‘There were a couple of decisions that we weren’t happy with,’ said Hartley, who saw McAlister score what proved a consolation goal in the 87th minute. ‘Some of the decisions were quite bizarre. ‘We understand that they have a tough job in high-pressure games. We had one in the first half and the referee gave offside and the linesman didn’t. He made a mistake and he admitted that to me at half-time. ‘Overall, I thought we were good. We just lacked a little cutting edge. If we had scored the goal 10 or 15 minutes previously we would have had them worried. ‘Two set-pieces have done us in. I thought we worked well, we were well organised and there was good discipline to our performance. Celtic have quality throughout their team.’","Josh Meekings was given a retrospective one-match ban for a handball .

The proof that City have belief in English players was evident in Monday night’s FA Youth Cup final where four of their starting line-up against Chelsea were born in Manchester. Another two have lived there from a young age. Manuel Pellegrini looked on with interest at City’s Academy Stadium. Yet, while those fledglings carry much promise for the future, the fallen Premier League champions have a more immediate problem: they need eight homegrown players for their first-team squad next season to meet guidelines set out by the Premier League and are in danger of losing at least four. Manchester City will ask about Raheem Sterling's availability even if Liverpool are likely to refuse to sell . Manuel Pellegrini watched City's academy in their FA Youth Cup final against Chelsea on Monday . The Premier League champions are also interested in signing Danny Ings (left) and Jay Rodriguez (right) Frank Lampard, Scott Sinclair and Micah Richards will all leave while Richard Wright is expected to follow, and James Milner will decide his fate at the end of the season. Dedryck Boyata and John Guidetti are also ready to move. Milner’s issue is not about money but understood to be about how many games he starts. He has figured in 27 Premier League matches this season but started just 14. The possibility of him departing means City have had to redress their buying strategy. Their track record of buying British has been questionable when you consider the impact made by Jack Rodwell, Sinclair and Adam Johnson. Further question marks have since been placed alongside recruitment decisions of last summer after City floundered in the Champions League and the domestic competitions. Indeed, the pressure is on all investments to make them a stronger Champions League proposition. Sporting director Txiki Begiristain wants Paul Pogba of Juventus, Kevin de Bruyne from Wolfsburg and took a flight to Munich yesterday to watch Porto attacker Yacine Brahimi and his team-mate Alex Sandro, a left back. They want young, hungry potentially world-class players but they also need at least some of them to be homegrown. Ross Barkley could be a City player next season but Everton want at least £50m for the midfielder . Club chiefs will not compromise on quality and they are also interested in foreign stars including Paul Pogba . For that reason, City have to ask about Raheem Sterling even if Liverpool are likely to refuse to sell him. They have discussed signing Burnley forward Danny Ings — even though he doesn’t want to be a peripheral figure — and Jay Rodriguez of Southampton, who will soon be fit again. His clubmate James Ward-Prowse is another promising talent admired by City. Everton’s Ross Barkley and John Stones are others constantly mentioned but here lies City’s problem: Everton would want at least £50million for Barkley. It is a figure that has made City balk. As coach Manuel Pellegrini protested: ‘It’s important to have English players. Can you sign them? To improve this squad, you’re talking players you can’t get. Either they don’t exist or clubs won’t sell.’ The search will intensify once City finish the season but the task will only get tougher. FA chairman Greg Dyke said it was ‘depressing’ to see City win the Premier League with just two Englishmen in their side last year and intends to introduce stricter rules on homegrown players from 2016. Pellegrini, if he's in charge next year, will need eight homegrown players for the first-team squad next season . James Milner was one of six homegrown players on their squad list this year, but could leave in the summer . He wants to phase them in over four years but it would mean players, irrespective of nationality, will have to be with their club from 15 to qualify as homegrown; the number of non-homegrown players in each 25-man squad is to be reduced from 17 to 13 and at least two homegrown players must be club-trained. Under those guidelines, City’s Gael Clichy and Dedryck Boyata would no longer be classed as homegrown. ‘I think it is important for big teams to bring in the best players, that is the most important thing,’ said Pellegrini. ‘I think about the academy we must be patient. This club built all these things because young players are important. ‘Maybe it is not always easy for young players, especially in big teams, to play in the professional squad but I am sure in the future we will have important players to come from the academy and will be part of our squad.’ While that wait goes on, City have no option but to put trust in their chequebook.","Manchester City will make signing English players a priority this summer .

"Cheltenham Town have two games to preserve their Football League status - and manager Gary Johnson has revealed one of the techniques he is using to try and bring the best out of his players. When Johnson took over as manager of the League Two club on March 30, he wrote 'I promise to do all I can to keep Cheltenham Town in the league' on an A3 sheet of paper and asked his players to put their signature on it. 'They all signed it,' Johnson said to the BBC. 'Some signed it and meant it, and some signed it and didn't mean it. Cheltenham Town manager Gary Johnson got every payer to pledge to give his all when he took over . Cheltenham were beaten by Northampton in their last game and have two games left to try and stay up . 'When you come to this stage of the season you need everyone to give everything for the cause,' Johnson added. 'You also need team-mates you can rely on. The lads that are here need to know they can rely on the others - and if they can't rely on some then you have to move them on.'

"Mauricio Pochettino insists he will not flood Tottenham's first team squad with players from the academy next season despite the success of his young stars. Harry Kane, Nabil Bentaleb and Ryan Mason, who are all products of Spurs' youth system, have taken giant strides in the senior set-up this season. Their success has led to calls for more youngsters to be promoted through the club, but Pochettino says he will cautious in his approach to blooding more youngsters. Mauricio Pochettino has questioned the logic of blooding more academy players based on past success . Nabil Bentaleb (left) has forged a strong partnership with Ryan Mason, while Harry Kane has been prolific . 'We need to be careful with that. Because Kane, Mason and Bentaleb are good this season, now we need to put all academy players in the team?,' said Pochetino. 'It's important to understand this is important for the club because it's our identity and philosophy and they can translate this passion for the club - but not because we need to show we are the best academy in the world. 'We need to be careful and work hard, we have fantastic staff, and the head of the academy John McDermott, but we need to analyse and be careful with the young players. 'Kane, Mason and Bentaleb are very important players in the team but it is not only these three are who very important for the team this season.' Meanwhile, Pochettino insists it is Hugo Lloris' ambition to play Champions League football with Tottenham after he was linked with a move away. Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has previously spoken of his desire to play in the Champions League . It has been suggested that the Frenchman would consider his future this summer if the club fail to finish in the top-four, a scenario which looks virtually certain. But Pochettino added: 'There's been no change from six months ago when we spoke about the rumour. Hugo wants to play the Champions League here for Tottenham and these rumours are nothing true. He is happy here and wants to reach the Champions League with Tottenham that is his dream.'","Mauricio Pochettino won't continue blooding youngsters unless approach is merited .

"Two goals within ninety seconds of each other was enough to spark an outbreak of fear and loathing rarely seen on this side of the Mersey. After more than two years of inexorable decline the patience of Tranmere's faithful finally snapped when Oxford moved decisively ahead, in an effortless manner reminiscent of the previous Saturday's Boat Race. The loathing was directed mainly at manager Micky Adams, who was announced on Sunday morning to have left the club by 'mutual consent'. The Tranmere players look down after the final whistle, as the prospect of relegation looms large . This is how it ends in football sometimes: standing in the dugout having a season ticket thrown in your face by an incandescent supporter, who you then see given a standing ovation by some sections upon being escorted out. The fear involves dropping out of the Football League a week on Saturday after 94 years of membership, something which provoked an angry demonstration by some 150 supporters outside the gates afterwards. Adams departs with two games to go and after a 3-0 defeat against a thoroughly professional Oxford side the Wirral's only professional sports outfit are one point behind Cheltenham and two behind Hartlepool. Bitter ironies abound. Relegation to the National League – the grand-sounding new title for the Conference but don't be fooled – may partly be down to Prenton Park legend and ex-manager Ronnie Moore, sacked by the club last season for a minor betting offence, and now masterminding Hartlepool's unlikely survival. And it could all happen under the ownership of former FA Chief Executive Mark Palios, knowledgeable football man and esteemed former Tranmere player who took over the club late last summer. Kemar Roofe celebrates scoring, as a professional Oxford side eased past sorry Tranmere . The battle between Barnet and Bristol Rovers to win automatic promotion to the Football League will go down to the last game. Barnet, who lead the Conference by one point, have a home game against mid-table Gateshead on Saturday while Rovers face a potentially more difficult match at home against fourth from bottom Alfreton, who almost certainly need to win themselves to avoid being relegated. Rovers looked as if they would head the table after the weekend’s games but conceded a goal with two minutes left to draw 1-1 at Dover. That put Barnet, who dropped out of the Football League two seasons ago, in the driving seat after a 1-1 draw away to Kidderminster. Grimsby are guaranteed a play-off spot, but one of Eastleigh, Forest Green and Macclesfield will miss out. It all seemed such a good idea at the time. Nobody questioned his judgement in October when, with the team bottom of the table, he replaced the inexperienced Rob Edwards with a seasoned operator like Adams. There was the odd dead cat bounce, but six months on they are still bottom after failing to keep a clean sheet for nineteen consecutive matches. The Mersey ferry displays a quicker turning circle than that shown by the home defence for the two killer goals that came just after half-time, but then a cause of that may be a lack of familiarity among players. A staggering 52 have been called up to first team duty this season. Adams played the selection and recruitment game like a man on the fruit machine, continually pulling the handle in the hope that the right combination would come up in alignment. The latest loan signing has been young Everton winger George Green who, when pulled off on Saturday after 60 minutes, could be seen haranguing some of his team-mates on the bench. It was not long after full-time that you could catch assistant manager Alan Rogers, part of a distinguished list of former Tranmere players who graduated to a higher level, stripping the paint from the dressing room walls. Micky Adams has left the club by mutual consent, with Tranmere bottom of the league with two games to go . Rogers – now in charge for the next fortnight – then had to deny that Adams's decision to dodge the media was of any significance. He then professed himself 'dumbfounded' by the team's performance. And so it unravels in desperate times. They had actually competed gamely in the first half, but were overwhelmed by anxiety when getting anywhere near the goal. 'It's not acceptable,' he said. 'We just don't look like scoring a goal. The players have got to start taking some responsibility. It's an easy option pointing fingers at the manager but the players have got to look at themselves, have they done enough? The answer is no. I was a player. You've got to stand up and be counted.' Marc Laird, well-travelled journeyman and among those fighting for his career, did not try to shift the blame onto the management. He just about summed up the sense of disbelief saying: 'It's a big club, when I joined in the summer I never imagined that we would be where we are.' The prospect of dropping out of the 92 is something uniquely grim in English football, especially for a club of this heritage, who shortly after joining the league gave a debut to 16 year-old local lad Dixie Dean. It was only in January 2013 that they stood on top of League One and early in the last decade reached the League Cup final plus three FA Cup sixth rounds. But they do not have to look far for examples of how there is no easy road back in the event of relegation. Aside from Southport and Chester there is Wrexham, not far across the Welsh border and a decent sized club, who fell out of the league in 2008 and have yet to return. There is a long trip to Plymouth next Saturday and then a last home game against Bury. The unpalatable odds are that the next stop after that could be somewhere like Braintree or Dover.","Tranmere on brink of relegation from League Two with two games to play .

"Manager Micky Adams has left Tranmere by mutual consent with just two games of the season to play. Rovers suffered a fourth consecutive defeat on Saturday, leaving them bottom of Sky Bet League Two and two points adrift of safety. Adams failed to show for his post-match press conference after the 3-0 loss by Oxford while supporters demonstrated outside the ground, calling for the manager to leave. Those fans got their wish on Sunday, with the club confirming the news in a statement on their official website. Tranmere manager Micky Adams has left his role at Prenton Park following his side's defeat by Oxford . Fans of the League Two side called for Adams to leave the club after their 3-0 loss on Saturday afternoon . It read: 'We thank Micky for his work at Tranmere Rovers having taken over the club at a difficult time and wish him all the best for the future. 'The focus of the first team and everybody at the club is now on the fight to the finish with a game at Plymouth Argyle on Saturday April 25 when three points could lift them above both Hartlepool United and Cheltenham Town.' Adams joined the club in October, with Rovers sitting bottom of the table after 12 games. The former Leicester manager, who sat in the stands for the 2-0 defeat by Oxford in October before officially taking charge, lost just two of his first 13 games at the helm. Tranmere reached the third round of the FA Cup, where they were beaten 6-2 by Barclays Premier League side Swansea, but a five-match unbeaten run in the league around the game saw them end January in 17th. But since then, Adams has overseen just two wins in 17 games and a run of four games without even scoring.

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has claimed no club has made an offer for Aaron Cresswell, and that the left back would be better off continuing his development at West Ham amid rumoured interest from Chelsea and Manchester City. Cresswell, 25, has been a consistent performer for the Hammers since signing from Ipswich for £2million last summer, making 32 Premier League appearances and scoring twice in his debut top-flight season.

What will happen in the summer, we will wait and see. ‘I have even heard somebody said we have put a £25m buyout on him. That’s the first I know, I haven’t heard anything from myself or through owners to say “well, if somebody wants AC they would have to pay 25m.”’ Despite Cresswell’s smooth negotiation of the step up to the Premier League from the Championship, Allardyce firmly believes he would be better served staying with the east London side next season. Upton Park boss Sam Allardyce (centre) believes Cresswell would be better off staying to develop his game . ‘There’s no doubt about that, because he’s year one in the Premier League.

His challenge is to continue to work as harder than he has this year, not to rest on his laurels, to think that he’s here. ‘We have seen players do that and then year two more of a disaster than his impressive first year.

"It was ten minutes short of 1am when Javier Hernandez left the Santiago Bernabeu last night. He did so beaming from ear to ear, admitting that he had seen the tweets from his Manchester United team-mates congratulating him on scoring what he called ‘one of the most important goals of my life’. Not everyone had been as complimentary as Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney, with Sky pundit Thierry Henry criticizing him for not immediately running to Cristiano Ronaldo who played the ball to him for the goal. Javier Hernandez (left) scores to send Real Madrid into the Champions League semi-final . Hernandez struck in the 88th minute to send Madrid through and fierce rivals Atletico Madrid out . Marca (left) say Hernandez scored 'the goal of his life' while AS praises 'Chicharito' for winning the tie . To pick up on that and not on the out-pouring of elation is to not understand just how much the Mexican striker has toiled for the last two seasons desperate for a chance to do what he feels he does best – score big goals in big games. ‘It was a great assist [from Ronaldo]’ he said after the match once the adrenalin levels that sent him sprinting towards the Real Madrid supporters behind the stadium’s south goal, had subsided. Despite starting only seven of the fifty games Real Madrid have played this season Hernandez has wriggled his way into the affections of the club’s supporters much and on three occasions, he got himself into goalscoring positions on Wednesday night. With the first two opportunities he snatched at the chance – shooting woefully into the side netting in the first half with Ronaldo and Isco better placed, and pulling another shot across the face of the goal in the second period. But when he hit the target with the third opportunity the stadium responded. His name echoed around all four sides of the ground and that is not something afforded lightly to any player in their first campaign. There was nothing special about the finish but getting there, to apply it when for the previous 88 minutes he had run himself into the ground does deserve credit and he had around 80,000 spectators wanting to thank him personally at the end. Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) provided a splendid assist for Hernandez's goal in the Champions League . Hernandez celebrates Madrid's victory with team-mate Ronaldo after the final whistle . Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick led the tributes to Hernandez on Twitter after the game . The Spanish radio journalists who mobbed him as he emerged from some post-match physiotherapy, all wanted to ask him about the last great Mexican striker to wear the white shirt, Hugo Sanchez. With a goals-per-minutes ratio that is better than Karim Benzema’s, there are even claims he should be starting more games. He replaced the Frenchman last night because of a knee injury that may yet sideline him for another couple of games. Once the euphoria of a last gasp winner subsides, Benzema’s extra quality has to be recognized and ‘El Chicharito’s’ place will eventually be back on the bench. In the longer-term he could satisfy himself in the knowledge that injuries will always present him with chances like last night. But he wants to be playing regularly and that will mean at the end of the season, when he returns to United, it will be to seek a new permanent deal elsewhere. ‘He has suffered’ said Carlo Ancelotti after the game. ‘He deserved the goal because he has never given in. He always trains well and he always gives everything when he plays. It’s a great reward for him.’ Had the 88th minute strike not come and Atletico held on to win on penalties, Ancelotti would have been criticized for his faith in the Mexican and the ‘Little Pea’ might have played his last minutes for Madrid with only the league left to contest. Some believe Hernandez should start more often ahead of Karim Benzema, who currently has a knee injury . Hernandez missed a couple of chances before scoring, but his persistence eventually paid off for Madrid . Real's players celebrate after Hernandez's late goal secured progress to the Champions League semi-final . As it is Madrid still have nine games to play and he will play his part. He has already written himself a little piece of Madrid history and reminded everyone what he can do. No wonder he ran straight to supporters to wildly celebrate; no wonder he didn’t want to leave the stadium last night.","Javier Hernandez got Real Madrid's Champions League winner against Atletico Madrid .

"Rafael Benitez has received fresh criticism of his waistline ahead of Napoli's crucial Serie A fixture with Sampdoria this weekend, as the quest for a UEFA Champions League place reaches a crescendo in Italy. The Spaniard has been linked with the managerial job at Sampdoria after it emerged that Sinisa Mihajlovic - the current Blucerchiati boss - is being lined up to replace Benitez at Napoli.

Paulo Sousa's not going to be Sampdoria's next coach, it will be [Italian comedy actor] Lino Banfi.' Sampdoria travel to face Napoli on Sunday trailing Benitez's side by three points, but Ferrero said he would rather keep hold of the Serbian Mihajlovic, who has guided the Genoa-based club from relegation candidates to European contenders in 18 months. 'Napoli would not be taking a step backwards if they were to get Mihajlovic,' Ferrero said. 'I'm talking from my experience and I can say that Sinisa's a man of great sensitivity, a great professional and a great worker. 'He arrives two hours before training and he leaves two hours after. Above everything, he's got incredible ability and if he does leave, then I'm sure whoever gets him will be hitting the jackpot.

"Napoli coach Rafa Benitez on Wednesday quashed speculation that he is to return to the Premier League to take charge Manchester City. The former Liverpool and Chelsea manager has yet to sign a contract extension with Napoli, with his current deal ending this summer. It has been rumoured Benitez could replace Manuel Pellegrini at the helm of City at the end of the campaign. Napoli boss Rafael Benitez has dismissed reports linking him to the Manchester City job . The Spaniard is out of contract at the end of the season and has yet to agree an extension with Napoli . However, Benitez said to the Italian press: 'I have not had contacts with City, unlike what I've read in England. 'I have spoken to the (Napoli) president via messages but we have not been able to meet due to our busy playing schedule in order to evaluate the business plan. 'Now our focus is on matters on the pitch.' Benitez joined Napoli in the summer of 2013 and led the Naples outfit to the Coppa Italia and third place in Serie A in his first season in charge.

"Salford assistant coach Ian Watson is poised to come out of his playing retirement at the age of 38 to answer an SOS from the Red Devils. Watson, whose last game was as player-coach in the Championship for Swinton last June, has stepped up his training ahead of Sunday's home game against Castleford after Salford lost a fourth player to suspension and three more to injury. ""It's a definite possibility that we might need to call on Ian,"" head coach Iestyn Harris said. ""He's been training and is ready to answer the call if need be."" Salford assistant coach Ian Watson is poised to come out of his playing retirement at the age of 38 . Salford are without Rangi Chase, Weller Hauraki, Cory Paterson and Darrell Griffin through suspension, while scrum-half Michael Dobson (knee), centre Junior Sa'u and winger Ben Jones-Bishop (leg) were all injured in Saturday's 22-18 Challenge Cup fifth-round defeat at Leigh, joining Josh Griffin, Tommy Lee, Jason Walton and brothers Jordan and Adam Walne on the sidelines. Salford recently signed veteran hooker Wayne Godwin on loan from Dewsbury and this week borrowed Oliver Gildart and James Greenwood from Wigan but Harris is still thought to be down to just 17 fit players. If Watson plays against the Tigers at the AJ Bell Stadium, he would become the oldest player currently in Super League, taking over from Salford's former Leeds and Warrington forward Adrian Morley, who turns 38 next month. The record for the oldest player in Super League is held by Australian Steve Menzies, who was 39 when he ended his career at Catalans Dragons at the end of the 2013 season. Watson, who made 41 Super League appearances as a half-back with Salford in 1997 and 2002, brought up the 500th appearance of his career in March 2014, a total that included a record-equalling 30 caps for Wales and took in spells with Widnes, Rochdale, Oldham, Halifax and Leigh.","Ian Watson is set to come out of playing retirement at the age of 38 .

"John Helm was commentating on Bradford City’s game against Lincoln City when the fire broke out and still struggles to listen to his description of that fatal day. Here he gives his insight into what caused the blaze. It was a day I have often tried to forget, but it was the one I must always remember. Approaching the 30th anniversary of the Bradford City fire, it was inevitable I would be asked to recall the horrific images from a match I was commentating on for Yorkshire Television. What I did not expect was for someone to suggest the fire may not have been an accident, as Martin Fletcher has done with his book Fifty-Six, the Story of the Bradford Fire. The tragic fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . Martin lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind — any bitterness would be understandable — but from everything I have been told there isn’t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately. On the contrary, I remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started. Detective Inspector Raymond Falconer actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire. This corroborates what I was told at the time by the coroner. He said it was believed the fire had been started by a man, visiting this country from Australia, but his name was never revealed. Without making allegations against the club’s chairman at the time Stafford Heginbotham, there is inference by implication in the book — with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased Heginbotham. As members of his own family were seated in the stand that day, and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later, it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson. I find it abhorrent that Stafford Heginbotham’s family are being subjected to this unseemly inference at a time when people are still grieving and paying their respects three decades on from the most horrendous day of their lives. There isn’t a shred of evidence to suggest anything other than a terrible human tragedy. It should also never be forgotten that Heginbotham twice saved Bradford City from extinction. As son James said to me: ‘He put that club above everything else, including family and business.’ A memorial at Valley Parade pays tribute those who died  in the devastating blaze almost 30 years ago . We all have our memories of a day that still sends a shudder up my spine. I cannot bear to watch the footage. If I hear my voice describing the tragedy as it unfolded I have to leave the room. Many of the 54 Bradford and two Lincoln fans who lost their lives, choked to death with inhalation of fumes. The smell was of acrid tar. As a Bradfordian myself I knew many of those fleeing for their lives, as I attempted to describe the scenes without becoming over-emotional. Thirty years on we try to forget but we must always remember. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","John Helm was commentating on the game the day the fire broke out .

"Twickenham will stage a thunderous collision between two French juggernauts in 13 days’ time, although Toulon’s crusade to win an unprecedented third successive European title nearly stalled at Stade Velodrome on Sunday. On this faltering, unconvincing evidence, the holders of the last Heineken Cup face a mammoth task if they are to stop Clermont Auvergne from claiming the inaugural Champions Cup. Bernard Laporte’s stellar side didn’t come to life until this dismal encounter went into extra-time and they were only galvanised once they had been reduced to 14 men, when Ali Williams was sin-binned for taking out Devin Toner in the air. Toulon winger Bryan Habana races away for a decisive try in extra-time against Leinster . Habana intercepted Ian Madigan's long pass to race away unopposed at Stade Velodrome . Leinster full back Rob Kearney beats Toulon flanker Juan Fernandez Lobbe to a high ball in the first-half . Instead of being undermined by the loss of the ex-All Blacks lock, Toulon scored the crucial points while he was off the field. Their victory was founded on the composed goal-kicking of their Welsh Lion at full-back, Leigh Halfpenny, who finished with 20 points from six penalties and a conversion. Leinster attempted to capitalise on their numerical advantage and it backfired in the 90th minute as Ian Madigan’s long pass was intercepted by Bryan Habana and the Springbok wing stormed clear to for the game’s only try. That the one fleeting flicker of creativity stemmed from an error was fitting. The Irish province wouldn’t go quietly and when Sean O’Brien went over from a close-range lineout drive, they were back in the hunt with five minutes remaining, but it wasn’t to be. So, the climax of the new continental tournament will have a familiar feel. Toulon vs Clermont is an all-French repeat of the 2013 Heineken Cup Final in Dublin, which the Cote d’Azur club won despite being dominated by Clermont for much of the game. Last year, they gave Jonny Wilkinson the perfect career sign-off with another triumph in Cardiff – where Saracens were dispatched – and now they are closing in on a hat-trick. But there was no swagger about them on Sunday, or any sustained power surges for that matter. It was unusually wet by the Mediterranean and the conditions made handling difficult, but that didn’t account for the sheer deluge of fumbles made by both sides. As a showcase of Europe’s elite event, this stop-start contest left much to be desired. For all the effort and commitment, there was no fluency or cohesion, no rhythm or flow. The teams simply took it in turns to launch a raid and either spill the ball or concede a turnover. Leinster centre Madigan fires over one of his five successful penalties against Toulon . English referee Wayne Barnes became the pantomime villain of the home supporters for repeatedly penalising their idols, but he had every right to on several occasions, particularly when Xavier Chiocci, the Toulon loosehead prop, was being dismantled by Ireland tighthead Mike Ross in the scrum. As an occasion, this was several notches below the blood-and-thunder epic between Clermont and Saracens in St Etienne 24 hours earlier. Clermont’s ‘Yellow Army’ – or ‘Jaunards’ – created a raucous, partisan atmosphere which wasn’t matched here by the Toulon hordes. There was a healthy crowd in excess of 35,000, but that was a long way short of capacity and the noise was often restricted to boos for the officials. Even the Mexican Waves late on were half-hearted. Leinster blindside Jordi Murphy does brilliantly to get up and disrupt a Toulon lineout . Still, it was not all grim. Steffon Armitage made his trademark breakdown impact after coming on as a replacement and Halfpenny’s class stood out throughout – not just as a goal-kicker but, crucially, in the way he handled the aerial onslaught with aplomb. The Wales idol had landed four penalties in normal time but saved his best for the end of the first half of extra-time – just before Habana’s try – when he struck from halfway, with inches to spare. Afterwards, he reflected on the prospect of a first appearance in Europe’s elite final, saying: ‘It’s what I grew up dreaming about. Toulon No 8 Chris Masoe makes a strong run as Leinster scrum half Isaac Boss tries to make the tackle . ‘I grew up watching European Cup Finals and you work hard day-in, day-out to be involved in big games like that. For me, coming to Toulon with the success they’ ve achieved and the ambition they have, I wanted to be part of that. I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity.’ Toulon were fortunate that he took his opportunities on Sunday. It meant that their shortcomings were not critically exposed and they will surely rouse themselves to far greater heights for the final. Their showdown with Clermont will shake Twickenham to its foundations. These twin French giants are the dominant forces of the era - the rest of Europe are chasing their shadows.

"Sir Oliver Popplewell, the judge who conducted the 1985 Bradford fire public inquiry, says police should look at eight other fires allegedly connected to the then club chairman to 'see if there was anything sinister'. A new book claims the fire at Bradford's Valley Parade stadium was one of at least nine blazes at businesses owned by or associated with the club's then chairman Stafford Heginbotham, who died in 1995. Popplewell's inquiry concluded that the cause was an accident probably started by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand.

But he said: 'I don't think it's going to affect what we decided but I think it is important from a public point of view that the police look at the other fires and see if there was anything sinister. It is a remarkable number. 'I think it's important to satisfy people's minds that the other fires are unconnected.'

"Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe says new allegations surrounding the Bradford City fire in 1985 which claimed 56 lives do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster. A new book claims that the fire at Valley Parade was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned by or associated with the club's then chairman Stafford Heginbotham, who died in 1995. Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City council at the time of the tragedy, says he knew Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by high court judge Mr Justice Popplewell that the fire was an accident. A memorial to the people who dies in the 1985 fire at Valley Parade . The judge ruled the fire was started by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand. Sutcliffe said: 'The inquiry by Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that it was caused by a discarded cigarette in what was an old wooden stand and I have not heard anything to convince me that that was not the case. 'Stafford Heginbotham was one of those football club chairmen of which there were many at the time who flew by the seat of his pants. I was deputy leader of the city council at the time and he was did fly by the seat of his pants when it came to paying the bill for the police and so on. The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . 'But I think the inquiry was very thorough at the time and I don't think there needs to be another because of this. I do not believe there was any sort of cover-up and in fact the inquiry led to a lot of recommendations on stadiums that together with the Taylor report came up with the right answers for football. 'There will always be speculation but I just think it was a tragedy that cost the lives of 56 people and injured many more, and has scarred the city for many years.' The new claims are contained in the book 'Fifty-Six - The Story of the Bradford Fire' by Martin Fletcher, who was 12 at the time and escaped with his life from the blaze but lost three generations of his family including his father and brother. The book, published on Thursday and being serialised in The Guardian, does not make any direct allegations but Fletcher says Heginbotham's history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £27million in today's terms, warranted further investigation. Then-Bradford chairman Stafford Heginbotham (left) with Mr Justice Popplewell in front of the burned stand . Gerry Sutcliffe does not believe a new inquiry into the Bradford fire is justified . 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?' he asks. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure. 'However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty's Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.' Fletcher's 11-year-old brother was the fire's youngest victim while his father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63, also died. The disaster occurred at a time, according to Fletcher's evidence, when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it wo uld cost £2million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford's promotion from the old Third Division. Yet this did not feature in the Popplewell Inquiry, which held its investigation only three weeks after the fire. Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. The book is released on April 16. Nine days later a minute's silence is due to be held at every Premier League and Football League match to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary.","Gerry Sutcliffe does not believe there should be a fresh inquiry into the fire .

"For Stuart McCall, the memories of May 11, 1985 will never fade. As Bradford City celebrated promotion from the old English Third Division, a day of joy quickly became one of devastation as a fire ripped through the timber main stand at Valley Parade towards the end of the first half, claiming 56 helpless victims. Just 21 years of age, McCall returned to his car, only to find the door handle was burning hot because it had been parked so near to the blaze. Upon learning his father, Andy — one of a large group of McCall’s relatives at the game — had been badly burned and was missing, the young midfielder set off frantically through the streets of Bradford. The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . The 30th anniversary is approaching since the tragic fire that killed 56 people at Bradford's ground in 1985 . Still wearing his boots and kit, he was finally reunited with his father in Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield. Those hours represented the worst of his life but given that other families lost loved ones that day, McCall has always declared himself and his father the fortunate ones. So how would the Rangers manager — who donated money from his 2002 testimonial to the Bradford burns unit that cared for his father and so many others — react to bombshell claims this week that mere bad luck had perhaps played no role in the disaster? A book written by Martin Fletcher, a Bradford fan who lost three generations of his family in the blaze, says the incident was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned or associated with the club’s then chairman Stafford Heginbotham, in the previous 18 years, resulting in huge insurance claims. In his book Fifty-Six, published on Thursday, Fletcher believes the fire was not an accident and says he and his family are no longer willing to ‘live the myth’. Fire engulfs Valley Parade on a day nobody can ever forget as 56 were killed at the football stadium . A police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as he runs in front of the stand on fire . From McCall’s annual visits to the club’s memorial services, he knows Fletcher, who lost brother, Andrew (11) — the youngest victim of the tragedy — as well as his father John (34), uncle Peter (32) and grandfather Eddie (63). He also knows Heginbotham and attended the funeral of the ‘great chairman’ in 1995. To McCall, the verdict of inquiry judge Sir Oliver Popplewell, who declared the fire had probably been started by a stray match, cigarette or pipe tobacco slipping through gaps on the floor on to a build-up of litter, remains the most likely cause of the tragedy. ‘I get so caught up in this job managing Rangers that I don’t always see the news but someone told me the other day that the Bradford story had been on Sky,’ said McCall on Friday. ‘And then my missus mentioned it to me later that night when I got home. ‘I know the (Fletcher) family. I go to every memorial that I can and you meet the same people at these things. So I know the lad, who was very young at the time (of the disaster), has brought out this book. Then-Bradford chairman Stafford Heginbotham (left) with Mr Justice Popplewell in front of the burned stand . A 12-year-old Martin Fletcher is comforted by his mother Susan in 1985 after the Bradford Fire disaster . ‘But I also knew Stafford. He was a great chairman and, not for one second, do I believe it was deliberate. He has passed away now and I was at his funeral. ‘But I saw (Sir Oliver) Popplewell said the actual stand wasn’t even insured, so they didn’t get any money for it anyway. For me, that just blows the theory out of the water.’ McCall, who spent six years from 1982 to 1988 at Valley Parade, recalls one of his jobs in his early years was to clean the main stand. And he finds it hard to accept any foul play was behind the inferno. ‘I used to sweep that stand,’ he said. ‘There were little holes and as you swept up (bits of rubbish would fall down) but you never gave a thought to what was underneath. But, over the years, all this rubbish has built up and it needed one cigarette. It has gone down a gap and then tragedy has struck.’ Former Bradford player Stuart McCall does not believe the fire was anything other than an accident . On Saturday, McCall takes Rangers to Dumbarton where victory would leave the Ibrox side four points ahead with two games remaining. Should they win, Hibs, who play Falkirk in the Scottish Cup semi-final at lunchtime, would travel under pressure on Wednesday to face a Livingston side who are bottom of the table but enjoying a recent resurgence. And the Ibrox boss insists he is not overly concerned by statistics which show that Rangers have just one win in five on the road. ‘It’s all about the result at Dumbarton. It is a game we have to win, simple as that. It doesn’t matter how we do it. It is about the three points. McCall prepares his players for Saturday's Championship clash with Dunbarton . ‘I saw a stat that we have won only five games out of 15, which is true. But we have lost one in 12 and won four out of the last six. And one of those wins, at Hibs, was our best performance of the season away from home. So you can use stats in different ways.’ McCall also backed his captain Lee McCulloch, who has been the subject of criticism from Rangers fans in recent weeks. He was red-carded for elbowing Hearts striker Osman Sow and, on his return to the team after a two-match ban, Rangers dropped two points at Livvy. But McCall said: ‘Since I’ve been here, I would say the criticism has been unfair because he has not done a lot wrong. He is good in the dressing room and he is an important player for us.’","In 1985 the main stand of Bradford's Valley Parade caught fire, killing 56 .

"Negotiations to make a fight between Paul Smith and Andre Ward are set to be concluded this week, with the Liverpool super-middleweight set to meet one of boxing's biggest talents on June 20. Sportsmail understands discussions are virtually finalised for the summer showdown, with a formal announcement of the fight expected imminently. Elements of the deal are still being rubber-stamped and Ward’s WBA world title is unlikely to be on the line.

Smith's hope this time round will be that Ward, usually so slick and brilliantly accurate, has diminished through inactivity. The 31-year-old, an Olympic champion and winner of all 27 of his professional fights, has not fought since November 2013. That period of absence will add a fascinating dimension to a fight that will catch the attention of Froch, who would postpone retirement for a home rematch against Ward.","Paul Smith is set to face Andre Ward in Oakland, California on June 20 .

"Patrick Vieira has the backing of Manchester City players to replace Manuel Pellegrini should the club sack the under-fire manager.

"At first glance, the ingredients might look pretty normal: dates, sesame, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, and chocolate. But the last step of the recipe for the Jungle Bar might leave you a little squeamish: cricket flour, which is essentially crickets ground up into a powder. The bar itself is claimed to be a good source of iron and protein - owing to the crickets - but whether you’ll want to bite into one is another matter. Scroll down for video . An Icelandic duo has created a snack that is made using cricket flour. Called the Jungle Bar it also contains dates, sesame seeds and chocolate. Cricket flour is said to be a good source of protein and other nutrients. The duo hopes it will encourage people in the West to eat more insects . The Jungle Bar is being developed by Icelandic duo Búi Bjarmar Aðalsteinsson and Stefán Atli Thoroddsen through their company Crowbar Protein. On Kickstarter they are seeking £10,000 ($15,000) for the insect-powered protein bar. They previously rose to fame with their Fly Factory, a micro-factory that used larvae to create foods including chocolate cake and pâté. Ingredients . Dates, sesame, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, chocolate and cricket flour. Nutrition information . The bar is 50 grams (1.7 ounces), 200 calories, contains 8 grams of high quality protein (16 per cent of the bar) and has a shelf life of 1 year. The duo say that insects are a largely untapped source of nutrients in the Western world, and they hope their product could spark a change in diet habits. To make the bar, the team has cricket flour sent in, from farm-raised crickets that have been ground down. It is then mixed with the other ingredients to make the unusual bar. Cricket flour is useful because it contains a lot of minerals, vitamins and nutrients that are essential for the human body. It has a high protein content, and it’s full of iron, calcium, B-12 vitamin, and omega-3 and 6.

"Most people would run away if they saw a pile of soil and rubble creeping towards them as if it had a life of its own. But one Russian YouTuber captured the terrifying moment a stream of soil flowed down a bank next to a main road, crushing trees in its powerful path and leaving toppled power lines in its wake. The eerie phenomenon is called an 'earthflow' and is a rare type of landslide. A Russian YouTuber has captured the terrifying moment a stream of soil flowed down a bank next to a main road (pictured), crushing trees in its powerful path and leaving toppled power lines in its wake . Alexander Giniyatullin kept a remarkably steady hand filming the scary scene in the Kemerovo Region of Russia, which is thought to have happened at around 1pm on April 1, according to a blog post on the American Geophysical Union’s website. In the video, snow-covered soil can be seen sliding down the bank at the side of a road, which is thought to run between Novokuznetsk and Bolshaya Talda. The earthflow also blocked nearby railroad tracks  and caused power outages, but no one was hurt. Commenting on the post, a user called Michal said: ‘The landslide looks like it may have come from a large coal mine area.' Alexander Giniyatullin kept a remarkably steady hand filming the scary scene in the Kemerovo Region of Russia (shown by the red marker), which is thought to have happened at 1pm on April 1 . An earthflow is a type of landslide. It's a viscous flow of fine-grained materials, such as clay, sand and silt that have been saturated with water and moves downhill because of the pull of gravity. As the earthflow moves down a slope, it remains covered with any vegetation and typically leaves a bowl-shaped depression behind. Earthflows usually begin in a large basin on the upper part of a slope where debris and weathered material accumulate. They are usually triggered by heavy rainfall, so that when the debris becomes saturated with enough water, it starts flowing downhill. The speed of an earthflow can vary depending on the amount of water present and the angle of the slope and varies from 0.11 to 12.4 mph (0.17 to 20 km/h). As the earthflow gathers momentum, it can be seen crushing trees in its path, and the sound of crumbling soil and splintering wood can be heard in the video. The cameraman backs away as the material eerily creeps across the width of the road, where he was previously standing and it seems to spread along the bank at a walking pace. An earthflow is a viscous flow of fine-grained materials, such as clay, sand and silt that have been saturated with water and moves downhill because of the pull of gravity. As the earthflow runs down a slope, it remains covered with any vegetation and typically leaves a bowl-shaped depression behind. It is slower than a mud flow, which can cover villages beneath mud in minutes. Earthflows usually begin in a large basin on the upper part of a slope where debris and weathered material accumulate, - although this point cannot be seen in the video. As the earthflow gathers momentum, it can be seen crushing trees in its path (pictured) and the sound of crumbling soil and splintering wood can be heard . The speed of an earthflow can vary depending on the amount of water present and the angle of the slope and varies from being barely noticeable to relatively rapid, as seen in the video when a road becomes completely blocked (pictured) in a matter of minutes . Research suggests that rockfall son Mont Blanc (pictured) are caused by warming temperatures . Climbers have long suspected that hotter summers trigger rockfalls on the slopes of Mont Blanc in the French Alps. Now a study of 533 rockfalls reported by climbers or spotted on satellite images of the mountain since 2003, has bolstered the opinion that climate change is making popular routes up Europe's highest mountain more treacherous. Ludovic Ranavel of the University of Savoie at Le Bourget-du-Lac in the Alps, spotted a strong correlation between the number of rockfalls and air and rock temperatures on the slopes, New Scientist reported. He thinks that melting permafrost may be to blame, because it loosens rocks that were held in place with ice, causing them to fall. The expert revealed that 95 per cent of rockfalls around the mountain occur during between June and September - the hottest months of the year. Most begin in areas 10,170ft (3,100 metres) above sea level, close to the zone containing perma ice, he told the European Geosciences Union's general assembly in Vienna. As the Alps get hotter, the zone is thought to be receding, creating more rockfalls than before. They are usually triggered by heavy rainfall, so that when the debris becomes saturated with enough water, it starts flowing downhill. The video shows a stream of water running down the road as the debris falls down the slope, indicating the mass of soil is waterlogged. The speed of an earthflow can vary depending on the amount of water present and the angle of the slope, varying from being barely noticeable to relatively rapid, as seen in the video when a road becomes completely blocked in a matter of minutes. Experts at San Diego State University said speeds can range from 0.11 to 12.4 mph (0.17 to 20 km/h). In fact, it can take minutes or years for material to move down slops and earthflows can affect anything from a few metres of land, to several hectares. In the video, the flow of debris is quite fast and it’s possible to see industrial equipment toppled at the top of the slope, while trees are crushed beneath the moving earth and what appear to be power lines and pylons pulled down and dragged along by the moving mass of earth. The movement seems to speed up as the cameraman beats a hasty retreat down the road. When he pans back along the way he has come, the road is completely blocked by a debris that looks as if it is between one and two storeys high in places. Towards the end of the footage, the speed of the earthflow seems to decline, but it continues to creep across the road, to completely cross it.","Eerie earthflow was captured in the Kemerovo Region of Russia .

"Young women no longer compare themselves to celebrities in glossy magazines but fret about how they look on Facebook instead, according to a study. They use pictures on the social networking site to gauge their own appearance and see how they measure up against friends. Facebook consumes 40 per cent of the time young women spend online, psychologists at the University of New South Wales in Australia found. Comparison site: A study found women compared themselves to their friends on Facebook rather than celebrities in magazines . The study, of 150 college students and staff aged 17 to 25, found they read magazines ‘infrequently’ but checked Facebook every few hours. The women preferred Facebook as a means of judging themselves because they could compare their looks with peers similar to them and see how they had changed over time. The research comes the same week as an Australian mother received a poison pen letter from a Facebook friend because of her regular updates about her baby daughter. Jade Ruthven, 33, from Perth, was told she was  'p*****g a lot of people off' with her constant statuses about daughter Addison. Measuring up: Women aged 17 to 25 were found to judge themselves alongside pictures of friends rather than celebrities in magazines . She got her own back on the unidentified 'friends' by forwarding it onto comedian Em Rusciano - who shared it with her thousands of followers on social media. Writing in the journal Psychology Of Women Quarterly, researcher Jasmine Fardouly advised women at risk of low self-esteem to post fewer pictures of themselves online and avoid following people who upload them too frequently.","Australian study found women spend 40% of online time on Facebook .

"Samsung famously poked fun at Apple when it emerged its iPhone 6 Plus could bend out of shape in people's pockets. But now the South Korean firm is facing a 'bendgate' controversy of its own after a video emerged claiming to show a similar flaw on the Galaxy S6 Edge. The company has now responded with its own video, demonstrating a three-point bend test on both its Galaxy S6 models. Scroll down for video . A video has emerged showing Galaxy S6 Edge bending and shattering under 110lbs (50kg) of pressure. The video was released by third-party warranty firm SquareTrade, and has since been criticised by Samsung . 'We are confident that all our smartphones are not bendable under daily usage,' the company said in a statement. The comments and video were posted in response to findings from third-party warranty firm SquareTrade, which publicised that the Galaxy S6 Edge can bend and shatter under 110lbs (50kg) of pressure. It also tested the HTC One M9 both deformed and broke at 120lbs (54kg). 'Bendability may be good in the yoga studio, but it is not what you want in a mobile device,' said Jessica Hoffman, vice president of global communications for SquareTrade. 'Last fall's Bendgate caught many by surprise, but as manufacturers strive for larger screens on thinner devices, they can be more susceptible to bending or snapping. 'SquareTrade Labs' tests reveal that while the iPhone 6 Plus bends, the Galaxy S6 edge cracks under pressure. Samsung claims the tests conducted by SquareTrade was unfair as 110lbs (50kg) of pressure 'rarely occurs under normal circumstances.' 'The video assumes a very specific condition - 110lbf (50kgf),' the company said. The teardown shows, from the front, the screen, logic board holder, battery, logic board with processor, camera, rear case and antenna. It is a fascinating view of exactly what goes into a modern smartphone - and how Samsung does business. The Chipworks site has posted this amazing image revealing the internals of the firm's Galaxy S6, which goes on sale on April 10th. The internals reveal Samsung used more of its own chips to power the new Galaxy S6 smartphone than it did for the predecessor S5, according to an early teardown report, in a blow to U.S. chip supplier Qualcomm. Samsung is not only using its own Exynos mobile processor, as had been widely reported, but also decided to rely on its in-house semiconductor business to source other parts, including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips, Ottawa-based consultancy Chipworks said. Samsung is counting on its new flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge phones to help revive earnings momentum after a disappointing 2014. Strong sales of system chips such as its Exynos processor could also help boost earnings, analysts and investors say. The Galaxy S6 also comes with Samsung's Shannon modem chip, U.S. phone carrierAT&T said on its website. 'The normal force that generated when a person presses the back pocket is approximately 66lbf (30kgf). 'Our internal test results indicate that the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge are not bendable even under 79lbf (32kgf), which is equivalent to putting pressure to snap a bundle of five pencils at once.' Samsung added that the test done by SquareTrade 'does not show the strength of the back side.' It has now asked SquareTrade to do the test again on both the front and back sides of the device. Apple had to go to similar lengths during its own 'Bendgate' crisis, by allowing reporters into its labs to showcase iPhone 6 Plus durability tests. Samsung claims the tests conducted by SquareTrade was unfair as 110lbs (50kg) of pressure 'rarely occurs under normal circumstances.' Pictured is the smartphone after the test was conducted .

"The cringeworthy, yet strangely addicting footage of whiteheads being popped, cysts being ruptured and blackheads being extracted has turned a dermatologist into an internet sensation as thousands of people flock to her video channel to catch a glimpse of 'Dr Pimple Popper' in action. Dr Sandra Lee is dermatologist at the Skin Physicians & Surgeons practice in Upland, California, and a regular guest on The Doctors talk show, but online she is known simply as Dr Pimple Popper, a moniker she used when she started posting clips of her patients' extractions on her YouTube channel. The clips have earned her nearly 60,000 subscribers, as well as loyal fan base of zit squeezing enthusiasts on Reddit. 'I find this little subculture fascinating,' Dr Lee told Racked of her followers. 'I pop these things, and yeah they kind of make me feel good, they’re satisfying, but it’s not like I seek them out.' Scroll down for video . All in a day's work: Dermatologist Dr Sandra Lee, who known as Dr Pimple Popper online, shares videos of herself extracting her patients zits on her popular YouTube channel . Day job: Dr Lee, from Upland, California, can be seen using a comedone extractor to pop one of her patient's blemishes . Dr Lee explained that when a patient comes in she offers to tackle their blemishes in exchange for them allowing her to post the videos of the process online, while keeping the clips as anonymous as she can. And she noted that, despite the somewhat gruesome nature of her YouTube channel, 'nobody ever says no'. Before she shot to internet fame, Dr Lee's channel, used to only feature a selection of TV segments that she had done, only had a few thousand followers. However, when she joined Instagram, she started posting short clips of her actually treating patients, a decision which quickly garnered her much more interest, prompting her to start putting full-length clips up on YouTube, starting with a video of her extracting a man's blackheads. 'I didn’t realize how big it would be,' she said of the video, which has received more than 360,000 views since it was posted in December. Dr Lee explained that she was such an 'amateur' at the time; she barely knew anything about Reddit and was 'floored' when she learned that her video was being shared on a popular pimple popping subreddit. The experience opened her eyes to an entire community that she had no idea existed. The doctor, who is now well-known on the subreddit, said the people are 'really wonderful'. Big break: Dr Lee became an internet sensations after she posted this video of herself extracting a man's blackheads on YouTube. The clips was later shared on Reddit and helped her to earn a loyal fan base . But Dr Lee questions whether she is a 'true popper' because she doesn't actually enjoy watching people squeeze and poke their whiteheads and cysts on their own. 'I don’t watch any of the other videos,' she said. 'They all kind of gross me out! When they’re amateur, I don’t want to hear screaming, I don’t like that stuff.' But pimple popping has quickly become a key part of Dr Lee's occupation. In fact, it's basically the family business; both her father and her husband are dermatologists as well. According to Dr Lee the most popular types of popping are the extractions of blackheads and whiteheads, and she has now come to learn that there are two different varieties of video – ‘a soft pop and a hard pop'. 'Some people just like blackheads, it’s like soft porn, a soft pop,' she noted. 'And then there’s a hard pop, where people like more of a cyst.' In March, Dr Lee posted a 'best of soft pop' video montage has been viewed more than 500,000 since it was posted last month. 'I've been listening to you guys, and I hear that there are two general groups of you PimplePoppaholics: Some like the SoftPop, some prefer the HardPop!' she wrote in the description. 'Of course, some of you like it all, but I thought I would try to make as many of you happy as I can. Here's a Soft Pop Best Of... I'll have a HardPop Best Of later today for you. Enjoy! [sic]' Free time: The dermatologist, pictured in a selfie posted on her Instagram account, is now well-known among the pimple popping community on Reddit . Basic extraction: Dr Lee said videos of blackheads and whiteheads being removed (pictured) are most popular . And many commenters lauded Dr Lee for her rapport with her patients. Dr Lee, who uses her iPhone and iMovie to shoot and edit the videos, told Racked that she likes to show the 'human side' of her patients by having them share their back story. She said that her favorite clips are of a patient she calls 'Pop', who recently lost his wife to a 'chronic, painful sickness'. 'What's amazing is that what started as a video of my squeezing the blackheads on his nose has transformed into the wonderful feel-good human interest story,' she told Daily Mail Online. She continued: 'They were inseparable, and he has had trouble adjusting to his new life in an assisted living facility. He has both financial and emotional stress, and he tells a little of his story in his videos.' After hearing Pop's struggles, Dr Lee's YouTube and Reddit followers asked her to start him a GoFundMe page so they could help him financially. The page, which was started on April 15, has already already exceeded its $5,000 goal - raising $5,665 in just eight days. Family business: Dr Lee can be seen with her husband Dr Jeffrey Rebish, who is also a dermatologist . Addicting videos: Dr Lee can be seen extracting a blackhead from one of her patients . 'He knows a little about what is going on, but doesn't know yet how much people have donated to help him out in his current situation,' she explained. 'He would be shocked to hear that well wishes are coming from all over the world.' One commenter who made a donation noted: 'This gentleman reminds me of my grandpa. I wish him all the best, he is such a gentle soul. Lots of love from a French girl in the UK x [sic].' Dr Lee said she plans on visiting him in his new home and present him with all the cards, messages and money that people have given him next week. 'I can't wait to see how surprised and touched he will be,' she said. As for her extraction technique, Dr Lee told Racked that it's 'not completely sterile', but she uses clean gloves and a comedone extractor, which she said costs less than $20. Although she warned that people shouldn't pop their pimples because they can risk scarring, she admitted that she is guilty of squeezing her own zits at home. For people who absolutely have to pick, Dr Lee advised them to use a warm compress and prick the blemish with a sterile needle when it comes to a head. But she he added that she can't ensure anyone that they aren't going to scar when they take matters into their own hands. Dr Lee, who is also a skin cancer surgeon and a cosmetic surgeon, explained that she has posted videos of her doing other procedures, but people aren't as interested in them. 'People might construe that I’m addicted to this stuff, but I’m not,' she said of work as Dr Pimple Popper. 'This isn’t everything that I do. In fact, it’s a very small part.'","Dr Sandra Lee is a dermatologist at the Skin Physicians & Surgeons practice in Upland, California, and is a regular guest on talk show The Doctors .

Mrs Klein, 71, (pictured this week) said that the middle-schoolers who verbally attacker her 'didn't learn any lessons' on hearing news of one of the student's alleged bullying this week . When she was informed of the bullying incident, Mrs Klein told WHEC this week: 'They didn’t learn any lessons from the other ordeal. I don’t think they ever will.' She also said of the alleged attack: 'Why did you [alleged bullies] do that, what possessed you to be so mean? 'And now with this, it is really obscene what they did, and it's like it's progressing rather that regressing.' Greece Athena High School was reportedly investigating the bullying internally after the Snapchat video was reported by other students. WHEC reported that the alleged attack could be a matter for family court but because the students were minors it would not reach criminal court. Daily Mail Online was awaiting comment on Friday from school officials. The students involved in the bullying have not been identified for privacy reasons. One student involved in the recent bullying had three years ago verbally attacked Mrs Klein when he was a 7th-grader. The sickening video, which was uploaded to YouTube by a concerned third party, saw an outpouring of support for the elderly woman and she received donations of around $700,000. At one point, Mrs Klein turns to the teens and says with arms folded: ‘Unless you have something nice to say, don’t say anything at all.' One of the kids responded: ‘Shut the f*** up,’ and then asked why there is water on her face. ‘Are you sweating?’ the student asked. ‘No, I’m crying,’ Mrs Klein said.

At the six-and-a-half minute mark, a student said: ‘If I stabbed you in the stomach, my knife would f***** go through like butter, because it’s all f***** lard.’ After the bullying was made public, the students responsible apologized to Mrs Klein. She responded: 'I want (the kids) to make sure they never do this again to anybody. I would like them to be kept off the bus for a year, and be forbidden to play any sports, at least for a year.' She added: 'They each try outdo the other.

'It came about because people were always looking for more impressive haircuts, and somebody came up with the idea of shaping the dog like a hedge.' Pictures of doe-eyed dogs with their shapely new cuts have proved extremely popular online prompting more owners to seek out the custom salons. Many are now opting for the cuts simply to get more likes and shares on social media sites. Ms Yeh added: 'The dogs don't mind, and the owners keep coming back for more. This sort of haircut needs a lot more maintenance then the regular type. 'It is also not suitable for all breeds. The dog needs to have plenty of hair to play around with so that you can shape it around the face and body.' Willing customers? Two more recently-groomed pooches stare sad-eyed into the camera as they show off new hairstyles .

"An elderly man who was bitten by a crocodile while playing golf has defended the creature who attacked him, claiming the 1.2 metre reptile was more frightened than he was and that the spat was partially the golfer's own fault. The victim, John Lahiff has spoken out from his hospital bed at Cairns Base Hospital, swearing he will return to the green again after the nasty run-in with the crocodile at politician Clive Palmer's Port Douglas golf course. On Monday afternoon, the man in his 70s believes he accidentally stood on a sunbaking crocodile on the 11th hole at the Palmer Sea Reef Golf Course, causing the croc to swiftly retaliate.

'It's partly my fault ... for disturbing it while it was sunbaking,' he said. 'I think he got more of a fright than me. He's alright.' Mr Lahiff says he has no qualms about returning to the green, explaining he will be sure to steer clear of crocodiles in future and ensure he doesn't hit balls in the water.

"Nestled between a 65ft high snow cavern, the winding track of Murodo looks like track that could be on Mario Kart. However this steep-walled phenomena is located in Japan and attracts visits from thousands of tourists annually - with the number predicted to rise this year. The Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route opened to the public on today and allows tourists to view the spectacular snow-walled passageway along the 1000ft section. Walled wonder! The Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route opened for visitors today, with tourists marvelling at the 65ft high walls . The Murodo-daira area of Tateyama unsurprisingly experiences one of the heaviest snowfalls in the world, with the 65ft walls being created every year, and then melting by July. The impressive route opened in 1971 and usually draws about a million visitors every year although numbers have failed to reach that figure in the last few years. An estimated 910,000 flock to the frozen passage last year. It is hoped the March 14 opening of the sightseeing route operator Hokuriku Shinkansen Line, which connects Toyama Station with Tokyo Station, will help to bump the numbers back up to the million mark. The snowy phenomenon can be seen on the winding track of Murodo in Japan from April under it melts in the summer . The whole 37km route will be open until November but tourists can walk the walled wonder until it starts to melt in summer. Sights along the way include scenic landmarks such as Kurobe Dam, hot springs and the Hida Mountains. One of the most popular activities is to ascend the 9891ft high summit of Mount Tateyama, one of Japan's highest peaks. Today tourists followed to photograph the walls. Over a million people visit the walls every year, although this dropped to 910,000 last year . It is hoped that numbers can rise again to reach one million with the help of the sightseeing route operator Hokuriku Shinkansen Line opening last month . The sun shone as coaches of tourists flocked today for the opening of the short section . There are many views along the picturesque route include one of Japan's highest peak, the 9891ft high summit of Mount Tateyama .

"The age-old ghost town of Balestrino was captured in all its spooky wonder by a drone. Circling the picturesque landscape, the camera picked out the castle on the hill and surrounding depreciated buildings. The ancient Tuscan settlement, based 40 miles south east of Genoa, is shrouded in mystery with its origin and much of its history remaining unknown. Scroll down for video . Little is known about  the origin or history of the ancient Tuscan town that dates back to the 11th century A.D. Residents were forced to flee their homes in the town more than 60 years ago, with seismic instability noted as a main reason for the mass abandonment. A number of historical earthquakes, including one in 1887 that measured 6.7 on the Richter scale, caused severe damage to the settlement’s infrastructure. Dating back to the 11th century A.D., the town was formerly owned by the Benedictine abbey of San Pietro dei Monti in the 1100s. Seismic instability caused by earthquakes forced residents to flee their homes more than 60 years ago . An earthquake in 1887 measured 6.7 on the Richter scale and caused severe damage to the town’s infrastructure . A total of 800 inhabitants occupied the settlement, but by the 19th century most of the population had migrated from the area. A new town with the same name was built around a mile from its location and it 1953 the remaining population moved away from the settlement.

"What if they come fifth? Manchester City may have big plans to revamp the team in the summer, with Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri among the high-profile casualties, but what if Liverpool reel them in over the next six matches? City are four points clear and have a superior goal difference, which equates to five, yet undoubtedly they are vulnerable. For a team playing this poorly no run-in is easy and matches against the much-improved Aston Villa and even Queens Park Rangers can no longer be viewed with certainty. Yaya Toure (centre) has been a shadow of the player who fired Manchester City to last season's title . Manuel Pellegrini (second right) trudges off the pitch after Manchester City were beaten by Crystal Palace . Future opponents Swansea City and Southampton have little to play for — yet neither did Crystal Palace. The long-term plan is plain: Pep Guardiola, at his convenience, probably in 2016. Yet where will City be by then? An overhaul of playing personnel is due, but there has been scant evidence Manuel Pellegrini or director of football Txiki Begiristain are adept at identifying replacements. Eliaquim Mangala was supposed to be a different class to Joleon Lescott, but the Premier League’s most expensive defender cannot command a place in the team; Stevan Jovetic is no Carlos Tevez; Fernando no great upgrade on Gareth Barry or Nigel de Jong. Toure is in obvious decline, but his influence on City’s two title winning seasons was huge. Can Pellegrini and Begiristain be trusted to find a replacement capable of Toure’s impact? Not on the evidence of their recent signings. Jesus Navas? Martin Demichelis? Even Fernandinho is not as good as he was at Shakhtar Donetsk. The powers that be at City are waiting for Pep Guardiola to leave Bayern Munich for Manchester . And what if City are caught and condemned to the Europa League? What happens to this lavish rebuilding plan then? Take away the Champions League money and City’s financial capacity is not really much greater than Tottenham’s. Pellegrini has performed weakly this season and keeping him on another year while marking time for Guardiola is a giant gamble. Roberto Mancini got City into the elite in the nick of time with the financial fair play regulations about to be introduced. Locked outside, City’s capacity to improve would be severely limited. Would Guardiola even come in those circumstances? Great manager he may be, but not one that has shown any burning desire to work off the same budget as Everton.","Man City currently occupy final Champions League place .

"History buffs around the world will now be able to access a rarely-seen Napoleonic fort for the first time. The Welsh fort, which defended Britain from French invasion, will be joined to the mainland thanks to a 328ft footbridge across the sea. Known as St Catherine's Island, and home to the historic tower and gun rooms, can currently only be reached by crossing a beach during low tide, which happens for only six hours per day. A rarely-seen Napoleonic fort, off the coast of Tenby, will now be accessible via footbridge for the first time . But tomorrow, planners are due to approve a new footbridge, which will stretch more than 328 ft (100 metres). This connector will open up the island from the coast of Tenby, Pembrokeshire, for the first time. Developer Peter Prosser wants to make the island accessible to sightseers in order for them to explore the fort, built in 1867, and also for visitors to experience the stunning views. He said: 'Putting a bridge across is integral and that 100m is critical. 'The tides limit pedestrian access to the island to one week in two and for a maximum of six hours per day.' Currently, the fort on St Catherine's Island can only be reached by crossing a beach during low tide . The new visitor site will provide economic benefit, and also restore the historical building to its former glory . It's expected that the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority will approve the plans, which also include an on-site gift shop, security office and paths. Not only will the new visitor attraction provide economic benefit, but it will also protect the integrity of the historic building, which was home to a Napoleonic lookout post. Such a reopening is also noteworthy as it's has been closed to the public since the 1970s, when it was turned into a zoo. The soon-to-be-opened island also plans to host historical, nature and stargazing exhibitions in the future . Mr Prosser said that though the concept of a bridge has been approved, the specific design needs to be approved. Although there was only a small church on the 200m long island for generations, it was taken over by the War Office in the 1860s to house a fort. History lovers will know that Pembrokeshire was the scene of the last attempted invasion of Britain in 1797. The soon-to-be-opened island also hopes to host historical, nature and stargazing exhibitions in the future.","St Catherine's Island in Pembrokeshire will now be easily accessible with a new 100m footbridge .

"Characterised by their long beak and large throat poach used for catching prey and draining water, pelicans are already aesthetically peculiar looking birds. But it turns out that watching one yawn is an even stranger visual experience, as an American man discovered after coming face-to-face with one of the birds. Capturing the footage in Santa Barbara, California, Scott Kaiser filmed the back of the large pelican sitting on a post overlooking the water. Recording the bird in slow motion, the video maker later noted that the pelican looked majestic, content and relaxed at this point in the clip. Before it began lifting its head all the way back and opening its mouth extremely wide to show off the size difference between the two parts of its beak. The bird then closes its mouth while looking up at the sky and the air sacs in its throat begin deflating once again as it settles back down. The bizarre slow motion footage was captured in Santa Barbara, California by video maker Scott Kaiser . At this point all the excitement appears to be over. But the bird shows it has one more trick up its sleeve as it rolls its head right back, opens its mouth again and inflates its air sacs. On display appears to be the pelican’s tongue and, quite bizarrely, some inner bill anatomy. The video concludes with the bird returning to its original position and continuing to look over the water as if nothing ever happened. The bird lifts its head all the way back and opens its mouth to show off the size difference between the two parts of its beak . The video maker later commented on the experience, describing it as an amazing display of the length and strength of the pelican’s neck and bill. Pelicans are large water birds that have mainly light-coloured plumage – the exceptions being the brown and Peruvian pelicans. They travel in flocks and hunt cooperatively, feeding primarily on fish caught on or near the water surface.

Adam said: ‘I have always been an extrovert and have been dancing while delivering for several months now. ‘It all started one day when I had the stereo on in the van and was moving a bit. Nichola started dancing, so I danced with her and now we do it every day. ‘I worked as a barman for a long time and I had one manager who paid me extra to get up and dance free style on the bar for half an hour. The video of Adam dancing with the unsuspecting homeowner has been viewed around 1.5million times . Adam said that he has never spoken to Nichola properly despite the fact that the pair enjoy dancing together . ‘If I have an audience it is perfect for me. I cannot dance with everyone or it would take all day to do my round but there are certain customers you get to know who like to have a laugh. ‘Being a postman is a good job, going out and about meeting people and getting some exercise and dancing is just having a bit of fun that brightens up people's day. ‘My moves are not bad but I am not sure I can pull off a proper moonwalk yet.’ Since the release of the 40-second-clip, Adam has received much admiration from female viewers, but states that there is only one woman in his life – his fiancée, Amy Scott. ‘The interest from women is all very flattering but Amy is the only girl for me and she knows it. She has to live with me and puts up with me full time, poor girl,’ said Adam. The postman said the dancing started one day when he had the stereo on in the van and was moving a bit . Adam says he has been dancing on the job for several months now and says he has been staggered by the response to his unusual delivery method . ‘She knows what I am like and is seeing the funny side of the video. ‘The funny thing is that I have never spoken to Nichola properly.

"Faced with deplorable conditions at a ‘horrendous’ hotel in Cyprus, two lads from Cambridge tried to make the most of it by creating a hilarious video diary for their friends back home. The three-and-a-half minute video, titled ‘Never letting him book a hotel again’, offers a glimpse into every traveller’s nightmare – dirty rooms, antiquated or broken amenities and a swimming pool no one would dare to enter. With scenes reminiscent of The Inbetweeners films, the video was created by Patrick Miller and his friend, Damien, who stayed at the family-run hotel last week when they travelled to the Mediterranean island for a friend’s wedding. Patrick Miller, from Cambridge, 'swims' in the shallow end of the pool, which doesn't have any water . The deep end of the swimming pool at the hotel was filled with green sludge, dead insects and debris . Patrick Miller, a self-employed personal trainer, created the amusing video with friend Damien Rigden . Patrick said in the video, which has thousands of views on Facebook and YouTube, that he allowed Damien to book the room, and they thought they would be staying at a four-star hotel for three nights. But it didn’t live up to its billing and it didn't match the photos they saw online, as the pair were shocked to find conditions that could have made it one of the worst holidays ever. At the start of the tongue-in-cheek video, Patrick tells the camera: ‘I left all the planning to him. ‘He booked the accommodation and flights. He told me it was a four-star hotel, I was chuffed, and this little video’s going to show you how it panned out.’ Patrick's friend, Damien, stands under an outdoor shower, which no longer works, near the swimming pool . This screen grab from the pair's video shows the hot tub filled with stagnant water and dead flies . The pair explored the hotel, including bathrooms with exposed pipes or missing toilets, in the video . It shows the pair looking annoyed during a flight delay at the airport before they were ‘squashed’ on the plane with very little legroom. Things got worse at the hotel, where they found an unstaffed and empty bar, and a disgusting scene inside the outdoor swimming pool. Patrick, wearing his swimming trunks, decides to get a closer look at he climbs down the rickety ladder. The self-employed personal trainer says: ‘I might go for a quick dip. Don’t mind if I do. It’s lovely in here’. Patrick Miller stands in uncut, waist-high grass on the grounds of the 'four-star' hotel in Cyprus . The lads' hotel room overlooked a dirty car park, where a lorry was abandoned, and a busy road . The camera then pans to show him ‘swimming’ on the floor of the shallow end of the pool, which has no water. It then pans even further to the deep end, which is filled with green sludge, dead insects and debris. They find the same problems when Patrick checks out the hot tub. He sarcastically tells Damien: ‘Oh, ledge, I fancy a Jacuzzi before we play tennis. Oh no, I think there’s a fly in the water.’ Later scenes show a tennis court without the net strung up, an outdoor shower that doesn’t work, a depressing hotel room view of a dirt car park with an abandoned lorry, paint peeling off the walls, and lights that don’t work or fittings that are missing altogether. At one point in the video Patrick Miller stands on the dilapidated tennis court with no nets strung up . The hotel's grounds were a fiasco, with overgrown grass and trees and dead flowers . The grounds are a fiasco, with overgrown waist-high grass and trees, dead flowers and downed tree branches. In the end, Patrick said, the holidaymakers got what they paid for from their £15-a-night hotel room, which looked perfect online. He added: 'But when the taxi driver dropped us off there were no lights on at the hotel and no one at reception, so we were a bit scared and wondered what we had come to. The pair stayed at the hotel while they attended a friend's wedding on the Mediterranean island . Patrick said the staff were friendly but they spoke very little English, 'so it was a struggle' to communicate . 'Our room wasn't too bad, the sheets were clean and there was hot water, but when we looked in another bathroom there wasn't even a toilet.' He said the hotel was 'horrendous', but they decided to stay as it was just for a couple of days. 'Outside it was like a ghost town, there was no one about and no atmosphere. The staff were friendly but couldn't speak much English so it was a struggle. 'We tried to point out the problems but they couldn't really understand. We decided to just get on with it and make the best of it.'","Patrick Miller and his friend thought they were staying at a nicer hotel .

"Three more of Hillary Clinton's 'everyday Americans'  have been revealed to have strong links to the Democrat party - including one who could be set to support a rival bid for the White House. Julie Stauch and married couple Sean Bagniewski and Vidhya Reddy all appear in on the video announcing Clinton's 2016 bid. They are part of a diverse group of people - from young mothers and people preparing for retirement, to Spanish-speaking brothers preparing to start a business and an Asian-American college graduate looking for her first job - chosen to show aspirational citizens as Clinton looks to speak to to wide demographic of voters. 'Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion,' Clinton says on the video. 'So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote.' But far from being 'everyday Americans', as the two minute video claims, Stauch and Bagniewski are directly involved with the Democrat party - just like campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, who discuss their upcoming wedding plans on screen. Scroll down for video . Sean Bagniewski and Vidhya Reddy appear discussing their plans for 2015 on Cinton's video announcing she is running for president - the Secretary of State's 'plan' for this year . But it has been revealed Bagniewski, who has previously run as for Des Moines City Council, was a campaigner for Clinton in 2007. Bagniewski, who lost  in 2013, is also said to be in talks with Martin O’Malley’s people and may support him . Lawyers Bagniewski and Reddy are shown in their home in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing their plans for 2015. 'We've been doing a lot of home renovations,' Reddy tells the cameraman. But then Bagniewski chimes in: 'But most importantly, we really just want to teach our dog to stop eating the trash.' 'And so we have high hopes for 2015, that that is going to happen,' she laughs. However, their plans for this year may not involve actually supporting Clinton's White House bid. A source has told the DailyMail.com Bagniewski, who ran for Des Moines City Council in 2013, losing by 270 votes, is in talks with Martin O’Malley’s people and may support him. Indeed, Bagniewski revealed to the Des Moines Register that he had been hosting an event for O'Malley last Thursday. O'Malley, who has just completed two terms as Maryland governor, is said to be considering running for president himself. The Democrat, 52, is expected to declare in May, but is keeping relatively tight-lipped about his intentions. 'My wife and I will make a decision on that when the time is right,' O'Malley told the Baltimore Sun earlier this year. But it seems Clinton's campaign team can breathe a sigh of relief: Bagniewski went on to tell the Register: 'O'Malley's great - but for me, Hillary Clinton is just head and shoulders above all the competition.' Julie Stauch is another person who appears on the video with strong links to the Democrat party . Stauch, an Iowa resident, is the former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis . Meanwhile Stauch, who is filmed in her West Des Moines garden, is a former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis, who unsuccessfully ran to be governor of Texas in 2014. Davis is best-known for he 11-hour filibuster to block a bill which would have meant the closure of almost every abortion clinic in the state. Stauch has worked in a PR office for Planned Parenthood, and a LinkedIn profile now shows her as the group’s top lobbyist in Iowa. However, in the video she is a woman famed for the produce gleaned from her Iowa garden. 'It's spring, and we are starting to get the garden ready - and my tomatoes are legendary in my own neighborhood,' she said. Jared Milrad (pictured right) and fiancé Nate Johnson have also been revealed as campaigning Democrats . The couple, who are planning a summer wedding, were featured walking hand in hand during Clinton's video . The video, which has had 3,477,630 on YouTube since its launch on Sunday, has quickly become one of the most viewed political broadcasts of the year - a fact which will no doubt help Clinton as she begins meeting people in Iowa today. Featuring snappy music, and showing Clinton for less than half the running time, it is a dramatic departure from the campaign launch of seven years ago, which showed the Secretary of State on a couch, talking about ending the Iraq war, shrinking deficits and expanding affordable health care. The 2015 video has managed to strike a chord with a range of people, with Democrat campaigners Milrad and Johnson talking about their up-coming nuptials capturing people's imagination. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I’m getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' Milrad, who did not know they would be on the video, said he was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton rollout - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. Mr Johnson, 30, is a project manager for a health care consulting company. The couple will get married in July in a Chicago park bordering Lake Michigan then have their reception at a LGBT community center, The Washington Blade reported. The couple told The Blade that they would be making financial contributions to Clinton's campaign and would volunteer. Both have previously volunteered in presidential campaigns. Johnson supported Clinton in 2008 while Milrad worked for Obama in New Hampshire. Milrad, who is the founder of social enterprise program the Civic Legal Corps, worked for Obama during the 2008 Democrat primaries in New Hampshire when the President was running against Clinton .

"Jack Wilshere may rub shoulders with the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil on a daily basis but he was left starstruck on Thursday evening when he met Brazil legend Pele. Even better for Wilshere, the Arsenal midfielder was given the opportunity to interview the three-time World Cup winner during the launch party of 10Ten Talent. Both Wilshere and Pele, along with Glenn Hoddle, are clients and the England international made sure his fans on Twitter knew about their meeting by posting several tweets. Brazil legend Pele (left) and Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere pose for a photo during launch of 10Ten Talent . Wilshere was given the 'honour to interview the legendary Pele' and asked Twitter questions from fans . Earlier on Thursday, Wilshere tweeted: 'Looking forward to meeting @Pele tonight. I'll be asking the best questions you sent. #JackMeetsPele.' The 23-year-old then followed this up with several tweets about the event, many of which included photos of Pele. Meanwhile, Pele has acknowledged that last year's World Cup was a 'disaster' for Brazil but is not surprised how quickly the likes of Oscar and Ramires have bounced back in the Barclays Premier League this season. Brazil were humiliated by Germany in a 7-1 semi-final defeat and the hosts were then thrashed 3-0 by Holland in the third-place play-off. Pele scored 77 goals in 92 games for Brazil and won the World Cup three times but the former Santos striker still finds last year's capitulation difficult to understand. 'It was something nobody can explain,' said Pele, who was announcing the Art, Life, Football exhibition at the Halcyon Gallery in London. Glenn Hoddle also attended the launch and along with Pele and Wilshere, the trio are all 10Ten Talent clients . Pele has bemoaned Brazil's performance as hosts at last summer's World Cup and said it was 'a disaster' The Brazil legend scored 77 goals in 92 games for his country and won the World Cup three times . 'When we were preparing for the World Cup the two teams everybody, even people who don't know football, expected to be in the final were Spain and Brazil. 'Those were the two teams that were supposed to be in the final. 'But the German team, I saw them play two years before and they were very, very good. They were very well prepared. 'And then of course there was the disaster, it really was a disaster. 'It was something nobody could predict. David Luiz (pictured) and his team-mates were humiliated by Germany in the semi-final as they lost 7-1 . Germany were 5-0 up in 29 minutess as Fred (pictured) and his team-mates suffered an embarrassing defeat . 'Brazil could lose, 1-0 or 2-0, but to lose 7-1 and the second game (third place play-off) we lost 3-0, it's something only God can explain.' The five-time World Cup winners have regrouped under new head coach Dunga and Brazil's Premier League based players have shown few ill-effects this season. Oscar and Ramires have helped Chelsea to a 10-point lead at the top of the table while Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho has been shortlisted for both the Professional Footballers' Association Player and Young Player of the Year awards. Pele has, however, praised Oscar (left) and Ramires (right) for their reaction in the Premier League this season . 'I am not surprised, I follow the league here,' Pele said. 'Of course sometimes what happened to Brazil happens in football. 'You see the team as the best team and they lose. 'It was not a surprise to me (that the players have bounced back). 'I had the pleasure to be in a commercial with Oscar recently and I congratulated him.' The Art, Life, Football is an exhibition of art inspired by Pele to celebrate his 75th birthday.The exhibition will open September 26 and include work from internationally acclaimed artists including Andy Warhol, Lorenzo Quinn and Mitch Griffiths.","Jack Wilshere was joined by former England manager Glenn Hoddle .

"First they made a life-sized bronze statue of him, and now they are creating an entire museum in his honour. Barcelona will dedicate a museum exclusively to the New York director, who picked the Catalan capital for the setting of his Oscar winning film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona. The cultural centre is hoped to be housed in former arts and crafts school, La Llotja, following an refurbishment of the now abandoned building. The tribute will be dedicated exclusively to the New York director, who picked Barcelona for the setting of his Oscar winning film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona . Mediapro group are behind the project, headed up by personal friend of Allen, Jaume Roures, who also produced three of his films. A spokesman from the group said to The Local: 'The Woody Allen project is under discussion but I can't say more yet. 'The neoclassical building that will house the Woody Allen Centre dates from 1883 and is located in the historic Gothic quarter of Barcelona. It is hoped the exhibition will be featured at La Llotja, which is a former art and crafts centre in the city . The building currently lies unoccupied, and it is thought a competition will decide what project is set in the 17th century building . The 17th-century building, in Spain's second largest city, aims to commemorate the work of the celebrated director, actor and writer. La Llotja is currently owned by the Generalitat de Catalunya and there will reportedly be a competition held to determine suitable projects to revive the famous building. The tribute will join a plethora of other museums dedicated to artists such as Dali and Picasso. The tribute will be in Barcelona, in the midst of many other celebrated artists and architects, such as Gaudí buildings (left). The museum follows the bronze statue (right) that was made the director after his Oscar winning film, Vicky Cristina Barcelona . Before fans get too excited, the Barcelona City Hall is yet to provide permission for the project, which is predicted to be completed in two years.

"It could be the result of jetlag, or maybe a few too many beers. As passengers waited to collect their luggage from the baggage reclaim, they were in for a shock when they discovered a man asleep on the conveyor. The incredible footage was shot at Domodedovo Airport in Russia, and shows a man lying in the foetal position seemingly away with the fairies. A man decided to have a snooze on the airport baggage reclaim, not looking too comfortable . While the rubber may well be more comfortable than the airport floor, the swinging motion of the conveyor make it a less-than comfortable snooze. Incredibly, other passengers appear more concerned with spotting their luggage than the fate of the dozing man in shorts. It's not the first instance where passengers have decided to relax on the baggage reclaim. An inebriated Chinese passenger wandered into a train station in his home country and fell asleep on the luggage belt. While some passengers appeared amused by the sleeping man, most were focused on claiming their luggage . When the machine started working, the man was taken through the X-ray scanner. Officials at the station decided to release the images as a warning to others not to do similar. And staff at Rome’s Fiumicino Airport spotted a man curled up on the conveyor after a 55-yard free ride. The Norwegian was believed to be under the influence of alcohol, and had clambered over a check-in desk to grab some rest. The incident brought smiles from those waiting for luggage, while the passenger circled around .","Footage shot at  Domodedovo Airport in Russia .

"A plane carrying former England rugby captain Lewis Moody was forced to make an emergency landing in the Arctic. As poor visibility struck between Svalbard and ice camp Barneo on Saturday, the pilot made the decision to bring the plane down, and due to the bumpy landing the aircraft's undercarriage was damaged. Moody, 36, who is undertaking a 100km trek to the North Pole to raise £250,000 for charity, and his fellow trekkers were unharmed in the incident. Former England rugby captain tweeted before the plane took off from Svalbard to Ice Camp Barneo, where the trek began . According to organisers Headnorth, the team were rescued from the remote site by a helicopter, which took the passengers to their camp to start their trek the next day. The famous captain is part of a team of nine sportsmen and Royal Marines attempting a ten-day expedition to the highest point on Earth. The team will battle extreme temperatures of between -25C and -50C as well as dragging 60kg sledges. A statement by Headnorth on their blog said: 'Due to poor visibility en route from Svalbard to Ice Camp Barneo, where the trek will begin, the team's plane had to make an emergency landing earlier today. England's Lewis Moody, right, scores the first try with Uruguay's Diego Aguirre on ground during the Rugby World Cup match in Brisbane, Australia, Sunday Nov. 2, 2003. England won the match 111-13 . A twitter update confirmed that Lewis and his trekker team mates were unharmed and continuing with their charitable mission . 'All the team are safe and well, although the plane's undercarriage suffered some damage. 'A helicopter was dispatched to the landing spot to collect the trekkers and take them the rest of the journey to their start point at 1 degree from the North Pole. 'They have now arrived in Barneo and are in good spirits, ready to start their epic journey tomorrow.' It is hoped the ten-day 100km trek to the North Pole will raise £250,000 for the Lewis Moody Foundation as well as the Royal Marines Charitable Trust. The retired flanker is completing the challenge alongside team mates Gary Wright, Charlie Birkett and Yves Damette from yachting company Y.CO, Rugby World Cup winners Danny Grewcock MBE, Josh Lewsey MBE, Royal Marines Wayne Hoyle and James Nightingale and expedition leader, accomplished polar explorer Alan Chambers MBE.

"An obedient pooch showed off its athleticism by completing press-ups with a twist alongside a dog trainer. The dog named Teeny is captured on video sat opposite Eric Ko – a trainer with over ten years’ experience – of the Dogaroo centre in Hong Kong. The pair hold onto push-up bars with their front paws and hands respectively and wait for the trainer's command before getting into position. Looking up at Eric in excitement, the dog waits for the trainer to say ‘one’ and complete a press-up before following suit and completing one of its own. On ‘two’ the pair return to their original position before Eric says ‘three’ and ‘four’ and the dog reaches out to high-five him with both paws. Eric then says ‘kiss’ and the dog leans towards him and gives him a quick peck on the lips before the pair begin the routine again. The dog looks up at the trainer in excitement and waits for him to say 'one' before starting . Repeating the process twice more, the dog maintains its level of concentration and acts upon every command as intended. The video concludes with Eric saying: ‘Come on Teeny you can do it,’ as the pair continue to complete more press-ups. Dogaroo is a luxury pet service that has both training facilities as well as a hotel for dogs. The trainer and the dog begin their workout and complete a press-up together to the count of four . After a count of four the dog named Teeny leans out and gives the trainer named Eric Ko a kiss . According to their Facebook page, the trainers at the centre obtained their qualifications from Australian. And they provide everything from obedience behavioural training to behaviour modification at the Dogaroo centre. At the luxury hotel there is a day care service, a professional pet grooming service and a swimming pool and playground. The video concludes with the trainer speaking to the dog encouragingly before they carry on working out .","Dog named Teeny works out alongside experienced trainer Eric Ko .

"The real reasons behind what causes knuckles to crack has long been the topic of dispute  among researchers. But a group of scientists from the University of Alberta in Canada claim to have settled the debate once and for all. Their study finds the cracking is caused by the rapid formation of a gas-filled cavity within a slippery substance called synovial fluid that lubricates the space between the finger bones. Research found that the cracking is caused by the rapid formation of a gas-filled cavity within a slippery substance called synovial fluid that lubricates the space between the finger bones . The study also found that the knuckle cracks in less than 310 milliseconds and that immediately before the popping sound there is a white flash, believed to be from water rushing together. The experiment was made possible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – which provides detailed images of internal body structures – and was humorously dubbed by those involved as the ‘pull my finger study.’ Biomedical engineering professor Richard Thompson said: ‘Rapid imaging with MRI was ideal for these studies because it allowed clear visualization of the bones and fluids surrounding them, and critically, the formation of the air cavity.’ One of the study's co-authors, chiropractor Jerome Fryer, was used as the guinea pig for the experiment and lent his own knuckles to the cause. The experiment was made possible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a study co-author's finger . His fingers were individually inserted into a tube linked to a cable that was pulled until his joint cracked and the results were captured on the MRI video. The next burning question: Is cracking your knuckles harmful? For now remains unanswered. But Greg Kawchuk, a professor of rehabilitation medicine, who led the study published scientific journal PLOS ONE, noted that some studies suggest it does no harm. He said: ‘Why do the same joints crack in some people and not others?’ A knuckle cracks in less than 310 milliseconds and water rushing together causes a white flash . ‘Although speculative, we wonder if being able to crack ones joints is a sign that the joint is actually healthy and that the inability to do so could be a sign of joint problems to come.’ The successful experiment confirmed the first scientific study on the topic, which was conducted in 1947, was correct by suggesting that the sound came from the formation of a gas cavity inside the joint. It also dismissed research from 1971, which disputed the initial study and stated that the collapse of a bubble inside the joint triggered the pop.","University of Alberta research found why knuckles really crack .

"A lion had an unfortunate accident when it got its head stuck in a feeding barrel at a zoo in the Netherlands. Captured by a visitor to the Dierenrijk zoo, the lion can be seen inserting its head into the barrel and attempting to retrieve a piece of meat. Zoo keepers place food in barrels to stimulate the lions, as it replicates the challenges faced when the animals feed in the wild. The animal, hoping to beat two other lions to the food, reaches in too far and suddenly gets its head stuck. Reacting in a panic the lion jumps backwards and attempts to flick the barrel from its head as the other lions chase after it. Visitors to the zoo can be heard laughing hysterically while the lion desperately tries to set itself free. The animal, hoping to beat two other lions to the food, reaches into the barrel too far and gets its head stuck . The other lions chase after the barrel as the distressed animal runs around in a circle and attempts to free itself . One lion appears to come to the rescue by jumping up and standing on the barrel while the lion pulls from the ground. But unfortunately the animal is unable to free its head and the other two lions walk around looking perplexed. Feeling sorry for itself, the distressed lion stands alone in the corner before turning and running frantically towards the zoo’s visitors. The lion reacts in panic and attempts to flick the barrel from its head by running around . Visitors watch on as the lion jumps around and even runs towards the people standing at the edge of the enclosure . The video concludes with the lion looking well and truly fed up as it lies on the ground, exhausted by its failed attempts to break free. According to the video maker, the lion was eventually freed from the barrel and it was unharmed. He said: ‘To make feeding a little bit more exciting for the lions they [the keepers] put meat in a barrel with two small openings. According to the video maker, the lion was eventually freed from the barrel and it was unharmed . The other lions look perplexed and one even looks as if it is trying to help its friend by standing on the barrel . ‘The lions had to get the meat out of the barrel through the holes. Instead one lion put his head through a hole and got stuck. ‘He was walking around and bumped into some objects. He became exhausted, but is basically still all right. ‘After closing time, a veterinarian came and anaesthetised the lion. The barrel was cut off and the lion did not have any injuries.

"A parody video that mocks American skiers and plays on stereotypes about US tourists has gone viral on the internet, but not all viewers are finding it amusing. The profanity-laced comedy sketch by 26 Minutes, a news satire programme broadcast by Radio Television Suisse, follows ‘Jeff Randl’, who travels to Switzerland to compete in Xtreme Verbier. With more than 300,000 views on YouTube since late March, some viewers said they were offended or didn’t find the humour in the show’s over-the-top depiction of Americans on the slopes in Switzerland. The comedy sketch follows 'Jeff Randl', who travels to 'Sweden' to compete in Xtreme Verbier . Jeff, portrayed by one of the French-language show’s presenters, is a blonde, mop-haired snowboarder who tells the camera he has travelled from Lake Forest, California to ‘Sweden’ to compete in the freeriding event. The Bible-toting and pot-smoking character plays on the usual stereotypes about US tourists – from being loud and inconsiderate to arrogant and less worldly. Scenes show Jeff smoking a ‘joint’ while travelling up the mountain on a gondola, saying ‘Excuse me, I’m American’ as he pushes his way past other skiers or snowboarders, and barrelling down the slopes without care or caution. At one point, Jeff tells the camera: ‘Sweden, I think that’s one of the 50 states of Europe or something. I don’t like it too much here, you don’t give a s*** what people are saying.’ Jeff (right) offends others by being loud, jumping queues and smoking marijuana on a gondola . He later takes offence to a rainbow-coloured gondola, saying: ‘Hey, this machine is gay. I don’t like it.’ The end of the video shows Jeff being buried in an ‘avalanche’ and pulling his Bible out of his jacket. When he is hauled out of the snow by a rescue team, he believes he is saved by God and shouts: ‘I’m American, and God bless America.’ The video has received mixed reviews on YouTube, although the majority of comments appear to be from those who found humour in the satire. The snowboarder takes offence to a rainbow-coloured gondola at the Swiss ski resort of Verbier . Of the negative reviews, one viewer wrote: ‘Kind of offended by this, definitely not entertained. Pretty poorly thought out satire.’ Another said: ‘Still trying to find the funny in this.’ Of those who found it funny, one viewer said: ‘I’m an American… and I freaking love this’. Another wrote: ‘Gotta love the Bible toting Californian surfer dude who snowboards… All it needed was for him to eat a Big Mac.’ Jeff holds his Bible after he was 'buried' in an avalanche and pulled from the snow by rescuers . Comedian Vincent Kucholl, who played the role of Jeff, told Swiss newspaper Le Matin that he has enjoyed seeing the response from Americans, and he rejected suggestions that the sketch was racist. He said: ‘It’s funny that they are reacting ... but we did nothing wrong. This was for people here, not in America.’ He told the newspaper that viewers' reactions suggests that Americans have less self-deprecating humour than the Swiss.","Comedy sketch mocked US skiers at the Swiss mountain resort of Verbier .

"Suddenly, after close to 14 years of international football and just 33 caps, Michael Carrick is the answer for England. He was very impressive against Italy in a friendly, true; and he has been an important influence on Manchester United’s revival. Yet it would be unfortunate in the extreme if four consecutive England managers had all failed to spot a game-changing wizard in their midst. Here’s the reality. Carrick has made nine competitive starts for England, and the majority have been ordinary at best. He played in the match against Ecuador in the 2006 World Cup, in which England were saved by a David Beckham free-kick, and was then dropped and replaced by the more energetic Owen Hargreaves for the quarter-final with Portugal. Michael Carrick played against Ecuador at the 2006 World Cup but was dropped for the quarter-final . England have won just four competitive matches when Carrick started, including against Poland . Carrick (left) played in the 2-0 defeat by Croatia which went a long way to England missing out on Euro 2008 . Under Steve McClaren he started in the disastrous double header of a 0-0 home draw with Macedonia followed by a 2-0 defeat in Croatia — the results that effectively cost England’s place at the 2008 European Championship. He was also part of unconvincing performances in Poland and, particularly, Montenegro under Roy Hodgson. England have won four competitive games in which Carrick has started — against Ecuador, and then San Marino, Poland and Lithuania, all at home. Ecuador were feisty opponents and Carrick struggled to match their intensity; the same in the second half in Montenegro, when England were overwhelmed and fortunate not to lose. The home draw with Macedonia — more than either defeat to Croatia — was the worst result of McClaren’s reign. Carrick was hailed after an impressive performance for England in their friendly draw with Italy last week . Carrick has also been impressive in Manchester United's midfield under Louis van Gaal this season . So the idea that England managers are fools for consistently preferring Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard is misguided. Carrick had chances throughout his career, and little changed. Equally, in less than one year, between May 30, 2009, and May 9, 2010, Lampard scored more goals for club and country than Carrick has in his entire career. Gerrard took slightly longer — outscoring Carrick in entirety between October 24, 2007 and December 13, 2008. And it wasn’t as if Lampard and Gerrard couldn’t pass or put a tackle in, too. Maybe Carrick has improved with age. Maybe he is the best around right now. He certainly deserves to be judged on his current performances, not his past. Just don’t think that there isn’t a reason why his international career underwhelms. They’re not all idiots, these England managers.","Michael Carrick impressed during England's draw with Italy last week .

"Three friends got the fright of their life when they were confronted by a pod of baby killer whales while on a crabbing trip. Steven Sloan, joined by friends Michael Niccum and Eugene Dight were on an aluminium rowboat when the encounter occurred off the west coast of Anderson Island, Washington. Filming from the boat, Steven captured the orcas swimming from afar – two of them can be seen jumping from the water. At a safe distance: The group cheer in excitment as Steven captures two orcas swimming and jumping from the water . The group on the boat cheer and yell in excitement at what they are witnessing as the whales appear to start moving closer to the boat. According to Steven, the group believe that the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the pod to them, as its distinctive sound disturbed the whales. Commenting on their approach, one of the group can be heard saying: ‘They’re probably coming to check us out.’ The group believe that the sound of the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the orcas . One of the group states that the orca is probably coming to check them out before it emerges from the water and gives them all a fright . Before later adding: ‘That is like 50 yards from us,’ as the marine mammals continue to head in the direction of their boat. After suggesting that it might be a good idea to start rowing away, one of the group begins panicking and shouts: ‘Guys we need to get out of here, it’s coming right at us.’ He then states: ‘We need to sit down in the boat. We need to get out of here. It is probably under us. This is really dangerous, I’m scared.’ 'We need to get out of here':The group panic as a killer whales approach their aluminium boat . The killer whales are videoed circling and swimming dangerously close to  the tiny boat . Suddenly an orca emerges from the water right beside the boat and the panicked member of the group screams in shock. Meanwhile the killer whales begin circling and swimming dangerously close to and underneath the tiny boat. Slightly less shocked now that the whale has made a relatively tame introduction, the group laugh nervously and begin heading back to shore. The group jokingly plead with the killer whales as the marine mammals continue to swim around the boat . The video maker captures a killer whale swimming underneath the aluminium boat in Washington . On the way back they jokingly plead with the orcas, and one of them says: ‘Please don’t attack us.’ Referring to the incident on the original upload of the video, Steven wrote: ‘Feel free to laugh at how I respond to a scary situation like this and enjoy the beautiful orcas at the beautiful Anderson Island.’","The group were on a crabbing trip near Anderson Island, Washington .

"The England cricket team's involvement with multi-billion-pound fraudster Allen Stanford — an all-time low point — has been defended by West Indies cricket legend Sir Curtly Ambrose. Great fast bowler Ambrose never spoke to the media during his playing career but launched his aptly titled autobiography Time to Talk on the eve of the West Indies-England series. Ambrose was one of the West Indies stars, along with Sir Viv Richards and Richie Richardson, who accompanied Stanford when he flew by helicopter to the Lord's nursery ground in 2008 to launch his five-year deal with England that ended with his arrest and subsequent 110-year jail sentence, just one $20million T20 game into the contract. The England cricket team's involvement with  Allen Stanford  has been defended by  Sir Curtly Ambrose . Stanford's deal with England England ended with his arrest and subsequent 110-year jail sentence . Ambrose wrote: 'I wasn't surprised the England Cricket Board officials were taken in by him. We all were. His vision to improve West Indies cricket by using England seemed a hard one to argue with. But we felt that having England as the same opponents over that period would turn things stale.' Richardson said: 'He employed a lot of people in several businesses and built a stadium. He did a lot of good. We thought what he was doing was legitimate.' Richards added: 'To a lot of fellers here, he did well.' Ambrose accompanied Stanford when he flew to the Lord's nursery ground in 2008 to launch the deal . The new ECB president Giles Clarke did not want to discuss the Stanford legacy saying it was a long time ago . However, the new ECB president Giles Clarke, who negotiated the doomed deal and greeted Stanford on his arrival at Lord's with a bear hug, did not want to discuss the Stanford legacy. Before the Wisden launch last week at which he made a fool of himself by haranguing both the guest speaker and Wisden editor Lawrence Booth, Clarke would only say of Stanford: 'That was all a long time ago.' Perhaps it's no surprise, with Stanford's decaying cricket stadium just outside Antigua's airport there for all visitors to see, that Clarke is swerving today's first Test on the island. Michael Vaughan might still be a long way from agreeing terms and working patterns to become England's director of cricket. But he is staying at England's luxury Sugar Ridge Hotel in Antigua, so he's right in the middle of any politics going on over the appointment of a director and ideally placed to judge the mood music of players and management.

Lancaster has a speaking engagement a week today in aid of the Dallaglio Foundation along with Sir Clive Woodward, Lawrence Dallaglio and captain Chris Robshaw at a £225-a-head function. The RFU say all Lancaster's talks in the run-up to the World Cup are for charity. Stuart Lancaster seems unperturbed by criticism that he's been talking the talk, not walking the walk . The Grand National peak viewing figure of 8.8million proved that this is one event on the racing calendar that Channel 4 invariably get right, even without Clare Balding.

THAT'S A BIT RICH, JIMMY . Jimmy Anderson being interviewed by cricket journalists on the eve of his 100th Test when he is just four wickets from becoming England's record Test bowler, was asked what advice he would give young bowlers starting their international careers. Anderson replied 'Ignore the media', which even if meant 'tongue in cheek', as he later claimed, was a pretty crass thing to say as someone who has benefited hugely over the years from money for newspaper columns. Meanwhile, captain Alastair Cook said he had learned of Kevin Pietersen's century yesterday from Test Match Special's Jonathan Agnew while being interviewed. Surely the ECB should have briefed him about KP's exploits — the elephant in the room — before his media duties. Jimmy Anderson was asked what advice he would give young bowlers and replied: 'Ignore the media' Cricket feuds don't always last as long as the 40-year enmity between Sir Ian Botham and Ian Chappell.

"Sky Sports’ drastic cost-cutting across the board after paying £11million a match to retain Premier League rights is being blamed for the demise of the Victory Shield, the home nations international Under 16 tournament. The FA announced this week that England are pulling out of the event with immediate effect in order to achieve a more varied fixture list, including more foreign opposition. England have pulled out of the home nations international Under 16 tournament . But it is understood this surprise move has been prompted by Sky allegedly withdrawing their title sponsorship as well as reducing live coverage and wanting further changes to the format and another backer found. Gareth Southgate, FA’s head of National Teams, said: ‘We feel due to the uncertainly around the Victory Shield and the potential changes suggested by Sky, it is a good time to review our fixtures and make an early decision.’ However, Sky say that their recommendations, including shortening the time between games, would have raised the profile of an historic competition that first took place in 1925 and whose notable players include Sir Stanley Matthews, Sir Bobby Charlton, Kenny Dalglish, Trevor Brooking, Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney. Meanwhile, Sky’s price hikes involving all their programming since almost breaking the bank by committing £4.2bn to Premier League football are significantly more than the Isleworth spin machine suggested. The variety bundle has gone up 7.1 per cent, sports by 4 per cent — double for Virgin cable subscribers — the HD pack by 9.8 per cent and the full total by 6.4 per cent . Referee Martin Atkinson travelled in business class on return from Munich .

Brazilian legend Pele will enjoy a short stopover in London on Thursday . Pele’s London highlife . Pele's enduring reputation as the world’s greatest footballer will be enhanced during a short stopover in London. The Brazilian legend is due at the Halcyon Gallery in Mayfair on Thursday to promote an art exhibition inspired by his life and to celebrate his 75th birthday in October. On display will be pop artist Andy Warhol’s original acrylic and silkscreen ink on canvas 1977 work of Pele in his final year with New York Cosmos. The painting is valued at $10million — and no picture of Ronaldo, Messi or Maradona can compete with that. Later, Pele will be going to a party organised by his agents Ten10, where he will be introduced to other clients including Jack Wilshere. Willie McKay, one of football’s most notorious agents, has been declared bankrupt at a hearing in Glasgow. McKay, who used to run his agency business from the multi-millionaire tax haven of Monaco and had racing stables in Yorkshire, revealed assets of just £987, while court documents detailed that he owed £713,292. When football democracy is so skewered that Sepp Blatter’s three rivals for the FIFA presidency are denied the opportunity to address the Central American CONCACAF confederation, no wonder Blatter feels no need to set up an election team. However, it does look like Blatter has been promising his support for the 2019 FIFA leadership to CONCACAF chief Jeffrey Webb, who is noticeably more aligned to Blatter than he was a few months ago. There is no stopping the Kevin Pietersen charm offensive with his KP24 foundation backing a campaign for a pioneering cancer treatment to be made available on the NHS.","Sky allegedly withdrew their title sponsorship of Under 16 tournament .

"Premier League clubs are now so wealthy through their TV deals that they can afford to turn down a title sponsorship worth £45million a year. Guinness offered the top flight a huge deal of £135m over three years, a £5m-a-year increase on the payments from Barclays, whose 15-year partnership with the Premier League will finish at the end of next season. But the clubs awash with over £5billion from domestic TV rights alone rejected the bid from Guinness’s parent company Diageo, in part because some teams have conflicting beer deals. THe Premier League has turned down a bid from Guinness to replace Barclays as the title sponsor . Instead the PL want as much as £60m a year from a mega title backer but will also examine a multi-partnership sponsorship model. Such are the TV riches that the smaller clubs in the PL are the ones more anxious about the sponsorship money — the £3m-a-year split doesn’t make much difference to the top of the table. The FA, meanwhile, have failed to find an ‘in association’ FA Cup partner this season prepared to pay £9m a year, although it’s understood Wembley finally have someone at the table after well over a year’s search. The league's mega-rich clubs have demanded a deal in the region of £60m-a-season from 2016 . Sky Sports’ petty refusal to let pundit Thierry Henry present Tony McCoy with the champion jump jockey trophy at his Sandown farewell on Saturday — because it’s on Channel 4 — doesn’t mean that an Arsenal legend will not doing the honours. Another iconic Gunners name has been lined up for the role although Sandown officials want to keep his identity a secret from Arsenal fan McCoy until the ceremony. It’s known that Tony Adams is unavailable while the ‘legendary’ tag surely rules out Ray Parlour, the Romford Pele. Ian Wright, record goalscorer before Henry, would be a good choice. Thierry Henry's (centre) contract with Sky Sports have presented him presenting a trophy to Tony McCoy . Surrey boss Richard Thompson’s elevation to chairman of the England cricket commercial committee will aid the sport’s chronic need for more terrestrial TV coverage. Thompson will push for a free-to-air highlights deal for the domestic T20 Blast this summer which would be vital to grow a tournament that is in the shadow of the IPL and the Australian Big Bash. Gary Neville is not known as a bon viveur.

Gary Neville was desperate to get away from Stamford Bridge to get to Nicky Butt's wife's birthday party . Second chance saloon . The Football League awards — the best football dinner in the calendar by a distance — showed this year there is a way back for some football offenders. Shortlisted for the player in the community honour was Leyton Orient’s Elliot Omozusi, who served 16 months in prison for intimidating a witness in a murder trial. And one of the contenders for goal of the season was Shrewsbury’s Andy Mangan, who was banned for five months for betting on his own team when he played for Bury. Leeds’ banned owner Massimo Cellino has few fans — understandably, considering the constant turmoil at Elland Road. Yet it was the Italian who insisted midfielder Lewis Cook, voted Championship apprentice of the year, was given a first-team chance. Massimo Cellino may not be popular but his decision to force Lewis Cook into the first team paid off . Meanwhile, Leeds put out a statement after the sick-note six ruled themselves out of the match at Charlton, saying that the club ‘stand by internal medical recommendations’. Yet when the Leeds medical staff advised Cellino about the chronic knee condition of AC Milan player Zan Benedicic, he was still signed on loan and played 13 minutes of league football before needing more surgery. Jevans will stay silent . Debbie Jevans, who walked out of her job as CEO of England Rugby 2015 before she was pushed, cut a relaxed figure at the Football League awards dinner. Jevans left her post six months ahead of the World Cup following a breakdown in relationship with the interfering RFU.

"The ECB are to spread the net far wider than expected in their search for the director of cricket to replace the axed Paul Downton. It was widely believed that the new ECB regime led by chief executive Tom Harrison and chairman Colin Graves would waste little time in appointing from a short list of former England captains Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart. But instead the Board are going to instigate a recruitment process involving head hunters Sport Recruitment International, who would be expected to suggest some overseas candidates as well as the trio already in the frame. Alec Stewart admitted he has had no contact with the ECB over the  role of England cricket director . Michael Vaughan has been among the leading candidates to take up the newly-created role with England . The main problem is that the job description has yet to be fixed. Crucial issues will be the amount of travel involved and how much power the new director will hold on selection and the hiring and firing of captains and coaches. The ECB are still finalising those parameters before the headhunters start preparing their recommendations. UKIP leader Nigel Farage was spotted in the Tory heartland that is the Halford Hewitt golf tournament played by public school old boys’ teams every April since 1925 at Royal Cinque Ports and Royal St George’s. However Farage, rather than electioneering, was cheering on his alma mater Dulwich College, for whom his son Sam was playing.

The severe cuts that Sky have been forced to make since agreeing their £11m-a-match Premier League deal is apparent even in the Caribbean. Last year the Sky cricket team stayed at Antigua’s luxury Curtain Bluff resort but are now in the cheaper St James’s Club. Their hotels in England aren’t as good as they’ve become accustomed to either. Meanwhile top Sky executive Andy Cairns, controller of Sky Sports News, has a bell on his desk at Isleworth, though a Sky spokesman insisted he doesn’t ring it to summon staff. Maybe he rings it every time one of his reporters refers to ‘Sky sources’, which would be often. Sofa so good for TMS . Test Match Special have relented over their fierce opposition to Test Match Sofa, who covered matches off the television, and have employed one of the Sofa’s main commentators Dan Norcross for their county cricket team. This would have been unthinkable three years ago when TMS’s Jon Agnew threatened to resign from the Cricketer magazine, who were funding the Sofa operation. And Agnew’s colleague, the late Christopher Martin-Jenkins wrote: ‘The thought of having to listen to predators who purport to be producing commentaries from sofa or armchair, without paying a penny to the ECB for the rights, is too ghastly to contemplate.’ TMS producer Adam Mountford said: ‘There is no issue with Dan, he’s a good commentator.’ Test Match Special have employed Test Match Sofa's Dan Norcross (right) for their county cricket team . One face missing from the England tour party in the Caribbean is specialist maths analyst Nathan Leamon, an important figure given coach Peter Moores’ love of data. The ECB say Leamon’s replacement by newcomer Rupert Lewis is merely a rotation policy. Lewis, who worked for New Zealand Cricket, joined the ECB after Stuart Broad’s analyst sister Gemma decided to go travelling. ‘Numbers’ Leamon had an eventful World Cup. He hurt his toe after kicking out in anger in his hotel room following a bar-room debate about the importance of cricket stats, during which he was mocked by the awful Paul Allott for not playing cricket to a high level. It is also understood that Leamon was frustrated that Moores, for all dependence on data, didn’t make the most of his intensely detailed work.","The ECB were expected to appoint a former England captain for the role .

"Inspirational speaker Turia Pitt, who suffered horrific burns when she was caught in a bushfire, has revealed she still struggles to overcome her near-death ordeal. The 27-year-old said just the smell from a barbecue brought back the traumatic moment she was trapped for four hours where she suffered burns to 65 per cent of her body. Speaking to a Networking WA audience at Crown Perth on Wednesday, the burns survivor said she still feels haunted when she talks about being caught in the bushfire when she competed in an ultra-marathon in Kimberley in September 2011. 'My heart rate has just gone up, my hands are sweating, my mouth is all of the sudden dry,' she said, The West Australian reports. 'This happens even if I go to a seemingly harmless barbecue. As soon as I smell that smoke, immediately I am transported back.' Scroll down for video . Burns survivor Turia Pitt said she still struggles to overcome her ordeal during a speech on Wednesday . The motivational speaker suffered burns to 65 per cent of her body when she competed in an ultra-marathon . Ms Pitt also revealed she ran her first marathon last month since the fire and clocked a faster time than before she was injured. 'As soon as I took that first step, it was as if all my worries and fears dissipated,' Ms Pitt said. 'I had finished the run but I also beat my time from before my injury.' The revelation follows after she successfully underwent reconstructive surgery to rebuild a nose but she was not expecting complications where she had stopped breathing during the procedure. When Ms Pitt woke up from her surgery, she expected to wake up in the burns unit with a brand new nose but  the moment she woke up in intensive care, she revealed she just wanted to die. 'At that point, all I wanted was death because I had worked so hard just to end up in the same situation,' Ms Pitt said. But she marked a new milestone in her recovery after another harrowing heath scare where her family feared the worst as she told Woman's Day: 'I can't believe I didn't have a nose for so long'. Ms Pitt went on to publish a book about her experiences - aptly titled Everything to Live For and fund raised almost $200,000 for surgical charity Interplast, . As she embarked on her own road to resilience, Ms Pitt is currently training ahead of the 10-day fund raising trek along the Inca Trail in Peru where she is getting up early every morning to prepare.

Prior to the bushfire, Ms Pitt, from Ulladulla, on the NSW south coast, worked as a mining engineer and a model . In an interview with Women's Day last month, her mother, Celestine Vaite, said she and Turia's partner Michael Hoskin heard the hospital's cardiac arrest alarm go off 'and we thought she was gone' during the nose reconstruction. 'I said, God, don't you dare. She's fought so hard, this girl,' she told the magazine. 'She fought to get out of bed, she fought to walk, she fought to accept - don't you dare do that to her!' Ms Pitt wore a compression stocking for almost two years and had seven of her fingers amputated during a seemingly endless series of operations. Her family were relieved when she woke - and Ms Pitt is happily showing off her reconstructed nose on social media.

"Roman Abramovich has never spoken in public since buying Chelsea, nor is there any expectation that he will. So the nearest to that happening could be a landmark event at Stamford Bridge next month. Marina Granovskaia is a Chelsea director and arguably the most powerful woman in English football as the club’s transfer and contract negotiator. She is also Abramovich’s day-to-day link with his football team. She is confirmed to speak — at least according to the organisers — for the first time publicly to an audience of 300 senior sports industry figures at a women in sport conference planned by the Leaders brand on May 21.

The club are known to be keen for a fresh voice to be heard from their hierarchy following the departure last October of CEO Ron Gourlay, whom Granovskaia has effectively replaced. She has worked for Abramovich since graduating from Moscow State University in 1997. Her hard negotiating style is such that she allegedly told captain John Terry to ‘take it or f****** leave it’ before he signed his one-year contract extension. Chelsea deny that the Terry exchange took place, describing it as an 'urban myth'. Granovskaia sold defender David Luiz for a remarkable £50million last summer to Paris Saint-Germain .

The ridiculous saga of Greg Dyke’s £16,400 Parmigiani watch was finally concluded on Tuesday when the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA’s ethics committee closed fanciful proceedings against Dyke after the watch was returned to Zurich.

"Departing England Cricket Board chairman Giles Clarke chose one of the most prestigious cricket occasions of the year, the Wisden Almanack launch, to make a complete fool of himself. Clarke, despite his standing as one of world cricket’s big powerbrokers who will continue with his deputy chairmanship of the ICC, embarrassed VIP guests with his astonishing behaviour at the Lord’s Pavilion Long Room dinner. Clarke arrived upset that the new ECB regime had just sacked his England managing director appointment, Paul Downton, whom he had rashly called a ‘man of great judgment’. Departing ECB chairman Giles Clarke made a fool of himself during the Wisden Almanack launch . Clarke confronted guest speaker Ehsan Mani and Sportsmail's Lawrence Booth during the dinner . He was further annoyed that Lawrence Booth’s Wisden editor notes had been scathing of the way the ECB on Clarke’s watch had botched the axing of Kevin Pietersen while operating a ‘nexus of self-preservation’. And Clarke finally lost the plot when eloquent guest speaker Ehsan Mani of Pakistan, the former president of ICC, outlined his understandable concern for the future of world cricket as a result of the financial and power carve-up by Clarke’s England, Australia and India. After Mani had finished speaking Clarke loudly harangued Wisden editor Booth across the table — in front of England all-rounder Moeen Ali, former fast bowler Devon Malcolm and ECB chief executive Tom Harrison. England cricketer Moeen Ali witnessed the incident at the Lord’s Pavilion Long Room dinner . Clarke was furious Mani’s ‘disgraceful’ address had made no mention of ICC’s Test match contingency fund and also had strong objections to Wisden’s opinions. Yet Clarke had been granted a two-page platform in last year’s almanack to explain his ICC strategy. Clarke then confronted Mani about his speech and had another go at Booth before storming out of the Long Room in high dudgeon. Mani said: ‘I’m very used to Giles being utterly irrational. He always thinks it’s just about him when there’s a far bigger picture of three countries sharing 52 per cent of income between them.’ To complete the farce, Clarke’s nomination was supported by the ECB board on Thursday for him to become the first ECB president. Sky ban Henry for AP . Sky Sports have refused to allow their pundit Thierry Henry to present AP McCoy with his record 20th champion jump jockey title at Sandown on April 25, where the great AP could ride for the last time. Racing officials had asked Henry, who immediately agreed due to the esteem McCoy is held in by fellow sportsmen and because he is a big Arsenal fan to boot. But Sky have withdrawn Henry because the race meeting is being broadcast on Channel 4. A Sky spokesman said the Henry approach had not been made through the right channels.

Presenter Clare Balding will present the women's Boat Race on BBC rather than the Grand National . With even former England batting coach Graham Gooch saying the Kevin Pietersen camp had wiped the floor with the ECB in the PR battle over KP’s banishment, it was depressing that new CEO Tom Harrison shows no sign of being more helpful with the media. When asked for a word as he left the Wisden dinner about his earlier axing of Paul Downton, he refused to break stride, merely stating: ‘We’ve said all we want to say.’ The Harrison regime have promised to stop leaks coming out of Lord’s, yet Sky Sports had a satellite truck and reporter in position at Lord’s for the unexpected Downton announcement and a correspondent ready to report live from St Kitts.

The trend at Arsenal has coincided with the agency business being thrown into turmoil by FIFA passing the buck to national associations to officiate on agents from April 1. Liverpool club secretary Stuart Hayton is leaving Anfield after just two seasons following 20 years at Wigan, having never settled into the role at the bigger club. Liverpool insist the popular Hayton’s departure ‘by mutual consent’ in May has nothing to do with the various big contract issues facing the club — Raheem Sterling’s stand-off over a new contract, Glen Johnson being on a free at the end of the season having signed for £18m and Jordan Henderson having only one year left on his deal. Fabio Capello and Terry Venables were two conspicuous names missing from the list of England managers who signed the letter prepared by PR agency Milltown backing FA chairman Greg Dyke’s campaign to boost home-grown talent.

He has taken the risk with the flats and any profit made will be nowhere near the amount he has put into Kent.’ Stew over Stu’s talks . There is plenty of sensitivity at Twickenham about relationships between chief executive Ian Ritchie and head coach Stuart Lancaster since Ritchie described England’s four successive Six Nations runners-up finishes as ‘unacceptable’. Sports Agenda has since highlighted a couple of upcoming Lancaster speaking engagements on his ‘winning’ formula, while a Sunday newspaper revealed Lancaster being promoted as a guest speaker for hire in a brochure produced by leading agency M & C Saatchi Merlin. Stuart Lancaster's relationship with Ian Ritchie has come under the microscope in recent weeks . This prompted the RFU to send out an unsolicited press statement that M & C Saatchi Merlin had produced and distributed the brochure without Stuart’s permission and have ‘apologised unreservedly’ for the error. Yet the agency say they have nothing to apologise for, especially as Lancaster is well known for being an excellent and enthusiastic speaker on sports management techniques. A different branch of business solutions company CWM is now sponsoring boxing promoter Barry McGuigan’s newspaper column in the Mirror. This comes after its previous backer, CWM’s foreign exchange trading division, found itself at the centre of a fraud and money-laundering investigation.

"Steve Peters, the sports psychiatrist called on by a number of top stars, will play a key role in keeping troubled England batsman Jonathan Trott focused in the Caribbean. Trott has made a nightmare return to the Test side 18 months since situational anxieties saw him quit the Ashes tour — falling cheaply in both innings in the first Test in Antigua and finding his ‘on the move’ batting technique under strong scrutiny. It is understood that Trott is having regular Skype sessions with Peters from the team hotel, and he credits the psychiatrist with helping him overcome his mental health issues to win his Test place back. Jonathan Trott has endured a nightmare return to Test cricket with some poor performances in the first Test . But the double failure will be a big challenge for Trott, with Peters’s assistance, to continue ‘to keep a proper prospective on life and cricket’ which he said he was doing before the Test, rather than having ‘unrealistic expectations about his batting,’ which he had in Australia. Peters, whose other clients include the England football team, Liverpool, British Cycling and snooker’s Ronnie O’Sullivan, will no doubt be telling Trott to manage his inner chimp — the part of the brain that runs on emotions and gut instincts in contrast to the rational, evidence-based part. Despite his success with multi-Olympic champions Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, Peters didn’t do anything to improve England during their dismal 2014 football World Cup but is still involved on an ad hoc basis. Steve Peters (right) worked with the England football team during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . The England team under Peter Moores have a more relaxed attitude towards the players’ use of social media than previous regimes. All-rounder Ben Stokes took to Twitter, after taking a wicket with a no-ball in the West Indies first innings, to comment: ‘Tweets about the no-ball flooding in, so tomorrow I won’t try, bowl four feet behind the line and bowl 70 mph... then you’re all happy’. Despite the provocative tweet, for which he later apologised, the England camp had no complaint. Instead they were pleased that one of the players had showed some character. England batsman Ben Stokes plays a sweeping shot during day four of the first Test in Antigua . Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove’s biggest ambition in cricket is to see an Ashes Test match at his beloved Ageas Bowl ground, which he was mainly responsible for building and funding. However, it will be 2023 at the earliest before Bransgrove has a chance of fulfilling his dream. And ironically ECB representative Bransgrove has been watching the first Test in Antigua alongside former ECB chairman David Morgan, highly influential in Hampshire rivals Glamorgan hosting Ashes games in 2009 and 2015. And since Bransgrove was one of Giles Clarke’s major opponents during his autocratic ECB reign, that didn’t help Hampshire’s chances either. Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove (left) wants to see an Ashes Test match at the Ageas Bowl ground . Peter Salmon, director of BBC England, made a surprise appearance in the Test Match Special booth at the Sir Vivian Richards stadium. However, Salmon had not flown out to the Caribbean at licence fee payers’ expense, just to check whether Joe Wilson’s hard-working BBC sports team were giving value for money. He happened to be on holiday in Antigua. SIR VIV: THIS IS SURREAL . Coming across Sir Vivian Richards, King of Antigua, having a moment alone surveying the Test match scene, Sports Agenda asked him what it was like, watching cricket at a ground named after you and where your statue stands. ‘It’s surreal,’ said Richards. ‘You have to pinch yourself.’ The striking Richards statue, by acclaimed Cuban sculptor Andres Gonzalez, was funded by Fidel Castro’s Cuban government to mark 20 years of diplomatic accord between the two islands. Meanwhile, England’s intense batting coach Mark Ramprakash is taking a surprising interest in Cuban politics. He tweeted: ‘Glad the US has finally taken Cuba off the terror list and relations between the two countries are improving.’ Ex-England Rugby 2015 chief executive Debbie Jevans attended Thursday’s Football League board meeting .

"The ECB are not living up to their promise of fresh transparency under a new regime by keeping secret the job description for the director of England cricket. The confidential details were sent by email to potential candidates for the post, front-runners for which are former England captains Andrew Strauss, Michael Vaughan and Alec Stewart. But the work parameters will not appear on the ECB website or that of headhunters Sports Recruitment International, as would be the normal procedure. ECB chairman Colin Graves has released very few details of the new director of cricket role for England . Former England captain Andrew Strauss (pictured here in 2011) is among the front-runners for the job . It is understood the ECB, who say there will be a proper recruitment procedure, don't want any publicity about the job specification. It might well be altered in various ways during the interview process so their chosen man is happy with the scope of his responsibilities. It is not expected that the new appointment will have to go to every England game. That will please head coach Peter Moores, who talked of the danger of having too many voices in the dressing room after the Antigua Test. But the cricket director will have the main say over coach and captain and set the overall playing strategy. Sports psychiatrist Steve Peters, who is credited with having helped Jonathan Trott recover from situational anxieties well enough for him to return to the Test arena, talked briefly this week about how he is aiding the England batsman. England star Jonathan Trott has overcome situational anxieties following work with psychiatrist Steve Peters . Peters, before giving a lecture on his role as undergraduate dean of the University of Sheffield medical school, said he wasn't equipped to give guidance on the technical batting problems that led to Trott's two failures in Antigua. But he concentrates on ensuring, through Skype sessions, that Trott is in the best state of mind to succeed while being able to put any cricket setback into proper perspective. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho appears to have enjoyed yet another big payday by fronting a Jaguar promotion of their new car supply deal for the Wimbledon Championships.

It has emerged that Keith Pelley, the Canadian media mogul chosen as chief executive of golf's European Tour, was not the only non-European in the running. So was the second choice, and there was also an American on the short-list. The message seems to have been that the Tour didn't want to antagonise the rest of Europe by appointing another Brit following the long, successful reigns of Ken Schofield and George O'Grady. However, Pelley, despite his lack of golf knowledge, is seen as a good appointment, mainly because of his TV rights acumen. Keith Pelley (right) O'Sullivan going to pot? Five-time world snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan, who has suffered from depression and missed most of the 2012-13 season with personal issues, doesn't seem to be in the best frame of mind ahead of this year's World Championship judging by a call he made while on the London-Sheffield train last Saturday.

"Rival clubs claim QPR, facing Football League fines of up to £50million for multiple breaches of financial fair play regulations, are making an outrageous attempt to get their man on the inside of the discussions.

The breakdown in the relationship between the FA and England Supporters Travel Club led to the offensive chants during England’s 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday. The tasteless repertoire of songs ran from ‘F*** the IRA’, to ‘F*** the Taliban’ to ‘F*** the English FA’ — the last one due to the huge discontent over the decision to switch double loyalty caps from away trips to home games at Wembley. Those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games. The Football Supporters Federation, despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting, believe it is inevitable that the songs — and the World War Two favourites — will be sung when England play the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7. There were offensive chants made by England fans during the game against Italy in Turin on Tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved . England's next international is against Ireland and takes place in Dublin on June 7 . The FSF are in no mood to work with the FA because of the caps dispute and claim that, having taken legal advice, anti-IRA and WW2 songs are not law-breaking and that the FA showed no interest when the FSF first tackled England fans singing offensive songs in 2005. The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues.

"The size of Sky Sports’ gamble in paying an astonishing £11millon a game to retain their Premier League TV rights has led to the company having to re-address their entire sports strategy. And overlord Barney Francis addressed staff this week to present his way forward - ‘Fit for the Future’ - with the station needing to make considerable changes to afford their gigantic football bill. This will see Sky concentrate on their live rights in every sport while reducing the support programming and those leaving the network are not being automatically replaced. Sky Sports will pay £11millon a game to broadcast Premier League football for three years starting in 2016 . Graeme Souness, Thierry Henry and Ed Chamberlain on Sky's Super Sunday coverage of the Premier League . Francis, who prefers to speak off the cuff, was using a prepared script on this important occasion and one department asked for a copy to show Sky personnel who missed the meeting. But he declined to issue duplicates, telling his troops he didn’t want your Sports Agenda columnist to get hold of the text - such is the paranoia in Isleworth. Sky claim the strategy talk - rather than plain cost cutting - was preparing the station for the varied demands of a multi-platform future where a Thierry Henry video on Sky’s YouTube channel can become more important than traditional programme making. The technical problems with the charter plane which forced the England team to stay overnight in Turin after the game weren’t the only flying concerns related to the Italy match. The BA flight bringing in ITV Sport’s football pundits Glenn Hoddle, Ian Wright, Lee Dixon and the cream of Fleet Street had to abort landing close to the ground because of the cross-winds meaning the plane was wrongly aligned with the runway approach. These same Italian cross-winds and another rather more serious runway direction miscalculation by the pilot in poor weather saw the plane carrying the great Torino side of 1949 crash into the Basilica of Superga which stands on the hill overlooking the airport, killing all 31 on board. Relationships between the FA and the England Travel Supporters Club - already at a low point over the switching of double loyalty rewards from away trips to Wembley - will be further strained by the loud singing of songs in Turin that only bring embarrassment on English football. Understandably the FA are in no mood to act on their fans’ complaints about ‘Two caps for Wembley, you’re having a laugh’, when the same travelling set of supporters still sing ‘F*** the IRA’ and ‘Where were you in World War Two’. It’s also been noted that while senior members of the Fans Supporters Federation are quick to speak out about loyalty issues, they are less talkative about those tasteless chants. England fans sang anti-IRA songs during Tuesday's friendly draw with Italy at the Juventus Stadium - there is no suggestion that the fans pictured in this image where involved in the chants . It would never have happened under the fanatical reign of former FA head of security Ray Whitworth, now working for Major League Soccer. But England manager Roy Hodgson took himself off for a long walk around Turin in his England training gear to while away some of the time before kick-off. Inevitably that meant good-humouredly running the gauntlet of England fans and their demands for photos, selfies and autographs. Kane not able to stop . The FA continue to micro-manage the supposedly free-for-all media interview mixed zone which players have to go through after matches. But for England, this means that even man of the moment Harry Kane, who is always happy to chat to the media after club games, isn’t allowed to stop because the FA decree who is going to speak. The FA say they go to great efforts to prepare their young players for England media scrutiny, which includes a briefing by Gary Neville, and it was decided that Kane would not do mixed zone duties.

Football agent Tony McGill continues his search for ‘peace of mind’ by proving he was wrongly cut out of the £300,000 fee agency SEM received for the Gavin McCann transfer from Aston Villa to Bolton eight years ago.

"If they didn't know it already, Jose Mourinho has issued a gentle warning to Chelsea's next generation of exciting starlets that he cannot absorb them all into his first-team squad. 'I cannot have a squad of 10 men and 10 kids,' said Mourinho, as his club prepare for their fourth successive FA Youth Cup final, at Manchester City. Ask around about youth development and most experts feel Chelsea are getting it right at Academy level. Jose Mourinho has issued a gentle warning to Chelsea's next generation that he cannot use them all at once . Chelsea captain isiah Brown celebrates with the trophy after victory in the UEFA Youth League final . Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been part of the the first-team at Chelsea and is set to get his chance next season . The Under 19s won the UEFA Youth League last week and the Under 18s will attempt to defend the Youth Cup against Manchester City, another club working hard with some signs of success in this area. Neither of them, however, has quite solved the problem of bridging the final void, converting this prized talent into first-team footballers. John Terry was the last at Chelsea, but one or two of this crop are considered to have a genuine chance and Mourinho has promised 19-year-old Ruben Loftus-Cheek his opportunity next season. 'Next season, Ruben will not be a kid in the development process,' said Mourinho. 'He will be a first-team player, absolutely ready to play and compete. And we will do the same with two or three or four players. 'Some of the older ones will go on loan to play every game in the Championship or the Premier League, even abroad. And we will bring some of the younger ones into the process. But to have them all at the same time in the first-team squad is hard. 'I cannot have a squad of 10 men and 10 kids. I must have a squad like we have now of 16 or 17 seniors and three or four kids.' John Terry was the last truly successful youth product at Chelsea and he has gone on to become captain . Terry celebrates after Chelsea beat Manchester United on Saturday to tighten their grip on the title . Strikers Isiah Brown, 18, and Dominic Solanke, 17, are earmarked for big things, but Loftus-Cheek, at Chelsea since the age of eight, has precisely what Mourinho wants in his midfield. He is tall, strong, athletic, and has poise on the ball. He is not dissimilar to Nemanja Matic in style and might just save the club £70million they might otherwise be tempted to spend on someone like Paul Pogba from Juventus. This would be an enormous boost for Chelsea as they wriggle within the confines of UEFA's Financial Fair Play. Strikers Isiah Brown, 18, and Dominic Solanke, 17, are earmarked for big things after the European success . Loftus-Cheek, at Chelsea since the age of eight, has precisely what Mourinho wants in his first-team midfield . Mourinho would like extra muscle in central midfield for the big games. His experiments with Kurt Zouma alongside Matic have gone quite well, but ideally, he would prefer someone who can perform the same defensive duties and still flex into attack with pace and vision. Also, he will need Zouma at centre half. Pogba would strengthen Mourinho's team but what signal would that send to Loftus-Cheek, and the rest of those striving to graduate at Cobham and the give the club something it craves? The Chelsea manager said: 'From that team that won the UEFA Youth League, four belong to my squad. Four are my players, first-team players who train with the first-team every day and develop with the first-team. When they're not selected with the first-team - and normally they're not selected - they go back and play there. 'Their development is easier when they're training every day with the first-team, doing pre-season, playing some matches, playing 20 minutes or half an hour in an FA Cup match, Capital One Cup match, even a Champions League match or in the league now and again. The tall, powerful midfielder got his chance to play at Stamford Bridge against Sporting Lisbon in December . Paul Pogba is a player Chelsea are looking at but would cost £70million, a cost they could do with avoiding . 'They belong to a process. I can't have 10 of these young players in my squad but I can have three or four and we did that with Loftus-Cheek, Brown, (Andreas) Christensen and (Nathan) Ake - and Solanke a few times.' In tandem with this quest to nurture their own, Chelsea still cast around the globe and are scrambling to sign 19-year-old Brazilian striker Nathan from Atletico Paranaense and 22-year-old Yoshinori Muto from Tokyo. When these names were thrown his way, Mourinho shrugged and replied: 'I'm not working on that, not at all. I don't make offers, I coach players.' On Nathan, he added: 'He's a player that our structure followed, and our structure thinks it's a player with potential for the future. Chelsea are set to announce the £4.5million signing of Brazilian wonderkid Nathan as part of their recruitment . Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto is another player Chelsea are interested in but Mourinho is not involved . 'If the deal is close, I will try to help him, as I try to help everyone, to become a Chelsea player. But he's not a player in my squad now, or a player I'm waiting for. I'm focused just on my job and my team. My team I love. My squad I love. The objective we are fighting for, I love it too.' His words reinforced the impression that one branch of Chelsea's development arm is busily signing, loaning and selling footballers with a view to economic gain; making money while hedging its bets in case one of these players turn out to be extra special. While another branch is focused more closely on producing players who might one day represent the club. Patrick Bamford is enjoying a very successful loan spells this season could force Mourinho into playing him . There is cross-over in the middle, of course, with those like Patrick Bamford and Bertrand Traore enjoying very successful loan spells this season and perhaps forcing Mourinho one day soon to consider if they are worth a chance in his squad. But as the manager has made clear, all these players are fighting for a maximum of 'three or four' places in the squad. It is a daunting task.","Chelsea have a successful academy playing in the FA Youth Cup final .

"You won’t find it written down anywhere in black and white yet it remains one of the unseen by-laws of the game: until such time as an almighty mess is sitting squarely on FIFA’s front step, the governing body chooses to keep the door bolted firmly shut. Rows over goal-line technology were hardly something new when Frank Lampard’s infamous ‘ghost’ goal against Germany in the 2010 World Cup finally brought matters to a head. The 2000 Africa Cup of Nations Final between Nigeria and Cameroon had already been scarred by a similar howler while the world watched agog five years later as a Pedro Mendez effort which crossed the line at Old Trafford was incredibly missed by all the officials despite keeper Roy Carroll ending up tangled in the rigging. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a goal-bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of Josh Meekings . Such was the hullabaloo over the incident involving the Portuguese star that FIFA did, in fact, begrudgingly make some noises about trialling goal-line systems but it was no more than platitudes to appease the masses. It took Lampard’s ruled-out effort in Bloemfontein – with the ball being clearly a yard over Manuel Neuer’s line in the last-16 match – for the dam to finally burst. Despite initially shrugging off calls for the adoption of goal-line technology to be approved, FIFA relented two years later with the system fully operational last year in Brazil. The lesson for Scottish football fans still bemused by events at Hampden Park on Sunday when the officials failed to spot a potentially game-changing handball? Perhaps only when such an outrage occurs in the World Cup in Russia in three years’ time will common sense prevail. For those who believe the SFA are intransigent to football embracing the kind of video technology that would have seen Josh Meekings red carded and Celtic awarded a penalty in the Scottish Cup semi-final, here’s some news… . In February, the International Football Board – the SFA, FA, Irish FA, Welsh FA and FIFA – gathered in Belfast supposedly to discuss the possibility of approving trials. Before the meeting, FA representative David Gill made no bones about his association’s stance. Griffiths heads the ball, which is deflected clearly off the hand of Inverness' Josh Meekings (left) on Sunday . ‘We can’t live in the past,’ he stated. ‘Greg Dyke the (FA chairman) has come out and said he embraces it, and I think in certain circumstances I would look at it. We’ve got to move forward. The game is getting much quicker. ‘The TV coverage, you know, 28, 30 cameras a game. Everything is replayed, replayed. So how do we use that? My personal view is yes, sensibly, but it needs to be done in a manner that doesn’t detract from the fast-paced, quick action of football.’ Despite cases also being forwarded by the SFA and Irish FA to at least take the matter further, FIFA, aided by a sceptical Welsh representative, simply kicked the matter into the long grass. It won’t be discussed again for at least another year now with the inevitable injustices far enough off the radar in the interim. ‘It’s a question of making the biggest decision ever in the way football is played,’ said FIFA’s secretary general Jerome Valcke by way of an explanation for its rejection afterwards. While that may well be the case, procrastinating on the issue is hardly likely to resolve it. Injustices like those that almost certainly cost Celtic a place in the Scottish Cup Final on Sunday are hardly a rarity in the global game. Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) has words with referee Steven McLean during the Scottish Cup semi-final . Yet, until such time as one directly affects the outcome of a World Cup match involving one of the game’s heavyweights, they seem set to remain an ugly, unsatisfying feature of the landscape. To the great embarrassment of Michel Platini, the stationing of additional officials behind both goals has proved to be an extraordinary waste of time. Seemingly less reluctant to get involved than traditional linesman, ‘additional assistant referees’ - to give them their Sunday names - have seemed utterly superfluous since they were first trialled in the 2009-10 Europa League. On Sunday, Alan Muir, the official behind the goal, should have had a clear view of Meekings’ handball. But for reasons best known to himself, he failed to advise referee Steven McLean on what seemed an inevitable course of action. It took the high-profile blunder that denied Frank Lampard in 2010 to shift FIFA on goal-line tecnhology . ‘I knew it was a penalty,’ said Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths. ‘I think everyone in the ground knew it was a penalty. I asked the ref why he didn’t give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him (Meekings) on the face.’ There is absolutely no excusing such crass incompetence. McLean and Muir should both have seen the handball with their own eyes and, even if one may have blinked at the wrong moment, assuredly one of them should have ensured the right call was made. That they didn’t is another blight on what’s been a desperate season for officiating in this country. Perhaps more than ever, the SFA now has good reason to press FIFA to at least road-test video technology. It’s hardly unchartered territory in sport. For those who prefer the oval ball game, a Television Match Official has been part of the fabric of rugby for 14 years now. No-one claims the system is perfect – decisions can often take longer to reach than they should - but few would dispute that it hasn’t enhanced the game because the right outcome is eventually arrived at. Lampard's disallowed goal forced FIFA to rethink, and Scottish fans must hope for a similar incident . Used only in first-class and international televised games, the TMO can only rule on exactly what the referee asks him. This usually involves, in try-scoring situations, whether a player’s foot has been in touch or to see if the ball has been properly grounded, but the TMO is also used to review if there has been dangerous or foul play. While the video review is normally conclusive, the snag – which is clearly a red flag for FIFA – is the time delay. At a recent Aviva Premiership match between Northampton Saints and Saracens, it took four minutes of review to award the winning try to the former while two other tries were disallowed. Edward Griffiths, the Saracens chief executive, later labelled the TMO process ‘a shambles’. ‘It’s almost make it up as you go along,’ Griffiths said. Indeed, rugby’s growing concern over the effect the TMO is having on the sport has led to Hawk-Eye, the ball-tracking technology company, to hold talks with the International Rugby Board about providing a replacement to the current system. Rugby's TMO may not be perfect, but it has shown that the game is better for use of technology . Hawk-Eye, which is already used in cricket, tennis and for goal-line decisions in football, says it can provide information for decisions within a few seconds by synchronising cameras from multiple angles. Paul Hawkins, the founder of Hawk-Eye, said: ‘Our system is a much cleverer way of looking at incidents. In Aussie Rules, we have halved the average time for decisions to be made.’ It can be assumed that, were FIFA to give tacit approval to video technology, Hawk-Eye would have just the programme to fit the bill. Using it sparingly would maintain the rhythm of football whilst ensuring that the 17 Laws of the Game are correctly applied. For football, the answers are already out there. If only someone would first ask the questions.","Celtic were denied place in Scottish Cup final by shocking decision .

"When Louis van Gaal talked about Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney as coaches on the pitch last week, it actually revealed far more than you might at first imagine. Football intelligence is something very few people are truly blessed with. Van Gaal was highlighting these two because of their superior football intelligence. The backdrop is a season at Old Trafford where Champions League football looks likely, but at the same time it is fair to say United have only been truly convincing in a few isolated games. Louis van Gaal has identified Michael Carrick (left) and Wayne Rooney as two of his most bright players . Van Gaal demands a level of 'football intelligence' from his players at Manchester United . United now have a eight-point cushion over Liverpool and are in good shape to make the Champions League . Van Gaal revealed why United have almost stumbled into the top four this season when he praised Carrick and Rooney. He basically said too many players at United aren’t very bright. In fact they’re pretty thick. Of course there are exceptions: Juan Mata is a cultured, classy individual on and off the pitch. Carrick and Rooney have football intelligence in abundance: hence Carrick slipping seamlessly in and out of the centre-half position mid-game at times this season, and Rooney slotting into whichever position Van Gaal asks him to occupy. The Dutchman can trust these players. Let me give you a couple of examples: last summer his first encounter with Luke Shaw was to set up a separate training regime for the teenager because he was so unfit. Shaw admitted his manager was right and accepted he need to step up his mentality at his new club. Spanish midfielder Juan Mata is another cultured, classy player in United's team . Rooney showed plenty of intelligence  to turn and volley home United's second goal on Saturday . Luke Shaw had to take part in extra pre-season training sessions to reach the necessary fitness levels . Imagine signing for Manchester United and being so unfit you can’t take part in pre-season training sessions. That’s what happened to Luke Shaw. Not very bright. Ander Herrera played well on Saturday but at one point in the first-half with United pressing he launched a ridiculous pass from the right-wing position, back into his own half. It sailed over Marcos Rojo’s head and the Argentina international had to chase back to retrieve it. It was a poor pass – that can happen. But choosing to make that pass in the first place was inexplicable. Van Gaal was clearly frustrated on the sidelines by this poor in-game management from a top player. Not very bright. Look at Phil Jones bulldozing his way into challenges and getting nowhere near the ball. I’m convinced that’s part of the reason he gets so many injuries. Not very bright. Marouane Fellaini is a good footballer, but he’s had several seasons of being turned into a target man by David Moyes. He had any football intelligence hammered out of him. He regressed – he became not very bright. Ander Herrera score twice against Aston Villa but also played a notably poor pass to Marcos Rojo . Phil Jones makes himself prone to injuries by crashing into tackles . Fellaini had his football intelligence hammered out of him by the disastrous David Moyes regime . A continental colleague told me that Van Gaal is frustrated by the lack of football intelligence he has found in the squad at Old Trafford. This is a guy used to working with erudite thinkers of the game at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. At these clubs there is a true football philosophy built up over years that has stood the test of time and stands proud despite managers coming and going. Van Gaal walked into United and found a club shorn of its direction. The dictator Sir Alex Ferguson was gone and any philosophy died with the departure of Fergie, and then Moyes's reign set the club back further. The United job is clearly far bigger than just signing Angel Di Maria and thinking everything will be fine. And this issue of a lack of football intelligence in the squad and at the club needs a long-term solution. But at 63 has van Gaal got the time to impose a new philosophy on the club, to teach that intelligence needed?","Very few Manchester United players possess the intelligence demanded .
Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata can claim to have it .

"The sense of burning injustice cannot be allowed to fester for too long; for all the psychobabble spouted about the strength of a siege mentality, there are few things more self-destructive than a suspicion that even the greatest effort may be undone by outside forces. The good news for Celtic is that they have an immediate opportunity to both vent their frustration and exorcise any sense of helplessness created by Sunday’s controversial Scottish Cup semi-final loss. The bad news? Ronny Deila’s men looked like a tired team by time-up at Hampden. As hard as they may have worked at building exactly the stamina needed for this stage of the season, having to play for some 70 minutes – including extra time – with 10 men inevitably left them appearing more than a little leggy. Celtic left back Emilo Izaguirre has called on his team-mates to focus their attention on winning the league title . Izaguirre and Celtic team-mates John Guidetti, Nir Bitton and Scott Brown look dejected during semi-final loss . Celtic are currently five points ahead of Aberdeen . As they travel to Dens Park to take on an always-dangerous Dundee, Deila, John Collins and the rest of his backroom team must find a way to lift – emotionally as much as physically – players who have seen a rare and historic Treble wrested from their grasp. Emilio Izaguirre, still low but trying to raise his eyes to the remaining challenge of finishing off with a domestic Double, said: ‘Now the Treble is finished. ‘We’ll try our best to win the league now - and next season we’ll try to win the Treble. Now it’s finished, everything is finished - and we must try our best to win the league. ‘It is hard to speak about the game after Inverness have won. It’s in the past and we must now work up the mentality now to win the league. ‘It is difficult with 10 men in a semi-final. Inverness are hungry and maybe more emotional. They controlled the ball and it was hard for us against 11 men. ‘To not have a Scottish Cup final to look forward to is so hard. We want to win the Treble but now it’s over. It’s all about winning the league now. ‘I don’t like to speak about the referee. It happens in football sometimes when bad decisions and good decisions change the game but it’s finished. Inverness won 3-2 and we’ll look to Wednesday. It’s important we move on and work on winning our next game.’ In the aftermath of such a sickening loss, Celtic have no option but to move on and concentrate on beating Dundee, re-establishing their commanding eight-point lead over nominal challengers Aberdeen. What neither Deila nor his players can afford to do, though, is completely ignore some of the lessons learned in defeat by Caley Thistle. Ignoring the obvious pointer about hoping a team umpteen officials can spot a deliberate handball on the line. The way in which Celtic were exposed by Inverness in the game’s *other* crucial moment, Marley Watkins out-pacing and out-muscling Adam Matthews before beating Craig Gordon to the ball, must be of concern. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a goal-bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of Josh Meekings . Virgil van Dijk, scorer of a wonderful opener on Sunday, admitted: ‘We will look at our own performance, because we lost. ‘It (the Josh Meekings handball) should be the key moment but the penalty wasn’t given so it’s nothing to talk about right now. We lost and we’re very disappointed. ‘We gave everything. With 10 men we kept on fighting, we had enough quality to create a goal but unfortunately it wasn’t enough. ‘It’s very disappointing of course but we need to move on. On Wednesday we play Dundee away. There is a lot of disappointment. Everybody is down but we are professionals and we need to focus on Dundee. ‘That’s a big game so we need to be ready for that. But first we need to recover.’ Celtic's Virgil van Dijk has also urged his team-mates to move on from their recent defeat by Inverness .","Emilo Izaguirre has rallied his team-mates ahead of final six league games .

"Raheem Sterling is earning less than Mario Balotelli. In fact he's earning less than half of what Balotelli is on at Liverpool. Puts a few things into perspective doesn't it? Liverpool Football Club have made some poor decisions in terms of signings and contracts since Luis Suarez departed, and those mistakes look set to cost them their place in the top four. For Brendan Rodgers' sake whoever is in charge of sorting out Sterling's new contract this summer needs to get it right. If they think they can afford to lose Suarez, Gerrard and Sterling in the space of 12 months they are very much mistaken. Raheem Sterling's contract negotiations have dominated the headlines in the past fortnight . Sterling shares a laugh in training ahead of Liverpool's FA Cup replay with Blackburn on Wednesday . Mario Balotelli earns more than double Sterling at present despite failing to perform in a Liverpool shirt . Sterling's agent has been accused of giving him bad advice. Apparently what people want his agent to tell him is that he's not particularly good, he's too young to earn big money, and he should sign whatever contract Liverpool offer him because he should be grateful just to even be there. The advice the agent gave was to turn down the contract offer and focus on football until the summer. Sounds reasonable to me. The big problem here is not the tired old narrative of a young greedy footballer. It's that Liverpool, through Rodgers, have repeatedly told the press and the fans that there would be no problem and Sterling would sign the new deal. In the middle of December, Rodgers described Sterling as 'a talisman' and told us he was confident he would stay. At the end of January, Rodgers told us the contract would be 'concluded imminently'. Last month he described the new offer to Sterling as 'incredible'. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has always insisted that the Sterling talks would be concluded soon . Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal, admitting he was 'flattered' by their interest . Rodgers has repeatedly insisted that Sterling will not be moving anywhere this summer . Liverpool find themselves seven points adrift in the race for the Champions League places . Rodgers has said things there he had no right to say, but those assurances he gave have now served to make Sterling and his agent out to be the bad guys. The astonished response of hypocritical ex-pros and pundits stuck in an era where the maximum wage still exists was blown up beyond proportion. 'How dare this greedy young man who's won nothing, scored less goals than Jon Walters (who thought that one up?) turn down this incredible offer from this great club. He should be grateful to be at such a club.' This was the standard response from people out of touch with the modern game. The 'incredible' deal was actually an offer which put Sterling on a par with Balotelli. Liverpool Football Club should be embarrassed by that offer to Raheem Sterling, a player who kept quiet last summer when he watched Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Balotelli all walk through the door and sign deals worth more than double what he was on. He then stayed quiet while his performances were being scrutinised more than most in the absence of Suarez and Sturridge, with Lallana injured at the start of the campaign and with Gerrard fading fast. Adam Lallana has been hindered by injuries since he arrived at Anfield from Southampton last summer . Dejan Lovren also arrived at Liverpool from Southampton in the summer and earns more than Sterling . The departure of Steven Gerrard to the MLS this summer will free up space on Liverpool's wage bill . Meantime Rodgers said there would be no issue with Sterling signing again, so when it turned out there was a problem, Sterling was instantly the bad guy, along with his agent. Now the message from those who want to bring Sterling down is that he's not very good. 'He's not good enough to move to a bigger club' (since when were Liverpool a small club by the way?) 'He would be stuck on the bench if he moved.' 'Coutinho is better.' 'Let him go, Jordan Ibe is coming through.' If people want to believe all that it's up to them, but it won't alter these facts: . Steven Gerrard and Glen Johnson are set to leave this summer which will free up a huge amount of the wages budget at Anfield. Philippe Coutinho would provide an alternative should Sterling depart Anfield in the summer . The emergence of teenage winger Jordon Ibe also suggests there could be life beyond Sterling at Liverpool . Sterling should be playing Champions League football - something Liverpool may not offer next season . Gerrard knows all about contract situations not being addressed, and that's why he said two months ago that the club need to sort out the futures of Sterling and Henderson 'before it's too late'. It was an important message from the captain that got lost in all the negative spin aimed at bringing Sterling and his agent's credibility down. The last two defeats have brought the debate back to where it should be: the mistakes made by Rodgers and Liverpool. Ramping up the hate towards a young English player who wants to play in the Champions League and wants to earn significantly more than a total waste of space like Mario Balotelli will hopefully now be seen for what it is – a way of deflecting from the real issues at Anfield. What's really disappointing is that a young talented player has had to put up with all this criticism. It's classically English I'm afraid. Those critics should be ashamed of themselves. Seriously - imagine if Real Madrid do want Sterling this summer, as Liverpool prepare for a Europa League campaign. Would it be good advice to turn down that move?","Raheem Sterling is currently earning less than half Mario Balotelli's salary .

"Peter Moores found himself in the familiar position of defending his captain on Saturday with Alastair Cook badly needing runs and wins in the last two Tests of the series to stop the mood for change in English cricket claiming him as its next victim. England’s failure to win the first Test and Cook’s failure in both innings leaves the captain in the spotlight. Yet Moores, under pressure himself after the sacking of Paul Downton as managing director, remains steadfast in his backing for Cook and is adamant he will turn things round in Grenada, starting on Tuesday, and in Barbados. Peter Moores has been forced to defend his captain with Alastair Cook badly needing runs and wins . England’s failure to win the first Test and Cook’s failure in both innings leaves the captain in the spotlight . ‘I’ve known lots of people in sport and, in terms of character, Cook is one of the strongest,’ said Moores. ‘Even though he didn’t get a score here you could see he’s found some form, with the way he’s hitting the ball and moving. ‘It was frustrating, but he’s a very good player and it’s almost been forgotten how strongly he finished the Test summer against India.’ Perhaps a bigger concern for England will be the form of Jonathan Trott, who looked both frenetic and unconvincing on his return to the side 18 months after leaving the Ashes tour. ‘Trott has earned the right to get a go,’ said Moores when explaining why he was preferred to Adam Lyth. ‘He went back to Warwickshire, scored runs and then captained and played well on the Lions tour of South Africa. Cook stands alongside Denesh Ramdin at the end of match ceremonies during day five of the 1st Test match . ‘We can see he’s really hungry to do well again and is playing well but he’s been done by the swinging ball. ‘It was his first Test for a long time and that was always going to be tough but this is a player who has played some brilliant innings for England and he’s got a good chance now to show that he’s still got that ability.’ Moeen Ali will join the side in Grenada and is expected to play in the second Test, especially as James Tredwell damaged his shoulder diving to attempt to take a catch here on Friday. Cook, Chris Jordan and Jos Buttler show their frustration as a chance is missed and game heads to a draw . England have also decided to keep Adil Rashid with them at least for the next week even though Yorkshire wanted him to return to them. Four of the six Yorkshire players in this England squad missed out on selection for the first Test while the county champions have been further weakened by an injury to Ryan Sidebottom. ‘We’ve a 17-man squad now which is a bit top heavy but we don’t know yet where Moeen is at,’ said Moores. ‘At the end of the next Test we will see where we are and if it feels relevant to let someone move on we will do that. Kemar Roach  edges past Alastair Cook at first slip off the bowling of James Anderson . ‘I have sympathy with Yorkshire but I know Adil is desperate to stay here and work on his game. He has worked really hard to get into this environment and he’s learning a lot and working very hard to get a go in this series.’ The pressure was increased on Moores, Cook and England by new ECB chairman Colin Graves’ description of West Indies as ‘mediocre’ before this series and his promise of an inquiry if they are not defeated. However, the coach insisted: ‘We have only one focus and that is to win this series. We’ve drawn the first Test after dominating so now it is a two-match series and we have to ignore everything on the outside.’","Peter Moores has come to the defence of England captain Alastair Cook .

"It’s 11 years since Arsenal won the title. They went from Invincibles to Incapables. And you can throw bottlers into that description as well. Of course Chelsea could implode and hand the title to Arsenal over the next six weeks or so, but that’s unlikely. If it does happen it’s a title that’s long overdue and nothing can ever take away the barren years when Arsenal and Arsene Wenger were an embarrassment at home and abroad – specialists in failure. Those years will always hang heavy around Wenger’s neck. Yes, yes, there’s the FA Cup currently sitting there in the trophy cabinet alongside the shiny shield they won in August. And yes, yes, they are clear favourites to win it again. An FA Cup isn’t the definition of success for the great clubs of Europe. Only the Wenger apologists can’t see that. Olivier Giroud celebrates Arsenal's third goal by Alexis Sanchez in their win over Liverpool on Saturday . Arsene Wenger's Gunners now have 15 wins from 17 games since New Year's Day, but it's come too late . So are Gooners seduced by this end of season run they’re currently on? It’s impressive, no question. 15 wins in 17 games since their loss New Year’s Day. But this is classic Arsene Wenger isn’t it? After that defeat at Southampton on January 1 the Gunners were sixth in the table, 13 points behind leaders Chelsea. Wenger and the players felt they had no hope of winning the title, and so they started to play with freedom, and the wins kept coming. As soon as the pressure is off, Arsene Wenger looks like he can still do it. But once the pressure is on he crumbles, and his players lose their bottle completely. Sanchez drills his shot by Emre Can as Arsenal's impressive run continued against Liverpool . Per Mertesacker can't stop this shot from Sadio Mane as they fall 2-0 to Southampton on New Year's Day . The only two defeats in this current run were the two key games all Arsenal fans desperately wanted to win – at Tottenham and at home to Monaco in the Champions League: the two games with more pressure on them than any others on this run. They went to Monaco for the second leg with no pressure on them, everyone thought they were out, and so it proved. But with the pressure off, Arsenal turned it on. Arsenal are clearly a lot better than most of the teams they face. And they are now making the kind of signings they should be making – marquee players. So much is in place for real success to come. But the task for Wenger now is to show some balls, cope better when the pressure is on. And he and his players need to stop failing in certain games. Harry Kane celebrates his second strike in the 2-1 win for Tottenham over their North London rivals . Dimitar Berbatov scores the second of three away goals for Monaco that ruined Arsenal's Europe campaign . Dodgy results will happen to all sides of course. But I’m talking about the ones that should have been avoided. This season for example, if they’d won a game they were winning at Swansea, if they hadn’t been so desperately pathetic in the first half at Stoke, and if they’d kept the lead at 10-man Liverpool, Arsenal would be top. Those games and the circumstances of how they dropped points, have stopped Arsenal being serious title contenders this season. When you analyse it like that, you can understand the frustrations of the Arsenal fans after that Stoke defeat in December. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain slumps to the ground as Arsenal bow out of the Champions League last 16 . Aaron Ramsey scores in the Gunners' 2-0 win at Monaco as they fell short again when it really counts . Arsene Wenger has been given time to fail repeatedly, and he’s still there. He now needs to make the most of his incredible good fortune and start earning his £8m a year as the fourth-highest-paid football manager in the world. Winning games when the pressure is off is something Wenger has proved he can do regularly. Now he needs to learn how to cope and succeed when the pressure is on. If he does that, then there really is no reason why Arsenal can’t win a major trophy, the kind of trophy that defines success for big clubs, and end an embarrassing period of failure for Arsene Wenger.","Arsenal have a chance at the Premier League title if Chelsea throw it away .

"Celtic have written to the Scottish Football Association in order to gain an 'understanding' of the refereeing decisions during their Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Inverness on Sunday. The Hoops were left outraged by referee Steven McLean's failure to award a penalty or red card for a clear handball in the box by Josh Meekings to deny Leigh Griffith's goal-bound shot during the first-half. Caley Thistle went on to win the game 3-2 after extra-time and denied Rory Delia's men the chance to secure a domestic Treble this season. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a goal-bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of Josh Meekings . Celtic's Adam Matthews (right) slides in with a strong challenge on Nick Ross in the Scottish Cup semi-final . 'Given the level of reaction from our supporters and across football, we are duty bound to seek an understanding of what actually happened,' Celtic said in a statement. They added, 'We have not been given any other specific explanation so far and this is simply to understand the circumstances of what went on and why such an obvious error was made.' However, the Parkhead outfit made a point of congratulating their opponents, who have reached the first-ever Scottish Cup final in their history, describing Caley as a 'fantastic club' and saying 'reaching the final is a great achievement.' Celtic had taken the lead in the semi-final through defender Virgil van Dijk's curling free-kick on 18 minutes, but were unable to double that lead thanks to the Meekings controversy. It allowed Inverness a route back into the game and Celtic had goalkeeper Craig Gordon sent off after the restart for scything down Marley Watkins in the area. Greg Tansey duly converted the resulting penalty. Edward Ofere then put Caley Thistle ahead, only for John Guidetti to draw level for the Bhoys.

"Inverness Cup hero Gary Warren has called for a change to the 'ridiculous' rule that will see him banned from a second final in successive seasons. Warren picked up his second booking of the competition in Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final win over Celtic – meaning automatic suspension for the season finale on May 30. But the central defender, who also missed last year's League Cup Final for the same reason, says either the threshold should be raised – or all cards should be wiped from the record for any show-piece final. Inverness defender Gary Warren will miss the Scottish Cup final after picking up his second yellow card . Warren was shown a yellow card for this challenge on Celtic's James Forrest (right) during the semi-final . 'Having two bookings (as the limit) in a cup competition is ridiculous,' said Warren. 'Especially being a defender, it means you can't tackle - and that's part and parcel of being a defender, making challenges, making interceptions, making blocks. 'To have something like that taken away from you is a little bit gutting. I think it should be looked at. They should either increase the number of bookings needed to get a suspension - or, if you get to the final, wipe it out completely. 'Then it's fair for everyone, every team that gets to the semi-final, whoever is booked knows it's a clean slate for the final.' Warren knew instantly that he'd miss the final when ref Steven McLean rightly showed him a yellow card for hauling back James Forrest. More annoying for the 30-year-old is that his previous booking in the competition came for dissent, as he explaining: 'That was my own fault gobbing off to a referee. That's disappointing because I should have kept my mouth shut. It was against Partick Thistle, that's me getting frustrated and being too gobby to the referee. 'That hurts the most because this one was a tackle and a foul but the first one was a very silly booking. I'm 30 years old and I should know better. 'When you come into this game you always think about it and wonder what if - but if you start allowing it to play on your mind then you're going to pull out of tackles. I won't do that. Warren feels that the rule to have players suspended for amassing just two yellows is 'ridiculous' Celtic's Adam Matthews (right) slides in with a challenge on Nick Ross (left) during the Scottish Cup semi-final .

"Captain Alastair Cook says England will leave Antigua with 'a bit of a downer on' after failing to force victory in the first Test against the West Indies. The tourists, chasing a first away win since beating India in December 2012, were halted by a stubbornly unresponsive pitch at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, as well as a name-making century from all-rounder Jason Holder. In the end they could only muster five of the eight wickets they needed on day five as Holder's unbeaten 103 steered the hosts to 350 for seven. Alastair Cook holds his head in his hands after the chance to take a crucial wicket goes begging in Antigua . Cook stands next to West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin as both sides settled for a draw in the first Test . Cook did everything in his power to force the issue, rotating his bowlers, tinkering with fields and leaving close catchers in place from first ball to last. But in the end he was deflated, with just three days before the second Test in Grenada. 'I think the whole dressing room has a bit of a downer on because we left everything on the pitch, as we had to do,' he said. 'I wouldn't swap much of what we did on a pretty docile wicket, but credit to Holder because he soaked up a bit of pressure. 'I think you could start another Test match again on that wicket and it would last another five days. It didn't deteriorate at all but we came close to winning a Test match on it. Jason Holder hits a shot past cook on his way to his maiden Test century that earned his side a deserved draw . 'We threw everything at the West Indies, we played a pretty good Test match and came up just a little short. 'It was probably a points victory but we go to Grenada now.' England are unlikely to get much more assistance from the deck in St George's, though it could be more receptive to turn. That brings Moeen Ali into the equation, with the off-spinning all-rounder passed fit after an abdominal injury and linking up with the squad in Grenada. England will also be wary about over-burdening their seam bowlers in back to back Tests, but Cook was not ready to speculate on possible personnel changes. 'It's very tough to say without seeing Grenada and the wicket, but Mo is flying out and we'll see how he is,' said Cook. Devon Smith drives a shot past Cook on his way to 65 runs in a patient 175-ball second innings . 'Obviously when you do 130 overs in the dirt you need to see how the guys pull up.' England's task now is find a way to bowl their opponents out twice on flat Caribbean surfaces, a question that was already occupying James Anderson on the day he became the country's leading Test wicket-taker. 'For a fifth day pitch I've not seen many flatter. You expect a bit of deterioration but there was nothing,' said the seamer. 'I imagine that's what we'll get for the next two games too so we have to go away and think about ways to get 20 wickets in the next two games.' For all England's frustration, the West Indies will view the result as a morale boost. Captain Denesh Ramdin added: 'We haven't lost to England in Antigua before so it was nice to keep up that tradition. 'The draw will feel good, confidence is up and some of our batters have got good starts. 'So we regroup, come again and take it all to the next game.' The England players leave the field frustrated after day five ends with West Indies having forced the draw .","England denied first tour win since December 2012 by stubborn hosts .

"It's such a crying shame that only now are people starting to realise what a vital player Michael Carrick is to England. When captain Wayne Rooney said after the draw in Italy on Tuesday that Carrick was the 'best player on the pitch by a mile', and that he 'dictated the game' he summed up what England have been missing since he signed for Manchester United in 2006. Successive England managers kept beating themselves up trying to solve the Lampard/Gerrard conundrum in midfield, but ironically it was a Scot who presented the answer to them. Michael Carrick gets ahead of Italy striker Ciro Immobile during Tuesday night's friendly in Turin . Carrick applauds the travelling England supporters in Turin after winning his 33rd cap against Italy . For all Carrick's achievements with Manchester United, he has been consistently overlooked by England . Sir Alex Ferguson signed Carrick for £18million, trusted him in midfield, and United dominated domestically and even became Champions of Europe in an era when Guardiola, Messi and Barcelona were taking their place in history as one of the greatest ever club sides. That's why I firmly believe that had Michael Carrick been a regular in England's midfield for the past 10 years, we would have won a major tournament in that time. You can disagree, but you cannot prove me wrong. Carrick has a 100 per cent record with England at the World Cup. He's only ever played in one game at the tournament, and England won it 1-0 against Ecuador in the round of 16 in 2006. He's a World Cup Invincible. Sven Goran Eriksson dropped him for the next game, the quarter-final against Portugal, and England went out. What followed is inexplicable: from October 2006 through to September 2012 Michael Carrick didn't play a single meaningful competitive game for England. Sir Alex Ferguson realised the abilities that Carrick could bring to his Manchester United team . Carrick gets stuck in to Lionel Messi during the 2009 Champions League final with Barcelona in Rome . Carrick has played in 377 matches for Manchester United in his nine seasons with the club . Carrick (right) has lifted the Premier League trophy on five occasions at Old Trafford . Premier League (5): 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13 . Football League Cup (1): 2009-10 . FA Community Shield (5): 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013 . UEFA Champions League (1): 2007-08 . FIFA Club World Cup (1): 2008 . In that same time period Carrick won four Premier League titles, a Champions League, and played in two other Champions League finals. England lumbered and stumbled on with the likes of Jermaine Jenas (21 caps), Scott Parker (18) and Gareth Barry (an incredible 53) all lucky to get the number of caps they did. Sir Alex Ferguson, arguably the greatest manager of all time, picked Carrick. But Steve McLaren and Fabio Capello did not. Who called it right? Fergie kept winning trophies, but McLaren failed to qualify for the 2008 European Championships, while Capello's 2010 World Cup campaign in South Africa was lifeless . Worse still, Capello took Carrick to that tournament, but then didn't give him a single minute on the pitch. All I remember of England in South Africa was that we simply could not keep the ball. We couldn't pass to each other. That's what Carrick brings to a team. Capello didn't even take time to sit down and explain to Carrick why he was being left out despite the shambles being played out by the players he did pick. Carrick celebrates his recent goal for Man United against Tottenham at Old Trafford . Carrick celebrates with Wayne Rooney after scoring a vital goal for United at Wigan in May 2009 . Carrick hasn't scored too many goals during his career but his stunner against Roma in 2007 stands out . Carrick's goal set United on their way to a 7-1 victory that registers amongst their great European nights . Carrick must have been wondering why he'd bothered leaving his wife and newborn son to go to the other side of the world and watch that horrible mess. Gary Neville told me this about Carrick: 'The players that play with him love him, and Sir Alex has picked him in probably 95 per cent of games during the most successful period of Manchester United's history. 'What he does isn't 'wow', it's largely unseen stuff, but a lot of midfielders don't do it.' Carrick is capable of the spectacular, take a look at this pass against Chelsea from 2013. In Turin on Tuesday, Ross Barkley and Andros Townsend caught the eye with their impact, but they were afforded the freedom to run with the ball, take risks and be adventurous because Carrick was so disciplined behind them. Critics continue with their tired old nonsense about how he isn't quick enough, and he's not spectacular, or he doesn't score goals. These criticisms are SO English, the kind of dinosaur thinking that's been holding our game back all these years. Two years ago I went to United's training ground to interview Carrick. I asked him about the job he does for the team, his role. Carrick celebrates with Robin van Persie (left) and Adnan Januzaj after scoring against Fulham last season . Carrick has won five Premier League titles at Manchester United - the last of which came in 2013 . Carrick jumps for joy after Robin van Persie scored a last-minute free-kick at Manchester City in 2012 . Carrick was never able to convince England manager Fabio Capello to give him a regular starting berth . Carrick was handed his England debut back in 2001 when Mexico were beaten 4-0 at Pride Park in Derby . Carrick shadows Marco Verratti during England's ill-fated European Championship quarter-final in 2012 . He put it very simply: 'I'm just there to help the defence and act as extra cover for them really, to stop the supply into opposition front players. 'At the same time to service our attackers and wide men; it's my job to keep the flow of service as much as possible to them and let them create and score goals.' A few weeks later he won his fifth title in seven years at Old Trafford. Not bad for someone who is criticised for not being spectacular. His best performance in an England shirt came in Berlin in 2008 when England won 2-1. He was man of the match and controlled the midfield. That was a few months after Germany had reached the European Championship final. Forget player-for-player comparisons for a moment and look at the role he plays in the team. It's similar to what Sergio Busquets did for Spain when they won a World Cup and a European Championship. And before him Marcos Senna did the same job in that Spain midfield. Carrick's finest hour came in 2008 as England defeated Germany 2-1 in Berlin's Olympiastadion . Carrick performs a similar role to Spain's holding midfielder Sergio Busquets . Marcos Senna has also performed the Carrick role for the Spanish team with great success . Carrick may not quite be at the level of Italy's Andrea Pirlo but he's the closest England have got . Those two winners have over 100 caps between them, and only three goals. It wasn't their job to score. Neither were quick, but they didn't need to be. In that position they read the game, looked after the ball, and got the team going the other way. These players are not famous for their tackling prowess either. They usually get to the ball before they need to dive into a challenge. And then there's Andrea Pirlo. It would be hard to make a case to say Carrick is as good as Pirlo, but he is certainly the closest this country can offer. Which is why watching England struggle to deal with him at the last World Cup made Roy Hodgson's decision to leave Carrick at home bewildering. It looks like Hodgson has come to his senses on that one. What a shame previous England managers couldn't see what Sir Alex Ferguson was showing them. It wasn't just Fergie who could see it: at the end of the 2012-13 season Arsene Wenger said Carrick was his player of the year: 'He is a quality passer. He could play for Barcelona, he would be perfectly suited to their game. Louis van Gaal has quickly come to appreciate Carrick since arriving at Manchester United . Carrick's performances against Arsenal have drawn praise from the Gunners boss Arsene Wenger . 'I think Carrick is an underrated player in England and sometimes not only should the goalscorer be rewarded but also the real players at the heart of the game.' And Louis van Gaal has learned in a short space of time at Old Trafford just how important Carrick is. Have a look at United's season – the better runs for the team have come when Carrick has been fit. Van Gaal said recently: 'Michael Carrick is more or less a trainer-coach. He is also willing to talk about shapes and systems.' Van Gaal has worked with some truly brilliant footballers in his career, that's high praise indeed for Carrick. On the pitch, in that key position in central midfield, Carrick has that football intelligence and spatial awareness that so few players possess. Sir Alex Ferguson made mistakes, but he didn't keep making the same mistake for seven successive seasons. While United were winning with him, England were losing without him. Would England have won the Euros, or a World Cup with Carrick in the team? I think so. I know for certain we would have had a much better chance.","Carrick made just his 33rd appearance for England in Italy on Tuesday .

"Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood kept faith with Jack Grealish, the 19-year-old academy graduate, after handing him his first Premier League start against Queens Park Rangers a fortnight ago. The young midfielder did not disappoint, playing a part in Christian Benteke’s equaliser and then setting up Fabian Delph’s winner. ‘The bigger the stage the better he plays, the more he relishes it,’ said Sherwood who saw Grealish outshine Liverpool’s experienced internationals Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson in midfield. ‘That’s the sign of a good talent.’ Jack Grealish runs at Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel in a game where he adapted well to the big stage . The youngster had a hand in Christian Benteke's goal as Aston villa stunning Liverpool at Wembley . Grealish could not wait to share his excitement with Villa fans, tweeting it was the ‘Best feeling of my life!!’ and posting pictures from inside the victorious dressing room. Sherwood added: ‘Jack’s someone I looked at before I was at the club and when I’ve seen him in training, if you give him an instruction he sticks to the plan. He’s got a big future at the club.’ Grealish, who wears children’s shinpads and socks rolled down, won two free-kicks for his team through dribbling with the ball. ‘He’s very durable,’ said Sherwood. ‘You should see the size of his legs, he’s still a kid. He takes more kicks in training than he does on the pitch so he’s getting a lot of practice fending off kicks — he probably needs bigger pads!’ Grealish (right) a posted to Twitter of him celebrating with Fabian Delph (left) and Gabriel Agbonlahor .

"Aston Villa match-winner Fabian Delph was left pinching himself after booking his side's place in the FA Cup final at the expense of Liverpool. Villa skipper Delph set up Christian Benteke's equaliser after Philippe Coutinho opened the scoring for the Reds and then rounded off a superb afternoon by sweeping home nine minutes into the second half to secure a 2-1 victory. Delph's strike means that Tim Sherwood's charges will return to Wembley to face holders Arsenal in next month's showpiece and the former Leeds midfielder says it will be a dream come true.

To walk out as captain is going to be the highlight of my career. So happy days, I'm happy for the boys,' he told BT Sport 1. The 25-year-old England international reserved special praise for Sherwood for the job he has done since taking over in February when the club looked to be in deep trouble in the drop zone. Big wins over West Brom, Sunderland and Tottenham in the league, as well as the cup run, since then have lifted the mood around Villa Park and Delph feels Sherwood deserves a lot of credit for the remarkable turnaround. Christian Benteke, who struck the equaliser for Villa in the 36th minute, salutes the Villa fans after the game . 'The gaffer (Sherwood) is brilliant. He's positive with everybody. He doesn't panic. He's got a game plan and we stuck to it and there were a lot of young lads in the team,' he said. 'Young Jack (Grealish) has come in today and done fantastic and we're just happy. We're thrilled for the fans.' Delph now feels they can use their cup run as a springboard to secure Barclays Premier League survival and is not worried the final will become a distraction. Young Villa midfielder Grealish showed maturity beyond his years during the contest at Wembley . 'We're confident we'll come through it. We'll put that aside for today and honestly the next game we've got to think about is one in the Premier League,' he added. Jack Grealish, who only made his first Premier League start 12 days ago, impressed throughout the contest. The young Villa midfielder tweeted after the match: 'Best feeling off my life!! So happy for all the fans!! What a game, can't even express how much this means to me.' Sherwood was understandably in bullish mood after the landmark victory in only his 10th match as Villa boss and when asked how much he is enjoying life in the Midlands he replied: ""Well it's going all right at the moment. The victorious Villa side celebrate their FA Cup semi-final triumph at the final whistle . ""We're delighted with that obviously. We were the underdogs today but we believed in there that we could win it and I think we outplayed Liverpool to be honest. ""We kept the ball off them, created lots of chances and they resorted to lumping the ball into our area in the last 10 minutes so you know you are doing something right when they're doing that."" The former Tottenham boss, who played a key role in the development of Harry Kane, also reserved special praise for 19-year-old winger Jack Grealish. He was a constant threat down the left for Villa and was involved in the build-up play that led to Delph's winning goal. ""He could be right up there amongst the best of them. The ball is his friend. He likes to receive it he doesn't look at it, he knows where it is, he shifts it, he's got a turn of foot, takes a lot of knocks, but he can take it. He's a big lad,"" Sherwood said. ""He's Aston Villa through and through. He lives a couple of miles from the ground, he just wants to play for the club and I want to give him the platform to do that because he's earned the right.""","Aston Villa beat Liverpool 2-1 at Wembley to book their FA Cup final place .

"It was meant to be the story of Jimmy Anderson breaking the England Test wicket-taking record and bowling England to victory in his 100th Test but eventually this became the tall tale of a new West Indian star. The perfect English script was ruined here on Friday night by the giant figure of Jason Holder who repelled everything that Anderson and co could hurl at him to make his maiden Test century at No 8 and earn his side a deserved draw. Anderson had finally taken his 384th wicket in Test cricket when West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin edged him to his great friend Alastair Cook at slip. Yet that was to be the final English success in a gripping final day of this first Test as Holder, batting with a maturity way beyond his batting position and his tender years, not only held out but went to his century in some style. What a mixture of emotions for Anderson and England, who have been left in no doubts by Colin Graves that they have to win this three-Test series against a side the new ECB chairman condemned as ‘mediocre.’ They failed at the first attempt in what became close to a carbon-copy of the last Test England played in Antigua six years ago when West Indies held on for a draw with nine wickets down after England had set them a vast target. The ultimate frustration spoiled the day for the great team man Anderson, who punched the air and screamed his delight when he took his second and what turned out to be his last wicket of a gruelling day. Anderson has had ups and downs since claiming Zimbabwe’s Mark Vermeulen as his first Test victim 12 years ago at Lord’s but now he had finally overtaken Sir Ian Botham as the most prolific bowler in England’s Test history. There was a warm embrace too from his captain Cook, who has been one of Anderson’s closest friends in cricket ever since they journeyed together from an A tour in the Caribbean in 2006 to join England in India. In the stands were Anderson’s parents Michael and Catherine and his wife Daniella who, together with his young daughters Lola and Ruby, had travelled here for his 100th Test and the excited expectation of an England record. Meanwhile, up in the commentary box, Botham applauded a man who he sees as worthy successor to him as the holder of a record he has held for so long.

Yet any thoughts England had of celebrating both Anderson’s record and what would have been a priceless win were denied by a 6ft 7in 23-year-old who provides genuine hope for the future of decaying Caribbean cricket. Holder is first and foremost a fast bowler but he has already been made one-day captain by West Indies and now they can regard him, as Sir Viv Richards believes, a genuine all-rounder who can lead his maligned side forward. England had taken three of the eight wickets they needed on the final day in the morning session to take any remote chances of a historic West Indian victory out of the equation and push England towards the winning post.

'Huge congrats on your well deserved record @jimmy9' - Phil Tufnell . 'Huge congratulations to @jimmy9 on becoming England's leading Test wicket taker. Brilliant achievement. Next target 500 wickets please.' - Alec Stewart . Yet after Devon Smith and Jermaine Blackwood, who became the only casualty between lunch and tea, had thrown their wickets away with two of the worst shots any side seeking a draw can ever have played in Test cricket, Holder stepped forward to save the day. First the Barbadian shared a stand of 105 with his Test captain Ramdin that ate up 32 priceless overs and then when Anderson had claimed his historic victim in Ramdin, Kemar Roach joined his giant team-mate to clinch a draw. Holder’s unbeaten 103, sealed with two majestic straight boundaries off James Tredwell, could have ended on 66 when Billy Bowden gave him out caught down the legside even though Anderson barely appealed. Technology rightly reinstated Holder who then, agonisingly for England, could have been caught in bizarre fashion when he drove Tredwell into Gary Ballance’s boot at silly mid-off only to see the ball balloon up just out of the reach of the diving bowler. That was pretty much it for England, who could not ultimately force their way through a largely disciplined West Indies on a pitch that refused to deteriorate and with the ball refusing to swing. It is difficult to be too harsh on them. Cook’s declaration came at the right time, giving his side 130 overs to bowl West Indies out and leaving them with very little chance of victory. England’s six-man attack gave it their all but perhaps did not bowl enough yorkers when it became clear that neither pitch not conditions were providing any help for them. Instead, as they invariably do, England’s pace bowlers erred on the short side of a good length too often. Tredwell, preferred to the inconsistent leg-spinner Adil Rashid, may have taken four wickets in the first innings but he could add only one more in the second when he was most needed and is vulnerable to the returning Moeen Ali when these sides meet again in the second Test in Grenada on Tuesday. Cook will start that match under pressure having failed twice with the bat and failed to secure the victory which would have reduced the chances of his side facing an ‘inquiry’ if they fail to win here, as Graves has promised. At least England can celebrate the success of Anderson, who may have become England’s leading bowler but still has to look up at 13 performers worldwide who have more wickets than him. Surely the 400th wicket will come soon but a hectic schedule of 16 more Tests over the next nine months is going to test his enduring fitness and stamina to its very limits. He needs to be wrapped up in cotton wool, told to concentrate solely on Test cricket, and treated like the gem he is. England, with two Tests to perhaps save the skins of their captain and coach, need a fit and firing Jimmy Anderson, at 32, more than ever.

Maxwell - 6 - The former Barcelona full-back will have been grateful for the suspension of Daniel Alves, allowing him a less stressful evening from a defensive point of view against the more conservative Martin Montoya. Good delivery going the other way. Blaise Matuidi - 7 - Powerful and determined, he inherited the captain's armband when Silva went off injured and produced a relentless midfield performance. You can understand why Manchester United scouted him so closely last season. Yohan Cabaye - 5 - A dreadful lunge on Iniesta summed up a difficult first half for the Frenchman. Lacks the ball quality of Marco Verratti and the defensive acumen of Thiago Motta, who were sorely missed in the midfield. Booked. Former Newcastle United star Yohan Cabaye (left) struggled and looked out of his depth at times . Adrien Rabiot - 6 - A courageous performance from the youngster. Good energy and didn't shy away from the challenge. Ezequiel Lavezzi - 5.5 - Little impact from the winger. Moments of quality few and far between. Edinson Cavani - 5.5 - So often leaves you wanting more in these pivotal games. Denied by a marvellous Mascherano challenge in the first half but lacked the conviction to really take on the opportunity. Reported Manchester United target Edinson Cavani had no luck in front of goal and was wasteful . Javier Pastore 6 - Brilliant opening very early on in the game but miskicked badly. Subs . David Luiz (Silva, 21) - 5.5 - Was treated by a Russian doctor for his hamstring injury - recommended by Andre Villas Boas - in a bid to get back in time for the game. However, he didn't look fully fit and was exposed for Suarez's first goal. David Luiz (32) had a torrid time after he replaced Silva and was nutmugged twice for Suarez's two goals . Lucas (for Rabiot, 65) - 5 - Couldn't influence the game as Suarez strengthened his grip with second and third goals. Bookings: Cabaye . Subs not used: Douchez, Camara, Bahebeck, Digne, Kimpembe . Manager: Laurent Blanc - 6 - Must have felt like he was playing with a player less with Verratti, Luiz and Ibrahimovic all unable to start. To lose captain Silva so early was a bitter blow, too, . Barcelona . Marc-Andre ter Stegen - 6 - Little chance with the consolation goal but one excellent stop to deny Cavani. Growing in stature. Martin Montoya - 6 - Lacks the marauding energy of Daniel Alves but didn't put a foot wrong in assured showing. Gerard Pique - 6.5 - Overcome the problems of earlier in the campaign and resembles a world-class centre back once again. Javier Mascherano - 8 - Such a brilliant reader of the game. Several superb challenges and his transition from midfield to defence has been almost seamless. No wonder Roy Hodgson admires him so much. Javier Mascherano proved how important he is to Barcelona with another impressive display at the back . Jordi Alba - 6.5 - Usual energetic self, offering menace in attack and robust defending. Sergio Busquets - 7 - The pivot that holds this Barcelona midfield together. Precise on the ball and his movement without it is terrific. Ivan Rakitic - 5.5 - Quiet night and not at his creative best. Still a way to go to demonstrate he can hold a place in this team in the long-term. Andres Iniesta - 6 - A first touch that should be taught to every child with aspirations of making the grade in the game. Usual excellent movement and passing. Luis Suarez - 8.5 - Quiet first half but came alive in scintillating fashion to decide the game and almost definitely the tie. Suarez was in top form and embarrassed Luiz for his two goals, showing off his genius ability . Lionel Messi - 6.5 - Sliced PSG apart with surgical precision to set up Neymar's opening goal. Neymar - 7.5 - There had been suggestions Neymar is unhappy that his manager replaces him so regularly during games. An early goal, tucked away so clinically, is a good way to stop that happening. Lionel Messi was instrumental in the opening goal for Neymar and was tidy throughout the clash . Neymar opened the scoring with a neat finish and cause Van der Wiel a number of problems throughout . Subs not used: Bravo, Pedro, Rafinha, Bartra . Bookings: Pique, Messi . Subs . Xavi (for Iniesta, 53) - 6 - Still the same midfield metronome. Didn't waste a pass. Mathieu (for Rakitic, 74) - 5 - Might have done better to prevent the PSG consolation. Adriano (for Montoya, 80) - 5.5 - Game was won but kept things ticking over. Man of the Match: Luis Suarez 8.5 . Manager: Luis Enrique - 7 - Has recovered from the ordeal of the first half of the season and his side are heading towards a triumphant end to the campaign. Fearsome front three could carry Enrique to European glory. Referee: Mark Clattenburg (England) - 7 - Didn't put a foot wrong and it may be that our leading official progresses some way further than our leading sides in this competition.","Barcelona outclassed PSG to win 3-1 in the Champions League quarters .

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers believes a 'very poor decision' by Michael Oliver's assistant referee was one of the reason's Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup semi-final by Aston Villa on Sunday night. With the score at 2-1 and just five minutes left on the clock at Wembley, much-maligned Reds striker Mario Balotelli had the ball in the net only to see the linesman unfairly flag for offside. Replays clearly showed that Villa defender Leandro Bacuna was playing Balotelli onside before the Italian slid the ball past Shay Given. Mario Balotelli (circled) is clearly onside as Steven Gerrard looks to play him through on goal . With Aston Villa leading 2-1, the Reds striker sweeps the ball home before realising his effort wouldn't count . Speaking after his side's defeat, Rodgers told BT Sport: 'It was very clear. It was a very poor decision by the official because he's looking right along the line. 'He should be able to see the full back is playing him at least a yard onside. It was a terrfici ball in, Balotelli has a good touch and he's in on goal. You need those to go for you.' Balotelli also criticised the decision, posting a screen-grab of the incident - showing him to be onside - to his Instagram page, with the message 'No words. This picture say it all' Rodgers' side had taken the lead after brilliant build-up play from Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho before the latter jinked into the Villa penalty area and curled a right-footed shot beyond Given. The semi-final showpiece was all-square just six minutes later after Christian Benteke swept home from 12-yards out following a neat cut-back from Fabian Delph.

"England are in danger of losing their fourth Champions League spot in the coming years, as poor performances from Premier League clubs in Europe take their toll. This season, for the second time in three years, there were no English clubs in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, while none of our clubs have reached the last eight in the Europa League either. And with Italian and German clubs performing significantly better this season, England could slip from their current ranking of second to a lowly fourth by the end of next season. Chelsea look dejected as they exited the Champions League in the last 16 against PSG last month . Arsenal's Olivier Giroud punches the ground in frustration as his side suffered a defeat to Monaco . Germany will begin next season with a higher ranking than England, once 2010/11 points are discounted. If Juventus, Napoli and Fiorentina win all their remaining games possible, Italy will go into next season within 0.1 points of England. Even if Italian clubs fail to reach finals, a repeat of this season would see them overtake England in third place next season. Germany is guaranteed to move ahead of England at the end of this season, while if Italian clubs continue to perform well this season and English clubs fail to reverse their slump, the Premier League could end next season out of Europe's elite. That would see England reduced to three Champions League places for the 2017/18 season, with Serie A taking the extra place from the Premier League. UEFA's country coefficient rankings take into account the previous five seasons' performance by teams from each association, which means England are set to lose a huge chunk of their total at the start of next season. Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain celebrates as the Italians all but booked their place in the Europa League semis . Arsene Wenger cannot hide his disappointment as Arsenal were eliminated in the last 16 yet again . David Luiz celebrates scoring at Stamford Bridge as PSG knocked Chelsea out oEurope . The 2010/11 season saw Tottenham and Chelsea reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League, while Manchester United lost in the final. Coupled with Liverpool and Manchester City reaching the last 16 of the Europa League, that earned England a massive 18.357 points, which will be knocked off the total at the start of next season. Italy and Germany will lose a significantly smaller number of points (11.571 and 15.666 respectively) meaning that by the beginning of next season, England will have slumped to third, and be in danger of falling further. Gianluigi Buffon celebrates as Juventus took a big step towards the last four by beating Monaco in Turin . Mohamed Salah runs at the Dynamo Kiev defence as they scored late to stay in with a chance of progress . The Premier League will still be defending a lead from Serie A going into the 2015/16 campaign, although how big that is remains to be seen. Each season every association gets points depending on how well their teams do. These are then divided by the number of teams that country provided for European competition. The previous five seasons make up a country's coefficient. How do the points work? Each team gets two points for a win and one point for a draw, with half-points for qualifiers. Teams get a bonus point for every round they reach in the knock-out stages of the Champions League, or every round after the quarter-finals of the Europa League. Qualifying for the Champions League group stages gets you a further four bonus points, as does reaching the last 16. With Juventus in pole position to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, Napoli all but into the last four of the Europa League, and Fiorentina in with a chance of joining them, Italy are likely to out-score England by at least four points this season, and that margin would grow if all three Italian clubs reach the final of their respective competitions. If all three teams were to win all of their remaining games - with the exception of an all-Italian Europa League final - Italy would pick up another five points for their coefficient, narrowing the gap to just 0.095 points. With Real Madrid and Barcelona still in the Champions League that may not be very likely, but any more Italian success will narrow the gap - and if the difference is less than four points, the English clubs will be nervously looking over their shoulders. A repeat next year would then certainly result in falling behind Serie A for the first time since 2006. And even if next season doesn't see England slump to fourth, without a significant reversal in the fortunes of Premier League and Serie A clubs in the next two years, the season afterwards would see England in major trouble. So if the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool think fighting over the top four is a struggle, they need to start winning in Europe - or it could be down to a top three. England are set to lose their points from the 2010/11 season, when Tottenham reached the quarter finals .","Premier League clubs have been outperformed by European rivals .
Bundesliga set to move above Premier League next season .
Serie A could also overtake England, if Italian successes continue .
Napoli, Juventus and Fiorentina are still in contention for European glory .

"Jose Mourinho has said Diego Costa's recovery from a hamstring injury is going well and the striker could return for next weekend's Premier League showdown with Arsenal. Costa sustained the injury in the 2-1 home win over Stoke City on April 4 and was expected to be out for a month. But his recovery has been quicker than expected and the 19-goal frontman will rejoin the squad for training next week. Jose Mourinho offered some positive injury news as he spoke ahead of Chelsea's game with Man United . Costa injured his hamstring in the win over Stoke City at Stamford Bridge on April 4 .

Arsenal is the sixth from the end, so if he doesn't play against Arsenal or Leicester, it is not a problem because we were always focusing on the last four. 'But thing are going so well he has a chance [of facing Arsenal]. He's training, he starts training with the rest of the squad next week.' Mourinho also said that Loic Remy has recovered from a calf injury and could return against United.

"Chelsea welcome Manchester United on Saturday tea-time with the stakes sky-high for the Premier League rivals. For Jose Mourinho’s men it is about seeing home a title bid which, in recent matches, has had to rely on one or two last-gasp interventions. Louis van Gaal's United, meanwhile, have hit top gear and it appears that all roads lead to the Champions League. Here, Sportsmail asks 10 key questions ahead of this weekend’s big match… . Premier League leaders Chelsea host a resurgent Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday . Blues veteran Didier Drogba celebrates after handing Chelsea the lead at Old Trafford in their previous clash . Robin van Persie rescued a draw with an injury time equaliser in the game in October 2014 . Will Angel di Maria get a look in? United have won four on the spin in which Di Maria has not started. The last time he did, United were beaten by Arsenal in the FA Cup and Di Maria was sent off. Indeed, the £60m winger has scored just once since October – and that against League One Yeovil who have since been relegated. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it - and that means Di Maria is almost certain to miss out again this weekend. Angel di Maria is likely to start another game on the bench after losing his first team place . The Argentina international's form has slumped since making a bright start to his Premier League career . Sports analysts BSports predict that a Chelsea win is easily the most likely outcome at Stamford Bridge . Will Juan Mata make Chelsea pay? Keeping Di Maria out of the side is Mata, and deservedly so. His match-winning brace at Liverpool was a real watershed moment for Van Gaal and this United vintage. Sold by Chelsea for £37.1m last January, their judgement looked shrewd as he struggled to impact under David Moyes. But Van Gaal is getting the best from the cunning Spaniard and he will need little motivating ahead of the reunion with Jose Mourinho, the man who deemed him not good enough for Stamford Bridge. Juan Mata has been an integral part of United's rise since scoring a sensational brace against Liverpool . The Spain international could return to haunt his former club after being pushed out at Stamford Bridge (left) Will a United victory blow open the title race? Yes. It would leave Chelsea seven points clear of Arsenal – having both played 32 - with a trip to the Emirates on the horizon. And, with the Gunners showing no sign of letting up, were the Blues to lose that London derby then it would make for a nervy final few rounds of the campaign, especially as Chelsea still have to face in-form Crystal Palace and Liverpool, as well as a tricky trip to resurgent Leicester. But perhaps United – who would be five points behind having played a game more were they to win – represent the biggest danger to Chelsea’s crown. Chelsea will be hoping to open up a greater gap before they head to the Emirates for a clash with Arsenal . Will the Colombians again be spectators? Colombian comrades Radamel Falcao and Juan Cuadrado have found themselves warming the bench for the large part and they’ll be able to catch up on the touchline again on Saturday night. Cuadrado – Chelsea’s £23m January signing – has managed just three hours of top-flight football and has failed to score or create a goal in that time. Loanee Falcao, meanwhile, will be ditched at the end of the season after a return of just four goals. Not all Colombians are as good as Tino Asprillia it would appear… . Radamel Falcao's (right) role at Manchester United has been reduced to that of substitute . Both Colombians have failed to live up to expectations following big money deals to sign them . Will Jose meet his match in Louis? Mourinho has long since ruled the roost in the Premier League, rival after rival lining up to lay praise at the feet of the Special One. Don’t expect Van Gaal to extol the virtues of his opposite number, however. There’s only one Special One is Louis’s world. He is fast going about proving as much at Old Trafford and victory for Van Gaal in west London would not rest easy with the proud Portuguese. Louis van Gaal (left) and Jose Mourinho will see two of the biggest egos in football collide on Saturday . Mourinho and Van Gaal embrace after their first meeting in October, will there be smiles again? Will Wayne Rooney remind Chelsea what they missed out on in 2013? It was during the summer of 2013 that Mourinho attempted to lure United’s star to Stamford Bridge – and boy did he come close. Had he achieved as much then Chelsea would have been defending their title this season rather than trying to reclaim it. Rooney remains a class act, as 21 goals for club and country this term bear testimony to. Mourinho holds United’s skipper in the highest regard and must still regret not seeing home a transfer which had looked very much on the cards. Wayne Rooney came close to signing for Chelsea in 2013 before being convinced to stay by David Moyes . The England captain has been the inspiration behind United's six-game winning run . Will Cesc Fabregas remind United what they missed out on in 2014? It was a no-brainer, wasn’t it? With Fabregas desperate for a return to England and United in desperate need of guile in the middle of the park, surely they would pull out all of the stops to bring Fabregas to Old Trafford? Instead, he went to Chelsea and has been inspirational as the Blues have eased to within touching distance of the title. His goals return – three in the league – has been poor, but there is no under-estimating is worth to the team in terms of craft and graft. Fabregas and Michael Carrick would have made some pairing. Cesc Fabregas has been clocking up the assists at Chelsea after being snubbed by United last summer . The Spaniard would have formed a formidable midfield partnership with Michael Carrick  at Old Trafford . Can Chelsea cope without Diego Costa? The Spaniard’s form had stuttered before his injury, with just three goals in 10. But his presence is perhaps the key reason behind Chelsea’s title charge this season. It is no coincidence that it wasn’t until the 88th minute that they registered an effort on target at QPR last weekend. Didier Drogba is far from the force he once was and United’s defence will be grateful that Costa is not in opposition. Diego Costa is escorted off the field against Stoke and has been ruled out of the match on Saturday . The Spain international was on fire at the start of the season but has tailed off in recent months . Who will come out on top in the PFA Player of the Year nominees – Eden Hazard or David de Gea? Hazard, it seems, is a shoo-in for the prestigious prize, and with good reason. But De Gea could well be joining him on the podium given his improvement this season. Eden Hazard (right) has arguably been the Blues most influential player in the title chase . Hazard is competing with United No 1 David de Gea for the PFA Player of the Year award . The United custodian has kept 13 clean sheets and, having matured into the goalkeeper Sir Alex Ferguson always thought he would do, it is little surprise Real Madrid are courting Spain’s No.1. Were Chelsea to get a penalty – pitching Hazard against De Gea – it would certainly prove a fascinating duel. Finally, are Chelsea as good as champions if they win? Yes. Ten points clear with six to play would mean they could afford to lose half of those games and still be crowned champions. Perhaps that is why the neutral will be in the red corner this weekend.","Chelsea host Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday .

He said games such as Saturday night's showdown at Stamford Bridge make his job 'easy' because 'every player is desperate to play and focused.' He said: 'To play Manchester United is to play one of the biggest clubs in the world and one of the best in the Premier League and this is what everybody wants.

He is a very correct boy and a top professional.' Chelsea can move 10 points clear of second-placed Arsenal - who take on Reading in the FA cup semi-final at the same time - with three points against United. They are boosted by the likely return of striker Loic Remy from a calf injury and Mourinho also confirmed that 19-goal frontman Diego Costa will return to full training next week after making a quick recovery from a hamstring problem. This puts the Spain international in contention for next weekend's top-of-the-table clash with Arsenal at the Emirates. Costa injured his hamstring in the win over Stoke City at Stamford Bridge on April 4 . Mourinho hinted that Loic Remy should return from a calf injury against Manchester United . Mourinho said on Costa: 'He is progressing very well. He has a chance for next weekend.

Klopp has long been linked with a move to the English top flight and this news will have Arsenal and Manchester City, among others, on alert.

'Everyone at BVB, especially the players, should give you the send-off you deserve in the next weeks.' In his time at the Westfalenstadion, he has won two Bundesliga titles and the German Cup, as well as guiding the team to the Champions League final in 2013. Bild reported that the former Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel, 41, is in the frame to take over though Watzke was not prepared to comment on Klopp's successor. Although Klopp is contracted to Dortmund until 2018, he is seeking a new challenge following a difficult season in which the club have struggled for form.

"Manchester City and Chelsea are set to battle it out for the signature of West Ham left-back Aaron Cresswell this summer. Cresswell has impressed for the Hammers this campaign and City are desperate to add to their quota of English players with the likes of James Milner on the brink of leaving the club. City will have another chance to run the rule over the 25-year-old when West Ham travel to the Etihad this Sunday. Chelsea and Manchester City are set to battle it out for West Ham left back Aaron Cresswell this summer . The 25-year-old has impressed during his first season in the Premier League since leaving Ipswich . West Ham snapped up Cresswell for £2million from Ipswich last summer but he has adapted to the top tier with relative ease and attracted the eye of the division’s Champions League clubs. Chelsea, mindful of their own number of English players, are also interested in Cresswell. With Cesar Azpilicueta installed as first choice left-back, the Blues see Cresswell as a homegrown alternative to Filipe Luis, frustrated with his lack of opportunities since arriving last summer. The Upton Park hierarchy would be reluctant to sell Cresswell, who is on a five-year deal in east London. Tottenham full back Danny Rose is also under consideration from City as they bid to boost homegrown quota . Manchester City also want Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling and are preparing a summer bid . Tottenham’s Danny Rose is also on City’s radar for the left-back role with Aleksandar Kolorov set to be among a large Etihad exodus in the close season. England stars Jack Wilshere, Jordan Henderson and Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling are also on City’s wanted list to fulfil the quota. Premier League sides must name eight homegrown players in their 25-man squad registered at the beginning of the season. A player is deemed homegrown if they have spent at least three years at any English club before the age of 21, regardless of nationality.","Aaron Cresswell has impressed during debut season in Premier League .

"Wayne Rooney may have to revert to a midfield role at Stamford Bridge on Saturday night after Michael Carrick and Daley Blind were two of four Manchester United players ruled out of the clash with Chelsea. Centre-backs Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo will also miss the trip to the Premier League leaders, and with Jonny Evans completing his six-match ban, Louis van Gaal described it as ‘the worst scenario’. Jones and Blind, who was injured by Vincent Kompany’s controversial challenge in the Manchester derby last weekend, both have ankle injuries while Carrick limped out of that game with a tight calf and Rojo later reported a stomach muscle problem. Michael Carrick limped off against Manchester City while Marcos Rojo picked up an injury soon after . Louis van Gaal also revealed in his pre-match press conference that Daley Blind and Phil Jones are out . Wayne Rooney has impressed up front in recent weeks but may have to drop further back . Louis van Gaal puts his arm round Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney during training this week . Van Gaal has revealed that Rooney may play in holding midfield role against Chelsea . 4-1-4-1: De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Blackett, Shaw; Rooney; Mata, Herrera, Fellaini, Young; Falcao . United’s injury setback means that Luke Shaw and Radamel Falcao could both be recalled against Jose Mourinho’s side. ‘I have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that’s not so good for us,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We had very good hope that we should recover two of the four but it’s not like that. Carrick is out and Rojo is out, but also Blind and Jones. ‘That’s the worst scenario because Rojo and Jones are good players at the left central defender position. Evans is suspended so we don’t have many choices. Blind and Carrick could play the midfield holding position and I don’t have any other option, or I have to play Wayne Rooney in that position again. I have to puzzle a lot for tomorrow. ‘Other players can take profit of the momentum now. It’s always like that. It’s not special in the life of a manager or a team. ‘You have seen that I took Jones off pitch (against Manchester City) because of injury, you have seen that Carrick was off the pitch, you have seen the tackle of Kompany against Blind. Only Rojo is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match. ‘It’s because of the distance between the matches. Blind and Jones were very close to playing but it was not enough. ‘Other players can take profit of the moment now. It’s always like that. It’s not special in the life of a manager or a team.’ Louis van Gaal addresses the media ahead of Man United's crucial Premier League clash with Chelsea . Luke Shaw hasn't featured under Louis van Gaal recently but should return to play at left back . Juan Mata is closed down by his Man United team-mates during a training session on Friday . Maroaune Fellaini will be hoping to continue his impressive form against Chelsea on Saturday evening . Marouane Fellaini is embraced by his team-mates after scoring against rivals Man City last week . Sports analysts BSports predict that a Chelsea win is easily the most likely outcome at Stamford Bridge . Asked if Shaw could return for the first time since being substituted in the FA Cup defeat to Arsenal last month amid concerns over his fitness, Van Gaal replied: ‘Maybe you shall see tomorrow. You never know. Luke is fit enough I think. He has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and I don’t like that. But we train and I think he is fit enough.’ With Chelsea holding an eight-point lead and a game in hand over third-placed United, Van Gaal believes it is asking too much for his team to win the title. He also claimed that Mourinho will be happy with a draw. ‘It’s still possible, I’ve said that before,’ he added. ‘It is not logical but it is possible. It’s more when and if, and I don’t believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. ‘But, alright, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal so we can lay pressure on Chelsea’s shoulders. You never know, you’ve seen it in previous Premier League seasons. So I cannot say it is not possible, but it is not logical. ‘They play at home but I think that Chelsea will be satisfied with a draw. Of course they will want to beat Manchester United and we want to beat them, the question is how long players can play in the discipline. ‘We live for these titles, we are doing this for that. The only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title. When you are second or third you can play Champions League, but a title is more fixed for you and you have your name on it. That’s why managers are fixated on titles. When you reach that goal you are happy. ‘To be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal, that is also a goal of mine. That is why I’m still a manager because I don’t have to work anymore – you can count on that. I like to work with young people and help them in their career.’ Robin van Persie (back right) has only been training with United for a week but may return to feature . Van Gaal gave a young Mourinho his break in coaching at Barcelona. Asked to compare the Portuguese with his current assistant Ryan Giggs, the United boss admitted that he has been surprised by the Old Trafford legend’s work ethic. He said: ‘It’s always difficult. People compare with each other because Jose Mourinho was not the world-class player that Ryan Giggs was. So that’s the same thing with me. I was not as world-class as, for example, Johann Cruyff yet our ambition is maybe then higher. ‘But I have to admit that I could not imagine when I spoke with him (Giggs) in May or June to ask him to be my assistant manager and we spoke about how we saw it, that he works very hard. As an ex-player you are not used to working very hard and he is a very hard worker, and he reads the game very well like Jose. But to manage a group you have to work, and what I can see is that he’s learning quickly.’ Chris Smalling celebrates after netting the fourth goal in the comprehensive victory at Old Trafford .","Manchester United have won six games in a row ahead of Chelsea clash .

"Nico Rosberg has published a video explaining his row with Lewis Hamilton after the Chinese Grand Prix. Rosberg complained during a heated press conference that his Mercedes team-mate Hamilton, the race winner who was sitting next to him as he spoke, had acted ‘selfishly’ in slowing down to such an extent that he (Rosberg) could have been caught by Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari. Speaking on video more calmly later, Rosberg, who finished second, a place ahead of Vettel, answered questions he had received from fans about the furore. Nico Rosberg responded to a fan who accused Rosberg of 'crying' after he complained about Lewis Hamilton . Lewis Hamilton celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Nico Rosberg appears less pleased with 2nd . Hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . One asked if he was ‘crying’ – by which the questioner meant moaning or being a poor loser. Rosberg said: ‘You say that I was crying. OK, I respect your opinion, and I’ll keep it in mind and I’ll try to show respect when it’s due going forward.’ Rosberg was a few seconds behind Hamilton when the world champion slowed. So why did he not push on and try to pass his team-mate rather than ask his pit wall engineers to tell Hamilton to speed up so he could move away from Vettel? Hamilton and Rosberg spray champagne from the podium as Mercedes celebrate a one-two finish . Rosberg was clearly angry with Hamilton in the press conference and hit out at his team-mate . ‘I understand why you’re asking that,’ said Rosberg to that question. ‘It might not be so easy to understand from the outside. But the reason is, I did try to attack Lewis in the first stint, and it just didn’t work. All I did was destroy my tyres. ‘So in the second stint there was no point to do that again, because this time there was Vettel right behind and it would’ve really risked my second place if I had tried that, because I would have completely destroyed my tyres, again, and Vettel could have had a really good shot at overtaking me. My only chance of winning the race anyway, or to fight Lewis, or try to overtake him, would have come at the end of the race, so that’s what I was building up to.’ Rosberg made the video – he posts his thoughts following each race – after discussing the incident with his team management before leaving the Shanghai track. The British driver denied he had done anything wrong following Rosberg's accusations . Hamilton backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . He added: ‘It was definitely intense after the race, but we had a very good sit down, a good discussion. There was a lot of constructive criticism, and now it’ s a thing of the past for everybody and we’re moving on to Bahrain. ‘The worst part of the weekend was losing out to Lewis in qualifying. That compromised me most. And it was by just four-hundredths. That’s all down to me to be those five-hundredths quicker next time.’ Rosberg has since travelled to Dubai en route to the next race in Bahrain on Sunday. Lewis, many congratulations. Was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from Ferrari and, also, can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up? Were you aware that Nico was getting so backed-up towards Sebastian Vettel? LH: I wasn’t controlling his race, I was controlling my own race but, great race, I’m really happy. Definitely going into the race we thought it would be a lot closer and we knew the Ferraris were very, very good with their long run pace and also looking after their tyres. So, today the real goal was to manage the tyres. And, as I said, my goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico through the whole race. So, I just managed it and got to really enjoy it, to be honest. A few of the real good fun laps were the laps before the pitstop, which I really enjoyed. Ultimately it was a much smoother weekend than we had in the last race where we got the whole, full practice sessions, on my side of the garage at least. And it made a real big difference to the balance of the car for the race. So really happy, and yeah, kinda excited. Q: Nico, can you talk us through your view of the race today. Started second, finished second but you sounded at times as though you felt at times under a little bit of unnecessary pressure maybe? NR: No. It’s just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race. Driving slower than was maybe necessary at the beginning of stints meant that Sebastian was very close to me and that opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me. And then I had to cover him. So, first of all it was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time as a result because I had to cover him and then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer. So I’m unhappy about that, of course, today. Other than that, not much to say. Q: Lewis, would you like to respond? LH: Not really! My job is not to… it’s not my job to look after Nico’s race. My job’s to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible – and that’s what I did. I didn’t do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up. I just was focussing on myself. If Nico wanted to get by he could have tried but he didn’t.","Lewis Hamilton won the Chinese Grand Prix with Nico Rosberg second .

"It was on New Year's Day last year that Juan Mata finally cracked after being substituted by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho at Southampton. He had done his utmost not to react and, placid by nature, there was no kicking water bottles, but he was visibly distraught despite the consolatory efforts of Michael Essien behind him. Fast forward 16 months and there was an altogether different kind of substitution in the 81st minute of last Sunday's Manchester derby. After scoring and inspiring United to 4-2 win, he received a standing ovation and a pat on the back from Ryan Giggs. Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata turns away to celebrate after scoring against Manchester City . Mata had scored United's third goal during the 4-2 victory over their bitter rivals at Old Trafford last week . Mata looks dejected after being substituted by Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho last year at Stamford Bridge . Although he had been a popular figure at Chelsea, Mata could not convince Mourinho to keep hold of him . Louis van Gaal is finally getting the best out of Juan Mata. In his last five games, the Spaniard has performed better than he ever has in the Premier League: . Mata is performing at the peak of his powers . He is not surprised by the turnaround in his own, and the team's, fortunes — he began the season believing United could win the league this year with no European commitments. He told Sportsmail last May: 'If we take Liverpool as the example there you have a team who have fought all the way to the finish without the Champions League.' He was mocked for the optimism but if United beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge they will be only five points behind the leaders. When David Moyes was manager, he and assistant Phil Neville had scouted Europe for the 'Mata-type player' they believed the team needed before it became clear United could get the real thing. When Louis van Gaal arrived, Mata took one step forward and two back. The early tinkering often meant he played in his favoured position behind the front two, but the three-man defence experiment undermined everything else the team did and results were poor. He ended up back where he had been at Chelsea under Mourinho — on the bench. Mata missed the football he had played earlier in his career at Valencia and under Andre Villas-Boas at Chelsea. The free spirit was being shackled and the only consolation was that others felt the same, none more so than Ander Herrera, the player he is closest to at the club. The two had won an Under 21 European Championship together with Spain where they had enjoyed a freedom of expression now denied them. Herrera, like Mata, was out of the side. Mata also missed London. When I interviewed him in 2012 before the Champions League final he insisted on meeting in a Kings Road cafe because it was where he felt most at home. Now he was in a mansion in Alderley Edge, south Manchester. Isolated and not playing. As United's fortunes changed on the pitch, however, so Mata's season has been saved. With Michael Carrick now planted in front of a back four, the side has the balance to allow its creative players to thrive. Mata is not in his favoured No 10 position but he is also comfortable on the right. 'I can come inside on my left foot and see the whole of the pitch in front of me,' he says. Mata enjoys a close friendship with fellow Untied midfielder and Spain international Ander Herrera (right) Mata scores the second of his two goals against Liverpool at Anfield this season, a stunning overhead kick . It is the same left foot Giggs joked about with him when he joined, saying he was glad to see him arrive but unhappy that he no longer possessed the best left peg at Old Trafford. The relationship with Giggs is healthy, as is the one struck up with Wayne Rooney. Both were players Mata admired before moving to England. As well as the bond with Herrera he is close to David de Gea — all three of them live on the same street. De Gea is another with whom Mata played in that Under 21 European Championship success in Denmark in 2011. Having been part of the 2010 World Cup-winning squad, Mata's willingness to step back down to the Under 21s says a lot about his character. The open letter he wrote to Chelsea fans when he left the club — against advice that it was not the best way to ingratiate himself with his new supporters — also spoke volumes. A Chelsea fan holds a sign to pay tribute to Mata, who earned himself a hero's reputation in west London . Mata never wanted to leave London but now he loves the countryside surrounding Manchester. It reminds him of his home in Asturias, and that more than makes up for not being in the capital. Life there was good under Villas-Boas. 'He trusted me to play and he wants to play attractive, fun and winning football,' he said, revealing a fondness for someone whom Mourinho held in far lower esteem. Mata never banged on the manager's door when he fell out of favour at Chelsea. Mourinho never struck him as a man whose mind could be changed. He has always preferred to do his talking on the pitch. It has not always been easy but he is back at Chelsea on Saturday and there has never been a better time to make a lasting statement.

"Joel Ward has put pen to paper on a new three-and-a-half year contract at Crystal Palace, keeping him at the south London club until the summer of 2018. The 25-year-old, who has impressed at both left and right back for the Eagles this season, has been a mainstay in the first team, making 35 appearances in all competitions. Speaking to the club's official website about his new deal, Ward said: 'I'm really pleased. It's been something that has been talked about a little bit and I'm glad to now put that to the back and just concentrate with my football and I'm delighted to have signed the deal.' Crystal Palace right back Joel Ward has signed a new three-and-a-half year deal with the south London club . Ward has played 101 times for the Eagles since joining from boyhood club Portsmouth in May 2012 . Ward has played every minute of Palace's Premier League campaign this season, under three different managers, and his performances have warranted some shouts for an England call-up. Last week's win over champions Manchester City saw Ward make his 100th appearance for Palace, and he cites the influence of manager Alan Pardew in his decision to sign a new deal. 'The relationship with the gaffer and the club helped. I'm excited for what the next few years have in store. I love the passion of the club, the fans have been exceptional since I've come here and they've welcomed me with open arms. Ward has been impressive  at both left at right back this season, playing every minute in the Premier League .

Ward was signed by then Palace manager Dougie Freedman (right) and he replaced Nathaniel Clyne (left) 'It's been a joy to play in front of them - especially at home - week in, week out. Even the travelling support's been incredible.' Ward joined Palace in 2012 from boyhood club Portsmouth, and proved to be a direct replacement for the outgoing Nathaniel Clyne, who himself has become an England regular since his move to Southampton. He played an integral part in Palace's rise from mid-table Championship side to secure Premier League outfit, and is a fans' favourite in south London.","Joel Ward joined Crystal Palace from boyhood club Portsmouth in 2012 .

"So, once again, it will all come down to the actions of a man from Salto. On this occasion, though, the focus will not be on Salto’s most famous son. Luis Suarez will be at the Parc des Princes tonight, forming one part of football’s most famous three-man attack, looking to fire Barcelona into the Champions League semi-finals. Usually when they reach this stage, Barcelona do not make any mistakes. Standing on the other side of the pitch will be someone who Suarez knows inside out, a player who hails from his home city in Uruguay and with whom he has shared a number of big nights when representing their country. Edinson Cavani prepares for Paris Saint-Germain's quarter-final clash with Barcelona . PSG train at Camp-des-Loges in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, west of Paris . Cavani celebrates scoring for the Paris side in the League Cup final last weekend . Edinson Cavani knows the spotlight will be shining on him this evening. If Paris Saint-Germain are to break through the glass ceiling and progress beyond the Champions League’s last eight, Cavani – a player known as El Matador – must torment the stars from Catalonia. The onus falls on Cavani for a number of reasons. First, PSG have been stripped by suspension of two key players, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Veratti, the product of that ugly last 16 success against Chelsea; Thiago Motta is injured, while David Luiz is also a major doubt. Yet there is more to it than that. Cavani has a towering reputation in the game, stemming from three prolific seasons in Naples which led to his record-breaking move to Paris, but can you think of a really vital game that he has stamped his class all over? To suggest that may seem a little harsh. He came within the width of a goal post at Stamford Bridge of being the undisputed match winner and his bullet header in the first leg in February that gave Laurent Blanc’s side the opportunity to travel to London with parity. Since then, however, Cavani has endured problems and a significant goal drought for one of his talent. Between February 17 and April 5, Cavani went seven matches without scoring and only ended the fallow spell with a double as a substitute in the Coupe de Ligue final on Saturday. PSG won that game 4-0 but had matters sewn up before Cavani came on and helped himself to a double late on (Ibrahimovic had scored twice to give them breathing space); it was his first action since an angry altercation with Blanc a week earlier during a 3-2 win in Marseille. Zlatan Ibrahimovic slides in on Oscar during PSG's second round clash at Chelsea last month . Ibrahimovic is shown the red card for his challenge on Oscar to leave PSG up against it . Ibrahimovic trudges off the field and will miss the first leg of the quarter-final against Barcelona . It has led to speculation about his future in Paris and he has been linked with a number of sides in the Barclays Premier League; Liverpool, for one, would have loved to have signed him last summer but the figures were exorbitant (he earns more per week than Radamel Falcao). Arsenal and Manchester United have also been mentioned with him, while Manchester City tested the water in June 2013 when it was clear that Cavani’s time in Serie A was over; the intensity of his play, you suspect, would enhance his prospects of thriving in the English game. Nasser Al Khelaifi, PSG’s president, maintains one of the jewels in their crown will not be sold this summer but the recent noises Cavani has made have not been ultra-enthusiastic and hint that he might be ready for a new challenge after two years in France. ‘I came to play as a centre-forward with Zlatan and after, things changed for a variety of reasons,’ said Cavani. ‘Everything else is perfect in Paris. The club has behaved very well towards me. I have had some difficult moments personally, and they protected me, supported me. ‘The fans have also always supported me. I think I'm in one of the best places in the world. I'm staying focused on my preparation to give my best for my team, to the club that pays me and has shown faith in me. You never know in football. I'm not thinking about it.’ Tonight his focus will be on Barcelona. With six goals in eight Champions League appearances this season – he averages one every 143 minutes and has created 10 chances for his team-mates – it would be risible to suggest Cavani has something to prove on this stage. That said, it might not be wrong to suggest he needs a big moment. Ibrahimovic’s ability to sprinkle stardust is beyond question, while Veratti is fast becoming one of the finest midfielders in Europe but, without them, PSG need their man from Salto to sparkle. Their prospects depend on him. Louis van Gaal is considering a move for Cavani after seeing Radamel Falcao struggle this season . Cavani is one of the highest-paid players in the world after moving to Paris from Serie A side Napoli .

"Lewis Hamilton’s feud with Nico Rosberg has erupted once more following an explosive press conference at the Chinese Grand Prix. Hamilton controlled the race in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship. But Rosberg was furious with his Mercedes team-mate, accusing him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.

Hamilton and Rosberg spray champagne from the podium as Mercedes celebrate a one-two finish . Click here to read Jonathan McEvoy's report from Shanghai as Hamilton wins . With the top three drivers covered by only 3.5secs ahead of the final round of pit-stops, Rosberg reported on the radio that ‘Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up.’ Hamilton, seemingly protecting his tyres, was given the hurry-up by Mercedes and both he and Rosberg eventually emerged from their final pit-stop first and second with Vettel third. Asked about the message, Hamilton, with Rosberg sitting next to him in the press conference, replied: 'I wasn't controlling his race, I was controlling my own race. 'My goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico throughout the whole race.' The last remark, in particular, was a dig in the ribs for Rosberg, who has been out-qualified and finished behind Hamilton at every race so far this season. A clearly fuming Rosberg replied: 'It's just now interesting to hear from you Lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race. 'Driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant Sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then I had to cover him. 'It was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time because I had to cover him.

'That's what I did. I didn't do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up, I was just focused on myself. If Nico wanted to get by he could have tried, but he didn't.' The spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre, and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded. It culminated in Rosberg and Hamilton colliding with one another in the Belgian Grand Prix, resulting in the former being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team. It proved to be a turning point in the championship as Hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown. Lewis, many congratulations. Was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from Ferrari and, also, can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up? Were you aware that Nico was getting so backed-up towards Sebastian Vettel? LH: I wasn’t controlling his race, I was controlling my own race but, great race, I’m really happy. Definitely going into the race we thought it would be a lot closer and we knew the Ferraris were very, very good with their long run pace and also looking after their tyres. So, today the real goal was to manage the tyres. And, as I said, my goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico through the whole race. So, I just managed it and got to really enjoy it, to be honest. A few of the real good fun laps were the laps before the pitstop, which I really enjoyed. Ultimately it was a much smoother weekend than we had in the last race where we got the whole, full practice sessions, on my side of the garage at least. And it made a real big difference to the balance of the car for the race. So really happy, and yeah, kinda excited. Q: Nico, can you talk us through your view of the race today. Started second, finished second but you sounded at times as though you felt at timed under a little bit of unnecessary pressure maybe? NR: No. It’s just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race.

So I’m unhappy about that, of course, today. Other than that, not much to say. Q: Lewis, would you like to respond? LH: Not really! My job is not to… it’s not my job to look after Nico’s race. My job’s to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible – and that’s what I did. I didn’t do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up. I just was focussing on myself. If Nico wanted to get by he could have tried but he didn’t. The British driver crosses the line in Shanghai after holding off the challenge from Rosberg and Vettel . Hamilton leads off the start-line as he moves off the race line to defend his lead . The British driver controlled the race as he claimed his fourth victory in China . Speaking to the BBC, Rosberg was asked about the incident. 'It compromised my race massively at the time because the best possible race for Lewis was to back me off into Vettel so Vettel would try to undercut me and I would have to respond,' he said. 'It was very frustrating Lewis was taking it as easy on his tyres. Interestingly, he said he was just thinking about himself and that says it all. What upset me is we went through exactly that before the race.' Hamilton denied the accusation: 'That's absolutely not the case. I wasn't trying to back him up into Sebastian because ultimately we do need a one-two and that is a priority to the team. If he wanted to get close to overtake he could have done. I'm not really quite sure what his problem is. 'We came here to get one-two and we did. There shouldn't be too much aggro really.' 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:39:42.008 . 2.

"They had only one shot at it, with the masked raider wriggling clear of security in the 88th minute and making his way into the penalty area undetected. This was the second London heist in a week, with the Loftus Road imposter easily identifiable when he whipped off his head gear in front of QPR’s stunned supporters. Cesc Fabregas was the diamond when he worked the opening, following the carefully laid out plans of Eden Hazard and substitute Oscar to pull off this unlikely job for Chelsea. The finish called for precision. Cesc Fabregas arrives late on to convert Eden Hazard's pass and secure all three points for Chelsea at Loftus Road . Fabregas celebrates with Branislav Ivanovic after scoring a late goal which was harsh on QPR, but sent Chelsea seven clear . Jose Mourinho’s team are within inches of the silverware — the Barclays Premier League crown — after this dramatic game of smash and grab. Rob Green had been on guard throughout, but the crestfallen Rangers keeper made the mistake that allowed Chelsea to extend their lead at the top of the table again. You snooze, you lose. It was an important victory for Mourinho, keeping Arsenal at arm’s length by recording their 22nd victory of the season in the Premier League. ‘We have been at the top throughout,’ he declared. Nemanja Matic hugs his goalscoring team-mate Fabregas as Joey Barton and Charlie Austin look on dejected at the final whistle . Charlie Austin lets fly from long range, the best effort for either side in a first half lacking quality in front of goal . Where they rank among the great teams to win the title, such as the Manchester United vintages (1999 and 2009) or Arsenal’s ‘Invincibles’ (2004) — is of no concern to the Portuguese. Chelsea’s manager has put together a team to win the league, grinding down the opposition until they eventually lift the trophy, probably later this month. They are relentless, we know that. Here at Loftus Road they were met with the resistance of their noisy neighbours QPR, surviving the screams and shouts from the stands to stretch their lead over Arsenal to seven points. Thibaut Courtois made a stunning save to deny Austin, as Chelsea's Belgian goalkeeper kept QPR's forwards at bay . They will meet at the Emirates on April 26, but Chelsea are equipped to survive the sternest and stiffest tests that domestic competition can throw at them. Even Arsene Wenger knows a title-winning team when he sees one. Chelsea had only one shot on target, an improbable statistic for a team that can call upon the dancing feet of Hazard, Willian, substitute Oscar and Fabregas. Joey Barton (above) was everywhere for QPR, but Ramires (below) failed to have much impact. CLICK HERE to see more from Match Zone . QPR: Green 5.5, Isla 6.5 (Dunne 90 mins), Onuoha 7, Caulker 7, Hill 7, Phillips 6.5, Barton 6.5, Sandro 6.5 (Kranjcar 81 6), Henry 6.5, Austin 6.5, Zamora 6.5 (Hoilett 83 5.5) Subs not used: McCarthy, Mitchell, Grego-Cox, Comley .

Subs not used: Cech, Luis, Mikel, Brown . Booked: Drogba . Goal: Fabregas 88 . Referee: Andre Marriner . Man of the Match: Courtois . Ratings by Sami Mokbel . Chelsea were careless in possession, knocked out of their rhythm by the boisterous presence of Karl Henry, Sandro and the bristling figure of Joey Barton strung out across the QPR midfield. This defeat feels tough on them because anyone who can sedate Nemanja Matic and Ramires over the course of 90 minutes probably deserves a bit more. The pair were over-run in that Chelsea midfield. Rangers have found an outlet in the willing, emerging figure of Matt Phillips down their right flank. They have to use and abuse him to stand a chance of staying up. Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta wins the ball from QPR's in-form winger Matt Phillips as the league leaders attempted to control the game . He looked to be their one chance of making something happen, a shuttlecock on that halfway line as he flitted in and out of Chelsea’s half. Cesar Azpilicueta will be glad to see the back of him. So will Gary Cahill, the Chelsea defender who bravely intercepted Phillips’s dangerous first-half crosses from that cultured right boot. Phillips was a menace on that wing. He had a massive chance to put Rangers in front at the start of the second half, denied by the anticipation of Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois when the Belgian moved to his left to turn the shot away for a corner. Joey Barton battles with Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas, who was wearing a mask after a collision with Charlie Adam against Stoke last week . When that failed, Rangers went old school, lofting balls into the box in the hope that forwards Bobby Zamora or Charlie Austin would get their head onto one of them. Even against Chelsea captain John Terry and the commanding presence of Cahill, the agricultural approach almost worked. Terry was hammered by QPR fans, choking on the abuse from the stands because of his exchange here with their former centre half Anton Ferdinand in October 2011. Didier Drogba, starting in the absence of Diego Costa and Loic Remy, is tackled by Steven Caulker at Loftus Road . John Terry, whose every touch was booed by the Loftus Road crowd, wins the ball ahead of Bobby Zamora to clear the danger . Chelsea’s captain has learned to deal with it, but the trip to Loftus Road is possibly as poisonous as it gets for Terry. He can take his medicine. Rangers were shooting from anywhere, with Austin’s looping effort falling neatly into Courtois’ arms from long range and later drawing a stunning save to the keeper’s right with another poke from distance. Even Barton shanked an effort wide of Courtois’ goal when he was put clean through after the break. They gave this a right, old-fashioned go. Clint Hill puts in a tough tackle on Chelsea's Brazilian winger Willian as QPR battled hard and matched Chelsea in the first half . Loftus Road was a bear pit, with just under 20,000 Rangers crammed into this stadium to watch them match their west London rivals for blood and guts. Under manager Chris Ramsey, they have renewed their faith. Rangers have given themselves a chance of getting out of the mess at the foot of the table after that handsome 4-1 win at West Brom earlier this month, followed by a 3-3 draw with Aston Villa. There is a noticeable shift in mentality, pulling together as they approach the final five games — West Ham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Leicester — of the season. Three are winnable. Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck (left) and owner Roman Abramovich share a joke as they watch their team in action at Loftus Road . The Russian was celebrating his 700th game as Chelsea owner since taking over the west London club in 2003 . Terry has to stretch to stop the ball getting through to Zamora as the hosts created the better chances in the first half . Gary Cahill stuck tight to Austin as the QPR front two caused plenty of problems with their direct style of play . Terry clashed with Austin on a number of occasions, in particular when he felt the QPR striker had followed through on Courtois . Chelsea are masters at this, calling on the pedigree of Hazard, in his 100 appearance in the Premier League, Oscar and the timing of Fabregas to secure this narrow win. It was their first chance, the only time in this game when they properly opened up the central defensive pairing of Steven Caulker and Nedum Onuoha. The man in the mask was there to finish the job, scoring in the league for the first time since Chelsea won 2-0 on the road at Stoke on December 22. ‘It’s like failing a driving test,’ admitted QPR’s manager. Here at Loftus Road, Fabregas turned out to be the getaway driver. A QPR fan shouts abuse at Chelsea's Brazilian midfielder Oscar as the player prepares to take a corner late on .

"Niki Lauda is fully expecting Nico Rosberg to turn 'nasty' at some stage after accusing the German and team-mate Lewis Hamilton of being 'egocentric b*******'. Hamilton spearheaded a Mercedes one-two at the Shanghai International Circuit, claiming his fourth Chinese Grand Prix victory and the 35th overall of his Formula One career. Rosberg, though, effectively accused Hamilton of selfishness during the post-race press conference after the reigning champion slowed in the middle stint of the race to preserve his soft tyres. Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda (right) pictured by the circuit in his recognisable red cap . Nico Rosberg speaks with Lauda in the team garage... the German is expected to turn 'nasty' at some stage . That backed up Rosberg who had Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel closing in from behind, forcing him to bemoan the situation to the team over the radio, who responded by asking Hamilton to increase his pace. Rosberg made his feelings plain to Hamilton immediately afterwards, yet the 30-year-old was completely exonerated of any wrongdoing. As far as Mercedes non-executive chairman Lauda was concerned, the actions of Hamilton were that of a driver with a winning mentality. 'We were first and second and I don't care if there is a quarrel, as long as Vettel was third,' said Lauda. 'One thing is clear from my point of view, Lewis had pole position and controlled the race from the beginning to the end, therefore there is no need for a quarrel.' Asked whether Hamilton had the right to be selfish, Lauda replied: 'Sure, he will drive selfish. 'These guys... I call them egocentric b*******, and this is the only way to win a championship. It's the oldest thing. There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that's it.' Lewis Hamilton waves to the crowd from the podium as Rosberg reflects on finishing behind his team-mate . Hamilton and Rosberg spray champagne from the podium as Mercedes celebrate a one-two finish . Hamilton celebrates his win with the Mercedes team but Rosberg appears less pleased with second . Hamilton backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . Lauda rightly noted Rosberg opted not to attack Hamilton for the win, instead wanting to preserve his own tyres and hang on to second. The three-times champion, however, believes Rosberg will hit back at some stage, adding: 'Nico will calm himself down. 'For sure, when you are being beaten by your team-mate it hurts. When I was being beaten by (Alain) Prost all the time I was not happy. On the other hand Nico is a guy who comes back quickly, so thank God there is only one week to the next race (in Bahrain) so all this talk will stop quickly when they start driving again on Friday. 'Of course, Lewis bites, he has the talent to bite, but Nico is as nasty as he is if he sees the chance. Don't worry.' It means Rosberg could respond in Bahrain, the scene of their titanic on-track duel last season which sparked their at-times bitter rivalry which culminated in their collision in Belgium. For now, Hamilton holds a 13-point cushion to Vettel, with Rosberg a further four points adrift. Hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . Rosberg accused Hamilton of selfishness during the post-race press conference on Sunday . Overall, Hamilton said: 'I'm really happy. It was a great race and really positive to have a clean weekend throughout every session.' Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was fourth ahead of Williams pair Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, with McLaren's Fernando Alonso 12th and Jenson Button 14th. Button had finished 13th, but was handed a five-second post-race penalty for an accident with Lotus' Pastor Maldonado that ended the Venezuelan's grand prix. In his first race with Manor, after missing the first two due to issues, Will Stevens was 15th, finishing ahead of team-mate Roberto Merhi.","Lewis Hamilton won the Chinese Grand Prix ahead of Nico Rosberg .

"Renault managing director Cyril Abiteboul can understand Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz's frustrations and has vowed there will be 'no surrender' in a bid to right their current wretched wrongs. In Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix, Renault suffered two blown engines as first Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat was forced out of the race, followed late on by Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen. It was yet further embarrassment for Renault who are under pressure to perform after Red Bull's billionaire benefactor Mateschitz threatened to pull out of Formula One unless the French manufacturer raised their game. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has been critical of Renault this season . The fact Renault powered Red Bull to four consecutive drivers' and constructors' championships from 2010-2013 is a thing of the past. Instead, the focus is now on their problems, leading to Red Bull team principal Christian Horner hauling in Abiteboul to explain the woes in a post-race media debrief normally solely reserved for him. Asked about Mateschitz's threat, Abiteboul said: 'I understand his position and frustration, and to a certain degree I'm sure Renault's board could share the same frustration. 'We understand we have issues. Those issues are supposed to be addressed by some of the many things going on at Renault Sport. Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo squabble with the McLarens of Fernando Alonso (left) and Jenson Button . 'There are things waiting to happen. There is a plan, and we need to understand if that plan is commensurate with the issues we've seen on track. 'This plan was more focused on power because we saw that was where we were missing. We've got all the driveability issues completely out of the way. 'Now we need to understand the reliability issues because a problem with reliability is bad for PR. 'Also when you have to address reliability issues you're not necessarily in a position to address power, which is also still missing.' Ricciardo (left) and Kvyat jostle for position - the latter was forced to retire after an engine failure . It means Red Bull's problems seem to continue in the short term, leaving Horner to state: 'The solution is we get our heads down and we work hard. 'From Red Bull's point of view, we'll offer as much support in the relevant areas as we can. 'It's a s****y position to be, but we've just got to engineer our way out of it.' Abiteboul is aware the two failures at the Shanghai International Circuit will be addressed, adding: 'We've just got to analyse what happened a little bit. 'It looks like the two issues are similar. We need to have a clear understanding. 'But we knew we had this reliability risk above our heads. Obviously it struck today, not the best day. It's a tough business. But we will not surrender. We are in this together and we will hopefully fight back.'","Daniel Ricciardo finished 9th while Daniil Kvyat retired with engine failure .

"Vincent Kompany has revealed that his mum halted a move allowing him to join Manchester United when he was just 17-years-old.

"Richie Benaud’s family have been offered a state funeral after Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott called his death the ‘greatest loss for cricket since the loss of Don Bradman’. The former Australia captain and legendary broadcaster died on Wednesday at the age of 84 following a battle with skin cancer. Abbott said: ‘There would be very few Australians who have not passed a summer in the company of Richie Benaud. Richie Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . Benaud was the voice of cricket for generations, commentating in his native Australia and for the BBC . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has offered Benaud's family a state funeral . Benaud, pictured on his wedding day to wife Daphne, and during his time as Australia captain . Benaud was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests . ‘He was the accompaniment of an Australian summer, his voice was even more present than the chirping of the cicadas in our suburbs and towns, and that voice, tragically, is now still. But we remember him with tremendous affection.’ State funerals in Australia are generally reserved for politicians. Even Bradman himself turned down the offer of one before his death in 2001. But such is the esteem in which Benaud was held, both as an engaging all-round cricketer – he took 248 Test wickets with his leg-breaks and scored 2,201 runs – and as a commentator, that Abbott has been moved to make an exception. David Gower, Geoffrey Boycott and Benaud assembled a formidable line-up for the BBC in 1995 . A master with the microphone to his lips, Benaud also was well aware of the power of silence . The tributes continued on Friday to a man routinely referred to as ‘the voice of cricket’. His fellow leg-spinner Shane Warne said, ‘For me it was an honour and a privilege to call you a close friend and mentor’, while Sachin Tendulkar described his death as a ‘great loss to the world of cricket’. Australia’s Test captain Michael Clarke praised Benaud for helping ‘the Australian team have the attitude where they wanted to win. He played the game the right way’. One of Clarke’s predecessors, Steve Waugh, said: ‘His legacy to the game will always live on.’ The veteran Australian radio commentator Jim Maxwell said: ‘He has been the most influential, revered and respected person in the game for 50 years. As Australian captain he never lost a series. As a commentator he was precise, authoritative and deliciously understated.’ Benaud, pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book My Take on Cricket, was widely respected and loved . Benaud pays tribute to Australian media mogul and cricket pioneer Kerry Packer after his death in 2005 . ON COMMENTATING . 'What I want most from being a television commentator is to be able to feel that, when I say something, I am talking to friends.' 'My mantra is: put your brain into gear and if you can add to what's on the screen then do it, otherwise shut up.' 'The key thing was to learn the value of economy with words and to never insult the viewer by telling them what they can already see.' 'Out in the field, you haven't got anyone whispering into your ear saying all sorts of things, you've got to do it yourself.' ON CAPTAINCY . 'The hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss, at the right time.' 'Captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill. But don't try it without that 10 per cent.' ON BATTING . 'Bruce Reid is not the worst batsman there is at international level but those who are worse would not need to hire the Myer Music Bowl to hold a convention.' 'Glenn McGrath dismissed for two, just ninety-eight runs short of his century.' 'He's not quite got hold of that one. If he had, it would have gone for nine.' ON BOWLING . 'A bleeding ring finger at the end of every training session was not only normal but essential for my development as a wrist spinner.' 'Your wrist must be cocked, but not stiffly cocked.' 'You must always look where you want to land it. If I offered you 10,000 dollars to hit a tin can, you'd never take your eyes off it.' ON TWENTY20 CRICKET . 'If any form of game can pull 20,000 spectators into a game of cricket it's great for the sport. I think it's wonderful.' 'As long as the people who run the game have brains and keep three forms of the game I think it will be terrific.' ON SHANE WARNE'S 'BALL OF THE CENTURY . 'Gatting has absolutely no idea what has happened to it. Still doesn't know.' ON 1981's 'UNDERARM BOWLING' SCANDAL . 'A disgraceful performance from a captain who got his sums wrong. It should never be permitted to happen again. One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field.' MISCELLANEOUS . 'The slow-motion replay doesn't show how fast the ball was really travelling.' 'A cricket ground is a flat piece of earth with some buildings around it.' 'He's usually a good puller - but he couldn't get it up that time.' 'Cricket has changed for the better ... it's because of what happened then, cricket is so strong now.'","Richie Benaud passed away aged 84 on Friday .
