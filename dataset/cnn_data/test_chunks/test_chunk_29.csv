"We think of them as thriving in wildflower meadows and rolling fields. But new research suggests Britain’s bees are happier near towns and cities. A study of wildlife sites across four English counties has found that most are home to fewer species of bee today than they were in the past. It found that the expansion of farmland has actually been more damaging to Britain’s bee population than the concreting over of the countryside for housing. A Reading University researcher has said that bees prefer cities to fields (honey bees in Paris shown). The expansion of farmland has actually been damaging to bee population, according to the researcher. Wildlife sites in four English counties saw bee species decrease . For instance, heaths and meadows near Milton Keynes now boast more species of bee than sites in more rural areas. Reading University researcher Dr Deepa Senapathi believes intensive agriculture is to blame. Climate change could be disrupting the relationship between bees and plants. That's according to a study that said warmer springs can change the life cycles of bees, which can throw them out of sync with the plants they pollinate . The research is the first clear example of the potential for climate change to disrupt such critical relationships between species. The study, Potential Disruption of Pollination in a Sexually Deceptive Orchid by Climate Change, was carried out by the University of East Anglia (UEA) and was published in the journal Current Biology. While the gardens, parks and churchyards of towns and cities provide bees with a variety of plants to forage on and an extended flowering season, popular crops such as oilseed rape only bloom for a few weeks. She said: ‘While concreting over the countryside may appear to be bad news for nature, we’ve found that progressive urbanisation may be much less damaging than intensive agriculture. ‘Urban areas may benefit bees more than farmland by providing a wide variety of flowering plants, providing a cosmopolitan menu for insects from spring through to autumn. ‘Over the past century rural landscapes in Britain have become increasingly dominated by large expanses of monoculture - the growing of a single type of plant, which has helped boost crop production. ‘But without a mixture of habitat and food sources, rural areas can sometimes be little better than green deserts for biodiversity.' Scientists around the country are trying to work out why populations of bees and other insects are plummeting. Pesticides, climate change and disease may, like intensive farming, be playing a role. The latest research is published in the Royal Society journal Proceedings B. Dr Deepa Senapathi believes intensive agriculture is to blame. While the gardens, parks and churchyards of towns and cities provide bees with a variety of plants to forage on and an extended flowering season, popular crops such as oilseed rape only bloom for a few weeks (stock image of honey bee shown)","Reading University researcher says bees prefer cities to fields .

"Changes: Mark Dawe, head of the OCR exam board, said schoolchildren would only have a short time to use the search engine during tests - and compared it to using a calculator in a maths exam . An exam board boss has today been accused of 'dumbing down standards' after suggesting students should be allowed to use Google in their GCSE and A-level exams. Mark Dawe, head of the  Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations board (OCR), said schoolchildren would only have a short time to use the  search engine during tests - and compared it to using a calculator in a maths exam. He said most pupils now learn through search engines anyway – and teachers should test how students interpret answers, rather than how they find them. Today Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the idea would lead to a 'dumbing down of standards'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's a nonsense. 'We have a crisis in standards in this country. We are three years behind the Chinese at the age of 15, we have got universities running remedial courses. 'We have got employers saying too many youngsters are unemployable. 'And here we have the OCR board saying ""let's dumb things down"". Row: Education campaigners say that this would send standards plummeting and said exams are about knowledge not hunting for information . Ranking: According to the latest OECD international rankings on education, from 2013, the UK is behind much poorer countries including Lithuania, Latvia and Hungary . 'You can have an exam on how to use Google, but that is not the same as having a history or geography exam. 'Exams should be about knowledge and understanding. It includes knowledge, therefore we do have to test what children are carrying the in their heads.' It would damage the board's credibility, he insisted, because 'sensible people' want their children to take proper exams. Mr Dawe told the programme that the arguments were the same used in relation to allowing calculators in maths exams. He added: 'You do need to have a base understanding of things. 'Actually, one of the most important things is about understanding what comes up on Google or some search engine. 'It is about understanding the tools they have got available and how to utilise those. 'I think that is a very rich way of learning and a very rich way of assessing. 'That is relevant, that is what they will be doing in working life.' He said Google could be allowed on some papers but not others, depending on the type of questions being asked. 'You ask different questions and it is about interpretation,' he added. 'It's about discussion, it is about application.' He said he could not see Google coming in any time soon but suggested it was 'certainly inevitable' longer term.","Mark Dawe, head of the OCR exam board, said it is like using a calculator .

"Tom Ballard plans to climb K2, 20 years after his mother died descending from its peak . A climber has set his sights on the summit of K2 - the second highest mountain in the world - 20 years after his mother died attempting the same feat. Alison Hargreaves, 32, was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalayan mountain in 1995. Now her son Tom Ballard, one of the world's most accomplished climbers, plans to conquer K2 himself. Mr Ballard, 26, told The Times that he saw it as his destiny to follow in his mother's footsteps. He said: 'I think it must be. At one stage I thought I would go and climb mountains for her. Then I realised that was actually a bit stupid because she had already climbed them herself. I realised I was climbing for myself. That's how I've gone on.' Last month Mr Ballard became the first to solo climb all six of the great north faces of the Alps in the winter season - and now he is training for K2. The climber was just six years old when his mother died while descending K2, which is regarded as more difficult to reach than the summit of Mount Everest, with dozens dying during attempts to reach the top. Days before her death, Mrs Hargreaves sent a fax to her son and his sister Katie. It read: 'Tom and Katie, We have arrived at our base camp. The trek was difficult — it snowed every day. The mountain I have come to climb is called K2.' Attached was a drawing of the 28,251ft mountain which would later claim her life. Mr Ballard's mother was a revered figure in the climbing world and was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen.

Tragic: Mr Ballard was just six years old when his mother died on her way down from the summit of K2 . Her decision to take on dangerous climbs while raising a young family was criticised by some, but she shrugged off the flak, saying that fathers who went climbing did not face the same scrutiny. When she climbed the north face of the Eiger, in the Swiss Alps, in 1988, Mrs Hargreaves was pregnant with her son. Mr Ballard said he had clear memories of clambering over rocks as a child and had always known climbing was his calling. 'When I grew, I was always scrambling around on little rocks underneath the crags where my mum and dad climbed. A child, playing,' he said. 'At primary school I had something like an epiphany. Suddenly I decided that all I wanted to do with my life was just to climb. Since then that's pretty much all I have done.'","Alison Hargreaves, 32, was killed in 1995 as she descended from K2 .

"THE WILD OATS PROJECT . by Robin Rinaldi . (Hodder £14.99) At the age of 42, San Francisco-based journalist Robin Rinaldi believed she had accidentally succeeded in conceiving a longed- for child. The pregnancy test turned out to be wrong, but her husband Scott wasn’t taking any more chances: he got a vasectomy. Rinaldi’s response was to demand an open marriage and bed 12 strangers in as many months. She’s now written a graphic, tell-all memoir about that year and its very messy fallout. Robin Rinaldi (pictured) demanded an open marriage from her husband, Scott after he had a vasectomy . When they met, 17 years earlier, Rinaldi wasn’t sure she wanted kids. As her biological clock began ticking louder, though, a child came to embody the solution to all sorts of problems. It would strengthen their marriage of opposites, help her finally overcome a troubled childhood as the daughter of an alcoholic bookie and give her life a sense of purpose. Her husband, meanwhile, was adamantly against it from the start. For reasons she never quite gets to the bottom of, he has no desire ever to become a father. She depicts him as stable and stoic but, frankly, he sounds a bit of a cold fish, spending much of his spare time making mead, keeping a file on his laptop entitled My World View and refusing to look her in the eye during sex. After his vasectomy, Rinaldi’s discontent settles onto her failure to sleep around when she was single. ‘I refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers,’ she declares. ‘If I can’t have one, I must have the other.’ Promiscuity, she’s certain, will enable her to look back from her deathbed and feel she’s lived. Instead of ending her marriage, she strikes a bargain that seems to give her the best of both worlds. During the week, Rinaldi lives in a rented studio, free to have as much casual sex as she likes. She picks up men on business trips, places ‘good girl seeks experience’ ads online and, eventually, gravitates to an urban sex commune, where very hands-on orgasmic meditation is practised twice daily. Come the weekend, she returns to Scott and their cat Cleo — no questions asked. Reading about her Wild Oats Project, it’s hard to know what’s more astonishing — that Scott ever agreed to this 5:2 open marriage or that Rinaldi thought it could possibly solve anything. Full disclosure: some years ago, I published a memoir about my own year-long experiment — with chastity. Afterwards, several people told me I should write a follow-up in which I did the exact opposite. I assumed they were joking, but that’s more or less precisely what Rinaldi has done. Not that it isn’t titillating stuff — at least to begin with. What she craves most especially is dirty talk, and she gives as good as she gets. There’s no hint of coyness as she details every sexual act she participates in along the way. As it gets steamier, her prose flushes a deep purple. There’s also some truly terrible dialogue. ‘Hmmm,’ she says, after being given technique tips by a 23-year-old she’s just slept with. ‘Roger that.’ Reading about another person’s orgasms turns out to be just as dull as flipping through their dream journal. Of her 12 partners, most are younger and two are women, one of whom agrees to a threesome. Yet they soon start to merge. This is California, and every other lover seems to be a vegan or a healer or a vegan healer. They strum her songs they’ve written as she fries them soya sausages. Only one of them really gets to her. Alden is a writer in his late-30s. They meet online and quickly tumble into bed. ‘In his sheets, I uncovered women who had lain dormant in me for years,’ she trills. He tells her she’s a goddess and that he worships her — until he ends it, abruptly. Later, when Rinaldi’s year is up and she finds herself back living full-time with Scott, trying to patch up their — you guessed it — deeply fractured intimacy, it’s an email from Alden that finally derails everything. As more women cross childless into middle-age, there’s undoubtedly a book to be written about their journey. This is not it. In fact, Rinaldi seems able to define herself solely in relation to her fertility and her allure to men. So much for her feminism. To be fair, it isn’t entirely devoid of self-criticism. Narcissistic, naïve, unfair: these are all words she applies to herself at various moments. But, in addition to being myopically self-absorbed, this is also a sad book. By the time you reach the end, any gains she’s made are balanced by some considerable losses. And then there’s the book’s dedication. To Ruby, it reads — Ruby being the name she planned to give the child she’s now unlikely ever to have.","Aged 42 Robin Rinaldi believed she had conceived a longed-for child .

"An eight-year-old boy from Layton, Utah, ran 33 miles just weeks before undergoing his fourth round of surgery on a malignant brain tumor. Lotatoa 'Lota' Ward just loves to run. Even before he was first diagnosed with a rare form of brain tumor - known as a mature Teratoma - back in October 2014, the young man was already running half marathons for charity, even raising $1,700 in September for two of his friends who suffer from spinal muscular atrophy. Though his diagnosis meant more time in the hospital, often in order to undergo some kind of surgical procedure, the tumor did nothing to stop Lota from hitting the trails. In fact, both he and his doctor say it has actually helped him through his treatments. 'I got this!' eight-year-old Lota Ward had already run several half marathons before being diagnosed with a brain tumor, and still continues to run despite his diagnosis . Most recently, Lota made the decision to attempt the 10th annual Antelope Island Buffalo Run just outside Salt Lake City, with the help of his running fanatic father. The 50-mile race was the eight-year-old's biggest challenge yet, but he tackled it like a trained professional, completing a total of 33 miles - longer than a full marathon - before his sore feet forced him to stop. 'I like running because it helps me a lot with hard times,' Lota told Runner's World. 'It doesn’t make me feel scared going into brain surgery.' In recovery: Lota underwent his fourth brain surgery on Wednesday, April 1, and while the Ward family remains optimistic, the fight is not over yet . 'I like running because it helps me a lot with hard times': Lota's hobby has become a source of strength for him in the face of several brain sugeries . Shortly after his diagnosis last October, Lota underwent two initial brain surgeries to help drain spinal fluid and to remove some of the tumor. However, due to the risk of stroke, doctor's were unable to complete the latter. Lota later went to see doctors for his three month check-up and was given devastating news: the tumor that they originally believed to be benign had grown aggressively. A subsequent biopsy lead to a new diagnosis - Lota has a Non-Germinomatous Germ-cell tumor, a malignant form of brain tumor. Luckily for the Ward family, the tumor was not untreatable. But Lota was going to be in for a fight. As tough as things became, however, Lota never stopped running. After every surgery, he would be up and walking within hours, ready to get out on the road once again. Reaching the peak: Lota was running before doctor's told him of his brain tumor. He had even ran a half marathon in aid of spinal muscular atrophy . Proud papa: Lota's father Keith Ward is also an avid runner and accompanied his son on the 50-mile race . Lota's parents were initially concerned, but their son's neurosurgeon, who also happens to be a trial runner, set their mind at ease. 'We asked [the doctor] if Lota’s running would affect the growth of the tumor or cause it to do mutations, and he said it doesn’t affect it at all,' Lota's father Keith told Runner's World. 'He said: ""As long as it keeps him happy and healthy, I don’t see anything wrong with it.""' Lota is currently recovering from his fourth surgery and, according to his Facebook page, already has his next helf marathon scheduled for May 30. And though he didn't quite finish his most recent 50-mile race, the ever-positive little runner plans to take on a 100-mile race next year.","Lotatoa 'Lota' Ward was diagnosed with a brain tumor in October 2014 .

"A Roma gang accused of selling a newborn  to a childless couple for £6,500 and a car has told a French court that the child was 'a gift' Four Roma men and women appeared in a Marseille court today, accused of human trafficking and being involved in several similar 'baby sales'. Six others are facing related charges in what prosecution documents described as 'a two thousands piece puzzle built around four births'. Human trafficking: Carmen and Mike Gorgan, pictured speaking to their lawyer in the courtroom of Marseille's Criminal Court today, are accused of paying a Roma gang £6,500 and a BMW for newborn baby boy Tony . At the centre of the scandal was Ilie Ionita, a 35-year-old Romanian, and co-conspirators Valeriu Rosu, 42, Florian Stan, 33, and Florin Coman 25. All face up to 10 years in prison and fines equivalent to more than £1million. They deny the charges against them, saying the babies were 'a gift'. The only defendant not in court was Fana Moses, the 32-year-old mother of the baby boy called Tony whom the gang sold. In July 2013, Marseille detectives received an anonymous tip that a Romanian woman had just given birth and had given the child to Mike and Carmen Gorgan, aged 27 and 28. The four accused Roma gang members deny the charges against them, saying the babies were 'a gift' Both were accused of 'complicity in human trafficking', but their lawyer, Patrick Gontart, insisted: 'They do not believe they have done anything wrong'. The Roma gang was arrested as they prepared to board a flight from Italy back to Romania. At first all denied that money or good had been exchanged, but it was quickly established that Mr Gorgan had handed over 9000 euros(£6,565) and the BMW to Ionita. Mr Gontart said: 'For a month and a half, Carmen behaved like Tony's mother and was very well treated.' He said the couple had 'fallen into the trap of many European couples. These are good people who are now unhappy because their child has been placed in a home.' Documents including identity cards were falsified to try and make it look like the parents who bought the baby were the biological mother and father. They had been trying for children unsuccessfully for ten years, the court heard. At least three other cases of babies being sold were then tracked down, both on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica and on the mainland. In all, two boys were sold, while other transactions broke down. All of the children are now back with their biological mothers, or else have been taken into care by social services. OICEM, the organisation against modern slavery, is a civil party in the case – one which it says highlights the growing problem of poor immigrants offering children for sale. Referring to baby Tony's case, OICEM director Nagham Hriech said: 'There was canvassing, exchange and even negotiations.'The case, which is expected to last two days at Marseille Correctional Court, continues.","Roma gang 'sold' newborn baby to childless French couple in 2013 .

"Prince Harry will arrive in Australia next Monday to kick-off his last tour of duty, where he will spend four-weeks with the Australian military. The royal's down under tour, his final before hanging up his fatigues and retiring from the armed services, will see him , where he'll serve alongside some of the country's elite soldiers  in Darwin, Perth and Sydney. Captain Wales, as he is known in the British Army, will fall in with troops at the Perth SAS base and take on training exercises. Scroll down for video . Prince Harry will arrive in Australia next Monday ahead of his four-week stint with the Australian Defence Force . The prince will also time with Indigenous NORFORCE soldiers in the Northern Territory, and the army's Sydney-based 6th Aviation Regiment. If he passes military testing, it is possible he'll fly helicopters while with the Sydney regiment. The prince will join diggers on urban training exercises and bush patrols as well as pack marches and physical training. Before the military stretch gets underway, Prince Harry will travel to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider, according to an Australian Defence Force statement. A spokesman for Prince Harry said he had wanted to come to Australia on a military exchange for some time, and he was excited for a 'challenging and hectic' schedule. Captain Wales, as he is known in the British Army, will fall in with elite soldiers at the Perth SAS base and take on training exercices . He will also be allowed to spend time off-base, meaning Harry will have plenty of time for handshakes with his fans . 'Prince Harry is tremendously looking forward to starting his four week attachment with the ADF,' the spokesman said, according to the ABC. 'It has been an opportunity he has been keen to explore for a couple of years now and is delighted to be able to do it before completing his military service with the British Armed Forces later this year.' The fourth-in-line to the throne royal will have his army activities briefly interrupted at the end of the month, when he flies to Gallipoli with Prince Charles for Anzac Day commemorations. The ADF confirmed Harry will be given down time off-base during his stint, meaning some lucky punters could have a pint with the prince. A spokesman for Prince Harry said he had wanted to come to Australia on a military exchance for some time, and he was excited for a 'challenging and hectic' schedule . Harry will spend time with the elite SAS and Indigenous NORFORCE soldiers during his military exchange . However, the ADF said it has created a very real experience for Prince Harry. 'Defence’s focus for this attachment is to provide Captain Wales with an authentic military experience in the Australian Army that builds on his previous experience with coalition forces and complements his work with wounded, injured and ill service personnel,' a statement read. 'Defence has selected units that best utilise Captain Wales’ skills and allow him to experience a broad range of Army capabilities. The attachment will also allow Captain Wales to share the experience and knowledge he has gained over 10 years of military service in the British Armed Forces, including two operational tours of duty in Afghanistan.'","Prince Harry to arrive in Australia next Monday ahead of four-week stay .

"Vijay Chokal-Ingam claims that he posed as a black man while he applied to medical schools in 1998 because he believed he had a better chance of gaining acceptance . After opening up about his experiences of posing as a black man to apply to medical schools, Mindy Kaling’s older brother has said that his sister does not approve of his actions. On his blog, Almost Black, Vijay Chokal-Ingam said that none of his family approves of his book, in which he’ll controversially claimed he was only accepted into medical school in the late 1990s because he posed as a black man. ‘My sister Mindy Kaling (Vera Mindy Chokalingam), of the Mindy Project and Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, strongly disapproves of my book,’ he wrote. ‘She actually said, “This book will bring shame on our family”. The rest of my family does not agree with the book. Still, they respect my right to make my own decisions with my career,’ he added. Chokal-Ingam says on his blog that he felt he had to change his appearance to get into the St. Louis University School of Medicine and heavily attacks affirmative action policies in the United States. 'I was determined to become a doctor and I knew that admission standards for certain minorities under affirmative action were, let's say… less stringent?' wrote Chokal-Ingam. 'I got into medical school because I said I was black. The funny thing is I'm not.' He claims in 1998 he shaved his head, trimmed his 'long Indian eyelashes' and joined the Organization of Black Students during the process. Though his website, AlmostBlack.com, shows side-by-side qualifications and pictures of Chokal-Ingam as an Indian-American man (left) and a black man (right), he doesn't specify if he went through the same application process as an Inidan-American man as he did a black man . His change in appearance was 'so startling that my own fraternity brothers didn't recognize me'. 'Vijay the Indian-American frat boy became Jojo the African American Affirmative Action applicant to medical school,' he said, claiming that Jojo was the middle name he was born with. As an Indian-American with a GPA of 3.1, MCAT of 31 and a member of the South Asian Student Association, he didn't think he'd get into medical school, but with a change of appearance and switch of student organization, he thought he could get into some of the top schools in the nation. 'I became a serious contender at some of the greatest medical schools in America, including Harvard, Wash U, UPenn, Case Western, and Columbia,' he said about the application process. 'In all, I interviewed at eleven prestigious medical schools in 9 major cities across America, while posing a black man,' he added. Despite his startling claims, Chokal-Ingam fails to mention if he applied to the same schools at the same time as an Indian-American man. He also does not seem to appear repentant about presumably taking a place at college that would otherwise could have gone to another person. Chokal-Ingam said that his sister, sitcom star and comedienne Mindy Kaling told him not to move forward with the book . When he was finally accepted to St. Louis University School of Medicine, he used the acceptance to claim he was only granted admission because he was black and used the situation as an example of what was 'wrong' with affirmative action. Indeed, Chokal-Ingam admits that he did not even complete his medical degree and dropped out before he qualified as a doctor. Chokal-Ingam also admits he found posing as a black person to be socially fascinating. 'Not everything worked out as planned,' he wrote on his website. 'Cops harassed me. Store clerks accused me of shoplifting. Women were either scared of me or couldn't keep their hands off me. What started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment.' And unsurprisingly, Chokal-Ingam has been at the end of a huge backlash following his contentious claims. The Daily Beast claims that though his experience 'revealed inherent cultural bigotries that feed systematic racism', Chokal-Ingam didn't bring everything he could to the table. 'He chooses to sidestep, downplay, or flat-out ignore how the same racism that led to him being harassed by cops and store clerks keeps black applicants on the fringes of elite educational institutions for generations,' Stereo Williams wrote. 'It's easier for him to tap dance for the right wing as the brown man who “gets it”, while conveniently missing how ongoing racism makes affirmative action absolutely necessary,' he added. And though he claims he became a serious contender at schools across the nation as a black man, he doesn't specify if he went through the application process as an American-Indian man. 'Chokal-Ingam seems to have assumed that he would've gotten nowhere as an Indian American applicant and dove head first into this poorly-conceived 'experiment' before determining otherwise,' Williams wrote. And more so, Williams claims that Chokal-Ingam's experiment 'is insulting to what black people endure in this country, both institutionally and culturally'. Williams claims: 'And as a person of color, it's irresponsible for him to be so invested in the idea of individual exceptionalism that he ignores structural inadequacies. 'Black people can't be as 'racist' as whites societally, Mr. Chokal-Ingam. You didn't spend your time applying to black colleges in the hopes of finding work as a doctor in black-owned and operated hospitals. 'And a major reason why you were in a position to be considered for entry into any white institution is because black people generations before you made that possible through sacrifice and hard work. 'The attempt to undermine their work for the sake of promoting false 'equality' is truly regrettable. But when you conduct social 'experiments' that cite C. Thomas Howell's Soul Man as an inspiration, it's obvious that you don't take these issues all that seriously.' A spokesperson for Mindy Kaling was unavailable for comment.","Vijay Chokal-Ingam claims he posed as a black man and was accepted into the St. Louis University School of Medicine in 1998 .

"Amazing images of a typhoon heading for the Philippines have been snapped from orbit by two astronauts. Typhoon Maysak was initially a top-rated category 5 typhoon, causing troops in the Philippines to be put on alert today. And residents and toursists along the eastern coast have been warned that it will hit land some time in the next 72 hours. This image taken Tuesday 31 March 31 shows Typhoon Maysak taken by astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti from the International Space Station. The Pacific Daily News newspaper in Guam reports the storm was upgraded Tuesday to a super typhoon with winds of 150mph . As it moved over the Pacific Ocean, the storm generated winds of more than 140mph (225km/h). It is expected to weaken once it hits the central or northern parts of the main Philippine island of Luzon on Saturday or Sunday. 'Commands respect even from #space: we just flew over typhoon #Maysak,' Esa astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti said in a tweet. And fellow astronaut Terry Virts, of Nasa, said: 'Looking down into the eye - by far the widest one I've seen. It seemed like a black hole from a Sci-Fi movie #Maysak.' Accuweather.com reported that the storn was one of the strongest cyclones in history during the months of January, February and March. Although it is expected to weaken slightly, it will still pose a significant threat to islands in its past. It first developed into a tropical storm last Friday, and now the full power of a super typhoon can be seen in the images. The steep walls of cloud drop into the eye of the storm, and more than 10 inches (250mm) of rain have been reported under the storm. Nasa astronaut Terry Virts captured the eye of typhoon Maysak early in the morning with the shadow being cast deep into the vortex. The storm was moving west-northwest at 15mph . The eyewall of Super Typhoon Maysak is seen as it heads west-northwestward through the western Pacific Ocean, northwest of Yap Island, in this infrared image taken by the Suomi NPP satellite's VIIRS instrument 1 April 2015. The storm has maintained its 15 nautical mile diameter eye, but is weakening slightly as dry air encroaches from the southern periphery, according to Noaa . This map from Accuweather shows the path of super typhoon Maysak over the next few days . This image was taken yesterday by astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti from the International Space Station.  Officials say super Typhoon Maysak is expected to significantly weaken before reaching the Philippines around Sunday . 'The eye of #Maysak typhoon really stands out early in the morning with the shadow being cast deep into the vortex,' said Terry Virts . 'This is very strong and it will maintain its strength as it nears, although we expect that the typhoon will weaken,' Esperanza Cayanan, an officer at the weather bureau, said in a televised briefing. 'But this will still be typhoon intensity so it will bring strong winds when it makes landfall on the eastern coast. British-based Tropical Storm Risk said Maysak would likely weaken to a category 2 typhoon, with maximum winds of up to 110mph (175km/h), when it hits land. The typhoon could damage rice and corn crops in central and northern areas of the Philippines, although damage is likely to be minimal because the major harvest of the national staple rice was finished around February. Super Typhoon Maysak is seen tracking west-northwestward through the western Pacific Ocean, northwest of Yap Island in this image taken by the Suomi NPP satellite's VIIRS instrument around 04:25GMT (00:25 ET) 1 April . 'Commands respect even from #space: we just flew over typhoon #Maysak,' Esa astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti said in a tweet . Alexander Pama, executive director of the national disaster agency, said the biggest challenge for authorities would be keeping foreign and Filipino tourists travelling to northern provinces for the weekend safe when Maysak makes landfall. Thousands of Filipinos have already begun travelling to the provinces and popular tourist spots before the Easter weekend. Maysak is not expected to make landfall where another category 5 typhoon, Haiyan, struck more than a year ago, leaving nearly 8000 dead or missing. The storm is expected to dissipate shortly after it leaves the Philippines.","Italian Esa astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti and US astronaut Terry Virts have snapped images of a typhoon .

"Murdered: Road rage victim Shahnawaz was returning home from a family function when the shocking attack occurred . At around 10.30pm on Sunday, Turkman Gate lived up to Delhi’s reputation as a city that has lost its soul. Two children, 13 and nine years old, stood wailing and begging bystanders as five local strongmen mercilessly beat their father to death over a traffic quarrel. Road rage claimed another life. No one in the crowd came forward. The police did not arrive from a chowki merely 50 metres away. You could tick every item on Delhi’s infamous check-list. When no one came to their father’s rescue, the hapless children ran to the cops, who asked them to call 100. By the time the police reached the spot, their father was lying in a pool of blood, and was declared dead on arrival at the Lok Nayak Hospital. The death of 40-year-old Shahnawaz has shaken the city. Murders are commonplace in the Capital, but a man being thrashed to death because his motorcycle grazed a car as bystanders watched in silence is a new low even by Delhi’s standards. Also, while Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi boasts about the new police motto “Shanti, Seva or Naya” and compares the force to the best-rated police departments across the globe, his men stood and watched Shahnawaz die without raising a finger. According to the Delhi Police, Shahnawaz was returning home from a family function with his two sons on a motorbike when it grazed a car near Turkman Gate in Daryaganj. Iron rods . The driver of the i20 car, identified as Shadab, got into a verbal spat with Shahnawaz. Shadab reportedly told Shahnawaz to move his bike as he was unable to manoeuvre his car. When Shahnawaz expressed his inability to do so due to heavy traffic, Shadab, along with Khalid Amin, another occupant of the car, started thrashing Shahnawaz with iron rods. Later, three other occupants of the car,  Atif Lala, Mohammed Wasim, and another unidentified person, got out and joined them. Seeing their father being attacked so mercilessly, Fahad and his younger brother Kaif tried to hold back the accused, but were pushed aside. The boys then ran to the nearest barricade where two policemen were standing and begged them to help their father. ‘Dial 100’ The cops allegedly told them to dial 100. The children then ran to their grandmother's house nearby and said: “Abu ki bahar ladai ho gayi hai kuch logo ke saath (Dad is involved in a fight outside with some people)”. By the time the family reached the spot, it was already too late. Shahnawaz, bleeding heavily, was rushed to the nearby Lok Nayak Jaiprakash Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. Sorrow: A large crowd mourns the death of road rage victim Shahnawaz in the Turkman Gate area . Heart-breaking: Shahnawaz's mother breaks down in the Walled City after hearing the news of her son's death . Numb with grief: Shahnawaz's devastated parents are supported by relatives . On Monday evening, almost 24 hours after the incident, Turkman Gate wore an uneasy calm. Throughout the day, Shahnawaz’s family members and relatives sat in protest on the road with his body. A crowd of 200 choked the entire stretch, causing traffic jams across central Delhi in places like New Delhi railway station, ITO, Mandi House and Connaught Place circle. Protesters held up a banner which had Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s picture along with those of the accused, demanding quick arrests. The victim’s relatives said police are trying to protect Amin. “Amin was the one who triggered the spat and started thrashing Shahnawaz. Police are clueless even after 12 hours of the incident,” Shahnawaz’s relative, Shahbuddin, told Mail Today. Delhi Police chief Bassi has assured that all accused will be arrested soon. “Mohammed Wasim has been arrested and the hunt for the remaining four is on,” he said, while briefing the media. Family of goons on a short fuse claims life . By Ankur Sharma in New Delhi . The arrogance and short temper of a family which has right connections with policemen and local politicians has snuffed out an innocent life. Residents of Delhi’s Turkman Gate, where 40-year-old Shahnawaz was thrashed to death on Sunday night, allege that main accused Khalid Amin alias Amin Pahalwan belongs to a family of goons, and all his 17 brothers are involved in illegal activities. In 2011, Amin was involved in a fight with former MLA Shoaib Iqbal. Three of the other accused in the Turkman Gate killing were also embroiled in that case. Relatives of the road rage victim point to the photos of some of the accused on an AAP hoarding in the area. However, a local AAP leader said they were not members of the party . Amin was initially a petty criminal. He was first arrested along with an associate in 1995 in an attempt to murder case from Seelampur area of North-East Delhi. The rogue element of Chandni Mahal area started a construction business since 2010. “He has a construction and a handicraft business, but he is involved in various criminal cases. His brothers are also facing criminal charges,” a senior police officer said. Amin is allegedly involved in eight criminal cases - robbery, an attempt to murder, rioting and incidents of causing hurt. “He always carries a country-made pistol and a knife,” police sources said. Importantly, Amin enjoys good connections with the local police as his day-to-day work requires their co-operation. Drunk men thrash LS MP's son in another case . The Turkman Gate incident was not the only case of road rage reported in the Capital on Sunday. In another case, the son of a Lok Sabha MP was allegedly thrashed by three men in South Delhi’s South Extension area. The Delhi Police have arrested three accused in connection with the incident after registering a case under five IPC sections. According to police sources, the incident occurred when Ritu Raj, the son of Jahanabad MP Dr Arun Kumar, asked one of the accused to not park his Scooty in front of the gate of his residence. “Around 10pm, the police got a call from South Extension Part-2 that three-four men have beaten up a man. When the police reached the spot, they found the MP’s son lying on the road. A PCR vehicle took the victim to the nearest hospital. “After examining him, the doctors said Ritu Raj had dislocated his shoulder,” a police officer said. Sources said the police have arrested three accused. The main accused has been identified as Manohar Lal Batra. Ritu Raj also told the police that all the accused were drunk when they thrashed him. The accused also allegedly threatened to kill the victim’s sister if she intervened.","Shahnawaz, 40, was beaten to death by five thugs because his bike - stuck in traffic - was blocking their way .

"Older people are more susceptible to emotions when making decisions over their retirement, scientists have warned (file picture) Older people are more susceptible to emotions when making decisions over their retirement, scientists have warned. Experts in America found that more than 50 per cent of pensioners with investments during the 2007 and 2008 global financial crisis panicked and sold them after the stock market fell by 30 per cent. Research carried out by scientists at Texas Tech University showed how those who did follow that path and sold at the lowest point eight years ago with a pension of £100,000 would only have £63,000 today. If they had resisted the temptation to sell, the same pot would be worth £141,000 today provided they had not spent any of the cash. It comes just days before retirees in Britain are given the power to decide how to spend their life savings for the first time ever in the biggest shake-up of pensions for almost a century. The Daily Telegraph quotes the authors of the study, Michael Finke and Chris Browning as saying: ‘Avoiding mistakes requires the ability to regulate emotions through our more rational cognitive process. ‘Consumers are increasingly responsible for managing their retirement savings... (but) we also find that cognitive scores decline with advance age.’ The newspaper says 1,204 retired people with investments between 2006 and 2008 were analysed as part of the study, which has been published in the Journal of Consumer Affairs. It reveals that retirees with better-than-average ability to solve ‘logic problems’ were more unlikely to make misjudgments in the investment market based on their emotions. The authors add: 'Lower levels of cognitive ability in old age can reduce an investor's ability to control emotional responses to a loss. Anyone in Britain turning 55 who isn’t in a final salary scheme will soon be allowed to dip in to their pension and take the income they need, under reforms announced by George Osborne (pictured) 'Greater sensitivity to loss may increase preferences for safety following a market decline, resulting in allocations away from stocks that are associated with long-term underperformance.' Under reforms announced by Chancellor George Osborne, anyone in Britain turning 55 who isn’t in a final salary scheme will simply be allowed to dip in to their pension and take the income they need from April 5. They could keep the money invested in the stock market to boost their profits. And if they die their spouse or loved ones will be able to inherit whatever is left over.","Half of pensioners in US with investments during 2007 financial crisis sold them at wrong time, research finds .

"Most people give up chocolate for Lent but one businesswoman decided to use her 40 days to change the lives of others - after almost losing her own. Triathlete Charlotte Roach, 26, from London, who nearly died in a horror crash, gave up ordinary clothes for Lent to raise money for the charity that saved her life. Along with her business partner Rosemary Pringle, 28, the pair vowed to sport only fancy dress costumes for 40 days to fundraise for London's Air Ambulance. Charlotte Roach and her business partner Rosemary Pringle dressed up in different costumes for every day of lent to raise money for the Air Ambulance Service which saved Charlotte after she was involved in car accident in 2010 . The two women rated buskers in London's Trafalgar Square while dressed as Simon Cowell, rode the Tube as Baywatch lifeguards and even pitched to clients in their pyjamas. Charlotte, co-founder of fitness company Rabble, owes the charity her life after a crash in November 2010 left her with punctured lungs, 12 fractured vertebrae, broken ribs and a broken collarbone. The fitness fanatic had been out cycling near Melton in Leicestershire in a bid to make the 2012 Olympic triathlete team when her bike collided with a Land Rover. She said: 'When I went down, nobody on my team saw it, so they just assumed I'd taken a tumble and I'd be fine in a minute or two. 'Luckily, the car behind us was driven by a physio for Leicester Tigers' rugby team and she took a look at me. Charlotte continued: 'She could hear a gurgling sound when I spoke, which was the sound of blood seeping into my lungs. Charlotte and Rosemary dressed up as Simon Cowell one day and rated performers in Leicester Square . The two women larked about dressed as Reindeer in some shrubbery . 'Effectively, I was drowning and I was running out of time to live. Her quick thinking probably saved my life.' Charlotte was airlifted to Royal Derby Hospital, where medics battled to pull her back from the brink of death. She underwent emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstructive work. Doctors warned she may never walk again, but determined Charlotte worked hard at her rehabilitation. She said: 'In my head I thought as soon as I got home, it would all be okay, but when I got home I couldn't really move. 'I still had holes in my chest that needed to be re-dressed and repacked by doctors every day. Charlotte (left) and Rosemary (right) wore a series of different costumes, here Rosemary is dressed as Harry Potter . Charlotte said that the pair had a lot of different reactions, from laughter to confusion . The former triathlete said that with some of the costumes it was hard for people to tell whether they were dressed up or not . 'One day, despite my mum's protests, I decided to walk to the doctors. My neighbour had to come round to tie my shoes as I couldn't bend down. 'I started walking but had to stop after around 400m. That's when it hit home how little I could do.' Following the accident, Charlotte, who had left university to train as a triathlete full time, was dropped by her former sponsors. 'I wanted to prove I could get back to where I used to be, fitness wise,' she said. 'The less people believed in me, the more determined I became. 'I later found out that, after the accident, doctors called my parents to say I may not survive. I think I was the only person who didn't think I was going to die.' Larking about on a Boris bike Charlotte dressed up as a clown . Following her accident Charlotte was left with severe injuries and had screws put into her spine . Slowly, Charlotte began to repair herself. While easing herself back into exercise, she stumbled upon the idea for Rabble, a fitness company that disguises exercise as games like capture the flag and dodgeball. 'While I was recovering from my injuries I thought to myself: ""exercise as an adult really sucks."" It can be repetitive, isolating and boring. 'I wanted to recreate that feeling of playing out with your mates as a kid.' It was the Rabble members that birthed the idea of the fancy dress challenge. 'We were coming up with fun ideas of what to give up for a Lent. A few were chucked around but none really stuck,' said Charlotte. For this costume Charlotte joked about as she was dressed up as a robber . The girls went about their daily lives whilst dressed in the costumes, including going to work and going to meetings . 'Somebody suggested [giving up] clothes as a joke and at first I thought: 'that's the kind of thing that gets people arrested,' but then we decided to give up normal clothes instead. 'We forget we're wearing costumes until we get weird looks. People do react quite differently. Some laugh, and some almost look disgusted. It depends on the outfit as some aren't obviously fancy dress. 'Our most embarrassing moment so far was meeting with a big, corporate bank in our pyjamas. At first, they wouldn't even let us in the building.' In August 2012, Charlotte cycled 16,000 miles from Beijing to London, raising £10,000 for London's Air Ambulance. Now, she is keen to keep donating. 'I owe the Air Ambulance my life. I wouldn't have survived without them,' she said. 'At the very least I want to donate enough to save someone else life.' For this look they used toilet roll to turn themselves into mummies .","Charlotte Roach was nearly killed in a horrific car accident in 2010 .

"The emails that resulted in the firings of two police officers and a court clerk in the city of Ferguson, Missouri were released on Thursday. Seven in particular are remarkably racist, including one that was previously released in which disgraced police officer Richard Henke says of President Barack Obama; 'What black man holds a steady job for four years.' In the other emails President Obama is labelled a monkey, welfare recipients are described as 'lazy' and unable to speak English before being compared to dogs and black individuals are First Lady Michelle Obama is called a tribeswoman. Scroll down for videos . The emails (above) that resulted in the firings of two police officers and a court clerk in the city of Ferguson, Missouri were released on Thursday . Police captain Richard Henke (left) and city cleark Mary Ann Twitty (right) were fired after exchanging racist emails . Former police sergeant William Mudd (above) said he was getting his dogs welfare in one email as they are 'mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English, and have no frigging clues who their Daddies are' One email, sent by city clerk Mary Ann Twitty to Captain Henke and former police sergeant William Mudd, and obtained by the Washington Post, shows President Ronald Reagan holding a monkey and feeding it a bottle. The caption underneath reads; 'Rare photo of Ronald Reagan babysitting Barack Obama in early 1962.' Twitty wrote at the top of that email; 'Some of these emails just touch me more than others.' All three were removed from their jobs after  the emails were discovered. Another email sent by Twitty, this one to unknown recipients, is a story about a man having his daughter deliver his final child support check to her mother called 'Leroy's last Child Support Payment.' Last week I went to sign my dogs up for welfare. At first the lady said, 'Dogs are not elgible to draw welfare.' So I explained to her that my dogs are mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English, and have no frigging clues who their Daddies are. They expect me to feed them, provide them with housing and medical care. So she looked in her policy book to see what it takes to qualify. My dogs get their first checks Friday. Damn, this is a great country!! 'I be anxious to hear what she say, and bout the 'spression on her face,' says the father. When she returns, he asks his daughter; 'Now what yo momma say about that?' The girl replies, 'She say to tell you that ""you ain't my daddy"" and what the 'spression on your face.' There is then a photo of a black man who is missing almost all of his teeth screaming 'Lawd a Mercy!!!!!' What's more, at the bottom it says; 'A smile is contagious, pass it around.' Twitty also sent an email that showed a group of tribespeople in costumes dancing with the subject line 'Simply Beautiful,' and wrote; 'Michelle Obama's high school reunion.' Twitty is also responsible for sending an email called 'Insensitive One Liners,' saying; 'This is pretty funny stuff.' To the question 'Are there too many immigrants in Britain?' the email says that 72% responded; 'I am not understanding the question please.' Another says a man converted to Islam so he could stone his wife to death after she cheated, and there are numerous references to pedophilia and sex with underage girls. 'Went to the pub with my girlfriend last night. Locals were shouting ""pedophile!"" and other names at me just because my girlfriend is 21 and I'm 50,' says the email at one point. 'It completely spoiled our 10th anniversary. An email sent by Mudd to Twitty and then forwarded on by Twitty to unknown recipients is about a black woman getting an abortion in New Orleans. 'Two weeks later she received a check for $5,000,' reads the email. 'She phoned the hospital to ask who it was from.' It then closes by saying; 'The hospital said, 'Crimestoppers,""' In another, Mudd writes to Twitter about getting his dogs on welfare as they 'are mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English, and have no frigging clues who their Daddies are.' He adds; 'They expect me to feed them, provide them with housing and medical care.' Mudd then says at this point the worker went to see if his dogs qualified for Welfare. 'My dogs get their first checks Friday,' he wrote after that. 'Damn, this is a great country!!!!' The only email sent by Captain Henke meanwhile was the aforementioned one about President Obama. President Obama (above) has not commented yet on the emails released on Thursday . Analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records in Ferguson last month found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed African-Americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in Ferguson, an unnamed department official said. A black woman in New Orleans was admitted into the hospital [for] pregnancy termination. Two weeks later she received a check for $5,000. She phoned the hospital to ask who it was from. The hospital said, ‘Crimestoppers.’ The Department of Justice report also found that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were black. According to figures recorded between 2012 and 2014, blacks were also twice as likely to be searched than whites during traffic stops, though contraband showed up more during searches of white drivers. What's more, charges for minor violations such as 'manner of walking in roadway' disproportionately affected black residents and were used 'not as a public service, but as a tool for raising revenue.' Nationwide protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of African Americans in Ferguson, New York and Cleveland laid bare racial tensions and what President Barack Obama called 'simmering distrust' between police and communities. Black offenders are also less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and they are more likely to be taken into custody on outstanding warrants during traffic stops, compared to their white counterparts. The Justice Department plans to use the findings to negotiate policy changes with Ferguson officials and enter a consent decree, or to sue the city to force change. Previous federal investigations into police departments have resulted in such changes as reporting arrest data to the Justice Department and installing federal monitors to oversee operations. The report's findings vindicate critics who have cited a pattern of abuse in Ferguson. But they are unlikely to restore full trust in the Ferguson police by citizens who were angered when a grand jury decided not to indict Michael Brown's killer, officer Darren Wilson. After a separate investigation, the Justice Department decided not to pursue federal charges against Darren Wilson, who has said he acted in self-defense. 'What it shows is that a culture existed and was allowed to fester in Ferguson municipal government and Ferguson Police Department. What we have seen so far is a few voluntary resignations but not a full acceptance of responsibility for that culture that has been allowed to exist in that municipal government,' St. Louis official Antonio French said of the emails. 'Even after the DOJ report . . . there is still a lot of work to be done and it still remains to be seen whether the people who remain in power will be the ones to make the change.'","The emails that resulted in the firings of two police officers and a court clerk in the city of Ferguson, Missouri were released on Thursday .

"A hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing, experts warned last night. Sterling has already fallen nearly five per cent against the US dollar in the past five weeks amid jitters about the outcome of the general election. Experts said last night that a badly hung parliament, with neither major party able to form a stable government, would be likely to send to pound plummeting by a further ten per cent. Sterling has already fallen nearly five per cent against the US dollar in the past five weeks amid jitters about the outcome of the general election . The sell-off could accelerate and spread to the stock and bond markets – driving share prices down and borrowing costs up for the government, businesses and families, analysts warned. A Liberal Democrat analysis released as party leaders prepare for tonight’s seven-way TV debate showed that 98 per cent of polls conducted so far this year to a hung parliament. All the major pollsters are predicting that no party will win an overall majority, and all leading bookmakers now have the shortest odds on such an outcome. Last night, a forecast from pollster YouGov suggested the likely result on May 7 is a badly hung Parliament. It predicted the Conservatives would end up on 297 seats, only slightly down on 2010, Labour 262, the SNP 35, Liberal Democrats 30, losing almost half of their MPs, Ukip four and the Greens one. A second Conservative-Lib Dem coalition would only be able to command a Commons majority of four, making it difficult to form a stable government. Senior Conservatives are understood to have privately discussed the possibility of a three-way coalition, also involving Northern Ireland’s DUP, who currently have eight MPs, to increase the Government’s majority. George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ‘The 2015 UK general election is set to be the most unpredictable for nearly a century. There may be no good outcome for investors.’ The pound could fall by ten per cent against the US dollar between the Thursday of polling day and the following Monday if a stable government does not emerge, according to experts at currency firm Argentex. ‘Currencies react badly to political uncertainty,’ said Argentex managing director Harry Adams. ‘If polls continue to churn out mixed results in the lead up to D-day the pound will continue to soften. The real danger for sterling is if a coalition can’t be agreed by Monday.’ Pollster YouGov suggested the likely result on May 7 is a badly hung Parliament. It predicted the Conservatives would end up on 297 seats, only slightly down on 2010, Labour 262, the SNP 35, Liberal Democrats 30, losing almost half of their MPs, Ukip four and the Greens one . Veteran City commentator David Buik, an analyst at stock broker Panmure Gordon, said a hung parliament could be hugely damaging for the investors in stocks and shares such as those saving for a pension. ‘Markets are incapable of dealing with uncertainty,’ he said. He said the biggest fear in the City is a deal between Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats – an outcome that could send the stock market down by ten to 15 per cent ‘in a few weeks’. ‘The negative perception that this kind of government could have on markets could be visceral both at home and internationally,’ said Mr Buik. A hard-hitting report by BlackRock, the largest fund manager in the world, said yesterday that ‘a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine’ given Labour’s anti-business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’ s membership of the European Union. ‘Labour would be tough on business – and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility,’ the US giant said in the report. ‘A Conservatives-dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK’s EU membership. ‘Whoever wins – and the result could take some time to emerge – will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered-down legislation.’ BlackRock, which invests in major British companies such as Tesco, said weeks of horse-trading to form a government would be ‘harrowing for the UK’.","City fears the impact of an inconclusive election result on the markets .

"It looks like something straight out of a Hollywood movie, and on April 1st, most cynics may assume the Research Vessel Flip is a poorly considered joke. But the 355-foot scientific platform is genuine and has been used by the US Office for Naval Research for more than 50 years. The RV Flip does not have its own engine and has to be towed to the location of scientific study, where it turns 90 degrees, leaving just 50 feet above the surface. The reason behind the flip, is that with 300 feet below the surface, the vessel becomes incredibly stable. Instead of bobbing up and down on the waves like a traditional boat, it keeps its position. Scroll down for video . While floating on the surface the RV FLIP looks as if the back of the vessel has suffered a catastrophic accident leaving only a spine . As the vessel sinks below the surface, it looks like it is about to break up and plunge to the bottom of the ocean . The vessel uses a system of ballast tanks which fill with water to shift the centre of gravity in the vessel moving it to 90 degrees . After 20 minutes, the RV FLIP is safely positioned at 90 degrees allowing the researchers to begin their various experiments . It is used to measure underwater acoustics as well as water temperature. It can be also used for oceanography, meteorology and marine mammal observation. The vessel can accommodate five crew and up to eleven researchers for up to 30 days. Once the vessel is towed to its location it 'flips' within 20 minutes by pumping water into several ballast tanks, sinking the front section of the vessel under the waves. After the vessel completes its flip, areas which were previously bulkheads become floors, and the floor becomes a bulkhead. In the bathroom, there are two sinks at right angles to each other so the crew can wash their hand no matter which way the vessel is pointed. The vessel was launched in 1962 when its unique ability to measure sound underwater would have been vitally important for the development of submarines during the cold war. In recent years, it has been far more concerned with studying marine life far below the surface. In 2010, the vessel was deployed to research wind and swell conditions to help improve weather models. Inside the bathrooms the designers have installed sinks which are at 90 degrees to each other to cope with the flip process . The designers initially considered converting a submarine for this unusual mission but soon decided starting from scratch was better . The vessel is more than 355 feet long and has been specially designed to cope with the stress of tipping over by 90 degrees . Operators flood the ballast tanks to turn the vessel on its tail and then pump out the water using air to re-float it .","The RV FLIP looks like it might be an April Fool, but it as been working hard for more than 50 years .

"A former doctor charged with killing a Yale University physician he once worked with has been found incompetent to stand trial for the second time. New Haven Superior Court Judge Thomas O'Keefe Jr. ruled Monday that 49-year-old Lishan Wang should be sent to Connecticut Valley Hospital for treatment. In a court report submitted last month, mental health experts said Wang displayed 'paranoid thinking' and was 'guarded and suspicious' when discussing a relationship with court-appointed lawyers. Lishan Wang was charged with murder in the shooting of Yale University doctor Vajinder Toor outside his home in April 2010 . He was originally ruled incompetent in 2010, but he was restored to competency after being treated at Connecticut Valley Hospital. A new evaluation was ruled after a public defender filed a motion asking for the court to terminate Wang's self-representation . The ruling came after two mental health experts testified that Wang is unable to rationally understand criminal proceedings or assist in his defense, according to The Hartford Courant. Wang, a father of three, is charged with murder in the shooting of Dr. Vajinder Toor, 34, and shooting but missing Toor's then-pregnant wife outside the couple's Branford, Connecticut, home in April 2010. Police say the shooting stemmed from a dispute the men had two years earlier while working together at a New York City hospital. Wang, who represented himself at the hearing, is due back in court on May 21. The report said that Wang would not be able to 'establish an effective relationship with a defense attorney or to organize himself in a manner that he could be meaningfully understood by others' in his current state. Wang and Toor worked together at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in New York City, and Wang had a history of confronting Toor and other staff members before his dismissal in 2008. Toor (pictured) was shot outside of his Branford, Connecticut, home. After the shooting, Wang was found in his van with documents referring to his dismissal from Kingsbrook Medical Center in New York City, where it's believed he had confrontations with Toor . After the shooting, police found Wang in his van with documents referring to his dismissal and others involved. They also found a wig, hammer, knife and about a thousand rounds of ammunition. In 2010 Wang was originally ruled incompetent, but he was restored to competency after being treated at Connecticut Valley Hospital. When a second competency evaluation was ordered earlier this year after Chief Public Defender Thomas J. Ullmann filed a motion asking for the court to terminate Wang's self-representation. Ullmann said that Wang is mentally ill, which Wang countered by accusing the public defenders of working against him. 'This is much more complicated because of particular issues in this case that it's hard for me to figure out even where to start,' O'Keefe told The Hartford Courant. 'He chooses to represent himself, which he has a right to do, but it causes some problems on how to proceed.' Wang has asked to represent himself in his trial and accused the public defender's office of working against him . While representing himself, Wang will have an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses, make his own statements and testify on his own behalf. Though Wang did not testify at Monday's hearing, he referred to a rebuttal of the competency report in which he quoted Dostoyevsky, Socrates, Richard Nixon, Abraham Lincoln and alleged Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, as well as recounts two parables. Wang said that the experts misinterpreted his answers, misquoted him and lacked knowledge about his 'cultural background'. One of the experts from the competency report, Madelon Baranoski, said that Wang lost his 'path of rational thinking' during the evaluation and that he suffers from 'a very serious mental illness'. She added that his distrust of the public defender's office was 'reaching psychotic proportions'. 'It is our opinion that you need treatment,' she said.

Its FireChat app paved the way for chatting to friends without the need for the web or even a mobile signal. And now developers at Open Garden have built Greenstone - a small egg-shaped gadget that acts like a beacon, or a booster, to help messages move around so-called wireless mesh networks more easily . FireChat launched last year and has been downloaded more than five million times. It takes advantage of a feature that launched in Apple’s iOS 7 called Multipeer Connectivity Framework (MCF). Android has a similar feature that works over Bluetooth. MCF lets you send messages and photos even when a person has no signal by creating what is called a wireless mesh network. Apple added to Multipeer Connectivity framework (MCF) to iOS 7. It creates what’s called a wireless mesh network that connects phones to each other. Instead of sending messages using mobile or data signal, the features lets users send messages to people in close proximity that are in Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct range - up to around 30 feet (9 metres). It does this by creating a localised network in which each phone becomes a node and the data is passed between nodes. Apple uses the framework for its AirDrop feature, for example, which makes it easy to send files and data to other connected iPhone users. However, there are limits to how far a message can travel in this way - at around 200ft (61 metres) - and Greenstone has been designed to solve this. When a user opens the FireChat app, they pick a screen name to start sending messages. Within the app there are 'chatrooms' with 'Everyone' and 'Nearby' options. The former will search for all users, while the latter option applies to people within Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range who are also using the app. This is particularly useful when on a plane, or the underground. It can also be used to save money on data plans, for example. The app creates a localised network in which each phone becomes a node, and the data is passed between nodes. Apple . uses the framework for its AirDrop feature, for example, which makes it . easy to send files and data to other connected iPhone users. These messages are sent securely, so the individual nodes can’t read them. Users can also send messages anonymously to avoid snooping, for example, because data is sent from app usernames, as opposed to mobile numbers. Elsewhere, because the feature doesn’t use an internet connection, it can’t be infiltrated by hackers. The 'Everyone' Setting allows people to send information further, however. It does this by bringing all its nodes . onto one network and relaying messages from one node to another until . it reaches the final recipient. In FireChat (left) there are 'chatrooms' called Everyone and Nearby. The former searches for all users, while the latter applies to people within Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range. It takes advantage of a tool used by Apple for AirDrop (right). This creates a network in which phones become nodes, and data is passed between nodes . Nodes . are simply a vehicle for passing data along a network. On a traditional . internet network any device that’s connected to the network is also . called a node. FireChat (pictured) has been downloaded more than five million times and is particularly useful when on a plane, or the underground . For example, if a network has a phone, tablet, two computers and a printer connected to it there are five nodes on the network. Each . of these devices has a network address which is used to uniquely . identify each one. This helps keep track of where data is being . transferred to and from on the network. However, there are limits to how far a message can travel in this way - at around 200ft (61 metres) -  and Greenstone has been designed to plus these gaps. Christophe Daligault, chief marketing officer at Open Garden told Daily Dot: 'The combination between [Greenstone] and the smartphones will enable a community, or a neighbourhood, or a hospital, or any other situation where they want resilient communication, even in the case of not having any connectivity.' It could also be placed in certain locations at music festivals, organised protests, football matches and other events where having large numbers of people can crash networks. Greenstone is still under development and only currently works with FireChat at a range of around 20ft (6 metres). Messages sit on Greenstone until another FireChat comes within range, and the device has a one-year battery life. It can additionally hold up to 1,000 of the most recent messages. Open Garden is now working with manufacturers to design and sell Greenstone and the timeframe will depend on these partnerships.","Greenstone acts like a booster for so-called wireless mesh networks .

"The wife of a Detroit-area soccer referee filed a $51 million lawsuit Friday against a hot-headed player who is in prison for throwing a punch that killed her husband during a game last summer. The figure represents $1 million for each of the 51 additional years that John Bieniewicz, 44, could have lived, according to the lawsuit in Wayne County court. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland, the representative of her husband's estate, is suing Bassel Saad, along with another man who controlled the team and the soccer league. Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland (pictured left with her late husband) has filed a $51 million lawsuit against Bassel Saad (right) who is in prison for throwing a punch that killed her husband during a game last summer . Bieniewicz died after Saad punched him in the head just moments before Saad would have been ejected from a weekend game in Livonia. Dr. Jamal Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other, and performed CPR which failed to work. 'We hope this lawsuit sends a message that when you commit uncivilized acts in a civilized world there are consequences, even beyond the criminal realm,' said attorney James Acho, who had known Bieniewicz since childhood. Cyril Hall, Saad's attorney in the criminal case, said Friday that the lawsuit surprises him. 'Bassel Saad is not an individual of wealth. He was a mechanic,' Hall said. Behind bars: Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter . The Associated Press left messages seeking comment from a telephone listing for the soccer league. Saad, 37, was recently sentenced to at least eight years in prison after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. He expressed remorse in court and said he prays for the Bieniewicz family. The lawsuit also names the Michigan United Soccer League, which is accused of allowing Saad to play despite his reputation as a violent player. Citing his doctor, the lawsuit described Bieniewicz, who had two children, as being in great health with the potential to live to age 95. Bieniewicz is pictured being administered CPR on the turf after being knocked out cold by Saad . 'I speak for his dozens of buddies, many of whom go back to our days at Catholic Central High, and we want justice for his family,' said Acho, who is handling the case with co-counsel Karen Daley. In 2005, Saad was involved in another assault on a soccer field. Court documents obtained by Detroit Free Press indicate that he repeatedly struck another player in the head. Saad pleaded no contest in that case and was sentenced to five days of community service and 12 months of probation. Mrs Bieniewicz testified at Michigan's Capitol earlier this year in support of proposed legislation that would make it a felony to assault a sports official in the state. Referees ‘are out there on an island with no one to defend them,' she said. 'Something more than a misdemeanor should be in place.' Mrs Bieniewicz said that through everything, her only consolation has been the thought that her husband died doing something he loved.","Kristen Bieniewicz of Westland is suing Bassel Saad, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and is serving eight to 15 years in prison .

"Prince Harry is headed for his final tour of duty in the elite SAS headquarters in Perth, Western Australia where the soldier who claims to have shot the Taliban warlord who was intent on killing the royal heir works as a training commander. Mark Donaldson is one of Australia's most highly decorated soldiers, one of the very few to have been awarded the nation's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross, for his bravery in Afghanistan. Corporal Donaldson VC revealed in 2013 how four years earlier he had been a member of an elite Special Air Services unit ordered to assassinate a Taliban warlord who had boasted that he intended to kill Prince Harry. To kill a prince: Captain Harry Wales (pictured on his first tour of duty to Afghanistan) was the target of a Taliban warlord codenamed Javelin who had boasted he would kill the royal heir but was shot dead by a crackunit from the Australian SAS, where Harry is headed next for the final chapter of his military career . Hunted down: Corporal Mark Donaldson VC, one of Australia's most highly decorated soldiers is pictured in Afghanistan where he and fellow SAS troops hunted down and shot dead the Taliban warlord who had boasted of killing Prince Harry . Valour under fire: Mark Donaldson (pictured, right, with fellow troopers in Afghanistan) was awarded the VC for his actions in September 2008, when, despite being advised not to go and help, Donaldson ran 80 metres to rescue a wounded interpreter, while under heavy machine gun fire for a large group of insurgents . Giants among men: A rare gathering of three living recipients of Australia's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross, from left, Corporal Mark Donaldson, Keith Payne who won the VC in Vietnam, and (right) Ben Roberts-Smith who also earned his honour while fighting in Afghanistan . Known in the British military as Captain Harry Wales, the fourth in line to the throne will fulfill one of his dreams by embedding with the Australian SAS. The first threat to his life by the Taliban came between December, 2007 and February, 2008 when as a 23-year-old he spent ten weeks  on his first tour of duty to Afghanistan in the southern province of Helmand guiding fighter jets towards suspected Taliban targets. In his book The Crossroad, Corporal Donaldson revealed how the SAS regiment had uncovered a Taliban fighter codenamed Javelin in Afghanistan in 2008. Targeted by the Taliban: A Taliban warlord codenamed Javelin targeted Prince Harry on his first tour of Afghanistan and in 2012 warlords again threatened to 'eliminate' the prince . 'Javelin had been saying he was going to take out Prince Harry,' he wrote. 'We flew by Chinook to a place called Paygolkar to go after two targets codenamed Longbow and Javelin. They were supposed to be important Taliban commanders.' On the first night time attempt by Donaldson and his fellow Australian commandos, they entered the compound where the Javelin was based, in Uruzgan province,a Taliban stronghold in central Afghanistan, but the commander got away. Almost a year later in 'an exact same type of job, at the exact time of night', Donaldson writes in The Crossroad, they shot him dead. 'We went into Paygolkar one night, searching for codename Longbow. We went onto the roof of the same compound we'd been in the previous year and found nine rocket-propelled grenade warheads and a landmine. 'We didn't get Longbow, but three Talibs squirted from the target building just before we were able to take it down. They ran straight into our cordon teams and were killed. ""One had a very nice chrome-plated, clean AK-47. He turned out to be Javelin, the target we'd gone after a year earlier in the same area. Further evidence established that he had a job helping high-value individuals coming in from Pakistan.' Prince Harry's first tour in Afghanistan was cut short after an imposed media blackout on his presence there was breached. He returned for a second tour  in 2012, when again the Taliban voiced a threat to 'eliminate him'. Corporal Mark Donaldson was to have further brushes with Afghan fighters, being shot in the leg in 2012. In his memoir, he revealed more details of the incident in which his bravery had earned him the Victoria Cross. On September 2, 2008, just  weeks after his first attempt to kill the Taliban warlord Javelin, the SAS trooper and twelve other Australians in a military convoy were ambushed by a large group of insurgents. One of the interpreters had been shot and was lying on the ground. Despite being advised not to go and help, Donaldson ran 80 metres to rescue the wounded man, while under heavy machine gun fire. In 2013 the prince visited SAS HQ in Perth to pay tribute to special forces troops killed in the line of duty, and is said to have met Donaldson. Next week, he will get his first chance to join the elite group and perhaps be trained in house-to-house combat using live rounds by the highly decorated soldier who killed the warlord who threatened the prince's life. Prince Harry will arrive in Australia next Monday to kick-off his final, four week long tour of duty. The royal's last tour before hanging up his fatigues and retiring from the armed services will also see him serve alongside Australian soldiers  in Darwin and Sydney. Scroll down for video . Prince Harry will arrive in Australia next Monday ahead of his four-week stint with the Australian Defence Force, which will be his last tour of duty in the military . The prince will spend time with Indigenous NORFORCE soldiers in the Northern Territory, and the Australian Army's Sydney-based 6th Aviation Regiment. If he passes military testing, it is possible he'll fly helicopters while with the Sydney regiment. The prince will join diggers on urban training exercises and bush patrols as well as pack marches and physical training. Before the military stretch gets underway, Prince Harry will travel to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider, according to an Australian Defence Force statement. A spokesman for Prince Harry said he had wanted to come to Australia on a military exchange for some time, and he was excited for a 'challenging and hectic' schedule. Captain Harry Wales, as he is known in the British Army, will fall in with elite soldiers at the Perth SAS base and take on training exercises in the bush with the indigenous unit NORFORCE operating out of Darwin . He will also be allowed to spend time off-base, meaning Harry will have plenty of time for handshakes with his fans, but he is also said to be looking forward to training with the elite Australian SAS . 'Prince Harry is tremendously looking forward to starting his four week attachment with the ADF,' the spokesman said, according to the ABC. 'It has been an opportunity he has been keen to explore for a couple of years now and is delighted to be able to do it before completing his military service with the British Armed Forces later this year.' The fourth-in-line to the throne royal will have his army activities briefly interrupted at the end of the month, when he flies to Gallipoli with Prince Charles for Anzac Day commemorations. The ADF confirmed Harry will be given down time off-base during his stint, meaning some lucky punters could have a pint with the prince. A spokesman for Prince Harry said he had wanted to come to Australia on a military exchange for some time, and he was excited for a 'challenging and hectic' schedule . Harry will spend time with the elite SAS and Indigenous NORFORCE soldiers during his military exchange . However, the ADF said it has created a very real experience for Prince Harry. 'Defence’s focus for this attachment is to provide Captain Wales with an authentic military experience in the Australian Army that builds on his previous experience with coalition forces and complements his work with wounded, injured and ill service personnel,' a statement read. 'Defence has selected units that best utilise Captain Wales’ skills and allow him to experience a broad range of Army capabilities. The attachment will also allow Captain Wales to share the experience and knowledge he has gained over 10 years of military service in the British Armed Forces, including two operational tours of duty in Afghanistan.'","Prince Harry arrives in Australia next Monday ahead of four-week stay .

"A 17 year-old college student could face a battle with Instagram after hacking the popular photo-sharing app. Caleb Benn, a Californian high school student, recently developed a $4.99 (£3.24) app for iOS devices using Instagram's application program interface. Called 'Uploader for Instagram', it allows users to upload photos to Instagram directly from their computer rather than using only their smartphone. Caleb Benn, a Californian high school student, has developed a $4.99 (£3.24) app for iOS devices using Instagram's application program interface (screen shot pictured). Now, the 17 year-old student could face a battle with Instagram over hackings its API . According Jillian Eugenios at CNNMoney, the teenager is currently making $1,000 (£675.70) a day from the app – and Instagram isn't happy. An engineer from Facebook, which owns Instagram, sent Benn an email last week claiming the app violated the company's terms of service. The email asked Benn to 'fix' the app by Monday, but Benn said doing this would make the app would be pointless. 'To be honest, I wasn't nonplussed when I got the email from Facebook,' Benn told DailyMail.com. 'I knew my app was playing in a legal gray area, and I suspected Facebook would find out about it somehow.' Facebook has strict restrictions against using its private API. An engineer from Instagram allegedly sent Benn an email last week, claiming the app violated the company's terms of service. Pictured on the right is a screenshot of the 'Uploader for Instagram' service . Chris Messina, a Silicon Valley technologist told CNNMoney the problem is that accessing the API 'opens up possibilities for all kinds of abuse, from spambots or people uploading stuff from other channels.' One in five Instagram users now combine their photos into a single image before uploading it to the app. To capitalise on this, the Californian firm has launched its latest standalone app called Layout that lets people create such collages with up to nine images and 11 combinations. Photos can be selected from the phone's camera roll, or taken with the Photo Booth tool, and Layouts can then be 'remixed' and edited with mirror effects and flips. The Layout app has four main features called Faces, Mirroring, Photo Booth and Previews. Users begin by selecting as many images, up to the maximum of nine, to feature in the collage. Photos can be selected or deselected at any point. As they add more images, the layout of the collage changes and photos can be dragged between sections and different sized boxes as desired. These photos can then be zoomed, flipped to form a mirror image, or turned upside down. He added, if Instagram wanted users to post from a computer, they can do so themselves. 'I was initially inspired to create the app because I saw a sincerely lacking feature for the desktop,' Benn said. 'I know Instagram purposely left out the uploading feature from the web interface to keep the social network’s unique, mobile-centered ecosystem intact. Instagram did release a web version of its software, called 'Your Instagram Feed on the Web' in February 2013. This allowed users to comment on each other's photos from a desktop, but the photo sharing site still does not allow uploaded of images from a PC. To combat the problem, some Instagram fans have installed special software, such as BlueStacks App Player, designed to simulate a mobile phone operating system on their computer. Uploader for Instagram offers a simpler workaround, and it is already garnering positive reviews on the App store. One user wrote: 'For my job, we post eight to ten Instagram pictures a week that are first designed on the computer. 'So it's always been a bit of a nuisance to transfer the image over to my phone then upload to Instagram. This app takes care of that.' Instagram, which Facebook acquired in 2012 for $1 billion, has 300 million monthly users. A spokesperson for Instagram declined to comment to DailyMail.com about the developments. Benn told DailyMail.com: 'I’ve played a few of my last cards, and now I’m just going to wait for Facebook to play theirs. 'I have no idea how this entire ordeal is going to end, but at least I know that I helped make a handful of people’s lives easier–and I think that that is worth all of the trouble.'

"New York City cab drivers spend their entire work days eavesdropping on their customers conversations, so it's no surprise that many of them have learned a thing or two about love and relationships along the way. With that in mind, New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice in hopes unlocking the key to a successful union. The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on YourTango. A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own – but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what’s best for the other person. If you’re always thinking, ""How can I make the other person happy?"" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can’t do that, you’re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden – suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner’s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date. Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy . New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare. Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won’t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don’t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'. And while marrying a complete stranger may seem absurd, FYI's popular reality show Married at First Sight, which is in its second season, enlists participants to do just that. Two out of the three couples from the show's first season are still together, which probably wouldn't surprise Musaf. 'When you’re only given one option, you have to fight to make it work,' he said, adding: 'People here don’t do that.'",New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to share their tips on finding - and keeping - a partner .
"A British woman told today of her horror at finding her two best friends shot dead on a sofa at a villa in Spain. Peter Tarsey and his wife, Jean, both 77, were found covered in a green raincoat, each killed with a single bullet in a double murder of 'terrible cruelty'. The friend, Ann, said she had gone to the house on Sunday afternoon with another friend because she was concerned at not being able to reach the couple on the phone. The expat, who had been friends with the couple for 25 years, said: 'I knew something was wrong as soon as we got there. What we found was like something out of your worst nightmare. Murdered: Peter Tarsey and his wife Jean, both 77, were killed with a single bullet each while locked in each other's arms under a raincoat on their sofa in their detached country home in Xalo, near Benidorm . Grim: Police were alerted on Sunday at 4.15pm when friends went round to the house for their regular Sunday dinner. They found the door open and the couple dead in each other's arms on the sofa in the front room . 'I'm still in a state of shock. Both the couple's cars were there, so we knew they must be in the house. 'We climbed over the fence and found the kitchen door open. I knew as we entered the house something was terribly wrong. 'We saw them on the sofa covered in a green raincoat that Jean had recently bought. 'They were covered up but their legs were visible at the bottom of the coat. 'We knew it must be them but Eduardo wanted to make sure, so he pulled the coat back just to check. 'They were in each other's arms like he was protecting her. I really don't want to think about it as it's so upsetting.' A murder investigation has been launched after Jean (pictured) and Peter Tarsey, both 77, were found shot dead inside their villa in Spain on Sunday . While police say they are not ruling any lines of inquiry out, they believe the couple were murdered . Ann, who asked for her surname not to be published, said she 'can't imagine' who would want to kill them, adding: 'They were such a lovely, friendly couple who would do no harm to anyone.' She said: 'I really hope the police catch whoever was responsible and throw away the key. 'It didn't look like a robbery as the house looked normal. There were none of the disturbances you would associate with a robbery.' Ann and her friend, Eduardo Juan, found the couple at around 4pm on Sunday at the couple's house in Xalo, near Benidorm on the Costa Blanca. Their dog Domino was inside barking when they arrived. The four friends went out for lunch every Sunday and Ann became concerned when she could not raise them on the phone. Mr Tarsey always went by his middle name of David. The couple, pictured together the day before they married in February 1960 . A 15-year-old Mr Tarsey practises his diving at a pool in London, four years before competing at the Olympics . She added: 'David was an Olympic diver and Jean was a swimmer. They met when they were 13 at a diving club in England and were childhood sweethearts. 'Who could do such a thing to a defenseless elderly couple? As far as I know they had no enemies and were not overly concerned about burglaries. 'There have been some robberies not far from Xalo in recent years and they have been getting more violent, but this is just terrible. I can't imagine anything worse. 'Their sons Alexei and Sascha are absolutely devastated.' Eduardo told a local Spanish newspaper of the moment he lifted the raincoat up. He told Las Provincias: 'From the shock I got, my legs are still trembling. 'The bodies were covered with a raincoat but the legs were sticking out. 'He was hugging her, on top of her, as if he were protecting her, because my impression is that they had an extremely cruel death. 'He was such a good person, I'm sure if they had asked for money or something very valuable, David would have given it so they didn't hurt his wife.' The killer or killers threw the couple's computer into the swimming pool (above), possibly out of fear it contained images captured on the couple's webcam . Eduardo told the paper he had known the Tarseys for 40 years, adding: 'They were very good people, humble, friendly and not ostentatious. Everyone who met them loved them. 'We called the Tarseys' sons, Alexei and Sascha, at 10.30 that night to inform them of the deaths of their parents. It was horrible.' Police have revealed that Mr Tarsey was shot in the back of the neck while Mrs Tarsey was shot in the face. The killer or killers threw the couple's computer into the swimming pool, possibly out of fear it contained images captured on the couple's webcam. Police said they are still investigating the motive for the murders, but believe it may have been a bungled robbery. A television was stolen, but police denied reports that an attempt had been made to force the couple's safe. No gun was found at the property, but police believe the murder weapon was a small pistol. The Tarseys, originally from West London where Mr Tarsey worked as an engineer, bought their Spanish home in 1990. They had put it on the market for €230,000 (£170,000) last year, hoping to move to Majorca to be closer to their son Sascha, a friend said.","Peter Tarsey and his wife, Jean, both 77, each killed with single bullet .

"Residents in San Bernardino County in California were forced to flee their homes after a planned control burn in an area of brush land went out of control due to high winds. The county parks department set the fire on Tuesday to clear the area of highly flammable cattails, although a shift in the wind in the Mojave Narrows Park, between Apple Valley and Victorville caused the fire to spread. At its height, 70 acres of land was ablaze and firefighters were forced to evacuate several rural houses while they tried to contain the blaze. Scroll down for video . An estimated 200 firefighters battled the blaze in California which threatened several outlying ranches . Residents were forced to flee their homes as the fire approached their properties near Victorville . One shed and one vehicle were engulfed in flames but fortunately no homes were damaged by the blaze .

"A pensioner who nearly choked to death on a pickled onion says his Labrador saved his life – after jumping on his back to dislodge it from his throat. Alan Spencer, 67, was tucking into his dinner when the pickled onion blocked his windpipe. He frantically tried to clear his throat, and after three minutes made his way to the door in a bid to get help from a passer-by. But he collapsed in his hallway and felt his life ‘slipping away’ as he began to black out – in front of his Labradors Lexi and Nancy. Scroll down for video . Man's best friend: Alan Spencer from Withernsea with his dog Lexi who saved his life by jumping on his back when he passed out after choking on a pickled onion . Thankfully 18-month-old Lexi leaped into action and jumped on to the centre of Alan’s back, dislodging the onion and saving her owner's life. He said: ‘People will say they are only animals and don’t know what they are doing, but Lexi is so clever. ‘She saved my life most definitely. If it wasn’t for her I honestly don’t think I would be here. If it wasn’t for her actions I would be dead – lying in that passageway dead.’ The pensioner had been tucking into his dinner when he began choking and had begun to feel his 'life slipping away' Alan, who lives on his own in Withernsea, East Yorkshire, was tucking into an early dinner of crispbreads with gherkins and pickled onions when he started to choke last Thursday evening. Lexi, a rare red-coloured Labrador, and ten-month-old Nancy began to get agitated as he leapt up and tried to clear his airway. Retired club singer Mr Spencer staggered into the hallway in an effort to get to his front door for help, but his legs gave way and he fell face-first towards the floor. But  18-month-old Lexi leaped into action and jumped with all fours onto the centre of Alan's back -dislodging the onion and saving her owner's life . He recalled: ‘All of a sudden out of the blue I felt this almighty crash on my back. Lexi had just jumped straight up in the air and landed right in the middle of my back. All of a sudden the piece of skin shot out of my mouth and I could breathe again.’ He added: ‘My back hurt for two or three days afterwards – as did my throat – but I’m fine now. I’ve been spoiling them both since with treats, but every time I cough now Lexi turns her head quickly.’","Pensioner Alan Spencer's life was saved by his 18-month old Labrador Lexi .

"Sometimes life imitates art, but apparently not when it comes to the Central Intelligence Agency. Current and former female agents spoke out to the New York Times on Sunday to renounce depictions of CIA women on TV shows and in movies. The group of women say they are nothing like the honey-pots on these shows who use their sexuality to ensnare terrorists and drown PTSD with booze and pills. Retired CIA officer Sandra Grimes, 69, who helped expose her colleague Aldrich Ames as a Russian double agent, says she sees nothing of herself in the characters at the center of shows like State of Affairs and Homeland. 'I wish they wouldn’t use centerfold models in tight clothes. We don’t look that way. And we don’t act that way,' Grimes told the Times. Scroll down for video . That's not me: Retired CIA officer Sandra Grimes (pictured above in January 2013)  is one of many former and current women at the agency speaking out about depictions of female spies on TV and in movies . Veteran CIA analyst Gina Bennett, one of the 'Band of Sisters' who helped track down Osama bin Laden, has the most trouble with how her fallen co-worker Jennifer Matthews was portrayed in the film Zero Dark Thirty. In the scenes before her death in a terrorist attack on a U.S. military base in Afghanistan, actress Jennifer Ehle plays Matthews as a 'giddy' agent, excitedly baking a Jordanian source a cake for their meeting on his birthday. As in real life, Matthews dies as the agent gets out of his car and detonates a suicide vest. 'The problem is that they portray most women in such a one-dimensional way; whatever the character flaw is, that’s all they are,' Bennett said. 'It can leave a very distinct understanding of women at the agency - how we function, how we relate to men, how we engage in national security - that is pretty off.' One of the fictional CIA agents currently on screen is Charlie Tucker on NBC's State of Affairs. Played by Katherine Heigl, Charlie is a character who in the first episode gets drunk at a bar, sleeps with a stranger and lashes out at her psychiatrist. Another example is Homeland's Carrie Mathison (played by Claire Danes) - a bi-polar spy who gives up nearly all responsibility for her child (the product of a secret relationship with a double agent) and spends most of her time controlling sources with sex. A retired covert officer identified as Meredith says sex isn't a major part of the spy game. Offensive: Veteran CIA analyst Gina Bennett says she was upset with the 'giddy' portrayal of her friend Jennifer Matthews (left) in the movie Zero Dark Thirty (played by Jennifer Ehle, right). Matthews, in real life as in the movie, was killed by a suicide bomber at an Afghanistan military base in 2009 . 'Let’s not kid ourselves. For me, working in the Middle East, there’s a lot of attraction for Middle Eastern men for Western women. I don’t mean necessarily sexually...but curiosity, if nothing else. And we certainly have played that.' However, Meredith says she more often has to put men in their place while doing her work. 'You need to remove [sex] off the table very quickly and clearly. Sometimes it’s ""Get your hands off my knee or I’m going to break it,"" or you put as many people into the room as you can,' she said. While the trials and tribulations of female agents on screen are wildly exaggerated, the women interviewed said they do similarly struggle to maintain the balance between their work and private lives. It's not about sex: The real women of the CIA say they are not all honey-pots who use their sexuality to control sources (like Carrie Mathison on Showtime's Homeland, played by Claire Danes above) Sending the wrong message: The women also take issue with NBC show State of Affairs, which features Katherine Heigl (above) as a troubled CIA analyst . 'I briefed Condoleezza Rice while in labor. I’d tell her about the global jihad and then I would turn away and breathe. When these two worlds clash, they clash really hard,' Bennett said. Bennett says that the concerns of her job are so important, that it's hard to come home and sympathize with the minor dramas ruling her teenager's life. 'I deal with people who are trying to kill lots of people in horrendous, painful ways. So I have a wall; it’s really tall. Unfortunately, though, what happens with time is you can’t click it on or off. You just block the sensation of feeling,' Bennett said. 'I’m no longer married because of my wall. So I have five kids whose parents aren’t together because I constructed that wall over time and didn’t know how to get through it,' Bennett added. Many of the women though said they enjoyed working for the agency, which is becoming more and more female friendly with a day care center in Langley and flexible time off. Which is good because Bennett thinks women naturally make great agents. 'Women don’t think more intuitively than men, but we tend to trust our own gut less. We are not going to put all our money in one basket,' she said.","A handful of current and former female CIA employees spoke out to the New York Times about the portrayal of women in the agency .

"Photographer Seth Casteel's unique pictures of dogs swimming underwater managed to captivate an international audience, but now he has a new subject: babies. Casteel has found a remarkable new way to capture images of toddlers at their most playful and pure as they dive down into the deep during their first swimming lesson. The pictures for his new book, Underwater Babies, reveal adorable babies as they explore the underwater world, chubby-cheeked, curious, mischievous, and playful, all captured in his up-close-and-personal signature style. Scroll down for video . Super swimmer: Zoe Ubiera is five-months old and was one of 750 babies that Seth Casteel photographed .

Oceanic: Nine-month-old Khyleigh takes like a duck to water as she swims towards the camera . His pictures are innovative and take on an air of excitement as the youngsters swim beneath the waves. Casteel says he was drawn to create his new book, Underwater Babies after hearing of the shocking statistics of the numbers of children that drown. Kids between one and four have the highest rates of drowning than any group in the nation. 'The book is a celebration of babies, but there's definitely a serious element to it,' Casteel told Today.com. 'A big reason I wanted to make this book is to promote the cause of water safety for babies. I just want to let people know about the benefits of these classes and that they are something to strongly consider.' He created the book by heading along to water safety classes for babies at swimming pools in ten different states. He photographed around 750 babies in schools across each of the states to create Underwater Babies, which will be released on April 7. Acquatic: Michael, 12 months, explores underwater with his goggles on . Playful: Valentina, nine months, takes a dip underwater with her rattle . Under the sea: A seven-month-old named Ayla takes the plunge in a mermaid costume  in photographer Seth Casteel's new book, Underwater Babies . Serene: Casteel hopes to use the adorable photos of babies like 4 1/2 month old Michael to promote water safety for toddlers . 'I only had a limited window to really seize that moment in time because they can only go underwater just for a moment,' Casteel said. 'I could only take four or five pictures really quickly. Maybe the baby turned or there were bubbles or the instructor got in the way. I was never frustrated because that's the nature of it. You get what you get.' Apart from promoting his new 70-page book containing his creative pictures, Casteel said that he was eager to get the message across about water safety. He was spurred along after hearing a story about an 18-month old baby who drowned in a pool at a family reunion where over 40 people were present, yet the baby died after being left unattended. Floater: This 11-month-old named Warren is happy in the few moments he has beneath the pool's surface . Snapshot: Casteel often only had a second or two to capture the images of babies like Emerson who is 7 months old when they briefly went underwater . The babies in the pictures are being taught to 'self-rescue,' in which babies are taught to hold their breath underwater, kick their feet, turn over to float on their backs and rest until help arrives. The technique was pioneered in the late '60s by Harvey Barnett, who at 18 became determined to teach infants to swim after the drowning of a neighbor's child. His methods have spread around the world and are now taught in numerous clinics and imitated widely. Underwater Babies by Seth Casteel is published by Headline on 7th April at £11.99.

"An unemployed alcoholic who boasts of fathering 40 children plays ultra-violent Grand Theft Auto for up to 20 hours a day on a PlayStation4 bought with his benefits. Mike Holpin has three 48in widescreen televisions dotted around his Monmouthshire council house, each connected to his three £450 PS4 consoles all funded by his state handouts. His 40 children by 20 women have cost the taxpayer more than £4million in benefits and care costs, with at least 16 taken off him and their mothers by social services. 'I won't stop': Father of 40 Mike Holpin, left and right with his fiancée Diane, is said to have cost taxpayers £4.3million in benefits and other costs because of his huge family . Addicted: Holpin plays on his three £450 PS4 consoles for up to 20 hours a day - all paid for by benefits . But at 56 says he wants more children even though he admits he would not recognise many of his offspring in the street. Now engaged again, the three-times married man keeps track of their names with an ever-growing family tree tattooed on his back. CARE COSTS: Mike Holpin says 16 of his children were taken into care. A placement in local authority care costs an average of £150,000 a year. If they each spent just a year in care, the bill would be £2.4million. CHILD BENEFIT: £1,000 per annum for the eldest child, plus £700 per year for each additional child, which would be claimed by the person looking after the child. Assuming half his children are now adults and half are still entitled to child benefit, the bill would be at least £500,000. Child tax credits would have been worth an average of £2,000 per year, per child if the parents were not working. That’s £800,000. HIS BENEFITS: Mr Holpin claims he has received up to £27,000 a year in benefits, totalling £675,000. TOTAL BILL: £4,375,000 . His fiancee Diane Morris, 46, told The Sun: 'He's a good guy. He's been unfaithful but that's all in the past'. One of his youngest children, a three-year-old girl, was born after he agreed to help a childless couple have a baby. He said: 'I helped them by having sex with her. For all my sins I have done one or two things right'. One of his children, Hayley, 25, who is also unemployed, said: 'He was a p***head but he's done well. I'm proud,' she told The Sun. But Mr Holpin’s brother, David, 59, said the former fairground worker’s ‘shocking’ behaviour had brought ‘shame’ on the family. David Holpin, from Erith, Kent, added: ‘I lost touch with Mike when I moved to Kent 18 years ago – he didn’t have a phone so we couldn’t keep in touch. ‘It wouldn’t surprise me if he had 40 children, the way he carries on. His behaviour is shocking. I’m not ashamed of Michael, but I’m upset about the way our family name has been tarnished. ‘He has brought shame on us, and we are a good family.’ Game of choice: The father of 40 loves playing Grand Theft Auto and owns more than 200 other titles worth £50 each . His relationships have broken down because of his drinking and womanising, and the recovering alcoholic says 16 of his children have been taken into care at some stage in their lives. If they had completed just one year in care each, it would leave the taxpayer with a bill for £2.4million. Mr Holpin or the children’s mothers would also have been able to claim at least £500,000 in child benefit and a further £800,000 in child tax credits. On top of this, he has claimed at least £675,000 in benefits himself. Yet the feckless dad, of Ebbw Vale in South Wales, said: ‘I’ll never stop [having children]. Never stop. In the Bible, God says go forth and multiply. I’m doing what God wants. 'I’m as fertile as sin. I don’t believe in contraception and I love sex'. He was the subject of a Channel 5 documentary this week, but last night former friends said Holpin’s claim to 40 children – aged between three and 37 – was nonsense. And as 40 Kids By 20 Women aired, his ex-wife Petrina told of her embarrassment on Facebook, writing: ‘Feeling Asshamed’ (sic). Mr Holpin, who lives in a council house and claims benefits, said he was a changed man who no longer drank alcohol. But he still wants more children. ‘Most of my kids have gone through the care system. 'It makes me feel like s*** because they’ve suffered. They [social services] took them from me because I’m an alcoholic. I’m still an alcoholic – I just don’t practise it.’ Keeping track: Mr Holpin, from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, shows off his family tree tattoo - which includes his children and grandchildren . Family: Holpin says that he loves sex and won't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care . TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: ‘It is the lack of shame that really sticks in the throat and taxpayers will be furious. 'It is sheer arrogance to keep having children as if they were hot dinners and expect other people to pick up the bill.’ But former friends say Mr Holpin’s boasts are off the mark, and that he has fathered as few as 16 children with three women. One said he had ‘padded’ his numbers by including his ex-partner’s stepchildren. He added: ‘He’s no angel after a drink but he isn’t the big ladies’ man that he likes to think he is. 'He’s definitely had a football team’s worth of little ’uns – maybe 16 – just because he’s not fussy and not careful. But no way has he got two rugby teams and all the subs to make it up to 40.’ Offspring: Holpin admits his lifestyle led to 16 of his children being taken into care but says he wants to make it up to them . Mr Holpin and his family are infamous in the former mining town of Ebbw Vale, where locals have launched petitions to stop him moving into their street. He now lives with his fiancee Diane Morris, ten years his junior, in a council house in the village of Cwm. Mr Holpin’s daughter Rhiannon, 19, said on Facebook yesterday: ‘You can all hate but it doesn’t matter, there’s plenty of us to stick up for each other and we can take on the lot of you. ‘I feel like I can’t even leave my house without people judging. Get off my back, I didn’t ask my dad to do what he’s done with his life.’ Dream: Mr Holpin says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect .

"A doctor has told the inquest into the death of a young boy who apparently died from injuries sustained while paddle boarding, that the child had been 'caned or whipped' before he died. Two-year-old Darcy Atkinson was covered in bruises and had traces of the stimulant Ritalin in his system when he died on December 7, 2012. The toddler had been in the care of his mother's boyfriend Adam Taylor when he was rushed to Gosford Hospital by paramedics, before being airlifted to Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital after throwing up three times and going rigid in the bath. At the second day of a coronial inquest into the toddler's death, Intensive Care Unit clinical consultant Dr Barry Wilkins said it was not possible the head injuries the Darcy suffered came from a paddle board, as the boy's mother Tara Rae-Maxwell had previously claimed. Darcy Atkinson, two, died of brain injuries in December 2012. He was covered in bruises and had traces of the stimulant Ritalin in his system when he died . Dr Wilkins described the injuries the toddler sustained as 'tram-line marks', and said he had only ever seen them inflicted on a child, News Corp reported. Darcy was covered in the lines, usually sustained from being caned or whipped, and had bad bruising around his ears which appeared to be infected, Dr Wilkins said. 'There is no doubt in my mind ... that Darcy had been assaulted physically at some stage in the day before he presented,' he told the court. 'In my opinion this child has been caned or whipped,' Dr Wilkins said, adding he had seen similar marks on a child in a landmark case where the toddler was beaten to death, about 20 years ago. The clinical consultant also noted that he notified the hospital's child protection unit soon after Darcy presented. Darcy's father, who was living in Victoria at the time of his son's death, broke down in the dock as his son's horrific injuries were described, according to News Corp. Earlier in the inquest it was revealed that the toddler was covered in bruises by the time he got to hospital, and traces of the stimulant Ritalin were found in his system. The toddler  was rushed to Gosford Hospital by paramedics before being airlifted to Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital (pictured) after throwing up three times and going rigid in the bath under his mother's boyfriend Adam Taylor's care . 'We need to call an ambulance because this isn't normal,' Mr Taylor was urged by his flatmate, Nicole Warne, Glebe Coroners Court was told on Monday. The boy, described by his father Peter Atkinson as smart and proud, had earlier been paddle boarding with Mr Taylor, the inquest was told. This is despite his mother Tara Rae-Maxwell claiming her son was 'petrified' of water, News Corp reports. He'd experienced difficulty returning to daycare after a week-long holiday and was instead put in Mr Taylor's care after telling his mother Tara Rae-Maxwell he didn't want to go to school. While on the board, Darcy had fallen back and bumped his head, Mr Taylor is alleged to have written in a text to Ms Rae-Maxwell. Mr Taylor then took Darcy to the home he shared with housemate Ms Warne for a swim. Darcy seemed fine, Ms Warne told the inquest, but he twice vomited while near the pool. Both adults became concerned when he again threw up, this time an alarming chunky-white mixture. They took Darcy to a bathroom and ran a bath to warm the boy but his body became stiff. 'That's when Adam started to panic,' Ms Warne said. The Glebe Coroners Court (pictured) heard that the usually bright and assertive young boy had become lethargic and lost patches of hair in the days before his death . Darcy, she said, was making loud, deep, gargling sounds but couldn't speak. The usually bright and assertive young boy had become lethargic and lost patches of hair in the days before his death, the court heard. When he died he had bruising on his ears, temple and limbs and traces of the stimulant Ritalin in his system. After informing Ms Rae-Maxwell Darcy had bumped his head, Mr Taylor allegedly sent her a photo of the boy. 'Adam sent me pictures all the time of Darcy when he had him,' Ms Rae-Maxwell said. But she repeatedly denied receiving the photo that day and it has never been located by investigators. Deputy State Coroner Hugh Dillon questioned how a mother who posted so many Facebook photos of her son couldn't locate the image. 'I know it sounds ridiculous. I've been through so many phones,' she said. The inquest continues.

"Famous Italian designers like Fendi, Gucci and Prada may be toted by celebrities such as Rihanna, Kate Moss and Katy Perry, but few are probably aware of the history behind the brands they wear. A new book has now archived the changing face of Italian fashion, from the post-war years to the 21st century. Italian Glamour: The Essence of Italian Fashion, From the Postwar Years to the Present Day, captures the evolution of Mediterranean style through 300 iconic dresses and archived images. Model Joan Olsen (left) shows off bold linear prints in an outfit by haute couture designer/artist Livio de Simone in 1954. Co-author Enrico says that Italian glamour is not 'sophisticated or artificial' The book was compiled by Enrico Quinto and Paolo Tinarelli - the two men who  were the first to introduce the concept of vintage style in Italy . The volume has been compiled by Enrico Quinto, 51, and Paolo Tinarelli, 49. The two men established the first flea market in Rome and were the first to introduce the concept of vintage in Italy. Enrico revealed that they wanted to honour the Italian designers who have helped to make the country a fashion powerhouse. He said: 'The pioneers that have really put Italy on the map of international fashion have been Emilio Pucci in the Fifties, Missoni and Krizia in the Sixties, Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace in the Seventies and Eighties, and Dolce & Gabbana, Prada and Gucci in the Nineties.' Fifties cover girl Ivy Nicholson wears Emilio Pucci in Capri, 1953. The book talks about how the start of many Italian fashion powerhouses started out with a real focus on craftsmanship . The book focuses on the humble beginnings of some of the world's biggest Italian brands and how they rose to cultural significance. It  looks at how designers such as Miuccia Prada, Giorgio Armani and Adele Casagrande, founder of Fendi, have created a legacy within their labels. Many Italian powerhouses started out with a focus on craftsmanship, using work methods and decorative traditions that were passed down through generations. Post-war economic development in the fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers such as Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with a patchwork of ideas and activities . The book also explores momentous periods which truly characterised Italian fashion. For example, post-war economic development in the Fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers like Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with patchworks of cartoon-like ideas and activities, which subtly influenced buyers. A woman wears a structural suit by Fernandi, at a time when Italian fashion was beginning to break away from Parisian style . In the mid-fifties, Emilio Frederico Schuberth created an outfit which had a removable over-skirt so that the wearer could opt for a straight or flared silhouette . Another poignant moment came in the mid-Fifties, where Italian fashion began to break away from what Parisian style dictated. Creative directors such as Emilio Frederico Schuberth began to create structurally innovative creations. Italian Glamour also looks at breakthrough moments for Italian fashion, such as one of the first runway showcases in Florence, which saw the artistic city overtake Paris as the global fashion capital. From that moment on, styles quickly progressed. By the mid-Forties, Italian designers began to take their inspiration from Hollywood femme fatales rather than Parisian fashion. Religion was also an inspiration, which explains the high-necks and dark tones often seen in that period. The moment Italian fashion made its breakthrough, at the grand hall in Florence's Palazzo Pitti in 1951 . A model is pictured in Italy in 1953. In the mid-forties, Italian designers began to take their inspiration from Hollywood femme fatales rather than Parisian fashion. Religion was also an inspiration, which explains the high-necks and dark tones . Model Liliana Mongini wears Germana Marucelli in January 1950. Marucelli was the first Italian post-war designer - her designs were on several occasions interpreted by Christian Dior . In fact, Parisian fashion soon began to follow the lead of Italian innovators. Germana Marucelli was the first Italian post-war designer, and her designs were, on several occasions, interpreted by Frenchman Christian Dior. The book also examines how trends developed over the years and iconic celebrity moments that would cement a designer's fame. One in particular came in 1956, when Italian-French film star Sophia Loren wore a sweeping gown by Emilio Schuberth at the Cannes Festival. Schuberth became known as the 'tailor to the stars', and also catered for the likes of Rita Hayworth and Brigitte Bardot. His students included Valentino Garavani - who continues to be an Italian powerhouse today. Impossibly glamorous: In 1956, Italian-French film star Sophia Loren wore a sweeping gown by Emilio Schuberth at the Cannes Festival . This dress by Emilio Schuberth cemented his position as 'tailor to the stars' Late sixties and early seventies creations from Fendi, including the bag with the signature interlocking Fs (right) Examples of humble beginnings are especially surprisingly when looking at labels such as Fendi - who originally came into existence as a leather and fur shop in Rome. From the mid-Sixties, Karl Lagerfeld was involved in the design of Fendi's logo with the interlocking F letters. Several designers in the book, such as Federico Forquet, are no longer operational, but were important in influencing and shaping the overall movement and progression of Italian fashion. The book also highlights how certain Italian designers, such as Roberto Carpucci, were propelled to fame when clothes were featured in advertorials - eventually appearing in publications such as Vogue. A piece from Italian designer Federico Forquet, in his autumn/winter 1965 collection . Renowned Italian designer, Roberto Carpucci's structural designs featured in Vogue Italia in 1982 . A defining moment for Italian fashion was circa 1994; Elizabeth Hurley stepped out in a Versace safety pin gown that was to become one of the most iconic dresses of all time. From then on, it seemed that Italian fashion was the pinnacle of daring style. Co-author of the book, Enrico Quinto says that Italian glamour is 'in the DNA of an Italian's lifestyle'. He adds: 'Italian glamour is not sophisticated or artificial; it keeps conscious of the female's body, and it works in the same way as the idea of 'Dolce Far Niente' - the sweetness of doing nothing. It's an accessible beauty - simple and natural.' Elizabeth Hurley in 1994 (left), pictured with then-beau, Hugh Grant (right) wearing the Versace dress that would go down in fashion history . Liz Hurley's dress (pictured) was a creation from Gianni Versace's spring/summer 1994 collection . In fact, Italian style has made a huge contribution to the fashion industry today, with Milan Fashion Week still a crucial part of the circuit, and with young models such as Kendall Jenner flocking to Milan every year. Popular culture figures such as Rihanna, are also active lovers of the Italian style. Rihanna recently customised a Fendi Baguette bag for a charity auction, along with Sarah Jessica Parker.

Successful models such as Kendall Jenner (pictured) flock to Milan Fashion Week every season to walk in shows such as Dolce & Gabbana (left - Autumn/Winter 2015, right - Spring/Summer 2015). Italian style is very much still crucial to the fashion landscape . In terms of the state of Italian glamour now, Enrico argues that it is a changing landscape, but something that maintains its simplicity. 'Italy has become more global and the melting pot of different nationalities has automatically brought new influences into Italy's lifestyle. 'I believe that  the essence of Italian glamour is based on a certain 'minimalism'. Clothing still has to be practical and adapted to an understated lifestyle.

The siege came to an end just before 5.30am this morning when police entered the restaurant and tasered the man. The 27-year-old female employee held in the restaurant emerged with police shortly afterward. Police said the man was a 'disgruntled' former employee of the restaurant who allegedly entered a restaurant storeroom armed with a knife.

"Police in San Francisco have discovered the mummified body of an elderly woman in a house said to be owned by a hoarder. The property in the Richmond area is said to have been crawling with rats, black widow spiders, dog feces and 300 bottles of urine. The remains which were removed from the house on Saturday are believed to be that of Anna Ragin who lived with her  65-year-old daughter Carolyn. Police removed the body, believed to be that of Anna Ragin, from the property in the Richmond area of San Francisco. Authorities said the home was covered in debris, including dog feces and bottles of urine . Neighbors told The San Francisco Chronicle the mother had not been seen for years. According to records another man, Archibald Ragin, lived at the property but died 15 years ago at the age of 101. Carolyn, said to be a retired Pacific Bell worker, was taken to hospital after her mother's body was removed from the house. Supervisor Eric Mar, a representative in charge of the area, told the Chronicle : 'The police captains I've spoken with tell me this is the worst case of hoarding they have ever seen.' He was concerned for the health and safety of the residents, but questioned how the situation in the property could have gotten to such a point. Mr Mar said: 'We certainly want seniors to stay in their communities as long as possible, but when people aren’t getting adequate health care and attention, this is what happens. 'This appears to be a nightmare of what can happen when people age in place for too long,' he added. 'We need to identify what the triggers are for the city to step in.' He told the Daily Mail Online that he heard the body was wrapped up in a carpet and described that, from the outside, it looked like the home was abandoned. Residents said the  woman had not been seen in years while police described it as the worst case of hoarding they had ever seen . When city workers arrived to clean up the body on Wednesday, they reportedly struggled to get in the door because the house was filled with so much debris. The mess was said to have included mold and piles of trash that reached the ceiling. They were forced to call in professional workers. The Chronicle quote a firefighter saying the body was lightweight and wrapped in a blanket. It is not clear where it was discovered.","Remains were discovered Saturday on Fourth Avenue in San Francisco .

"Mothers across the globe have been left outraged by an alleged religious community that is criticizing moms for having cesarean sections instead of natural childbirths – creating a series of insulting campaign images, or memes, that claim they 'didn't really give birth'. The Facebook page of the so-called Disciples of the New Dawn has sparked an internet firestorm as thousands of mothers share, and comment on, the group's anti-cesarean memes, expressing their disgust at the outrageous messages they express; the community, led by Father Patrick Embry, is using the images to encourage fellow Christians to shame 'lazy' and 'negligent' mothers who have elected to undergo C-sections. 'Face the facts: You didn't really give birth. You caught a lucky break. Please show respect to superior women who actually had what it took to get the job done,' reads one of the group's Facebook memes, which has been shared nearly 80,000 times since it was posted on Sunday. Alarming message: This controversial anti-cesarean meme posted on the Disciples of the New Dawn's Facebook page on Sunday has been shared nearly 80,000 times . Propaganda: The religious community claims women will be 'cast into the lake of fire' if they undergo a C-section . 'Good advice from Matriarch Graber on behalf of The Circle of Matriarchs,' the Disciples of the New Dawn captioned the controversial image featuring a woman's C-section scar. The post continued: 'They have delivered many babies over the years, NATURALLY and not once has needed a C-Section or pharmaceutical toxins. Pregnancy is a beautiful thing as it is the zenith of a woman's role in a moral Christian society. If God has decided to call you home, it is not up to you or a doctor to reject Him. You may find yourself cast into the lake of fire for doing so. God's Peace [sic].' Although some reporters claimed to have spoken with Mr Embry, many question the existence of the extreme religious community and the validity of its messages. And while it remains unclear as to whether or not the page was created with the sole intention of inciting fury, its most recent postings have taken the internet by storm. Not scientific: This meme alleges that women who avoid vaccination are 'more likely' to have a natural vaginal birth . Public shaming: This meme featuring a mom in a bikini states that women shouldn't flaunt their stomachs after having cesarean sections because they didn't take care of themselves while they were pregnant . Scare tactics: The community added this picture caption to the meme to remind women that God is always 'watching' and 'judging' Thousands of women are sharing their stories and reasons for undergoing C-sections in the comment sections of the images, which claim there is 'no medical need' for cesareans. 'I am proud to have had a C-section! I was in labor for 3 days,' Barri Lynne Thomas wrote today. 'We found out my baby was stuck on my pelvis face up! If they would have simply moved her giving birth naturally I could have killed her! [sic]' Sara Jane Schwarz asked: 'How is it a lucky break? Getting a C-section means that the baby's and or the mother's life is in danger.' She continued: 'Birth is a miracle. It should not be played down or slandered like this group has done. It's a disgrace to women everywhere for this group to post such a hurtful and tactless post. It doesn't matter how one gives birth. All that matters is that there is birth of new life and everyone is safe and healthy.' Not true: This controversial meme claims that women who have C-sections 'do so because of decades of drug abuse and alcohol dependence' Unfair claims: The Disciples of the New Dawn also believe that there is 'no medial need' for cesarean sections when giving birth . Outrageous accusation: The group called women who have C-sections 'lazy' parents . 'Ignorance is bliss. May God forgive your stupidity,' Wendy Comfort added. And Cassie Wallace noted: '8,304 ppl LIKED THIS POST? See, to me, that's the scariest part... [sic]' Meanwhile, others are breathing new life into old petitions looking to remove the group's page from Facebook because of its history of 'severe hate speech' and 'sexism'. 2,500 new supporters have joined one online petition on Change.org today. 'I am signing this because of the hatred and condemnation they give to mothers who were not able to have a 'natural vaginal' birth and they are saying anyone who did not have this type of birth was due to drugs or 'being a little w****,' one woman from Texas explained. Nothing new: The Dawn of the New Disciples has a history of being accused of being sexist and hateful towards women . Dangerous thinking: The religious group claims that sticking to gender stereotypes is the key to a healthy and happy household . Impressionable minds: This disturbing image was allegedly drawn by a child and shared on the group's Junior Disciples page, which was created for younger members of the sect . She continued: 'This is very demeaning to women and mothers. It also makes claims that any mother who chose a C-section committed a SIN and should have refused it even if it mean death for both the mother and child.' Dawn of the New Disciples currently runs numerous pro-life, pro-gun Twitter accounts and Facebook pages including The Dawn Guard Militia and Junior Disciples, a community for its younger members, which features disturbing religious images allegedly created by children. One picture, which was posted in February, shows Jesus smiling while surrounded by guns. 'The Lord has given us many wonderful blessings in our life. None more precious than the God given right to bear arms. Every firearm is an extension of his hand. Every round like a heavenly embrace from Jesus himself, upon your adversary,' the group had captioned the controversial drawing. Violent thoughts: This childlike drawing shows Jesus smiling as he is surrounded by guns and a bloody knife . Loaded message: The picture was accompanied by this caption, which alleges that 'every firearm is an extension' of God's hand . Family affair: This photo of three young boys brandishing guns was shared on The Dawn Guard Militia page, which is also run by the religious community .","One of the images posted on the Disciples of the New Dawn Facebook page has been shared nearly 80,000 times since it was posted on Sunday .

"Nigel Farage has admitted Ukip has 'slipped back a bit' in the polls as the sense of euphoria among the party's supporters has waned. But the Ukip leader said he expects to recover momentum in the run-up to next month's election as its key campaign issues like EU membership are now very much 'back in play' with voters. Asked if he was panicking after a poll showed support for the party has fallen, Mr Farage said: 'Good Lord no!' Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage today admitted Ukip has 'slipped back a bit' in the polls as the sense of euphoria among the party's supporters has waned . Ukip  has seen its support slump from 16.75 per cent in November to just 12.25 per cent today with voters appearing to switch to the Tories in the run up to the election . Mr Farage is facing a fight to win his own election battle after falling behind the Tories in South Thanet, Kent - despite enjoying a 12 point lead of his Conservative rival just two months ago . The Ukip leader has seen support for his party drop from 16.75 per cent in November to just 12.25 per cent today, with voters appearing to switch to the Tories in the run up to the election. Mr Farage is also facing a fight to win his own election battle after falling behind the Tories in Thanet South, Kent - despite enjoying a 12 point lead over his Conservative rival just two months ago. Speaking on a tour of the Midlands, he added: 'We are exactly where we were last August, having won the European elections - we were on 14-and-a-bit per cent. 'We won the European elections, we found that level and we did have a rally in the Autumn through the remarkable events of first Clacton and then perhaps more remarkably the Rochester by-election . 'We've slipped back a bit since then, there are 30 days to go and I think the issues Ukip is campaigning on are back in play.' Mr Farage poses for a selfie with a group of girls during a visit to Himley Hall, near Dudley in the West Midlands . The Ukip leader was joined on the campaign trail by a car painted in his party's colours of purple and yellow . Nigel Farage is facing a possible libel case from a former Ukip MEP who defected to the Conservatives. Mr Farage attempted to play down Amjad Bashir's decision to switch sides in January by insisting that the former communities spokesman had already been sacked over alleged financial irregularities and claims of the employment of illegal immigrants in his restaurant business. Solicitors' firm Atkins Thomson confirmed it has sent a 'letter before action' to Ukip warning of High Court action against the party and its leader. Mr Bashir, who was elected Ukip MEP for the Yorkshire and Humber region in the 2014 European Parliament elections, is awaiting a response and no date has been set for a court case. A Ukip spokesman said the party was making no comment on his case. After quitting Ukip in January, Mr Bashir branded Mr Farage's party 'pretty amateur' and accused it of a 'ridiculous' lack of policies. Questioned at the time about Mr Farage's accusations, Chancellor George Osborne said he was 'absolutely comfortable' about Mr Bashir becoming a Conservative MEP. Mr Farage described the party's support as having 'peaks and troughs', adding: 'Share prices have peaks and troughs, we all have peaks and troughs. He blamed the poll slip in recent months on a declining sense of euphoria from members and said: 'There was a degree of slightly euphoric Ukip support round about the time of the result of Rochester, which was a remarkable event.' But he added: 'The trend over the last week is we are beginning, as the short campaign for the General Election has begun, the vote is beginning to harden.' During a campaign stop in Dudley, Mr Farage spoke out against so-called 'super mosques'. Proposals for a mosque in the town that will accommodate 750 worshippers have been the subject of a long-running battle between the local council and the local Muslim association. Asked about the row, Mr Farage said he preferred 'smaller and proportionate mosques'. He said: 'People need places of religious worship. It's just a question of whether that scale is the right one or not. 'I'm not going to for one moment advocate that we should ban people from being able to worship their religion. I think it's very important they do. 'Whether super mosques are the way forward is a separate question. I personally don't necessarily think it's a great idea. 'I would rather see more smaller and proportionate mosques going ahead.' Mr Farage also expanded on his controversial remarks in the televised leadership debate last week that foreigners with HIV should not be allowed to come to this country for free treatment. He said that he believed people with cancer and tuberculosis should also be stopped. 'HIV is one of the big one, cancer and certain resistant strains of tuberculosis, which you ask the doctors about, they have got some real problems,' he said. Mr Farage leaves an election campaign event in Carrick, central England, after becoming stuck in traffic . Ukip sources privately admitted raising the issue in the TV debate, which drew criticism from other party leaders, was part of a 'shock and awful' strategy to shore up the party's base. But Ukip's poll rating has not shown any signs of picking up following Mr Farage's outburst - with some experts predicting it will fall below 10 per cent by the time of the election. The latest national polls have put the Conservatives and Labour virtually neck and neck. A YouGov poll on Sunday had the Tories on 34 per cent, one point ahead of Labour, and Ukip in third place with 13 per cent of votes. A poll in Tory-held South Thanet – where Mr Farage is running for Parliament – shows him in second place, and pollsters now believe Ukip will win just a handful of seats. David Cameron, pictured in Cardiff today, has issued an impassioned plea for Ukip voters to 'come back home' to the Conservatives . Speaking yesterday in Bristol, David Cameron conceded that he understood the 'frustrations' of Ukip voters. It is a significant peace offering by the Prime Minister, who once dismissed Ukip as 'fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists'. He said to those who had left the Tory fold: 'Look, we've heard the message loud and clear about the things you want to see changed and we'll change those things. Come with us, come back home to us, rather than risk all of this good work being undone.' But there are deep concerns that support for Ukip, fuelled by the Conservatives' failure to meet their pledge to cut immigration to 'tens of thousands', could swing enough votes in other seats to hand Ed Miliband a victory. Mr Cameron, who also promised a referendum on Europe, said the Government had turned around the economy and cut taxes for working people. 'To keep generating the jobs and the growth our country needs, come back to us, come back home to us,' he pleaded. The PM warned those who voted for 'a minor party' risked ending up with Ed Miliband propped up by the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, 'driving him into even more spending, welfare unlimited, debt bloat'. Mr Cameron said the prospect of a minority Labour government held in power by the SNP was a 'nightmare scenario' and said the Conservatives 'need' Ukip support. 'We are 23 seats short from an overall majority,' he said. 'We can provide that clear, decisive and frankly more accountable government that a majority Conservative government would deliver. We need those 23 seats.' Mr Farage immediately attacked the Prime Minister and said he would not win Ukip voters back. He said former Labour and Tory voters have found a 'more authentic home' where they do not get 'roundly abused by their hosts'. Meanwhile, the 'defection' of a Tory parliamentary candidate to Ukip descended into farce yesterday when it was revealed he had already been dropped by the Conservatives. Nigel Farage hailed the move by Mike Whitehead as a 'hammer blow' for the PM. But the Tories said the candidate for Hull West and Hessle had been 'sacked' for threatening to stand as an independent.","Support for Ukip has fallen by 5% since October as the election looms .

"An Ohio police officer who jumped on the hood of a car and fired the final 15 rounds of a 137-shot barrage that killed a pair of unarmed suspects is claiming that he doesn't remember doing it. Michael Brelo goes on trial on Monday charged with two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30. He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting. A rookie cop told the same investigators Michael Brelo spoke with that the 31-year-old Cleveland officer talked about it in the days after the November 2012 shooting. Brelo's footprints were also found on the hood of the beat-up Chevy Malibu where  Russell, 43, and Williams, 30, died. Scroll down for video . Cleveland officer Michael Brelo is facing charges after two unarmed suspects were killed in this  Chevy Malibu . Brelo faces two voluntary manslaughter charges after firing the final 15 rounds of the deadky 137-shot barrage . Malissa Williams (left) and Timothy Russell (right) were both unarmed when they were killed in November 2012 . The car was strafed by police gunfire and its two unarmed occupants were killed after a high-speed chase over streets and freeways in and around Cleveland. When Brelo was questioned by investigators two weeks after the shooting, he told them he didn't recall what happened. He said: 'It's possible because I was so terrified that I was going to get run over.' 'But I don't recall that, sir.' Rookie officer Brian Sabolik  who was assigned to the same district as Brelo, told investigators he stopped firing after 'someone' jumped on the hood of the Malibu. Officer Sabolik said he later learned it was Brelo. Asked how he found out, Sabolik said: 'Because [Brelo] was talking about it.' While Brelo claimed not to remember jumping on the hood, prosecutors have evidence to show that he did. Investigators from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation found footprints on the hood of the Malibu that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car that Brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar. Brelo is currently suspended. Photos released by the Office of the Ohio Attorney General show a Cleveland cruiser sitting next to the Chevy . Brelo goes on trial Monday on two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of Russell and Williams. He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting. A judge - not a jury - will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years if convicted. Brelo's defense team has argued that all 49 rounds Brelo fired that night, including the last 15, were lawful. The threat from the pair didn't end until Brelo reached into the Malibu and removed the keys to prevent the suspects from using the car as a weapon, according to his defense. Russell and Williams were each shot more than 20 times. The chase started with a failed traffic stop on the edge of downtown by a plainclothes detective who never reported to dispatchers that he'd lost sight of the vehicle. Russell then sped past Cleveland police headquarters, where his car backfired. Officers and witnesses standing outside were certain they'd heard gunshots and a police radio call for shots fired triggered an adrenaline-fueled rush by officers to join the chase. Brelo and his partner were two of the first officers to join the pursuit that ultimately included more than 60 police cars, 104 officers and reached at least 100mph. In this forensics picture, bullet trajectories from the deadly shooting are marked off on the Chevy Malibu . After driving into a school parking lot more than 20 minutes after the chase began, Russell turned the car around and tried to flee again - sideswiping a cruiser before coming to a stop. Another officer, who said he feared for his life, opened fire, prompting others including Brelo to do the same. Brelo and his partner fired 15 rounds through their own windshield and told investigators they saw dark objects in Russell's and Williams' hands. Brelo said he left his cruiser because he said he was afraid the Malibu would hit him, even though he then crossed in front of the car to climb on top of another cruiser and open fire again. He told investigators: 'I had leapt trying to get out of the way of this car so it doesn't run me over and kill me.' Investigators found footprints on the hood of the Malibu (left) that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car (right) that Brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar . Investigators eventually concluded that neither Russell nor Williams had a gun. An exhaustive search was conducted along the route of the pursuit, including the use of a dive team to look in bodies of water, but no gun was ever found. Regardless of the trial's outcome, the after-effects of the chase and shooting will likely endure for years to come. The incident helped spur a US Justice Department probe that concluded Cleveland police officers have shown a pattern and practice of using excessive force. The city and federal authorities are negotiating a consent decree to reform the police department that will cost the city millions of dollars to implement and enforce. Cleveland has already paid $3million to the families of Russell and Williams to settle a lawsuit.","Cleveland, Ohio, officer Michael Brelo is facing two counts of manslaughter .

"Greece's prime minister has had an audience with Vladimir Putin, amid fears Europe will no longer rescue his country's ailing economy. Alexis Tsipras met the Russian President in Moscow yesterday and the pair agreed a package of investment in energy and other projects. But Mr Tsipras insisted he had not asked for – or received – financial aid, saying Greece is a 'sovereign nation' and 'not a debt colony'. Meeting: Greece's prime minister met Vladimir Putin yesterday and struck potential deals over investment in energy and other projects. It was expected Mr Tsipras (left) would ask Mr Putin (right) for a hand-out . Greece's government, the most left-wing ever elected in Europe, has been handed a list of reforms it must carry out in return for a new injection of cash from Eurozone countries. Propped up by some £175billion of aid from Europe and the IMF since 2010, Greece has not received bailout funds since Syriza took power in January, and could run out of money within weeks. It was expected Mr Tsipras would ask Mr Putin for a hand-out - despite Russia's economy also suffering deeply under Western and US sanctions imposed after the invasion of Crimea. But instead the meeting saw a commitment to restore trade between the two countries, which had been significant before both were hit by economic woes. The Greek Prime Minister said, defending his visit: 'Greece is a sovereign state with an indisputable right to its own foreign policy. 'Greece is not a beggar to go around all the countries asking them to help resolve its financial problems.' He said he would not be thrown 'off the boat' by the Eurozone, saying: 'We are equal passengers. There is no higher or lower deck. We are not a debt colony, we have the same rights as other countries have.' Moving forward: Mr Putin (right, with Mr Tsipras) said Russia could also provide loans for projects including a gas pipeline via Turkey, which was shelved last year as relations between Moscow and the EU deteriorated . Mr Putin said the leaders had discussed 'various ways of co-operating, including major projects in energy' and said Russia 'could provide loans' for projects including a potential gas pipeline via Turkey, which was shelved last year amid deteriorating relations between Mr Putin and the EU. 'This is not about aid but about financial cooperation in major projects….of course we are interested in pipelines, ports, and airports, as well as energy generation and other resources', Mr Putin said. Top of the agenda were restoring Greece's exports of food – such as vegetables and cheese - which stopped after Moscow slapped an embargo on them, in response to EU sanctions. Mr Putin suggested this could be lifted, restore the livelihoods of Greek farmers. Experts said Greece could get a discount on gas – most of which it imports from Russia. It is thought Mr Tsipras intended to ratchet up the pressure on his European creditors particularly Germany, to draw him away from Mr Putin's sphere of influence. A Greek repayment of around £325million is due today. Greece claims Germany owes them many times this sum in reparations for the Nazi invasion for which they were not sufficiently compensated.","Prime minister Alexis Tsipras had been expected to ask for hand-out .

"A mysterious 'ring of fire' has been spotted in space thanks to Albert Einstein's theory of relatively. The ring, located 12 billion light years away, is an illusion created by the chance alignment of two distant galaxies. The striking circular structure is a rare manifestation of gravitational lensing predicted by Albert Einstein in his theory of general relativity. Scroll down for video . Alma's image of the gravitationally lensed galaxy SDP.81. The bright orange central region of the ring - Alma's highest resolution observation ever - reveals the glowing dust in this distant galaxy . Gravitational lensing occurs when a massive galaxy or cluster of galaxies bends the light emitted from a more distant galaxy, forming a highly magnified, though much distorted image. In this particular case, the galaxy known as SDP.81 and an intervening galaxy line up so perfectly that the light from the more distant one forms a nearly complete circle as seen from Earth. Einstein's theory predicts that the gravitational effects of the nearer galaxy will bend the light of the more distant one. The Alma telescope in Chile was able to capture the effect in the highest resolution images ever taken by the observatory. In this particular case, the galaxy known as SDP.81 and an intervening galaxy line up so perfectly that the light from the more distant one forms a nearly complete circle as seen from Earth. Discovered by the Herschel Space Observatory, SDP.81 is an active star-forming galaxy nearly 12 billion light-years away, seen at a time when the universe was only 15 percent of its current age. It is being lensed by a massive foreground galaxy that is a comparatively nearby 4 billion light-years away. 'Gravitational lensing is used in astronomy to study the very distant, very early Universe because it gives even our best telescopes an impressive boost in power,' said Alma Deputy Program Scientist Catherine Vlahakis. 'With the astounding level of detail in these new Alma images, astronomers will now be able to reassemble the information contained in the distorted image we see as a ring and produce a reconstruction of the true image of the distant galaxy.' An AlmaHubble composite image of the gravitationally lensed galaxy SDP.81. The diffuse blue element at the center of the ring is from the intervening lensing galaxy, as seen with the Hubble Space Telescope . The highest resolution image of SDP.81 was made by observing the relatively bright light emitted by cosmic dust in the distant galaxy. This striking image reveals well-defined arcs in a pattern that hints at a more complete, nearly contiguous ring structure. Though this intriguing interplay of gravity and light in SDP.81 has been studied previously by other observatories, none has captured the remarkable details of the ring structure in such detail. 'The exquisite amount of information contained in the Alma images is incredibly important for our understanding of galaxies in the early universe,' said astronomer Jacqueline Hodge with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Va. 'Astronomers use sophisticated computer programs to reconstruct lensed galaxies' true appearance. 'This unravelling of the bending of light done by the gravitational lens will allow us to study the actual shape and internal motion of this distant galaxy much more clearly than has been possible until now.'

"Scientists believe the first complex conversation between humans took place around 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Much of it, they say, involved cavemen grunting, or hunter-gatherers mumbling and pointing, before learning to speak in a detailed way. But in a new study, one linguist argues that human language developed rapidly with people quickly using complex sentences that sound like our own. Scientists believe the first complex conversation between humans gradually took place around 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Much of it, they believe, still involved cavemen grunting, or hunter-gatherers mumbling and pointing, before learning to speak in a detailed way . 'The hierarchical complexity found in present-day language is likely to have been present in human language since its emergence,' says Shigeru Miyagawa, Professor of Linguistics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Most scholars believe that humans first started using a 'proto-language', which was a primitive kind of communication with only a gradual development of words and syntax. But according to Professor Miyagawa, single words bear traces of syntax showing that they must be descended from an older, syntax-laden system, rather than from simple, primal utterances. 'Since we can find syntax within words, there is no reason to consider them as 'linguistic fossils' of a prior, presyntax stage,' he adds. In a new study, one linguist argues that human language likely developed rapidly with people quickly using complex sentences that sound like our own. Pictured is a reconstruction of of Rhodesian Men. Remains from this species have been dated between 300,000 and 125,000 years ago . Professor Miyagawa has a different theory about what created human language. He says humans combined an 'expressive' layer of language, as seen in birdsong, with a 'lexical' layer, as seen in monkeys who utter isolated sounds, such as alarm calls. The 'integration hypothesis' suggests that whatever first caused them, these layers of language blended rapidly. In his paper, Professor Miyagawa writes that a single word today can be 'internally complex, often as complex as an entire phrase,' making it less likely that words we use today are descended from a presyntax mode of speech. 'Nationalisation' for example starts with 'nation,' a noun; adds '-al' to create an adjective; adds '-is(a)' to form a verb; and ends with '-tion,' to form another noun, albeit with a new meaning. 'Hierarchical structure is present not only in single words, but also in compounds, which, contrary to the claims of some, are not the structureless fossilised form of a prior stage,' he says. The researchers arrived at their conclusions by conducting a series of experiments in teaching students the art of 'Oldowan stone-knapping' The very first rudimentary communcation between our ancestors took place much earlier, say one group of scientists. Earlier this year, researchers argued that cavemen initially began communicating 2.5 to 1.8 million years ago - and they were talking about DIY. The international study found stone tool-making drove the evolution of language among our human ancestors in the African savannah. It suggests communication among our earliest ancestors may have been more complex than previously thought, and that tool-making helped drive evolution. The researchers, who included scientists at the University of Liverpool and St Andrews, arrived at their conclusions by conducting a series of experiments in teaching students the art of 'Oldowan stone-knapping'. This is when butchering 'flakes' are created by hammering a hard rock against certain volcanic or glassy rocks, like basalt or flint. Oldowan stone-knapping dates back to the Lower Paleolithic period in eastern Africa, and remained largely unchanged for 700,000 years until more sophisticated Acheulean hand-axes and cleavers were developed. In testing five different ways to convey Oldowan stone-knapping skills to more than 180 college students, the researchers found that the demonstration that used spoken communication – versus imitation, non-verbal presentations or gestures – yielded the highest volume and quality of flakes. The same analysis applies to words in Romance languages that have been described elsewhere as remnants of formless proto-languages. In Italian, 'porta asciuga-mani' - literally 'carry dry-hands,' but today colloquially meaning 'towel holder' - is one such case, where a compound derived from old words has a clear internal structure. Researchers think the integration hypothesis could generate a productive set of research questions. Andrea Moro, a professor of linguistics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Pavia, Italy, who edited the paper, calls it a 'very interesting' critique of the idea that human language developed gradually. However, Professor Moro suggests there is an 'intuitive difference' between cases where words assemble to form either a compound word or a sentence. He believes it is possible that studies of the concept of 'symmetry-breaking,' a potentially distinctive part of sentence formation, 'may offer new empirical data to test the hypothesis and shed light on the birth of human language.'","Complex human conversation began around 50,000 to 100,000 years ago .

"Winning a free trip would put a wide grin on most people’s faces, but one tourist couldn’t hide his ‘misery’ during a dream holiday to Puerto Rico. Kevin Blandford's holiday snaps have gone viral on the internet, with each one showing him pulling the same sad face in an attempt to prove how much he missed his wife. The 33-year-old, from Louisville, Kentucky, won the Caribbean getaway through his workplace, but his wife, Bonnie, wasn't able to join him because she stayed home to care for their six-month-old daughter. Kevin Blandford's photo album has gone viral with more than two million views on the website Imgur . After posting the photos he wrote that he won a free trip to Puerto Rico but his wife was unable to join him . Kevin said 'a dedicated friend' took the photos that show him looking miserable during his holiday . Amusing photos show Kevin looking sad while snorkelling next to a boat called ‘Spread Eagle II’, playing a slot machine at a casino and sipping drinks in the sunshine. Kevin said the idea came to him out of the blue after a friend who joined him on last week's trip snapped a candid photo of him. Kevin told MailOnline Travel: 'It kind of happened organically. I was sitting there with my friend, he took a picture of me and I looked miserable. 'We started talking about it and we thought it would be funny to say that I didn’t have any fun at all because Bonnie couldn’t come with me.' At the end of the trip he posted the photos on Facebook and Reddit, where they quickly became an online sensation. Each photo shows Kevin pulling the same sad face in an attempt to prove how much he missed his wife . Kevin wrote online that his wife could not accompany him because she stayed home to care for their child . In his post on Reddit, Kevin wrote: ‘Won a trip to Puerto Rico and couldn’t take my wife. Didn’t have a single second of fun.’ Thinking the post would amuse family and friends, the photo album has been viewed more than two million times on Imgur and attracted nearly 3,000 comments on Reddit. Many users wanted to know who was snapping photos of Kevin if it wasn't his wife who accompanied him on the trip. On Reddit, he told commenters that the images – including snaps showing him looking glum in bed and under a waterfall in a swimming pool – were taken by ‘a dedicated friend’. In a comment added later, he explained why his wife didn't accompany him: ‘I have a 6 month old, [my wife] didn’t want to be away from her for that long and taking her made things very complicated with the type of trip it was.’ After posting the photos online Kevin Blandford wrote that he 'didn't have a single second of fun' Amusing photos show Kevin looking sad on the plane, in the sea and while sipping drinks in the sunshine . Despite his expression in the photos, Kevin said he had a good time on his getaway, and his wife had a good laugh when he showed her the pictures. He said: ‘It was a fun trip. It was a work trip, though, so there were a lot of presentations and meetings.’ He is shocked by the amount of attention he has received since he shared the photos with Reddit users. Since the photos were posted on Monday he has been contacted by media from around the world, including an Australian news network which asked him to do a live interview. Kevin said: ‘It’s pretty surreal. I didn’t think that it was going to blow up like it did.’ Kevin said he has been shocked by the amount of attention he has received since he posted the photos . The photos have had nearly 3,000 comments on Reddit, with many users wanting to know who took the photos . Bonnie told MailOnline Travel that she didn’t ‘get’ the joke when Kevin sent the first photo, and she assumed he was tired from travelling. She said: ‘Photos began pouring in and I thought, per usual, they were quite ridiculous and wondered what he and his “dedicated friend” were up to this time. ‘After a few, I clearly understood the joke and expected each new photo would be more hilarious.’ And she knows he wasn’t miserable without her. ‘I know he truly wanted me there, but was accompanied by the next best person and I know too well they enjoyed visiting very much. I did appreciate the joke and their efforts.’ This photo, showing Kevin  playing Diablo III with his daughter, went viral after it was shared on Reddit . This isn’t the first time one of Kevin’s photos has gone viral. Two months ago he shared a photo on Reddit that shows him playing Diablo III, with his daughter, Gwyneth Paige, on his lap.

"It's a dilemma many of us have faced - whether to call in sick to the office when you wake up feeling under the weather, or brave heading in and spreading your germs.

The GP writes that the patient, 'has had, by their own report, a cold today and sensibly stayed home from work rather than spreading this to his colleagues/customers. 'I have no test for the common cold and therefore believe him/her, however you feel his time and mine should be wasted by making him sit in the walk in clinic for hours and me spending time writing a sick note that I could be spending on people who genuinely need my attention.

She has suggested a full-blown coalition, with SNP ministers in the Cabinet, is unlikely to be the outcome. But her MPs could vote to prop up a Labour minority administration, raising the prospect of a Scottish-backed government over-ruling the views of a majority in England. Labour leader Ed Miliband is forecast to lose dozens of seats to the SNP after a sharp drop in support in Scotland . However, today Ms Sturgeon made clear he patience is wearing thin, and called on Mr Miliband to respond to her offer. She claimed that every day that passes risks fuelling the impression that Mr Miliband would rather see the Conservatives return to government than work with the SNP. Addressing supporters in Livingston, Ms Sturgeon insisted the SNP is not seeking any UK ministerial posts. But said she will fight for as much power for Scotland as she can get. Her predecessor as First Minister Alex Salmond  has already vowed to hold a Labour minority government to ransom to secure a £180billion debt-fuelled spending spree in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said: 'Even if the Tories are the largest party, I have said we will vote to stop the Tory government getting off the ground,' she said. 'I have asked Ed Miliband to confirm that Labour will do likewise. Thus far, Labour hasn't given that commitment. 'I hope to hear him give that commitment before too much more time elapses because as long as he fails to give that commitment he leaves lingering the suspicion that Labour would rather see the Tories get back into power than work with the SNP. 'If that is the case, then people in Scotland, I don't think, will ever forgive the Labour Party.' She added: 'I have said a formal coalition with Labour is unlikely. 'The SNP is not going to Westminster to seek ministerial posts, we're going to Westminster to make Scotland's voice heard and to win more progressive policies for Scotland. 'Now, I've ruled out any kind of arrangement with the Tories, but I have also said to Labour, very directly, if there is an anti-Tory majority in the House of Commons, then even if the Tories are the biggest party, if Labour and the SNP work together we can stop a Tory government getting off the ground. 'I repeat that call to Ed Miliband today, and maybe today unlike the previous few days he will answer that. 'If we have an anti-Tory majority, will he work with the SNP rather than allow David Cameron back into Downing Street?' The Scottish First Minister was swamped with requests for selfies as she met residents of Livingston, west Lothian this morning . Ms Sturgeon has refused to work with the Conservatives under any circumstances, but has held out the possibility of putting Mr Miliband into power . The SNP is projected to win more than 40 seats in Scotland at the election, potentially leaving them holding the balance of power if Labour and the Tories both fall short . Ms Sturgeon was said to have triumped in last week's live TV debate, as polls suggest a surge in support for the SNP will cost Labour a majority on May 7 . She also outlined changes she said would support childcare and getting parents back to work, including uprating child tax credits and child benefit and a rise in the minimum wage to £8.70. Ms Sturgeon said she still wants Scotland to be independent, but in the meantime 'will push for the maximum devolution to Scotland'. 'If Scotland is to become independent, that will only happen with a vote in a referendum,' she said. 'But poll after poll shows that people in Scotland want significantly more powers in the Scottish Parliament. 'Now, I will not stop campaigning for and wanting Scotland to become independent, but that will only happen in a referendum.' Scottish Liberal Democrat president Sir Malcolm Bruce called on Ms Sturgeon to make clear whether she still supports the reversal of welfare changes made since 2010. He said: 'The SNP need to come clean. Are they planning to reverse welfare changes since 2010? 'This is what they have spent five years telling people. If so, where are they going to find the money that they have said would be £2.5 billion for Scotland alone? 'If they are not, people will expect them to admit that they are not going back to 2010. 'SNP voters will believe they've been led up the garden path. 'Only Liberal Democrats have set out costed and credible plans to balance the books by 2018, building a stronger economy and a fairer society. The SNP are all over the place when it comes to balancing the books.'","SNP leader challenges Miliband to respond to her offer of help after May 7 .

"Gerry Adams has sparked outrage over comments he made on US television about notorious abduction and murder of Jean McConville . Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has described the notorious abduction and murder of Jean McConville as 'what happens in wars'. In an interview on US television, he sparked outrage by suggesting that incidents like Mrs McConville’s murder happened ‘in every single conflict’. The comments have angered relatives of Mrs McConville, whose abduction, disappearance and subsequent murder became one of the most shocking events of The Troubles. She was 37 when she was taken by a masked gang from her home in Belfast in front of her children. She was accused by republicans of being a British Army informer, suffocated with a plastic bag and shot dead. Her remains were eventually discovered by a dog walker buried in a dune on Shelling Hill Beach in County Louth in 2003, ending decades of torment for her relatives and enabling them to finally give her a proper burial. Last year Mr Adams, who has long denied he was even in the IRA, was arrested by police investigating Mrs McConville’s murder. He denied any involvement and was released without charge. But then last month, the influential American magazine the New Yorker named Gerry Adams as a former IRA commander who personally passed ‘death sentences’ on its enemies. It published a damning 15,000-word assessment of allegations against him and claimed that Adams himself issued the order to ‘disappear’ Mrs McConville. The mother-of-ten, pictured with three of her children, disappeared from her Belfast home in 1972 . In an interview with CBS this weekend, Mr Adams insisted that he did not know about Mrs McConville’s killing. He said that he only reported himself to the police last year after a ‘tsunami of stories’ about his alleged involvement that were based on reports of interviews given by former IRA paramilitaries to Boston College in the US. Mr Adams said: ‘They (the police) said that I was a senior manager of the IRA at managerial level so I’m bound to have known. I told them I didn’t. In the preview of the interview, which will be shown in full on Sunday, CBS presenter Scott Pelley said: ‘It was known to the IRA and you’re saying you didn’t know? Mr Adams said: ‘Yes’ McConville's daughter Helen McKendry described Gerry Adams as having 'blood on his hands' Mr Pelley asked: ‘How do you orphan 10 children? What kind of depravity is that?’ Mr Adams said: ‘That’s what happens in wars, Scott. ‘That’s not to minimize it, but that’s what American soldiers do, British soldiers do, Irish Republican soldiers do, that’s what happens in every single conflict.’ The comments sparked anger from Mrs McConville’s family. Helen McKendry, now a grandmother, was one of the 10 McConville children orphaned when she was suffocated with a plastic bag and shot in the head. She said: ‘He’s a liar ... I would like Gerry Adams to stand up and admit he played a part. ‘This man has blood on his hands and I want him to pay for what he did.’ Mr Adams’ arrest last May caused uproar among his supporters and, in his view threatened the peace in Northern Ireland that he helped broker with the Good Friday agreement in 1998. In the CBS interview, Mr Adams said he decided to contact the police himself because he was ‘sick, sore and tired of a tsunami of stories based upon these tapes linking me to Mrs McConville’s death’. Mr Adams told CBS that he never pulled a trigger, ordered a murder or set off a bomb during The Troubles. He said: ‘I don’t disassociate myself from the IRA. I think the IRA was a legitimate response to what was happening here. ‘I never will (disassociate himself from the IRA). But I was not a member of the IRA.’","Jean-McConville, 37, was taken from her Belfast home by masked gang .

"Most scientists agree that a bit of stress is good for you, stimulating your body to produce an important hormone called cortisol. But too much is bad for your health and now an expert has revealed exactly why in a video. In it she reveals why prolonged periods of stress - due to money and work, for example - can inhibit the immune system and even lead to weaker bones. Scroll down for video . A University of Nebraska researcher has revealed why stress is bad for you in a video (still image shown). Limited periods of stress are good, as they release the hormone cortisol. This is useful in helping you recover from very tense situations. But too much will lower your immune system and make your bones fragile. The science of stress was explained in a video by Dr Raychelle Burks from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for the American Chemical Society. Cortisol is known as the 'stress hormone'. Normally, it's present in the body at higher levels in the morning, and at its lowest at night. Although stress isn't the only reason that cortisol is secreted into the bloodstream, it has been termed the 'stress hormone' as it is released when the body is in 'fight or flight' mode. As she explains, when you encounter a stressful situation ‘your body will start releasing [the hormones] adrenaline and norepinephrine within seconds to prepare you to fight - or more likely, take flight.’ After a minute or two your body is flooded with cortisol, which is vital in keeping you healthy in tense situations. Cortisol puts more glucose into your bloodstream so that when the adrenaline is gone you don’t crash. ‘It also kicks your liver into gear, pumping out the extra glucose that’s now sloshing around inside of you,’ Dr Burks explained. But if you stay stressed for too long, it can have negative effects. After a minute or two of being stressed (stock image shown), your body is flooded with cortisol, which is vital in keeping you healthy in tense situations. But too much will lower your immune system, and could also make your bones more fragile, according to Dr Raychelle Burks from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln . ‘Cortisol inhibits some of your immune responses, meaning you’re more likely to get sick and it takes longer for wounds to heal,’ Dr Burks continued. ‘Cortisol also slows bone growth, meaning sustained levels can lead to weaker, more fragile bones. ‘And because cortisol acts on a part of your brain that controls appetite, it also increases your desire for fatty and sugary foods.’ One positive side effect of too much cortisol, though, is that cortisol is good at reducing swelling or itching in its medical form - known as hydrocortisone. However, remaining stressed for too long is still not advisable - and Dr Burks recommends eating healthy food, exercising and getting plenty of sleep to beat stress.","University of Nebraska researcher has revealed why stress is bad for you .

"Pet aquarium fish are being dumped in rivers where they damage unique local ecosystems by growing up to twenty times their regular size. Goldfish are being caught weighing up to 2kg and koi carp up to 8kg and one metre in length, in the waterways of Western Australia amongst other exotic introduced species. 'A lot of these fish are much larger than the native fish, so they prey on them and compete for habitat,' Dr David Morgan, the Director of the Centre for Fish and Fisheries Research at Murdoch University, told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Goldfish (pictured) weighing up to 2kg are some of the exotic aquarium fish invading and destroying WA's waterways . Koi carp (pictured) weighing up to 8kg and up to one metre in length are another of the 13 introduced pests . The native fish in the region, such as this Balston's Pygmy Perch which has been attacked, are only up 10cm . 'Our native fish are generally less than 10cm in length like the pygmy perch or the native minnows. 'In the south-west of Western Australia 90 per cent of the fish and 100 per cent of the crayfish are only found there, so the rivers are refuges for the native fish and when they are forced to coexist with introduced species, they just don't do very well.' Aside from feasting on local fish and taking their homes, introduced species are also bringing exotic parasites and disease with them. 'In Perth we're aware of a couple of parasites. One is pretty devastating on native fish, it's an anchor worm which is a little crustacean that leaves a hideous, hideous impact on native fish and was probably introduced by goldfish. A huge Murray River Cod was removed from a Perth wetland in Novemeber last year: 'A lot of these fish are much larger than the native fish, so they prey on them and compete for habitat,' Dr David Morgan, the Director of the Centre for Fish and Fisheries Research at Murdoch University, said . Pest carps: 'In the south-west of Western Australia 90 per cent of the fish and 100 per cent of the crayfish are only found there,' he added . 'We've now found it in three rivers around Perth and south of Perth. 'It's been only in the last decade that we've discovered a lot of parasites and disease that we don't know a lot about - there's a lot of things that have come in to Australia that we really don't know anything about.' Research conducted by Dr Morgan and Stephen Beatty found that at least 13 species of fish had been introduced into south-western Australia, with pet owners believed to be the biggest culprits. In 2012, the world's biggest ever specimen of a South American cichlid was found living in WA. 'Goldfish in captivity generally remain orange, grow to about 10-15 cm and weigh less than 100g – in the wild in WA they get to 2KG and 40cm,' Dr Morgan said . Pet owners who have dumped their aquarium fish in rivers are the culprits behind the invasion . In 2012, the world's biggest ever specimen of a South American cichlid (pictured) was found living in WA . 'Effectively people are unknowingly doing it - or occasionally they deliberately do it for fish to catch - but they're basically released by pet owners, so people aren't really aware what damage they're going to have in the ecosystem,' Dr Morgan said. 'What you see up and down Western Australia's coast is a lot of pest fishes are right in town centres and almost every town has one.' The problem is not unique to Australia. Many countries with Mediterranean climates have also had their waterways invaded by aquarium fish which, due to being extremely easy to breed, take off when in the wild. 'Education is our best solution, once fish get in the waterways they're extremely difficult to eradicate,' Dr Morgan, whose organisation euthanizes hundreds of the pests after catching them through electric fishing, said. Introduced species also bring exotic parasites and disease with them . The problem is not unique to Australia.

"Bald, emaciated and close to death: this is the shocking images on show inside a caged hen farm in Victoria. These were the scenes that greeted Animal Liberation Victoria activists who broke into Wagner's Poultry Farm in Coldstream in March. The photographs they took at the Yarra Valley farm give a chilling insight into the bleak world of caged chicken factories. Scroll down for video . Some of the hens found at Wagner's Poultry Farm were ravaged and dying . Some looked as if they had only a few days left to live such was their condition . Eggs were still being produced at the farm despite the poorly hens . Activists said they found birds living in terrible conditions. Amazingly, two weeks earlier government health officials inspected the farm, but gave it the all clear. However, several hens were in such a bad state that they had to be removed from the cages by the activists as they were in desperate need of veterinary care. 'During multiple investigations in March, our rescue team discovered deformed, sick and dying hens, filthy conditions and immensely dangerous working conditions, which are now being investigated by Worksafe,' Noah Hannibal president of Animal Liberation Victoria told Daily Mail Australia. Hens continue to lay eggs despite a dead carcase lying in the cage beneath them . Animal Liberation Victoria activists look through the cages to see how healthy the hens are . 'Photos and video were taken of hens with eyeballs hanging out, with mangled beaks, and completely defeathered hens. 'Hens spend over a year in small wire cages, as is standard practice in the egg industry. When they are no longer 'profitable' they are sent to the slaughterhouse. 'Our rescue team found many hens in urgent need of veterinary attention, who were clearly not receiving any care.' But the owner of the 6000-bird farm that sells caged, free-range chicken and duck eggs has denied claims that the animals were not being cared for properly. Two dead hen carcases are just left on the floor of the caged chicken farm . Dirt and dust hang from the hen cages that look as if they haven't been cleaned for ages . Wagner’s Poultry is a family business that has been operating for over 50 years. ‘Wagner’s is regularly inspected by the Department of Primary Industries alongside a veterinary practitioner to ensure Wagner’s meets all regulatory requirements and adheres to the industries code of practice,’ the company said in a statement. ‘At no time has the industry regulator raised concerns with the animal husbandry practices on Wagner’s property. ‘Wagner’s Chicken Picken shed has been specifically designed to ensure that all our poultry is selected in a stress-free environment rather than being chased and caught in the paddock.’ Nothing to see here: One hen with a mangled beak looks forlornly out through its cage . Hundreds of hens stand in rows of cages as they lay eggs in pretty dire conditions . Dirty and emaciated hens stand in their cages with no room to move . The government department responsible for animal welfare in commercial facilities also confirmed two recent inspections did not find any breaches under animal cruelty laws. However, Mr Hannibal maintained that not only is the farm a hell hole for hens, it is also extremely unsafe for workers. 'Narrow and flimsy walkways next to the central cages drop directly into manure pits below,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'This presents a huge danger to any humans working in the shed who are at risk of falling down to the excrement pit a floor below - when they attempt to populate and depopulate the cages, or carry out the ‘daily inspection’ required by law. An Animal Liberation Victoria activist lifts up one of the hens to show how bad it looks . Another Animal Liberation Victoria activist takes a dirty and exhausted hen from one of the cages . Webs and dirt hang from the ceiling and cages where the hens as an Animal Liberation Victoria activist looks on in shock . 'Many people consider free range eggs to be an ethical alternative to these cruel battery systems that are in operation. 'But consumers should realise that all eggs, whether they are caged, barn or 'free range', cause enormous suffering and death.'","Animal Liberation Victoria activists who broke into Wagner's Poultry Farm .

"David Cameron yesterday made a last-ditch plea for Ukip supporters to ‘come home’ to the Conservatives. In a direct appeal to voters who have shifted allegiance to Nigel Farage’s party, the Prime Minister vowed to ‘do more’ to respond to concerns about immigration. With the election on a knife-edge, he warned that it is ‘not the time to send a message or make a protest’. Doing so could put the economic recovery at risk by allowing Labour back into power, said the Tory leader. David Cameron tonight issued an impassioned plea for Ukip voters to 'come back home' to the Conservatives . Mr Cameron also conceded that he understood the ‘frustrations’ of Ukip voters. It is a significant peace offering by the Prime Minister, who once dismissed Ukip as ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’. Speaking in Bristol yesterday, he said to those who had left the Tory fold: ‘Look, we’ve heard the message loud and clear about the things you want to see changed and we’ll change those things. Come with us, come back home to us, rather than risk all of this good work being undone.’ The latest polls have put the Conservatives and Labour virtually neck and neck. A YouGov poll on Sunday had the Tories on 34 per cent, one point ahead of Labour, and Ukip in third place with 13 per cent of votes. A poll in Tory-held South Thanet – where Mr Farage is running for Parliament – shows him in second place, and pollsters now believe Ukip will win just a handful of seats. David Cameron's hopes of staying in Number 10 have been buoyed by opinion polls showing a steady squeeze in support for Ukip. As the election gets closer, voters appear to be drifting away from Nigel Farage's party. After hitting 18 per cent in the polls at the European elections last year, Ukip has seen its support drop by around five points. The Tories, meanwhile, have jumped ahead of Labour. The most recent surveys have given Mr Cameron's party a slender one-point lead  - with around 34 per cent of the vote. Mr Farage is also facing a fight to be elected in Thanet South. The Ukip leader has seen a comfortable lead slip and is now trailing in second place behind the Tories. A leaked poll showed the Tories in the lead in the Kent constituency Mr Farage is fighting with 31 per cent support. Mr Farage is on 30 per cent, with Labour in third on 29 per cent. The Prime Minister was joined by George Osborne for a speech at the Bristol and Bath Science Park this evening . But there are deep concerns that support for Ukip, fuelled by the Conservatives’ failure to meet their pledge to cut immigration to ‘tens of thousands’, could swing enough votes in other seats to hand Ed Miliband a victory. Mr Cameron, who also promised a referendum on Europe, said the Government had turned around the economy and cut taxes for working people. Mr Cameron has previously accused Nigel Farage supporters of being 'fruitcakes and loonies' ‘To keep generating the jobs and the growth our country needs, come back to us, come back home to us,’ he pleaded. The PM warned those who voted for ‘a minor party’ risked ending up with Ed Miliband propped up by the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, ‘driving him into even more spending, welfare unlimited, debt bloat’. Mr Cameron said the prospect of a minority Labour government held in power by the SNP was a ‘nightmare scenario’ and said the Conservatives ‘need’ Ukip support. ‘We are 23 seats short from an overall majority,’ he said. ‘We can provide that clear, decisive and frankly more accountable government that a majority Conservative government would deliver. We need those 23 seats.’ Mr Farage immediately attacked the Prime Minister and said he would not win Ukip voters back. He said former Labour and Tory voters have found a ‘more authentic home’ where they do not get ‘roundly abused by their hosts’. Meanwhile, the ‘defection’ of a Tory parliamentary candidate to Ukip descended into farce yesterday when it was revealed he had already been dropped by the Conservatives. Nigel Farage hailed the move by Mike Whitehead as a ‘hammer blow’ for the PM. But the Tories said the candidate for Hull West and Hessle had been ‘sacked’ for threatening to stand as an independent.","PM said he understood why Tory supporters had backed Nigel Farage .

"In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is pulled out of obscurity, swiftly develops expert bow-and-arrow skills and leads a government rebellion - all without having to deal with braces or a single spot. However, the rise of the young adult heroine has prompted a backlash on Twitter, as more people compare the fictional portrayals with the mediocrity of their own lives. Teenagers have taken to the social media site to hilariously voice their frustrations between the fantastical lives in the pages of books and in films, and reality using the hashtag #realisticYA. The Hunger Games book (left), the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence in the film - pictured right) deals with exciting scenarios but never from any teenage ailments such as acne or braces . Twitter user, Adrienne Long, makes a reference to the fact that many YA heroines have their lives turned upside-down, but they are always prepared. Real life would perhaps be very different . Many of the tweets look at similar dystopian situations to those in the novels, but the Twitter users describe their own realistic reactions, or what would really be probable. Comparing real life to Katniss Everdeen's role in The Hunger Games, Adrienne Long tweets: 'Girl finds out she has impossible destiny to fulfill. Fails miserably having never spent a day preparing for it #realisticYA.' Some funny tweets simply address that at a time when many teenagers are going through the awkward stages of puberty, the YA protagonists are completely free from any awkward ailments. Joanna Macgregor tweeted: 'I met this new guy at school. He's really freaking cute but he has, like, zits, and I have, y'know, a muffin-top.' Young adults tell it like is is on Twitter under the hashtag #realistic YA . One teen addresses that unlike her perfect YA contemporaries, she suffers from  adolescent ailments . Another girl's tweet refers to Twilight, where the main character has to choose from multiple love-interests . Some look at dangerous scenarios and what would be likely to happen. Rather than escaping every situation unscathed, the Twitter users take a wry and straight-forward approach to the situation. Referring to the Twilight novel, one writer refers to Bella's choice between her multiple love-interests Jacob and Edward. Danielle Welling writes: 'Girl has no problem choosing between two equally hot boys in love with her. Because no hot boys love her. #realisticYA.' Other tweets look at young teens in a realistic manner, calling them '100% human' rather than 'mysterious and broody', and others look at realistic situations that arise with teen romances. Another tweet describes being too busy to be the 'chosen one' - referring to the character Beatrice Prior in Divergent. Preeti Chhibber writes: 'Girl is Chosen One but actually has 250hrs of community service, college apps, SATs and resume building so she can't but thx #realisticYA.' Not the chosen one? In the book Divergent (left), Beatrice Prior, who is played by Shailene Woodley in the film (pictured right with actor Theo James) is the 'chosen' one and leads a rebellion against the corrupt goverment . One user points out that many would not have the time to simply drop their lives to become the 'Chosen One' The hashtag on Twitter sees users comparing the reality of their own lives to young adult heroines . This #realisticYA looks at the fact that real teenage scenarios can mean that sometimes love is unrequited . If Harry Potter had never gone to Hogwarts, JK Rowling may have had five or six less books to write . Some of the tweets are hilarious because if the character in question did what the tweet suggests, much of the action in the novels would have never happened. Linda Newbery tweets: 'Boy thinks about running away, but changes mind when he realises that life at home is just too comfortable.' Many can imagine what the Harry Potter books would have been like if Harry never went to wizard school, Hogwarts. How young adults would really react to situations in novels revealed on Twitter . Another Twitter user users the hashtag to voice her concern that romantic leads have to be 'broody' or a 'jerk' Another girl writes about the realistic possibility that teenagers might be too frightened to confront their romantic interests . Hundreds of Twitter users have taken part in the hashtag . Others have written funny commentaries about how swiftly the heroine's life changes - and how a normal teenager, put in the same scenario, would be highly unprepared and may miss the opportunity. Another tweet explores the fact that on several occasions in YA novels, the protagonist may meet a mysterious, handsome stranger who aids her, but unlike normal teens is never overwhelmed or nervous. Lustybustyliz writes: 'Girl meets boy at the library. He's smart, cute & interested. She has a panic attack and hides in the bathroom.'","Young adult novels regularly feature teen heroines  saving the world .

"A car repair shop worker has been suspended after telling a customer's husband he needed to 'get her in check before there's a big f***ing problem' in a profane and threatening voicemail. Kyle Kandrick was suspended from the Maaco auto body shop in Hagerstown, Maryland after Ella May Rudd posted the voicemail left for her husband on Facebook. In the voicemail, Kandrick said: 'Hey, Billy, Kyle at Maaco here. I was just personally attacked by your wife on Facebook, and I don't appreciate it at all, pal.' Scroll down for video . Ella May Rudd points to the leak on her Hummer H2 that she was trying to have repaired at a Maaco auto body shop in Haggerstown, Maryland, before co-owner Kyle Kandrick left a threatening voicemail for her husband . 'So I want you to get her in check before there is a big f***ing problem here on my end. Understand me?' 'I did everything I could for her. She was in here Saturday and I explained everything to her the right way, and I don't like being attacked on Facebook.' 'I'm telling your right now: deal with it before I deal with it.' On her post, Rudd wrote that she had been dealing with the auto body shop for 'the last two months' while trying to repair a leak on her Hummer H2. She said that the voicemail was in response to a scathing review she had written on the company's Facebook page after her tenth unsuccessful trip to Maaco. 'Crooks, rude people, and liars. Please take your business anywhere else but here. I regret spending the last month and a half wasting my time with this company,' she wrote in the review. 'My car is still not fixed. They have charged me for car parts not needed, they have had me show up to multiple appointments and not have mechanics/car ready, they have lied about multiple car repair events.' 'They are extremely unprofessional, and so much more. I hope this review at least stops a few people from being robbed and aggravated. So disappointed.' Rudd said that she paid Kandrick a visit on Saturday when she found out her car had still not been repaired. Kandrick called Rudd's husband after she left a scathing review on the shop's Facebook page. In the voicemail he said: 'I want you to get her in check before there is a big f***ing problem here on my end. Understand me?' Kandrick was suspended after Rudd posted the voicemail on Facebook and the post quickly went viral . She said that Kandrick was 'really rude' and blamed his workers. Rudd said she demanded she be returned the money she had been charged. 'I don't care whose fault it is,' she said she told him. 'It is your business that messed up and I need your business to fix it and to return my money that they just took.' She said Kandrick then claimed the shop didn't repair leaks, only to ask her to bring the car in again when a mechanic walked in and said the leak would be an 'easy fix'. Rudd said Kandrick also 'stormed out' of the room at one point and was talking to her 'like I was the biggest idiot ever'. The stay-at-home mother of two calls herself a 'strong woman', who had no problem confronting Kandrick herself after hearing the voicemail. 'I said to him, ""My husband will not handle me at all.""' Rudd said Maaco President Jose Costa called her Thursday, the day after she posted the recording, and said he couldn't fire the employee because he's a co-owner of the franchise. Maaco officials didn't respond to questions from The Associated Press about that call. The company apologized to Rudd in a statement issued on Friday and said the 'employee at issue' would be suspended pending further review. Maaco added that he would be getting diversity and anger management training and that the shop would be temporarily closed 'in order to pursue customer care training for the team'. Rudd said the company has also offered to repair her car, but she's not interested. 'Maaco will not touch my car now,' she said.

Each bungalow reportedly sleeps up to eight people and offers a view of both the Magic Kingdom Resort and the lagoon, where an electrical water pageant takes place each night. Nestled on the shores of the Seven Seas Lagoon, the villas feel more like Bora Bora than Florida . All of the bungalows have two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a full kitchen and a large living area . There are 20 overwater villas in total and each of the opulent offering sleeps eight people . Each bungalow has an expansive private deck, complete with private plunge pool overlooking the water . Before being ushered to their private bungalow, all 20 of which are connected via bamboo walkways, guests are welcomed at the Great Ceremonial House, where they are given flower leis. From there, and if you're not headed directly to the theme parks, guests can take advantage of their private decks and sun loungers or explore the sandy shores of the lagoon. There are also a pair of bamboo chairs hanging from the roof on each of the bungalow's decks, providing the perfect spot to tuck into a bit of Dole Whip soft serve ice cream. The pineapple-flavoured concoction is famous on the resort - and one of the only places you can find the sweet treat outside of Hawaii. In one of the bedrooms, the bed's headboard is crafted out of wooden surfboards . Of the two bathrooms, the master even has a television hidden in the mirror . The villas have a mid-century, 60s-era design scheme and a large dining room table that seats eight . The bungalows provide the perfect vantage point from which to watch the electrical water pageant at night . At night, music from the fireworks display, which takes place at the Magic Kingdom, gets piped in to the villa . The villas can be booked by regular holidaymakers but are also available as part of a timeshare programme through Disney's Vacation Club. 'If you'd like to rent one of the bungalows, it's anywhere between $2,100 and $4,500, depending on the time of year you come and visit,' Tracy Powell, Vice Presidents Deluxe Resorts told Fox Orlando. She maintains that the high price will stil offer great value for timeshare programme users as lifetime membership will eventually save them up to 50 per cent on costs.","Disney has just unveiled their latest luxury resort: Bora Bora Bungalows .

"Boris Johnson today fire an extraordinary attack on the Labour party, claiming Ed Miliband wants to go back to the 'nasty, racist' era of the 1970s. The London Mayor, who today launched the Tory campaign in the capital, said the Labour leader was 'hostile' to people who wanted to own their own home and would embark on an 'orgy of regulation and state socialism'. He also claimed Ukip wanted to turn the clock back to the 1950s while the Greens want a return to 'somewhere around the bronze age'. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson today launched the Tory campaign in London with a speech in Hartley Hall, Mill Hill . Mr Johnson told voters that if they vote Conservative they will get broadband but if they vote Ukip they will get Miliband . Mr Johnson was mobbed by fans at the launch in Mill Hill, North London where he posed for selfies with supporters. He was joined at the event by Hendon candidate Matthew Offord and his dog Max, and International Development Secretary Justine Greening. As the mayor arrived he could be heard asking whether he needed to show his ID to get in. Launching his attack on Labour, Mr Johnson told voters that if they vote Conservative they will get broadband but if they vote Ukip they will get Miliband. He also joked the Tories were the party of 'kitchen ownership' while Labour was the party of 'kitchen concealment'. Mr Johnson also said he believed the polls were starting to and would continue to move in favour of the Conservatives. He described the party's formula as 'wealth creation for a moral purpose'. In his speech, Mr Johnson repeatedly mocked Mr Miliband over the revelation he has two kitchens in his £2million North London home. He said: 'I don't mind if he is so lazy he would rather not go downstairs to make a cup of tea shortly before binge-watching Breaking Bad or whatever he does. 'I mind very much that he is instinctively and intuitively hostile to the liberating policy of home ownership. We are the party of home ownership, of kitchen ownership. They are the party of hypocrisy and kitchen concealment.' Mr Johnson cuddled up to a dog wearing a blue rosette supporting local Tory candidate Matthew Offord . Mr Johnson was mobbed by fans wanting pictures and selfies when he visited a cafe Mill Hill, North London . A large media scrum followed Mr Johnson as he went on his walkabout around north west London . He also visited a shop, with Tory party leaflets in hand, to drum up support for the Conservatives . Mr Johnson is expected to campaign across the country as a senior Conservative who appeals to voters which other ministers cannot reach . Progress through the streets of Hendon was slow as he stopped for selfies with supporters . He hailed the Conservatives' record on connectivity, saying: 'If you vote Tory you get broadband, if you vote Ukip you get Miliband.' The 'main problem' with the Labour leader is not his inability to eat a bacon sandwich, the mayor went on, or that he sounds like a 'polytechnic sociology lecturer'. Nor is it that he and Ed Balls drove the car 'so spectacularly off the cliff' the last time they had the keys, he added, calling them the 'Thelma and Louise of British politics'. He said: 'The main problem is not even that they would be the playthings of the SNP and that Ed Miliband would be peeking out of Alex Salmond's sporran like a baby kangaroo. 'The main problem is that Ed Miliband and the Labour Party are now more left-wing than they have ever been at any time since Michael Foot. 'They literally want to take us back to the 1970s with an orgy of regulation and state socialism.' Mr Johnson said he believed the polls were starting to and would continue to move in favour of the Conservatives . It echoed comments made in a speech last night, in which Mr Johnson said Mr Miliband does not see that wealth creation has a moral purpose. 'And by attacking wealth creation both in rhetoric and his actions, he would take this country backwards to those 1970s that I spoke of with an orgy of higher taxation and regulation. I remember the 1970s. I wouldn't want to go back. 'It was a nasty, grim, petty epoch of really foul racism, frankly, and a union-dominated economy,' he told an event organised by the Legatum Institute think tank. Mr Johnson also joked that Ukip wanted to take the country back to the 1950s, the Greens to 'somewhere around the bronze age' and the Liberal Democrats to whatever would give them a boost in the polls. He added: 'We are the only party presenting ourselves for election that thinks, broadly speaking, that today is better than yesterday. 'And tomorrow, broadly speaking, is going to be better than today. We have a fantastic story to tell.'","London Mayor claims Labour would embark on 'orgy of state socialism'

"A mother has voiced her fear after scientific tests have failed to explain why oranges are turning an inexplicable tone of purple in her house. Angela Postle, from Maroochydore in southeast Queensland, stumbled upon the bizarre spectacle last month after slicing some oranges she bought  from a local supermarket. The mother-of-five sent the fruit of to Queensland Environmental Health Branch for testing, but their first round of scientific tests were to no avail. 'I'm very worried because I feed my kids a lot of oranges and fruit. We need answers because this could be a more widespread problem,' Ms Postle told Daily Mail Australia . The oranges that turned an inexplicable hue of purple in Queensland mother Angela Postle's house . She first stumbled upon the uncanny phenomenon after buying the oranges from her local Woolworths. 'I cut them up up for my children but ended up making something else and forgetting about them. The next morning I noticed the purple colouring, and it got progressively worse over the coming days.' Ms Postle took the oranges back to the supermarket and was offered a refund but no explanation. She resolved to send them to the health authorities in a bid to find out what had happened. But to her horror, the phenomenon unfolded a second time with oranges from a different supermarket, suggesting the problem is coming from within her own house. 'We need answers, this isn't normal or natural. I am not going to feed my kids something like that. I think it's awful they haven't come up with any answers.' Angela Postle with four of her five children, Jaspa, Marlah, Makali and Ceejay . The mother has voiced her fear over the strange phenomenon: I am not going to feed my kids something like that. I think it's awful they haven't come up with any answers' A spokesperson from the to Queensland Environmental Health Branch told Daily Mail Australia the following. 'Preliminary testing on a sample of oranges which had shown purple discolouration has been completed by the Queensland Health Forensic and Scientific Services. 'Testing was carried out to determine the presence of commonly used synthetic food colourings. The oranges showed no indication of the presence of any artificial colours. 'Testing was also undertaken to determine the presence of iodine. No evidence of iodine was found. They said a sample of the the oranges has been sent to a molecular biology laboratory for further analysis. Ms Postle said the discolouration grew worse over the coming days until it encompassed the entire fruit . After the first round of tests were completed last week, a sample of the the oranges has been sent to a molecular biology laboratory for further analysis . Mrs Postle said the second round of tests could take a whole month, a period when she will be avoiding oranges and being dildigent with her food choices. 'We're not eating oranges and being very careful with our food choices until then.' Experts have voiced their bewilderment at the images of the discoloured fruit. Andrew Harty from Citrus Australia told 9News it was highly unusual. 'I've never seen anything like that, and I've been in the game a long time. An orange would never do that naturally.'

"Ed Miliband would be a 'catastrophe' for Britain, according to FTSE 100 bosses . Seven out of 10 business chiefs at Britain's biggest companies think Ed Miliband would be a 'catastrophe' for Britain, a survey has revealed. The poll of FTSE 100 chairman has revealed overwhelming support for David Cameron to remain Prime Minister, despite the widespread business concern over his pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. It comes just days after more than 100 company bosses signed a letter warning against a Labour government. It also echoes controversial remarks by the Boots chief executive Stefano Pessina who sparked fury after claiming it would be a 'catastrophe' for the UK if Labour won the election. The poll of 35 business chairman, by the headhunters Korn Ferry, is a further blow to Labour which is struggling to repair its relationship with big business after a series of controversial policy announcements. Mr Miliband last week vowed to ban 90 per cent of zero-hours contracts and  unveiled proposals to make it easier for workers to take their bosses to court for unfair dismissal. He also confirmed plans to raise corporation tax for the first time in 40 years to raise cash for a £400 cut in business rates for smaller firms. One of the FTSE 100 bosses surveyed, who did not want to be named, said businesses could work with Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and its economics chief Ed Balls. But he said Mr Miliband's 'tone and rhetoric' had proved 'deeply disturbing', adding: 'At times his language is vitriolic and he appears to completely misunderstand business.' Mr Umunna, speaking on Radio 5 Live today, Umunna insisted Labour was no anti-business and defended Mr Miliband's recent announcemtn that Labour would all-but outlaw zero-hours contracts. Mr Umunna admitted not all zero-hours contracts were 'awful and bad', but insisted many workers were being exploited. Scroll down for video . Mr Miliband has vowed to force companies to offer staff a full time contract if they have been working regular hours for three months. Mr Umunna said: 'I think this will be massively helpful. There are 1.8million zero hours contracts now and I think this will transform people's lives.' The shadow business secretary has also pointed to Labour's refusal to offer a European referendum as a policy which business supported. David Cameron and George Osborne, out campaigning today, have jumped on business criticism of the Labour Party to boost their core campaign message that only the Tories can be trusted with the economy . He said: 'Business people have been very impressed that Ed took a decision on a matter of principle on the in-out referendum. It would have been easier to dance to Nigel Farage's tune, as the Conservatives have done.' Last week, Mr Umunna and a host of other Labour figures hit out at Britain's top business leaders after they backed the Conservatives' economic plan and urged voters not to risk a 'change of course'. In a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the general election, the business chiefs claimed a Labour government would 'put the recovery at risk'. Mr Miliband said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the Tories were on the side of 'a few big firms and individuals at the top'. Mr Umunna, meanwhile, dismissed the signatories as a 'cosy little club', while Labour peer John Precott went further criticising them as 'tax dodgers, Tory voters and non-doms'. Mr Cameron, however, insisted the intervention was 'unprecedented' and claimed it sent a 'very powerful message'. The business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as Primark, Iceland, Ladbrokes and Costa Coffee. Bosses behind big name retailers, drinks and restaurants have backed the Tory economic plan, including (top row) Primark and Costa and (bottom row) Ladbrokes, Cobra, Tango and Iceland . Executives at consumer brands such as Cobra beer, Britvic, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill, Thorntons, Robinsons, Tango and London Pride are also on the list. Embarrassingly for Labour, the list of business chiefs includes several who supported the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. However, Mr Miliband said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election. He said: 'Businesses have come out today to say they want lower business taxes and, you know, that doesn't surprise me. 'But it does also go to the wider choice at this election. The Conservatives really believe that if all of the few corporations and individuals at the top are doing well, the wealth will magically trickle down for everybody else. 'We have tried that experiment over the last few years and it hasn't worked. We have seen falling living standards and falling wages and insecurity at work. I just have a different view about the way the country succeeds.'","Poll of FTSE 100 bosses reveals overwhelming support for the Tories .

"A former Fortune 500 executive from New Hampshire will serve between nine and 20 years in prison for causing a highway crash that killed a Vermont couple and their unborn baby. Robert Dellinger, 54, was sentenced on Thursday to two four-and-a-half to ten year sentences that are to be served consecutively in the December 2013 deaths of Amanda Murphy, 24, who was 8 months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Prosecution claimed he deliberately drove his vehicle head-on into the couple's car because he was depressed and wanted to kill himself. During the second day of the sentence hearing, he was given credit for the 15 months he has spent in jail since the crash, which means he could be released in less than eight years.

Dellinger was given credit for the 15 months he has previously served and could get out of prison in less than eight years . He pleaded guilty in February to negligent homicide for the deaths of the couple, who were from Wilder, Vermont, and to assault for the death of the fetus. On Thursday, he was also sentenced to three-and-a-half to seven years in prison on the assault charge, all suspended, according to Valley News. His lawyer said that Dellinger might petition to have one of the consecutive sentences suspended. The family of Murphy and Timmons declined to comment following the sentencing. Prosecutors previously said  Dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across an Interstate 89 median and smashed into an SUV carrying the couple. Relatives of Murphy and Timmons tore into Dellinger on Wednesday during the first of the two-day sentencing hearing. 'I have been robbed and violated. I will never see or touch my child ever again,' Timmons' mother, Debbie Blanchard, said as she fought back tears. 'How could you be so heartless? You still have a family; you have taken mine from me', reports the Valley News of West Lebanon. Jason Timmons (left), 29, and Amanda Murphy (right), 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013 . This is an ultrasound of the couple's unborn baby who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth . Dellinger appeared to be deeply remorseful during the hearing on Wednesday. 'You have my deepest, most heartfelt apology, condolences and remorse for your loss. I am so sorry,' the 54-year-old Dellinger said through sobs. 'My guilt and remorse will be with me forever. I ask for your forgiveness, and I pray for your healing.' Dellinger, of Sunapee, New Hampshire, was a senior vice president and chief financial officer at PPG Industries Inc. when he left in 2011 because of health problems. He also held high-level posts at Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co. Earlier he had  told the court he has 'never been suicidal.'

Defense attorney Lucy Karl comforts Robert Dellinger after testimony by the families of Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons on Wednesday. The former Fortune 500 executive has admitted causing a highway crash that killed them and their unborn fetus .

'We are devastated by the deaths of your loved ones,' she said as her husband broke down at the defense table. 'We have been and continue to pray every day for your collective peace and comfort.' Dellinger reportedly broke down in tears at the defense table as his wife was speaking to the relatives of Murphy and Timmons. Defense lawyers have said Dellinger was suffering from delirium due to a 'toxic regime' of prescription medications for multiple sclerosis and depression. In asking for a shorter sentence, they also contend he was suffering from withdrawal of a sleeping aid. Robert Dellinger thanked his family and friends for their support in court on Wednesday. He told a judge that he was not suicidal at the time of the crash . Attorney Steven Gordon wrote in a sentencing brief they now know 'a medical event' was the main cause 'of this accident.' Dellinger has been jailed since his arrest in December. Investigators said Dellinger told them that on the day of the accident he 'had a disagreement with his wife and went to Vermont to drive around. He said he was very depressed and gloomy and wanted to have a car wreck and kill himself.' On Wednesday, Dellinger told the court: 'I have never been suicidal.' Assistant Attorney General Geoffrey Ward said in court that Dellinger's truck reached 101 mph in the seconds before the crash and was going 87 mph one second before he hit the SUV. His truck sheared off the top of the SUV. The medical examiner's report compared the injuries suffered by Murphy and Timmons to those of plane crash victims. Dellinger suffered cuts and bruises. This is a picture of the scene of the crash after Dellinger careened over the central median in December 2013 .

"David Cameron took on Church of England bishops yesterday after they questioned the morality of his austerity and welfare policies. In an Easter message to Christians, the Prime Minister insisted the Coalition had spent five years ‘trying to lift people up’ by making work pay and encouraging responsibility. ‘Just because some people have disagreed with our policies, does not mean those policies are missing in moral content,’ he insisted. Scroll down for video . Trip with George: Prime Minister David Cameron visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton yesterday . Statement: In an Easter message to Christians, the Prime Minister insisted the coalition had spent five years 'trying to lift people up' by making work pay and encouraging responsibility . His intervention came as another senior Tory, chief whip Michael Gove, claimed Christians in Britain were being dismissed with a combination of condescension and suspicion. Six weeks ago, the Church provoked a row with ministers by publishing an unprecedented guide to how the country’s 30million Christians should ‘approach the General Election’. Bishops insisted it was not targeted at any particular party, and criticised successive governments while calling for a ‘fresh moral vision’. But much of the 50-page document was widely interpreted as indirect criticism of the Coalition’s welfare policies, which include a £26,000-a-year cap on household benefits, a new universal credit designed to ensure people are always better off in work and tough sanctions to prevent people languishing on jobless benefits. The bishops complained that welfare claimants were ‘described in terms that imply they are undeserving, dependent and ought to be self-sufficient’. They insisted it was ‘game-playing … to claim that anyone who cares about the impact of austerity on the most vulnerable members of society is… careless about the extent of national indebtedness’. The Archbishop of Canterbury the Most Rev Justin Welby - pictured ahead of a service for the re-burial of Richard III at Leicester Cathedral last week - has seen the Church of England come under fire from the PM . Despite evidence that the best-off are paying more in tax than ever before, the bishops also complained that ‘the greatest burdens of austerity have not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders’. Official Treasury figures suggest that the richest 10 per cent of households are contributing most to deficit reduction. Archbishop of York John Sentamu blamed welfare cuts and 'poverty wages' for rising inequality . Speaking to Premier Christianity magazine, Mr Cameron said the ‘values of the Christian faith are the values on which our nation was built’. ‘I’m an unapologetic supporter of the role of faith in this country. And for me, the key point is this: the values of Easter and the Christian religion – compassion, forgiveness, kindness, hard work and responsibility – are values that we can all celebrate and share,’ he added. Mr Cameron conceded he was not a model Christian and was ‘a bit hazy on the finer points of our faith’. ‘But even so, in the toughest of times, my faith has helped me move on and drive forward. It also gives me a gentle reminder every once in a while about what really matters and how to be a better person, father and citizen,’ he added. The Prime Minister said he had attempted to ‘banish the notion that being in government means you can somehow wave a magic wand and solve all the world’s problems’, and instead it was about ‘the right judgement… based on clear values and beliefs’. He said the Government had inherited ‘exceptional pressure on the national finances’ from Labour, adding: ‘I am proud that despite the pressure on public spending, we made clear choices to help the poorest paid and most vulnerable in society. ‘We have increased NHS spending, despite the overriding need to deal with the deficit. We also raised the threshold of income tax to lift the poorest paid out of income tax altogether. ‘More fundamentally, the core of our recovery programme – dealing with the deficit to restore confidence in our economy – is based on enduring ideas and principles: hard work, fair play, rewarding people for doing the right thing, and securing a better future for our children.’ Writing in The Spectator magazine today, Mr Gove said that the popular image of Christianity was at odds with the reality of churches across the country, which daily offered ‘thousands of quiet kindnesses’ to those most in need. ‘To call yourself a Christian in contemporary Britain is to invite pity, condescension or cool dismissal.’ Nick Clegg is on course to lose his seat to Labour, a poll suggested yesterday. A survey of voters in the Lib Dem leader’s Sheffield Hallam constituency put Labour on 36 per cent of the vote compared with 34 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. Prime Minister's wife: Samantha Cameron arrives for a visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent . Samantha Cameron yesterday visited a primary school in the seat of Rochester and Strood, held by former Tory Mark Reckless, who defected to Ukip and won a by-election last year. Despite his victory, the Conservatives are hopeful of recapturing the seat at the General Election. Reckless’s party Ukip, meanwhile, has said 16 and 17-year-olds should not be allowed to vote in a referendum on membership of the European Union. Its deputy chairman claims children are being exposed to ‘propaganda’ from Brussels in a bid to ‘catch them young’. Suzanne Evans said: ‘It’s everything there from colouring-in books on the Common Agricultural Policy for primary schoolchildren right up to research projects at university level. ‘The amount of money that the EU is putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous. 'Overall the EU has an advertising budget that is larger than Coca-Cola.’ It is thought the Lib Dems would demand 16 and 17-year-olds are given a say in any EU referendum as part of a post-election coalition deal.","Prime Minister said Coalition had spent 5 years 'trying to lift people up'

"A former bomb disposal expert has won his battle with the bulge after shedding half his bodyweight after undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Steve Tempest-Mitchell, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, lost a whopping 16st after the surgery 14 months ago, which caused his stomach to shrink to the size of a tennis ball. The 56-year-old said he decided to go through with the operation after hitting 32st and struggling to control his Type 2 diabetes. Scroll down for video . Slim and trim: Steve Tempest-Mitchell says he has a new lease of life after slimming down from 32st to 16st . 'It was a case of going in for the surgery and hoping to come out the other side,' said the father-of-three. This was a life changing and life threatening decision for me to make. 'At 32st, it was not an easy decision as I had been turned down for the surgery two and a half years previously . 'It had got to a point where something had to be done because I was slowly killing myself. I was just waiting for something awful to happen and even needed psychiatric help.' Although he never indulged in binge-eating, Mr Tempest-Mitchell says he would eat smaller portions at regular intervals and was drinking around eight cans of cola a day. But the former bomb disposal expert hadn't always been big and he says that growing up, he lived an active lifestyle, regularly playing rugby and competing in wrestling. Flashback: Mr Tempest-Mitchell said he was almost a recluse when he was at his biggest (above) As he got older, he began to struggle with his weight thanks to a lifestyle of long-haul flights, business meetings and boozy evenings spent entertaining clients. Mr Tempest-Mitchell also had to contend with some highly stressful situations while working as a bomb disposal expert between 1996 and 2005 in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he was employed as a contractor with the Ministry of Defence. Using high-pressure water technology, he would set about the grim task of defusing bombs. 'It was a very stressful situation,' he explains. 'Not only have you got to handle the situation of defusing the threat of the bomb but you are in dangerous territory as well under guard from soldiers. Helping hand: The former bomb disposal expert said he needed to be pushed in a wheelchair to board a plane . 'We were very lucky as one of the bases we were stationed at was attacked by a rocket launcher just weeks after we left.' Mr Tempest-Mitchell, who is now a business development manager at a demolition and asbestos removal firm, said as the years went by, his weight crept up. 'I had a very active lifestyle before my work and life balance was disrupted and I began to not have time to eat right,' he said. 'I was never one of those people who would eat massive amounts of food where you are stunned by the amount but I did have small portions regularly. 'Ever since I was a child, I always drank coke. At one point, I was having between six to eight cans a day. I have had to completely cut coke out of my life as well as other fizzy drinks. I don't mind if I never have one again.' The father-of-three said his weight affected his self confidence and esteem . As a result of the weight gain, Mr Tempest-Mitchell almost became housebound at his heaviest and was forced to plan every trip out. His weight issues even affected his working life, as well as his confidence and self esteem. 'I was forced to park the car as close as possible to wherever I was going, if I couldn't, I'd have to turn back and go home,' he recalls. 'I was almost becoming a recluse as I was unable to visit sites for my work so instead worked from home. I was becoming a burden on my family, especially when we tried to go on holiday. I had to be taken to the plane by a buggy or wheelchair.' Fed up, he took the plunge and opted for surgery - a decision that coincided with him finding that he was about to become a grandfather. Both of his daughters, aged 26 and 36, were expecting babies. 'My one daughter came to see me while I was recovering from the operation and broke the news that she was pregnant,' said Mr Tempest-Mitchell, who also has a 34-year-old son. Although he never indulged in eating too many snacks, he said he would drink up to eight cans of coke a day . 'I was so thrilled as I knew the success of the surgery would allow me to be more active and enjoy spending time with them as they are growing up.' As well as losing more than a stone a month, he has also seen his waist shrink from 66 inches to 42 inches and his chest go down from 66 inches to 48 inches. 'Now I feel like I am a new man,' he said. 'I have the energy to play with my grandchildren, who are both nearly one, which I would not have been able to do before.'","Steve Tempest-Mitchell had gastric bypass surgery to shrink his stomach .

Popular Australian comedian Rebel Wilson also recently enlisted Stewart's style advice in a bid to bring a sense of 'classiness' to her image in Tinseltown. Stewart was also voted number one stylist on The Hollywood Reporter's Power Stylist list last year, and was also blamed for causing a major fashion stir for having Blanchett (dubbed ‘the darling of Hollywood’) be the first to step out in a black frayed dress for Maison Margiela by John Galliano (after the disgraced designer left Valentino) during her Blue Jasmine acclaim. Also notably scoring eighth place was Cristina Elrich, the stylist responsible for creating a fresh faced glamour look for Aussie beauty Margot Robbie (during both her blonde and brunette red carpet appearances) and an Amazonian style for mystical Australian actress Isabel Lucas. Style sisters: Jeanann Williams, Naomi Watts' longtime stylist, placed ninth on the list . Personal and professional: Jeannan also used to date Naomi's brother Ben, and the pair share a daughter .

"The mother of an Australian man who was killed in Syria during a clash against Islamic State, has finally farewelled her son after his body was brought back onto home soil. Ashley Johnston, 28, was shot in February in Rojava, near the Turkish border, while fighting with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) and was given a heroes send off in Macquarie Park, Sydney, on Thursday morning. Although his mother Amanda Johnston had no idea her son was at war in the Middle East until she learnt of his death, the proud mother paid a touching tribute to his final action in life at his funeral. Scroll down for video . Amanda Jonston (centre) the mother of former soldier Ashley Johnston, walks in front of her son's coffin as it is carried out of the chapel during his funeral service at Macquarie Park Cemetery on Thursday . 'Ashley put his life on the line to stand up for what is good, for what is just, to protect and defend not just innocent people caught up in this war but you and I and people everywhere,' Mrs Johnston said as she fought back tears. The Queenslander, who lived in the ACT, is believed to be the first Westerner to die in battle against IS. Ashley Johnston, originally from Maryborough in Queensland, but who had most recently been living in Canberra, told his mother Amanda he was simply heading to the Middle East to do humanitarian work. The Australian reportedly died on February 24 in a small village near Shingal in Iraq, close to the border with Syrian Kurdistan . However he was fighting against the IS rule and was shot in a clash with their forces in February. Johnston said in his final interview before his death, that he was afraid of returning home because he thought he'd be treated like a terrorist. At the time, his mother Amanda Johnston told the Sydney Morning Herald that she was in disbelief that her son was fighting against ISIS in Syria. 'I just kept calling because I didn't believe it was true. I know in my head that it is actually Ash but the rest of me doesn't like to believe it's true,' she said when she learnt of his death. Members of Australia's Kurdish community carry the coffin of former soldier Ashley Johnston . Mr Johnston's mother did not know that her son was in Syria fighting with Kurdish soldiers against ISIS until she heard of his death . 'I just said, ""I need to talk to you. You have to ring me. I don't believe that what I've been told is true. I need you to ring me and tell me what's going on … I need to hear your voice.""' Mr Johnston served for seven years with Australia's Army Reserves before going travelling and becoming moved by the struggle of ethnic Kurds against IS militants, who have taken control of large parts of Syria of Iraq. His body finally arrived home in Canberra last week, leaving Mrs Johnston to face the grim task of identifying him. She reportedly slapped her son's body when she saw him and then kissed him on the face. According to a family member, his mother would not have supported his choice to fight with the Kurdish people in Syria. Mr Johnston's coffin was draped in the Australian and Kurdistan Democratic Union (PYD) party flags, and was carried by men and women dressed in khaki fatigues and scarves in PYD colours of red, yellow and green . Mr Johnston who worked for seven years as part of the Australian Army Reserves is believed to be the first Westerner to die in battle against IS . 'She wouldn't have supported him fighting there in any shape or form,' a family spokesman told Fairfax Media. 'She doesn't want anyone to go over there, no matter which side they are on.' Sitting with hundreds of mourners, many with pictures of her son and a YPG star pinned to their chests, she listened on Thursday to the story of his legacy. 'We came from different lands, different cultures, different religions and different languages' Saadet Ozdemir, a Kurdish community member from Sydney, said. 'A young man from Canberra by the name of Ashley Johnston brought our communities together not just in Australia but globally.' Ashley Johnston, originally from Maryborough in Queensland but had most recently been living in Canberra, told his mother Amanda he was simply heading to the Middle East to do humanitarian work . Mourners at his funeral wore T-shirts imprinted with Mr Johnston's image and carried badges to honour the fallen soldier . The service heard Mr Johnston was among eight fighters in a broken-down truck confronted and outnumbered by IS. His comrades said he sacrificed himself to draw enemy fire, a move that saved them.

'You gave your life so that our children and our community might live in peace and hope,' she said. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Shiyar Cahal, 22, paid his respects to the Kurdish fighter and said he wished he knew what motivated Mr Johnson to leave Australia to fight in Syria.

"More than 50 dead greyhounds have been found dumped in Queensland bushland, with a taskforce set up to probe live-baiting in the state now investigating the grim find. At least 55 carcasses were found in the Coonarr area, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday. A joint RSPCA and Queensland Police taskforce is now investigating. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says it's understood the dogs were killed before a Four Corners special which exposed the horrors of the greyhound racing industry. 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' Beatty told Fairfax media. At least 55 carcasses were found in the Coonarr area, near Bundaberg, on Tuesday, with the RSPCA. Early investigations suggest the dogs were young dogs that were killed as they were too slow . 'The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know,' an RSPCA spokesperson told Fairfax media . 'Unfortunately as I think most people would be aware, there's always been a lot of wastage in the greyhound industry.' Police said it was unclear how long the dogs' bodies had been there, but confirmed they were found in various states of decomposition. There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said. They're appealing for anyone with further information to come forward and are expected to address the media on Thursday. Queensland Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller expressed her outrage on Twitter after the discovery. 'Absolutely sickened that @QPSmedia and @RSPCAQLD have found the remains of 55 greyhounds. Animal cruelty in Qld won't be tolerated,' she wrote. There were no greyhound training facilities or other connections to the racing industry in the area, a police spokesperson said . The taskforce was established to investigate the use of live baiting using possums, rabbits and piglets to train competitive greyhounds. It came after an ABC Four Corners expose from earlier this year sparked widespread outrage after showing racing dogs chasing and mauling live animals. So far, five people have been charged with a total of 23 offences in the state. An independent review headed up by barrister Alan MacSporran SC is also being conducted into the practice. It's expected to be completed in about three months' time. This review aims to find out how widespread the use of live baiting is in Queensland, and how it could go undetected for so long.

'Seeing this opportunity he swung around and pounced onto the baby - trying to get a grip and take the baby down. 'The adult hippo swung around and came back charging at the lion. The lion quickly released its grip and decided that it was time to exit the scene.

"A Nevada woman received a $200 ticket after she was pulled over for putting on makeup while she was behind the wheel as part of a statewide crackdown on distracted drivers. So what sort of beauty product was she applying while stopped at a red light?  Lip balm. Stephanie Fragoso was cited on Wednesday, April Fools' Day, after she was stopped in Las Vegas by a Nevada Highway Patrol (NHP) trooper. Scroll down for video . Stephanie Fragoso was cited on Wednesday, April Fools' Day, after she was stopped by in Las Vegas, Nevada .

"Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under David Cameron's Conservatives party, compared to just under nine per cent under Labour . Shares have performed nearly twice as well under Conservative governments than under Labour over the last 45 years, according to figures published today. Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under the Tories compared with just under 9 per cent under Labour and just over 9 per cent under the current Coalition. The figures, in an analysis for the Daily Mail by investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, are a further boost for David Cameron and George Osborne ahead of the general election on May 7. Ed Miliband is struggling to win over business men and women as well as investors who are worried about a Left-wing Labour government’s attitudes to enterprise. A survey of FTSE 100 bosses this weekend showed 70 per cent believe a Labour government under Mr Miliband would be a ‘catastrophe’ for the economy. The analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown shows investors – including millions of workers saving for a pension – fare better under the Conservatives. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘The stock market has performed twice as well under a Conservative government as it has under Labour, according to performance statistics dating back to 1970.’ The analysis shows that companies have also performed better under the Tories with profits up by an average of 11 per cent a year under the Conservatives and 6 per cent under Labour. Writing in the Daily Mail, Mr Khalaf said: ‘Over the last 45 years there have been five Conservative governments, five Labour governments, and the current Coalition. ‘Over that time the UK stock market has returned on average 16 per cent a year under Conservative rule, compared with 9 per cent under Labour. ‘Markets can be capricious beasts in the short term, but on average this trend reflects the growth in UK company profits under the two parties.’ However, he said events on the global stage ‘are far more important to the UK stock market than the next resident of Number 10’. He added: ‘Looking back over the last 45 years, the waxing and waning of the stock market has been driven in large part by overseas influences, and is not commanded from Westminster. This makes sense when you consider how globalised most industries are.’ Experts have warned that a hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing. A survey of FTSE 100 bosses  showed 70 per cent believe a Labour government  would be a ‘catastrophe’ for the economy. The analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown shows investors fare better under the Conservatives . All the major pollsters are predicting that no party will win an overall majority. George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ‘The 2015 UK general election is set to be the most unpredictable for nearly a century. ‘Polls suggest that neither of the two major parties may have sufficient support to secure an outright majority. ‘There may be no good outcome for investors.’ A hard-hitting report by BlackRock, the largest fund manager in the world, said ‘a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine’ given Labour’s anti-business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. ‘Labour would be tough on business – and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility,’ the US giant said in the report. ‘A Conservatives-dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK’s EU membership. ‘Whoever wins – and the result could take some time to emerge – will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered-down legislation.’","Shares have performed nearly twice as well under Tories, new figures show .

"With the increasing pressure of modern life, more and more women in their 30s and 40s are suffering stress spots as well as wrinkles. But now help is at hand on the high street with a cream that claims to tackle spots while also fighting the signs of ageing. Superdrug has launched a range of creams with ingredients normally found in teenage spot treatments – as well as those for anti-ageing. Scroll down for video . Superdrug has launched a range of creams with ingredients normally found in teenage spot treatments – as well as those for anti-ageing . A poll of 2,000 women in their 30s, 40s and 50s discovered almost half were still being blighted with blemishes well into adulthood. One in three women said they even shy away from talking to people because they are so self-conscious about the state of their skin . One in three women said they even shy away from talking to people because they are so self-conscious about the state of their skin. And experts say that growing stress levels are a key factor. Stress makes the adrenal glands release male hormones, which then trigger more oil production, blocking pores. The Superdrug range, Clearly Youthful, starts at £5.99 and it is believed the range is the first of its kind on the high street. Clinique has a blemish range but this does not include a full regime of anti-ageing products, while brands such as Murad, which has focused on anti-ageing, are pricier with £49 for a moisturiser. Jill Flood, of Superdrug, said the Clearly Youthful range is inexpensive compared to high-end versions and the products provide a two-in-one solution. She said: ‘The general assumption is that we suffer the most problematic skin in our teens – but we know that for today’s woman this simply isn’t true. Most women will have some type of skin complaint well after their teenage years. ‘The rise of candid images of celebrities being shared has certainly shown that the average woman is not alone in having bad skin days, when even Kate Moss is pictured with blemishes it shows that the problem is universal.’ Dermatologist Dr Michael Prager believes hormones and diet are also to blame. He said: ‘I get a lot of women coming along and saying, “I never used to get spots but now I’m getting them”.’","One in three women are self conscious about the state of their skin .

"Water police have been called in to help with the search of a missing autistic boy, as 11-year-old Luke Shambrook is 'fascinated' by water but can not swim. Luke has been missing for two nights in a Victorian national park, with temperatures dropping to as low as eight degree Celsius on Saturday night. However, he may not even know he is lost and is known to frequently hide, according to his family. He was last seen leaving Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park near Lake Eildon at 9.30am on Good Friday. According the Herald Sun, the 11-year-old was reportedly seen walking near the Devils River on Sunday, four kilometres south of his campsite where he was last seen. Search crews have rushed to the location and police remain comfortable that the young boy is still alive. Luke has limited speech and his family says he is probably confused, and he may not even be aware he is lost. Campers are helping rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES volunteers in the search of thick bushland. Scroll down for video . Luke Shambrook was last seen on the national park at 9.30am on Good Friday. It is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since . Police assume Luke has spent 36 hours without food or water and on Saturday night would have experienced temperatures as low as 8 degree Celsius. Police hold hope that Luke has been able to stay reasonably warm as he was last seen wearing a beanie and warm jacket. There was a moment of hope when a beanie was found by the search party, however it was decided it did not belong to Luke. Having met Luke's family during a push to open a special school in Melbourne's southeast, Opposition emergency services spokeman Brad Battin says it's devastating to hear the 11-year-old is missing. He says Luke's parents Tim and Rachel have been updating him on the search and appreciate the efforts of all those out looking for their little boy. 'He's a lovely young kid,' Mr Battin told AAP on Sunday. 'He displays all the characteristics of a child with autism, which means he might not even think he is lost.' Sergeant Greg Paul says the search is focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland. The Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park, central Victoria, where Luke went missing on Friday . 'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush, we've got a lot searchers searching all the tracks and in between the tracks and the gullies and the spurs,' he told reporters on Saturday. The Shambrook family has thanked emergency service workers, volunteers, family and friends for their help. They say the disappearance is completely out of character for him. A widespread search is being carried by search and rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES members, along with campers around the surrounding areas. A large search is being carried by a medley of search and rescue teams . Sergeant Greg Paul said the search was focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland. 'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush,' he told reporters on Saturday. 'We've also got people walking the banks of the lake.' But he outlined a serious hurdle for the search efforts, according to ABC. 'With the autistic condition, Luke might not respond to searchers, he may not even know that he's lost,' he said. 'He won't necessarily respond to his name being called, but that might change a little bit as he gets hungry maybe. Lake Eildon, near where Luke went missing: Police say conditions are favourable for his survival overnight, with warm temperatures through the day . Sgt Paul said there were hundreds of other campers in the area over the busy Easter period, so there was a chance someone else could spot Luke. Luke is described as being of medium build, about 150 cm tall with olive skin, brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a black windcheater, black t-shirt, grey track-pants, grey boots and a scarf. Sergeant Greg Paul said the search was focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland .

"The Hunger Games film franchise has grossed over $2 billion after three movies - and the final chapter is due out at the end of the year. Before that, the Twilight saga managed $3.3 billion over five films from 2008. The Avengers garnered $1.5 billion with just one film in 2012, and there are three other sequels to come, with the follow-up hitting cinemas May 1. When it comes to Hollywood's primary concern - banking a major box office - a series or superhero adaptation is largely seen as a surefire success, in a benchmark set in the early 2000's by Harry Potter and The Lord Of The Rings, and followed by The Pirates Of The Caribbean and Spiderman. However, while original screenplays and independent projects are being edged out and overlooked as a result, there is still a small group of stars considered capable of pulling people into theaters in droves. According to a new survey in The Hollywood Reporter - which called upon producers, agents and executives to list those who can command a major opening based on their fan base -  there are six superstars around that can keep the studios swelling, without having to resort to turning a best-selling book or beloved comic into a picture. In return, they can ask for $20 million per film. 1. Sandra Bullock . The acting favorite, who won an Oscar in 2010 for The Blind Side, topped Forbes' list of the highest-earning actresses in 2014. The Miss Congeniality star took the headline spot thanks to her gripping turn in Gravity, which became one of the highest-grossing movies of 2013, with a global box office of $716 million. And while her buddy cop comedy The Heat with Melissa McCarthy managed similarly impressive numbers, with about $229.9 million worldwide, the powerful pull that Bullock has today is a career-long achievement. Thrillers like Speed, A Time To Kill ,Murder By Numbers and Crash served her well, but Bullock's legion of loyal fans have really followed her quality comedies and dramas - from While You Were Sleeping to Hope Floats, Practical Magic, 28 Days, Two Weeks Notice and The Proposal. Theater favorite: Sandra Bullock has built up an impressive and loyal following over a career spanning almost 30 years. Here she is pictured in 2013's Gravity (left) and Speed in in 1994 (right) Old faithful: Bullock made her name - and continues to - by appearing in feel-good romantic comedies, such as Hope Floats with Harry Connick Jr. in 1998. In it Bullock plays a housewife who moves back to the small town she is from following the collapse of her marriage . 2. Leonardo DiCaprio . For a young guy who started out doing TV ads for Bubble Yum chewing gum in the 1990s, DiCaprio is now 40 and a bona fide movie star. While 1997's Titanic is still ranked as the second highest-grossing film of all time (after Avatar), taking $2.18 billion, he has appeared in some of the largest films of the last 15 years, including Inception, Django Unchained, The Departed, Catch Me If You Can, The Aviator and, most recently, The Wolf Of Wall St. According to The Richest, his films have grossed an astounding $2.3 billion. Mr blockbuster: Leonardo DiCaprio asked for $25 million up front to appear as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf Of Wall Street (left), according to reports. His is pictured out and about in New York in September 2014 (right) 3. Matt Damon . He is perhaps best-known for the Bourne spy series, which spawned three films from 2002. And, despite a shaky return once the series wrapped up, with the disappointing performances of The Adjustment Bureau, Margaret, Invictus, Green Zone, We Bought a Zoo and Promised Land, Damon showed once more he is a leading man when not playing Jason Bourne. End-of-the-world blockbuster Elysium became a big movie for Sony in 2013, not just for its global takings of $286 million, but for being an original screenplay - a follow-up to Neill Blomkamp's sleeper hit District 9 - and not an adaptation. However the big money will come in 2016, when he reprises his role as Bourne. Leading man: Matt Damon - pictured left with his wife Luciana Barroso - made a big comeback in 2013 with sci-fi hit Elysium (right) 4. Robert Downey Jr. This comeback king put a shocking bout of arrests, rehab and prison behind him when he played unconventional superhero Tony Stark in 2008's Iron Man. He followed it up in 2009 by appearing as the title role in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, and then its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows, in 2011. Iron Man 2 proved another major hit in 2010, and then the character appeared in The Avengers in 2012, before Iron Man 3 broke office records in 2013, collecting $1.2 billion. Downey Jr. now has an estimated net worth of $190 million, and is said to be on the best pay packet of all the actors who are signed on to The Avenger's. Comeback king: Robert Downey Jr. has played Iron Man in three installments, plus The Avengers franchise, all of which has a big pay pack . 5. Angelina Jolie . She won an Oscar for playing a disturbingly violent inmate of a female mental institution in 1999's Girl, Interrupted, before going to refashion herself as a leading action star, with roles in Gone In 60 Seconds, Tomb Raider, Mr and Mrs Smith, The Wanted and Salt. While her most recent film, Unbroken, featured her as director, the Disney live-action flick Maleficent became the fourth highest-grossing film of 2014, taking $758 million. The actress was paid a reported $15 million for the Sleeping Beauty remake, and is set to make $20 million for the Salt sequel. Regardless of the film, if Jolie is in it, audiences will go see it. Action star: While last year's Maleficent was a big box office hit, Jolie is expected to collect $20 for the Salt sequel . 6. Denzel Washington . Two-time Academy Award nominee Denzel Washington has a career that is as diverse as it is spread out. From Muslim minister and human rights activist Malcolm X in 1992, to boxer Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter The Hurricane and football coach Herman Boone in Remember the Titans, he moved into a series of action roles, including Training Day, Man On Fire and American Gangster. But his portrayed of an alcoholic but brilliant commerical pilot who prevents a catastrophic plane crash in Flight is the most memorable of late. Washington is believed to have been paid $20 million - $10 million more than co-star Mark Wahlberg - for the 2013 film 2 Guns. According to The Hollywood Reporter survey, however, there is a separate list of actors who are not far behind this list. The second group are said to be able to command $15 million each per picture. In order, that list goes Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Dwayne Johnson, Jennifer Lawrence, Melissa McCarthy and Channing Tatum. The $15 million club: The recent survey said these six are Hollywood's next-in-line for huge pay packets. In order, that list goes Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Dwayne Johnson, Jennifer Lawrence, Melissa McCarthy and Channing Tatum .","New  survey reveals there are six actors in Hollywood who can ask for $20 million per movie .
Number one on the list is Sandra Bullock, with Angelina Jolie the only other female at number five .

"That's me and 'Daddy.' Karl Lagerfeld and Choupette . Her trademark hair is thick, glossy and silky smooth. Her sapphire blue eyes are piercing and stare icily ahead making little effort to disguise the contempt she feels for all before her. The lady in question is Choupette, the moody French sensation taking the modelling world by storm and who, last year, clawed in over £2 million in fees, outstripping the earnings of bushy-eyebrowed supermodel-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne. Designer Karl Lagerfeld says: ‘She is the centre of the world, when you see her you understand. She is kind of Greta Garbo. It’s the way she moves, the way she plays. There’s something unforgettable about her. She is an inspiration for elegance.’ But this starlet who has bewitched the creative director of fashion house Chanel is no leggy clothes horse, in fact her legs — all four of them — are on the short side. For Choupette is a three-year-old Birman cat and the pride, joy, and slightly disturbing obsession, of Lagerfeld — or ‘Daddy’ as he calls himself when talking to his pet. Choupette is so famous she has notched up over 100,000 followers on Twitter and Instagram, boasts a Wikipedia entry and doesn’t get out of her bed for less than a million quid. Her earnings came from just two jobs, one for Japanese cosmetics company Shu Uemura to whom she lent her name for a special capsule collection. The other was posing for German car brand Opel. In keeping with her first-class pedigree, Choupette would never promote cheap brands. ‘I don’t allow it, she’s far too sophisticated for that,’ sneers the pony-tailed Lagerfeld, who admits to being in love with his feline muse. ‘There is no marriage allowed between humans and animals,’ he said regretfully in an interview recently. ‘I never thought I would fall in love with a cat.’ Choupette and the Chanel chief are rarely apart, living, eating and sleeping together with their respective entourages trailing in their wake. Yes, Choupette has her own six-strong team at her beck and call whether they’re catering for her very faddy diet, stocking up on her favourite beauty products or just tickling her furry tummy. While most moggies start their day with a tin of supermarket pet food, Choupette’s tastes are a little more refined. She’s not so much the cat who got the cream as the cat who got the bespoke mineral water, specially blended for her using a cocktail of Swiss, Swedish, British and German water by Le Water Bar Colette in Paris. Let me eat cake - as that other famous French glamour puss, Marie Antoinette, almost said . I travel in style and I refuse to go anywhere unless it's in this £1,660 Louis Vuitton pet carrier . She doesn’t demean herself by eating her food from the floor but dines perched on the table beside her Daddy. When it comes to her diet she laughs in the face of Whiskas and Felix. All her food is prepared by her personal chef Patrice who creates several dishes at a time including liver pate, chicken and asparagus and fresh fish. All morsels are served in her favourite silver dishes made for her by French luxury goods company Goyard. When not dining at home Choupette likes to eat in some of the finest eateries. Restaurants in Paris aren’t exactly known for welcoming humans with open arms, let alone animals, but when you’re a superstar like Choupette, escorted by the head of France’s most iconic fashion house, then no maitre d’ is going to tell you to ‘casse toi’ (get lost). Flicking through the apps on my iPad keeps me entertained on my private jet, before a little catnap on the pilot's lap . The famous La Voltaire retaurant on the banks of the Seine will prepare a special ‘Choupette’s Eggs’ dish for their fussy feline diner, a concotion of chopped boiled eggs infused with fresh mint. Over at Cafe De Flore they offer Croquettes a la Choupette (potato croquettes with minced beef). The one thing her personal vet Madame Horn has put her foot down about, however, is her penchant for beluga caviar. No, it’s not the extortionate price (as if), rather the fact it’s far too high in salt and fat. Besides, a girl needs to watch her weight and Choupette likes to stay at a trim 7lb 11oz. Perhaps the extraordinary thing about Choupette is that, strictly speaking, she was stolen — catnapped — by Lagerfeld who was only meant to look after her for her a fortnight as a favour to her original owner, French model Baptiste Giabiconi. When Baptiste returned from his skiing trip he was told that Karl had taken such a shine to his kitty that he wouldn’t be handing her back. Given that Baptiste was the male face of Chanel, he was hardly going to argue with the boss. I told my Twitter followers: 'The French don't need to bathe so much, that's what perfume is for, oui? Lagerfeld perfume, naturally . This is me promoting Opel cars. It was exhausting work but I must say the money was rather good . Since then Choupette has published an autobiography — a glossy 128-page coffee table affair called The Private Life of A High-Flying Fashion Cat in which her two personal maids Francoise and Marjorie (one for day, one for night, darling) regale us with details of her fabulous life. It was in the book that we learned Choupette (who Lagerfeld claims: ‘is like a woman spoiled to death’) travels everywhere by private jet. She likes to curl up in the lap of the pilot for the duration of the flight or (I kid you not) entertain herself flicking through pages on her personal iPad. Choupette likes to summer in Provence and splits the rest of the time between Paris, New York and Monte Carlo. She’s backstage when her Daddy exhibits his new collections but snubs the after-show bashes. ‘She’s not a party animal,’ says Lagerfeld. ‘She likes her sleep.’ And, just like Daddy, Choupette hates to be around children. It’s the job of maids to pack her custom-made Louis Vuitton trunks for her trips away and be sure to include her array of beauty and grooming products, including eye drops and brushes and oils for her fur which is combed every day — no fur balls. With so much effort put into her looks, it’s no wonder Choupette has already graced the cover of Vogue on two occasions. In December 2014 she featured on the front of Brazilian Vogue in the arms of model Gisele Bundchen and, back in July 2013, she snuggled up to Linda Evangelista on the cover of German Vogue. This is the bed I share with my fashion designer 'Daddy.' We both love antique French lace .

"Mbaeri, of Hamilton Court, Ashby Place, Portsmouth, denies fraud by abuse of position and conspiracy to commit fraud . A Nationwide branch manager conned elderly customers out of their life savings by setting up bogus standing orders for hundreds of thousands of pounds. Hugo Mbaeri, 25, from Portsmouth allegedly handed over customer names, account details and signatures to a gang of fraudsters while he was working at Nationwide Building Society, a court heard. The alleged ringleader of the scheme, Olawabiyi Ayanwale, who is not before the court, set up standing orders by impersonating the victims, it is said. Mbaeri is on trial for fraud by abuse of position and conspiracy to commit fraud at the Old Bailey. He is in the dock alongside seven others who are accused of using their accounts to siphon the funds away. Abiola Balogun, 22, Gideon Boateng, 19, Tevin Campbell, 20, Joshua Clark, 20, Rebecca Jack, 21, Patrick Reddington, 20, and Christiana Tella, 19, were allegedly paid around £300 each for letting the fraudsters use their bank accounts. Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay described the scam as a ‘nasty little fraud’ that ‘deliberately targeted elderly people with the aim of clearing them out of their life savings’. ‘Hugo Mbaeri is the inside man in this fraud and the remaining defendants in the dock allowed their accounts to be used for the stolen money to be passed through. ‘It wasn’t a particularly sophisticated fraud but it’s a fraud which, were it not detected, would have netted the fraudsters hundreds of thousands of pounds and caused a loss in life savings to the victims. ‘The set-up was quite straight forward - standing orders were set up from these elderly people’s accounts to withdraw money. That’s it, it’s as simple as that. Mbaeri used the bank’s computer system to access nine customers’ details and signatures which he sold on to the fraudsters, the court was told. He worked as a cashier at the Fareham branch in Hampshire until February 2013 when he was promoted to branch manager in Gosport, Hampshire. The fraud was allegedly carried out from May 2012 to May 2013 and many of the victims were elderly or vulnerable, four were in their 80s and another three were over 65. ‘We say Mr Mbaeri looked up those people’s details for a dishonest purpose, not because they came into the branch or were making a genuine enquiry,’ Mr Polnay said. Mbaeri is on trial for fraud by abuse of position and conspiracy to commit fraud at the Old Bailey (pictured). He is in the dock alongside seven others who are accused of using their accounts to siphon the funds away. ‘They were older people, it’s not just a random nine accounts.’ He added: ‘The records show Mr Mbaeri and not anybody else was the one person who accessed all the signature details for all the people who were victims of the fraud. ‘The information was used to set up false standing orders by impersonating those people. ‘Undoubtedly there were other people involved in the fraud as well who recruited people to allow their accounts to be used in the fraud. ‘There was an agreement to impersonate Nationwide customers, Olawabiyi Ayanwale was the ringleader and a part of that plan was Mr Mbaeri. ‘He agreed that the signatures and details he obtained would be put to that use.’ Standing orders for around £2,500 were set up from each of the victims’ accounts, the court was told. The money was siphoned through the holding accounts before it was withdrawn in cash. Korrine Bright, 23, of Sydenham Hill, Lewisham, South East London, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and will be sentenced at the end of the trial. Mbaeri, of Hamilton Court, Ashby Place, Portsmouth, denies fraud by abuse of position and conspiracy to commit fraud. His seven co-defendants also deny the charges against them of aiding and abetting fraud. The trial continues.

"China is creating a 'great wall of sand' in the South China Sea, the US Navy has said. The latest huge land mass is 1.5 square miles (four square kilometres) in size and was created by dumping sand on live coral reefs, possibly damaging local ecosystems. But this is just one of several artificial islands China has been creating in the region - and the exact purpose of them is unknown. China is creating a 'great wall of sand' in the South China Sea, the US Navy has claimed. Five islands have already been made, with two more in development. This image shows the Johnson Reef on 25 February 2014, which has seen land added drastically over the last three years. A Chinese vessel is seen at the top . The large expanses of sand and concrete - the latest being Johnson Reef - are being built among the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. China is creating the area by using dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea, and then dumping it on subermeged coral reefs to make islands, Ethan Rosen - a geopolitical researcher in China - explained. And experts have told MailOnline that the activities could be hugely damaging to local ecosystems. China has supposedly been carrying out the land reclamation in order to build airstrips and other structures in the region. Five islands in total have been built in this way, and two more are in development. Richard Dodge of the Nova Southeastern University Oceanographic Center, said: 'The activities described would appear to clearly both be greatly exceeding corals and coral reefs’ ability to cope and survive the excess sediments and turbidity.' He said that as the reefs were being covered by cement and landfill, this constituted 'outright destruction' of the buried coral reefs and associated habitats. 'Coral reefs are extremely globally and locally valuable both for the biodiversity and ecosystem they create but also for the tremendous services they provide in terms of food supply, cultural heritage, erosion prevention, recreation, tourism, and habitat for myriad other organisms,' he continued. 'Coral reefs worldwide are under extreme threat from changing climate and from local sources of land based pollution, over fishing, and coastal construction. 'The activities described would appear to represent an additional and severe threat to coral reef ecosystem health and sustainability.' Robert Nicholls, a Professor of Coastal Engineering at the University of Southampton, added: 'It is clearly destroying [coral reefs] at the local scale of the land claim and the environment. 'In the bigger scheme of things it is harder to be precise as these are small areas in a large area of reef.' Experts have told MailOnline that the activities could be hugely damaging to local ecosystems. China has supposedly been carrying out the land reclamation in order to build airstrips and other structures in the region. The extent of how much damage is being done is seen in this image . This photo released by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, shows what the Johnson Reef looked like on 28 February 2013. A Chinese-made structure stands on the Johnson Reef, called Mabini by the Philippines and Chigua by China, in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea . This photo, taken on 13 March 2012, shows what the Johnson Reef looked like before China started to build there. The Philippines has protested China's reclamation of land in the disputed reef in the South China Sea that can be used to build an airstrip or an offshore military base in the increasingly volatile region . Yesterday, the commander of the US Pacific Fleet - Admiral Harry Harris Jr - warned that the constructions were 'increasing regional tensions and the potential for miscalculation.' 'China is building artificial land by pumping sand on to live coral reefs - some of them submerged - and paving over them with concrete. China has now created over 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) of artificial landmass,' he said. Harris said the region is known for its beautiful natural islands, but 'in sharp contrast, China is creating a great wall of sand with dredges and bulldozers over the course of months.' China claims virtually all of the South China Sea, but the Philippines and other countries which have territorial disputes with China in the busy sea have been particularly concerned by the land reclamation projects. These have turned a number of previously submerged reefs in the Spratlys archipelago into artificial islands with buildings, runways and wharves. The islands could be used for military and other facilities to bolster China's territorial claims. The dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels. Several south Asian countries stake claim to the territory, though China tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago. Beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which, they say, includes the islands in Chinese history. Taiwan supports its claim, and has its own airfield on the island of Taiping. Vietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the Philippines, the closest geographically, says the islands belong to them. In 1974, Chinese forces seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing 70 troops. There were further clashes between the two countries in 1988, with 60 Vietnamese soldiers killed. In 2012 China and the Philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a Scarborough Shoal. The Filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call Panatag. Upon boarding a Chinese military vessel for inspection, officials claimed they found live sharks, clams and illegal reef. Later, Vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting Chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in January it was claimed China would be taken to a UN tribunal to challenge its stake. China is creating the area by using dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea, and then dump it on subermeged reefs to make islands, Ethan Rosen - a geopolitical researcher in China - explained. Shown is an image of a dredging vessel in San Francisco, demonstrating how land can be moved from underwater . Harris said the pace of China's construction of artificial islands 'raises serious questions about Chinese intentions.' He said the US continues to urge all claimants to conform to the 2002 China-ASEAN Declaration of Conduct, in which the parties committed to 'exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability.' 'How China proceeds will be a key indicator of whether the region is heading toward confrontation or cooperation,' he said. The US says it has a national interest in the peaceful resolution of the disputes in a region crucial for world trade. China says its territorial claims have a historical basis and objects to what it considers US meddling.","China is building artificial islands on coral reefs in the South China Sea .

"Crime and punishment: Erica Ginnetti, 35, has been sentenced to 30 days, house arrest and probation for having sex with a 17-year-old student . A disgraced Pennsylvania math teacher has been sentenced to 30 days in jail, house arrest and probation for having sex with a 17-year-old student and sending him X-rated photos. Erica Ann Ginneti, 35, a married mother of three from Philadelphia, pleaded guilty in December to institutional sexual assault and disseminating sexually explicit materials to a minor. The former math and calculus teacher at Lower Moreland Township School District had been facing seven to 14 years in prison, but on Friday Judge Garrett Page sentenced her to 3-23 months, including the first 30 days in jail and the next 60 on house arrest. She also faces three years’ probation, 100 hours of community service and will have to register as a sex offender for the next 25 years, according to The Intelligencer. Ginneti’s jail terms begins April 10. In court Friday, Mrs Ginneti wept as she read a letter of apology in hopes of offering the victim 'closure for this nightmare.' Prosecutors said the boy had seen his grades drop in his senior year and has been struggling with social interactions. The former educator described for the court how she has reconciled with her family and embarked on a new career as a fitness instructor. In her time off, she volunteers at a church, reported Philadelphia Inquirer. Judge Garrett Page told Ginneti he was certain she would continue to turn her life around, but he reminded her that her ill-thought actions had had devastating consequences. 'One bad day because of sexual hunger has resulted in all this avalanche of harm,' Page stated. He also chastised her for sending her male student explicit photos and videos of herself, which he likened to ‘dangling candy’ in front of the boy. The judge later clarified that he does not think the defendant is a 'bad human being,' but stated she must be punished for her ‘bad act.’ Ginnetti, pictured above with her husband, first approached her victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym . Ginneti's attorney asked the judge to spare her jail time so she could care for her small children. She was fired by Lower Moreland Township School District after her arrest in January. According to investigators, the math and calculus teacher first approached the victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym. A few days later the 17-year-old responded to Ginnetti with a text message, and the two began communicating on a daily basis. The criminal complaint against Ginnetti says that over the next several months, she sent the minor sexually explicit text messages, photos depicting her wearing bikini, a thong and other underwear, and videos showing the woman undressing suggestively and performing a sexual act on herself, according to The Bucks County Courier Times. According to officials, the illicit relationship culminated in July 2013 when Ginnetti and the student met for coffee in Starbucks and then drove to an industrial park to have sex in her car. She then allegedly dropped her paramour back at the coffee shop and told him not to tell anyone about the encounter. Authorities say the investigation began after they received a tip-off that students had been overheard discussing X-rated pictures showing a minor and Ginnetti doing 'sexual things.' When police questioned the 17-year-old boy, he came clean about the affair and Ginnetti then also confessed to having a relationship with the student, police said. Watch the full report on CBS Philly here. Two months after Ginnetti first met her 17-year-old victim at his prom in May 2013 they drove to an industrial park and had sex in her car . The 35-year-old, pictured above after her arrest in January 2014, will have to perform community service and register as a sex offender . ‘I would say that she treated her relationship with this student as she would have treated a relationship with an adult with whom she was involved,’ Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman told The Mercury News in January. Police said they found several texts the lovers had exchanged discussing their July outing and one mentioning ‘a used condom that had been left in Ginnetti’s vehicle,’ according to the criminal complaint. On the night of the alleged tryst, after he returned home, the student told police he got a text from Ginnetti asking him to ‘do it again.’ As part of her $50,000 bail condition in January, Ginnetti was forbidden from having unsupervised contact with any minors except for her own children, ages 8, 11 and 14. She also had to surrender her passport, and the authorities have been keeping track of her using a GPS device.

"Labour were left embarrassed tonight after it was forced to remove a signatory to a letter of support after she was exposed as a benefit cheat who had swindled nearly £30,000. Campaign chiefs attempted to rebuff a letter from 100 business leaders that criticised the party by publishing its own message calling for a Labour government signed by people ‘from all walks of life’. The signatories, who said they were ‘all working people’, warned about the ‘proliferation of zero-hours contracts’ they claimed were ‘letting down Britain’ and showed that ‘we need a Labour Government to put working people first’. Labour attempted to rebuff a letter from 100 business leaders that criticised the party by publishing its own message calling for a Labour government signed by people ‘from all walks of life’ But within hours the plan was in chaos as it was found the signatories included a benefit fraudster, trade unionists and the cigar-smoking children of millionaires. One of the signatories identified herself as someone who had ‘worked on [a] zero hours contract’, but Labour removed her name yesterday after it was revealed she had been convicted of benefit fraud in 2012. A court in Manchester heard that the woman moved to Britain after she had a ‘marriage of convenience’ in Nigeria in December 2007. According to tax officials she lived with her ‘husband’, who was the holder of a British passport, ‘briefly or not at all’. She was not entitled to benefits as she was subject to ‘immigration control’, but she submitted a tax credits application and a child benefit claim for three children, two of whom didn’t live with her. The court heard that she moved in with a new partner but claimed £27,888 tax credits in two and a half years as a single person. David Cameron, visiting pupils during his visit to King's Leadership Academy in Warrington today, hailed the business letter in support of the Tories . She was caught after she applied for leave to remain in Britain on the basis of her ‘marriage’. Officers found that she had been fraudulently claiming benefits and had allowed others to use her name and national insurance number to work illegally in the UK. In July 2012 she was given a two year suspended jail sentence and a 150-hour community work order after she pleaded guilty to immigration and fraud charges along with her ‘husband’ who had been working at HMRC as a security officer. A Labour spokesman last night said: ‘More than 6,000 people have now signed our letter from all walks of life across the country. Former Red or Dead boss Wayne Hemingway was among the signatories . ‘Of course we were unaware of the background of this person. The fact still remains that the epidemic of zero hours contracts are a symbol of the failure of this Government's economic plan.’ Other signatories included 21-year-old Manchester University students John-Jo Pierce and Rory Somerville. The pair said they were both working on zero hours contracts but their Facebook pages included photographs of them smoking cigars whilst dressed in black tie. Mr Pierce, who is studying maths, is registered on the electoral roll at his parents’ £1million house in woodland near Leatherhead, Surrey. His mother Deirdre, 55, yesterday said that he was ‘just a kid’ who ‘knows nothing about politics’ but had signed the letter after he was asked to by a fellow university student ‘he vaguely knows’. She told the Mail: ‘All he did was sign a petition that somebody called Andrea asked everybody to sign. He knows a little but not much. It’s the first time he’s been interested in an election.’ She declined to discuss what work he was doing on a zero hours contract. Mr Somerville, who is in his final year studying economics, is register to vote at his mother's house in an affluent area of Belfast. Mr Pierce was also photographed at a party in front of a sign that said ‘Drugz Room’, but Mrs Pierce said that it was just a ‘joke’ sign that was a reference to the U.S. television programme Breaking Bad. She said: ‘John-Jo has never done drugs in his life. It’s a joke about Breaking Bad. That’s what people of that age do. They all make jokes about Breaking Bad.’ Mr Somerville did not respond to a request to comment.","Signatory to letter backing Labour was given suspended sentence .

A man who met the pair while collecting scrap metal said they may have lived in a homeless camp, ABC 11 reported. James Thompson said: 'The last encounter I had with the man and woman was they had a grocery cart and they had a few items in it. 'They asked me would I use my truck to go over there because crossing the railroad tracks was so bad, and so hard with the cart. After the accident occurred, the train was delayed for almost three hours before continuing on its way . 'They'll come up to me and want me to give them a little something. 'When you see a person that's in dire straits, be kind to them. 'Don't condemn them. They've got a heart.' Durham is located about 25 miles northwest of the train's next destination, Raleigh. The trip from Charlotte to New York City usually takes about 13 hours and 30 minutes.","Accident happened just before 10am on Sunday in Durham, North Carolina .

"These shocking photographs show the bed where a severely disabled boy was left to sleep for seven nights in hospital. They show two mattresses squeezed together on the cramped hospital floor, with wires from an oxygen tank and tubes dangling across the room. Cody Neatis, from Preston, was admitted to Royal Preston Hospital last Thursday with a chest infection. But rather than a bed in the children's ward, has had to sleep on a mattress on the floor since arriving. The eight-year-old - who has Down's syndrome, epilepsy, autism and is fed by a tube - has been without a hospital bed because staff do not have the special cot he needs to keep him safe in his sleep. Cody Neatis, eight, has been in hospital for a week with a chest infection but has had to sleep on a mattress on the floor as the hospital doesn't have a suitable bed for him to sleep in . Cody has Down's syndrome, epilepsy, autism and is fed by a tube. The hospital does not have the specialist high-sided cot he must sleep in, to prevent him from injuring himself in the night . Cody's mother, Lynne Neatis, 48, has had to sleep with Cody - who has a developmental age of 12 months - on the mattress. She watches him sleep in case he pulls out his oxygen or hurts himself in the night . His mother, Lynne, 48, has slept on the floor alongside him for the past week. She fears her son - who has a developmental age of around 12 months - will injure himself or pull out his oxygen. She is now demanding answers from the local health trust as she claims she has waited two years for the high-sided bed needed for Cody and other disabled children. The mother-of-six said: 'Cody was admitted to hospital last Thursday and we were told there was no special needs bed for him. 'This situation has been ongoing  for years with this hospital and I don't understand why they still don't have a suitable bed. 'We had to stay in for nine days in August 2013, I complained about it then and was told that the ward was getting a special needs bed. 'So I fully expected them to have it this time, but there is still nothing.' She added: 'They have baby cots and single beds with side rails, but they aren't safe as Cody rolls around so much in his sleep and is restless all night long. 'I have to sleep on the floor with him and I have had to fight for a nurse or health care assistant to be with us during the night to watch him too as I can't stay awake for 24 hours. 'It has been a very stressful and exhausting time.' Cody's father Stephen Neatis, 45, said he 'cannot believe' his family are forced to sleep on the floor during their stay in hospital . Cody's mother says she has been battling the hospital for a special bed ever since Cody was forced to stay there two years ago in 2013 . While Mrs Neatis is furious at the lack of provisions for disabled children, the hospital trust insists it has ordered a suitable bed from America and is waiting for it to arrive. Karen Partington, chief executive at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said other sleeping arrangements had been offered, but the family had agreed a mattress on the floor would be the safest option at this point. She added: 'We offered Mum the options of a traditional bed plus 1:1 nursing staff and we also brought in a special bed again with 1:1 nursing. 'We believe we have appropriate beds available to meet the needs of Cody along with appropriate nursing support. 'However based on the options available her preference was for Cody to have a mattress on the floor.' Mrs Neatis and husband Stephen, 45, are full time carers not only to Cody, but his brother Dexter, seven, who is also disabled and has autism and ADHD. Cody has to be tube fed and cannot be left unattended. At home he sleeps in a specialist bed which cost more the family more than £3,000. Mr Neatis said he cannot believe his family are forced to sleep on the floor during a stay in hospital. Cody, pictured here with his father, has to be tube fed and can't be left unattended. At home he sleeps in a specialist bed which cost more the family more than £3,000. Mrs Neatis says she has had to ask for staff to come and help her watch Cody sleep, as she can't stay awake 24 hours a day . He said: 'I just can't believe that there is nothing to cater for him, or that they wouldn't try to at least get something for him during the stay. 'I got a call from Lynne and she is having to stay with him on the floor. 'We have one of the special needs beds at home and I saw the two guys assemble it, it took half an hour so it wouldn't be a big job to move one. There must be one somewhere.' Mrs Neatis threatened to take Cody home after finding out the sleeping arrangements but his oxygen levels fall dangerously low when he is taken off the ventilator so he cannot be discharged. She said she was told the hospital did get a special bed and used it on a trial basis, but it proved unsatisfactory. She said: 'When they came up with the idea of sleeping on a mattress on the floor I told them I would take him home as we had a bed there but his oxygen levels were too low. 'I told staff he needs someone to watch him all night long but they made me feel like I was being awkward and said they had no staff to do that. 'I took the photo of Cody and the floor and sent it to my friend who tweeted it and that night we had a nurse, and for the next two nights we had a health care assistant, they were great. Mrs Neatis said when she first heard about the sleeping arrangements at the hospital, she said she would take Cody home. But his oxygen levels were so low that he couldn't be discharged . Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, who run Royal Preston Hospital, say they have ordered a special bed from America and are waiting for it to arrive . The chief executive came to see me and she was really nice. 'But on the fourth night they said there was a staff shortage again so I threatened to take him home - I took his oxygen out but they insisted we stay, and someone did come to watch him. 'Other hospitals have these beds and special needs children are admitted to hospital more often than other children so I don't understand why it's so difficult here. The bed wouldn't be left unused, she claims. She said: 'I know of other parents who have had the same problem and have brought their own special needs beds with them from home.' A spokesperson for the trust told MailOnline that a specialist bed from America was due to arrive in February, but the delivery was delayed. Chief executive Ms Partington added: 'Our priority is to always provide excellent care with compassion for our patients and we have had several discussions with Cody's family regarding his care. 'We are awaiting delivery of a specialist bed from America and we have discussed a number of alternatives with Cody's family, which have been declined.' 'Clearly when making these decisions regarding the care of children we believe it is important to do so in collaboration with parents. We continue to work with her to find a solution that meets Cody's needs and his mum's preferences.'","Cody Neatis, 8, has Down's syndrome, epilepsy and autism and is tube-fed .

"Two states at the center of gay rights protests over laws designed to 'uphold religious freedom' are engaging in hurried climbdowns today, with both moving to alter legislation that critics say legalizes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Indiana lawmakers unveiled this morning an amendment its already-in-effect law clarifying that no one will 'be able to discriminate against anyone at any time.' The Arkansas legislature was also poised to pass changes to its legislation after the state's Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson rejected its bill at the last minute on Wednesday following public uproar and a personal plea from his son. The two, GOP-controlled states were in a frenzy to quell national outrage over legislation meant to satisfy evangelicals who do not believe they should be compelled by the government to provide goods and services to certain customers if doing so would violate their religious convictions. The moves had the direct effect of upsetting gay and lesbian individuals, however, and incited massive protests. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma speaks at a press conference announcing changes to the state's religious freedom law as Senate President Pro Tem David Long, left, looks on. The GOP leaders said today that they would add anti-discrimination safeguard sto the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act . Opponents of an Arkansas religious objection measure chant 'We Are Arkansas' as they face the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Wednesday. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson earlier Wednesday said he wants the legislature to either recall the bill from his desk or pass a follow-up measure that would make the proposal more closely mirror a 1993 federal religious-freedom law . UNDER FIRE: Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Tuesday that he'd support changes to his state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act that clarifying that it doesn't legalize discrimination. After gay rights activists, sympathetic businesses and celebrities thrust the measures into the national spotlight, both states found themselves in the cross-hairs, and even Republican lawmakers began to distance themselves from the laws as written. Republican leaders in the Hoosier State conceded this week to critics arguing that their state's law, signed into effect by Governor Mike Pence a week ago today, inadvertently left room for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 'It was never intended to discriminate against anyone,' Indiana Senate President Pro Tem David Long said this morning at a press conference. Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma, standing alongside Long, said, 'Hoosier hospitality had to be restored.' In addition to the already protected classes of persons, the new language specifies that businesses, individuals and other 'providers' cannot refuse to do business with the basis of their sexual orientation. Exempted from the new rules, however, are churches and non-profit religious organizations, including schools, according to the Indianapolis Star, which received an early look at the draft language. After adamantly defending the state's law in the national press, Pence suddenly said Tuesday that 'it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone.' The 180 earned him the mocking of the White House, which described him as a 'previously defiant governor' who changed his position after a 'bipartisan and even nonpolitical outcry.' Demonstrators hold signs on the steps of the Arkansas state Capitol thanking Hutchinson for calling for changes to the religious freedom measure. A new version of Arkansas' law is now making its way through the statehouse. The altered bill would more closely mirror federal legislation . A new version of Arkansas' law that is making its way through the statehouse would more closely mirror federal legislation. The fixes passed the state's Senate last night and will now be considered in the House. Hutchinson on Wednesday had requested the legislative changes, saying he could not sign the bill until they were made. 'How do we as a state communicate to the world that we are respectful of a diverse workplace and we want to be known as a state that does not discriminate but understands tolerance?' he said during a press conference outside the state Capitol. 'That is the challenge we face. Making this law like the federal law will aid us in that effort in communication, but also was my original objective from the beginning.' Conservative lawmakers said they didn't appreciate the slap in the face from Hutchinson, who had said numerous times in the past that he would approve the legislation in its current form when it reached his desk, but they worked to make the necessary adjustments just the same. 'I don't feel it was right for the governor to say he was going to sign something that he watched all the way through and didn't sign,' state senator Terry Rice told Arkansas Online. 'I know things come up at the last minute but now we have hodgepodged some bills together.' That sentiment was shared by Arkansas Family Council, a group that favors the law and pushed to get it passed. 'I'm very puzzled at this point to see why the bill would need to be amended at this late date, considering everybody in the chamber has had a chance to see it,' Jerry Cox, the group's leader, said. 'I think it's been thoroughly vetted, and it's a good law.' A family-owned pizzeria in Indiana that said it wouldn't cater same-sex weddings shut down until further notice on Wednesday after the owners received threatening phone calls, and the establishment's YELP page was flooded with bad reviews . Indiana, the first of the two states to pass the offending religious liberty legislation, saw a fierce backlash over the weekend and early this week that included thousands of protesters descending on the state Capitol and a prominent local business cancelling a planned $40 million expansion of its headquarters after Pence formally approved the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Hutchinson, who took office just two months ago, undoubtedly wanted to avoid an uprising of equal intensity in his own state. The Arkansas-based retail corporation Wal-Mart publicly lobbied the Republican politician not to approve the bill, labeling it as discriminatory. Meanwhile, in Indiana, a family-owned pizzeria, Memories, that said it wouldn't cater same-sex weddings shut down until further notice on Wednesday after the owners received threatening phone calls and the establishment's YELP page was flooded with bad reviews.","New text of Indiana bill states that no one will 'be able to discriminate against anyone at any time'

"As a young prisoner of war, he survived the brutality of the Nazi ‘death march’ across Europe. Now 96-year-old Robert Clark is engaged in a different sort of battle after a council refused to increase funding he needs for a live-in carer. It means the Second World War veteran could be forced out of his home of nearly 50 years and into a care home – a move his son describes as ‘like going back into a prisoner of war camp’. Scroll down for video . Public support: More than 127,000 people have backed a petition calling for Brent Council to pay for war veteran Robert Clark's home help . More than 127,000 people have signed a petition calling for Mr Clark to be allowed to stay in his house. But despite his war record, the council insists he cannot be treated as a special case. Yesterday his son Mike Clark, 58, who runs an executive coaching business, said: ‘He fought for the freedom of this country – without people like him Brent Council wouldn’t even exist. How can they treat him like this? It’s inhumane.’ His father was a gunner in the Durham Light Infantry when he was captured by the Nazis in the North African city of Tobruk in June 1942. He spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Poland, before being forced to join the ‘death march’ in 1945. Hitler ordered thousands of PoWs to march west for four months in extreme winter weather as the Russians advanced from the East. After the war, the soldier married his sweetheart Rita and worked as a carpenter. In 1969 the couple moved into the house where he still lives in Burnt Oak, north London. Mrs Clark died in 2010 aged 91. Now a great-great-grandfather and one of Britain’s oldest surviving PoWs, Mr Clark is registered blind, deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair. Writing home: Veteran Robert Clark, pictured in 1940, when he was serving with Durham Light Infantry . For the past two years he has used his £50,000 savings to pay towards a £960-a-week live-in carer, while Brent Council contributed £350 a week. But as his money runs out, the council is refusing to increase its funding and Mr Clark may have to go into a care home instead. His son, who said his home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is not suitable for the pensioner, added: ‘This is causing my father to be very anxious and he is unable to sleep. We have enough money to pay for around three more months of care but we have no idea what is going to happen after. We are not looking for a lot of money just for the council to do the right thing. ‘He’s as good as told me that if he has to move, he’ll just give up on life. Whenever he’s been in hospital, he … pulls the blankets over his head and stops talking. ‘He hates being anywhere which isn’t familiar … going into a care home will be like going back into a prisoner of war camp.’ Despite tens of thousands signing the petition to allow Mr Clark to stay in his own home, Brent Council said they will not increase their funding for a live-in carer. The council’s Phil Porter said: ‘We recognise Mr Clark’s contribution to this country and sincerely empathise with the situation that he and other older people … are in. ‘However … the care package that Mr Clark is choosing is not affordable to council taxpayers given the constraints of local government funding and the need to be consistent for the 2,900 people we support.’ He added: ‘Mr Clark owns his home, so there is absolutely no question of Brent Council evicting him despite what has been suggested in this petition.’ Prisoner: Robert Clark (front row, second left) pictured on June 21, 1943 at prisoner of war camp Campo PG70 in Italy . The council said Mr Clark’s needs can be met in a care home for £451 a week. Alternatively, he could choose to receive the same weekly sum and stay at home, but would have to pay the extra amount necessary for a carer. Mr Porter said: ‘We want to find a solution which meets his eligible social care needs, provides value for money for the taxpayer, but also reflects the choices he has made and the additional cost this creates.’ He added that the council had offered ‘a deferred payment which means he doesn’t need to sell his house to pay for his care’. After signatures hit the 127,000 mark this morning, a spokeswoman said: 'Our position hasn't changed since the petition was at 75,000.' Mr Clark’s family reported the case to the Local Government Ombudsman, but the watchdog agreed with the council.

"They are the most recognisable shapes in the night sky, tracing distinctive patterns that have enabled astronomers to navigate the starscape above them for thousands of years. Yet for anyone staring at the heavens 98,000 year from now, the constellations could look very different indeed. Martin Vargic, a graphic designer from Slovakia, has created a chart that shows how the most famous of the constellations have changed from 50,000 BC to 100,000CE. Martin Vargic used satellite data to chart how the constellation stars have shifted and will change in the future . Using data collected by the European Space Agency on the gradually shifting position of stars, he has estimated how the constellations will change between. The results suggest that many of the most distinctive constellations will become almost unrecognisable in the future and some may need to be renamed entirely. Stars generate sounds on their surface in an unexpected way, according to new experimental evidence. Of course, as space is a vacuum it is impossible to hear sound in space, but the discovery reveals a new way that fluids can interact to produce a sound - one with an extremely high frequency. The researchers found that, when material - dust or gas from nearby - falls onto a star, it can produce an extremely high pitched sound in the plasma. The researchers said the phenomenon is 'more common in younger stars' that are still accumulating material from their surroundings. It would be less common in more mature stars, like our sun. The Big Dipper, for example, will change from looking like a plough to something that looks more like duck, while the proud form of Leo will mutate into an unrecognisable shape. Orion, named after the hunter in Greek mythology, will lose his head and the Crux will become little more than two parallel lines similar to an equals sign. Mr Vargic's chart also shows how some of the more abstract constellations, like Cassiopeia, were almost unrecognisable further back in human history when our ancestors were still living in caves. Lyra would also have faced completely the wrong way 52,000 years ago. Mr Vargic said: 'On a short timescale, stars appear to maintain nearly fixed positions in relation to each other, long term observations show that all stars indeed move and all constellations gradually change over time.' Astronomers have been recording the position of the stars since the Ancient Greeks, who believed the Earth was at the centre of the universe due to the apparent unchanging nature of the stars. This animation shows how the constellation Leo changed from 50,000BC to what it will look like in 100,000CE . The constellations were initially named after real life objects and mythical figures they appeared to represent and that tradition has continued. There are now 88 officially recognised constellations. In some cases ancient travelers used the constellations to help find their way at night. Now, using sophisticated observations from space telescopes like Hubble and the European Space Agency's Hipparcos satellite, scientists have been able to watch the movement of the stars. This has allowed astronomers to predict the position of the stars thousands of years into the future. Mr Vargic's chart shows how some of the constellations will become probably need to be renamed. From left to right the image above shows how they changed from 50,000BC, 2,000AD, 50,000CE and 100,000CE . This animation shows how Leo has changed since 50,000BC and how unrecognisable it will be in 100,000CE . Mr Vargic used data from the four year long Hipparcos satellite mission, which was launched in 1989, to collect data on the position of the stars. While there are some celestial objects that move across the sky quite regularly - such as the planets and the Moon - most of the stars vary little in relation to each other. Obviously their position in the sky changes as the Earth itself spins on its axis and moves around the Sun, the constellations have remained appeared constant through out human history. This animation show the changing face of the constellation Cassiopia from 50,000BC to 100,000CE . This animation shows how Orion's distinctive shape will change to become headless in the next 98,000 years . In fact many stars, including our own sun, are moving through space at thousands of miles per hour. However the vast distances between the Earth and the stars makes them appear static and those that are closer appear to move more. Dr Marek Kukula, public astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, said: 'In art and poetry the idea of the stars being fixed and eternal is a strong theme. 'However, we now know our solar system is moving through the Milky Way and other stars have their own particular paths. 'The constellations shapes already look a bid dodgy when trying to see the patterns in them, but in the future we may need to find some different names for them altogether.' The Big Dipper could eventually start to look more like the Big Duck over the next 98,000 years . This animation shows how the Crux will shift from being a distinct crucifix to two parallel lines by 100,000CE .","New charts show how the constellations will look 98,000 years in the future .

"There are few things more beautiful - or terrifying - than the menacing flash of lightning bolts within a volcanic ash cloud. The latests picture, captured by an amateur photographer as the Colima volcano in Mexico spews out a plume of ash and lava, reveals the raw power of a volcanic eruption. Hernando Rivera Cervantes took the pictures as local authorities warned those living around the volcano, which is also known as the Fire volcano, to prepare for a possible evacuation. Lightning strikes inside the enormous ash cloud thrown into the air by the Colima volcano (above) in Mexico . The 12,400 feet (3,800 metre) high volcano, which first erupted in 1576, is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico. Mr Cervantes spent eight hours watching the volcano as it threw ash up to 1.8 miles (three kilometres) into the atmosphere before managing to capture the rare picture. He said: 'I waited for eight hours, knowing something was going to happen. When the lightning arrived it was magical. An unforgettable experience.' These blots of lightning are thought to occur due to the build up of electric charge in the ash cloud as the particles rub against each other. Just like in a thunder cloud, this charge eventually builds up until it seeks a path through to the ground as lightning. This sequence of images captured by photographer Hernando Rivera Cervantes show the lightning flashes as the Colima volcano erupted . Mr Cervantes also managed to capture this night-time image above of lava spilling from the erupting volcano . Small volcanic eruptions over the past 20 years have been protecting the Earth from global warming, according to a recent study. Scientists have confirmed that droplets of sulphur-rich aerosols spewed into the upper atmosphere by volcanoes have been reflecting sunlight away from the Earth. Until recently it was thought that only particularly large eruptions had any noticeable affect on the climate. However, a study published earlier this year has confirmed results from the end of last year that showed these small eruptions can have an accumulative impact on global temperature. This could have helped decrease the global temperatures by between 0.05°C to 0.12°C over the past 15 years. Earlier this month scientists discovered that it is this lightning that is responsible for making the glass spheres that can appear in volcanic rocks. They found that the intense heat generated by the lightning bolts causes the ash to melt into spherules of smooth glass. A bolt of volcanic lighting can heat the surrounding air to more than 3,000°C, according to the researchers from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Dr Kimberly Genareau, a volcanologist at the University of Alabama, said their findings suggested that the role lightning plays in volcanic eruptions may be under reported. Writing in the journal Geology, she said: 'We refer to this new morphological classification of ash grains as lightning-induced volcanic spherules (LIVS). 'Observation of LIVS in tephras (volcanic rocks) will provide evidence of lightning occurrence during eruptions where lightning was not directly observed or documented.' The Colima volcano is actually one of three volcanic domes that make up the Colima Volcanic complex in the Mexican state of Colima, 301 miles west of Mexico City. It has erupted around 40 times since its first recorded activity in 1576. There are now around 300,000 people living in it shadow. The volcano has a history of large and explosive eruptions, which has meant it is also one of the most studied volcanoes in Mexico. Although lightning in volcanic ash clouds has been observed for a long time, scientists have only recently begun to understand what causes it. The Colima volcano is regarded as one of the most dangerous in Mexico due to its large explosive eruptions . Mr Cervantes (shown above) spent eight hours waiting to capture his stunning images of the Colima volcano . Getting close enough to an erupting volcano is dangerous, so scientists at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich recreated volcanic lightning in a lab. In 2013 they suspended volcanic ash gathered from sites around the world in a chamber filled with argon gas, forcing the concoction through a narrow tube. They found that the movement of ash particles against each other as they go from the compressed environment under the Earth's surface into the atmosphere during an eruption causes a built of up static charge. When the ash reaches the atmosphere, the energy is discharged as lightning bolts.","Lightning flash spotted in the ash cloud of the Colima Volcano which is 301 miles west of Mexico City .

"Church of England schools should stop selecting pupils on faith because it discriminates against the poor, a group of vicars has claimed. They say the system is open to abuse and many oversubscribed schools reject non-churchgoing families even though they may live nearby. Many Christian schools give priority to families who regularly attend services, a practice which they say preserves their faith ethos. Many Christian schools give priority to families who regularly attend services, a practice which they say preserves their faith ethos - but a group of vicars say it can lead to discrimination against the poor . But the clergymen said affluent parents were more likely to cheat the system by going to church just to get their children into a C of E school, which are often high-performing. In an open letter published yesterday, an alliance of Left-leaning clergy and laypeople called for an end to religious selection. They claimed the Church was being ‘turned to the advantage of those who are already advantaged’, and said it presented a ‘slow-burning crisis’. The comments, made in a letter to The Guardian, sparked anger from the Church of England, which labelled their arguments ‘doctrinaire’. The letter’s 20 signatories included Christina Baron, lay member of the General Synod, Barry Sheerman, Huddersfield Labour MP since 1979, and Theo Hobson, a theologian and religious commentator.

Also on the list were Reverend Una Kroll, a women’s equality campaigner, former teachers’ union president John Swallow and Oxford professor Keith Ward. Referring to a 2013 survey by the Sutton Trust, they said 6 per cent of parents with a child at a state-funded school admitted to attending church services in order to get their child into a Church school. They said the level of false Church attendance rose to 10 per cent among affluent parents in the socio-economic group A. The letter said: ‘On a superficial level this is in the Church’s interest, as attendance figures in many parishes are inflated and the standard of our schools boosted by the admittance of children from more affluent families. ‘Ultimately however the universality of the Church is being turned to the advantage of those who are already advantaged. We believe this issue presents a slow-burning crisis. ‘We urge the Church to review and then amend its national guidance on pupil admissions, so that schools are guided towards having open admission arrangements. ‘Church of England schools should look outwards, as an expression of the warmth and generosity of its mission to the whole community.’ Yesterday, a Church spokesman said: ‘The arguments set out in the letter are so flawed and inaccurate they need to be placed in special measures. 'The interpretation of the data cited is mistaken and the arguments doctrinaire.’ Rev Nigel Genders, the Church’s chief education officer, said the Church’s secondary schools have an average of 10 per cent selection by religious criteria and some have more pupils on free school meals than the national average. He continued: ‘We run Christian schools for everyone, providing an inclusive and effective education, we are not – as the article seems to imply – running schools for middle class Christians.’ Simon Calvert, of the Christian Institute, added: ‘There’s a push to try to secularise Church schools and it’s a shame that a group of liberal Anglicans are playing into that.’","Group of vicars say CoE schools should stop selecting pupils on faith .
Many Christian schools give priority to those who regularly attend church .
But vicars argue the system is open to abuse and oversubscribed schools may reject non-churchgoing families even though they may live nearby .
Clergymen said affluent parents were more likely to cheat the system by going to church just to get their children into a high-performing CoE school ."
"It is an astronomical nightmare - if an asteroid were spotted headed towards Earth, what could humanity do about it? The European Space Agency's latest mission hopes to find out if crashing into it will help. It is working with Nasa  to send a lander crashing into a small asteroid's moon at 14,000mph to see what happens . Scroll down for video . Impact! An artist's impression of what could happen when the craft hits the asteroid. Experts hope the impact will be large enough to alter its orbit. The mission will take place in two parts, and this month marked the start of preliminary design work on ESA's Asteroid Impact Mission, or AIM. Intended to demonstrate technologies for future deep-space missions, AIM will also be the Agency's very first investigation of planetary defence techniques. Launched in October 2020, AIM will travel to a binary asteroid system – the paired Didymos asteroids, which will come a comparatively close 11 million km to Earth in 2022. The 800 m-diameter main body is orbited by a 170 m moon, informally called 'Didymoon'. This smaller body is AIM's focus: the spacecraft will perform high-resolution visual, thermal and radar mapping of the moon to build detailed maps of its surface and interior structure. AIM will also put down a lander – ESA's first touchdown on a small body since Rosetta's Philae landed on a comet last November. Two or more CubeSats will also be dispatched from the mothership to gather other scientific data in the vicinity of the moon. AIM's findings will be returned by high-capacity laser link to ESA's Optical Ground Station on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. 'AIM should gather a rich scientific bounty – gaining valuable insights into the formation of our Solar System – but these activities will also set the stage for a historic event to come,. the space agency says. A similar collision was achieved back in 2005, when NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft shot a copper impactor into asteroid Tempel 1. But the Didymos moon is several tens of times smaller than Tempel 1, so much greater precision will be required to strike it – and the possibility of altering its orbit should be correspondingly higher. The Didymos moon is nearly three times larger than the body thought to have caused the 1908 Tunguska impact in Siberia, the largest impact in recorded history. An equivalent asteroid striking Earth would be well into the 'city-killer' class, leaving a crater of at least 2.5 km across and causing serious regional and climate damage. The 2013 Chelyabinsk airburst, whose shockwave struck six cities across Russia, is thought to have been caused by an asteroid just 20 m in diameter. AIM is also Europe's contribution to the larger Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment mission: AIDA. In late 2022, the NASA-led part of AIDA will arrive: the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, probe will approach the binary system – then crash straight into the asteroid moon at about 6 km/s. 'AIM will be watching closely as DART hits Didymoon,' explains Ian Carnelli, managing the mission for ESA. 'In the aftermath, it will perform detailed before-and-after comparisons on the structure of the body itself, as well as its orbit, to characterise DART's kinetic impact and its consequences. The target for the international Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment mission, of which ESA's Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM) is a part. In 2020 AIM will head to the paired Didymos asteroids, which will come a comparatively close 11 million km to Earth in 2022 . Launched in October 2020, AIM will travel to a binary asteroid system – the paired Didymos asteroids, which will come a comparatively close 11 million km to Earth in 2022. The 800 m-diameter main body is orbited by a 170 m moon, informally called 'Didymoon'. 'The results will allow laboratory impact models to be calibrated on a large-scale basis, to fully understand how an asteroid would react to this kind of energy. 'This will shed light on the role the ejecta plume will play – a fundamental part in the energy transfer and under scientific debate for over two decades. 'In addition, DART's shifting of Didymoon's orbit will mark the first time humanity has altered the dynamics of the Solar System in a measurable way. 'It will also give us a baseline for planning any future planetary defence strategies. 'We will gain insight into the kind of force needed to shift the orbit of any incoming asteroid, and better understand how the technique could be applied if a real threat were to occur.' AIM and AIDA will be discussed at this month's International Academy of Astronautics Planetary Defense Conference, hosted at ESA's ESRIN Earth observation centre in Frascati, Italy, which will be devoted to assessing the risk of impacts from asteroid and comets and envisaging possible responses. This year's event features a simulated asteroid threat exercise, to which representatives of global space agencies and disaster response organisations will coordinate their reactions.

"CCTV pictures show a man police want to speak to after a 'peeping Tom' incident at a swimming pool . These pictures show a 'peeping Tom' who is believed to have been spying on young women changing in cubicles at a swimming pool. At around 12.45pm yesterday, a 19-year-old woman was changing in a cubicle in Aqua Vale Swimming Pool in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, when she noticed a man looking under the bottom of the cubicle. She had kicked him and he then disappeared. Captured on CCTV cameras placed in the changing areas near the pool, the latest pictures are thought to be connected to a similar incident that took place at the same pool. On February 7, a man sexually assaulted two teenage girls in the changing area of the pool. Police issued the new images, appealing for anyone who recognises the man to contact them urgently. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'The woman kicked out at the man and he moved away, before she noticed him looking at her again.' 'The victim shouted and the man was not seen again. 'Officers are investigating the incident and are linking it to an incident at the same location on 7 February in which a man sexually assaulted two teenage girls in the changing area.' Detective Sergeant Simon Johnson, of Aylesbury Force CID, said: 'Detectives are investigating both incidents, which we believe are linked. 'In this incident the victim was not touched by the offender. 'However, this would have been an understandably distressing incident for her. 'I would like to appeal to anyone who recognises the man shown in the CCTV image as he may have information which could assist with our inquiries.'

"From bear testicles and tiger paws to crocodile jaws and snake heads, these are just some of the bizarre animal parts being sold in China's so-called medicine markets. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) claims all manner of ailments including back ache, poor memory and even cancer can be cured by the natural world. It is often believed that  the more endangered the animal is, the greater the healing affect it will have. Such  wisdom is widespread in Guangzhou, where markets stock exotic and rare animals destined for restaurant menus, pharmacists and pet cages. However, a movement of fledgling organisations such as the South China Nature Society, run by student conservationists, is challenging centuries of tradition by trying to change consumer appetites in the country. Snapped up: Customers purchase a Crocodile Head at Hunagsha market. The head is commonly used in soups. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, it is believed that crocodile meat can treat lung illnesses and improve memory . Jaws-dropping: A selection of shark fins for sale at Haizu mjarket.

With a history of more than 2,000 years, TCM has acquired a list in excess of 1,500 animals, many of which are endangered . Sensitive issue: A tiger penis, which is considered to be a potent aphrodisiac, for sale at Qingping market. China's appetite for endangered wildlife and the 2,000-year practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine is the main catalyst behind the world's third-largest illicit trade . Guangzhou is the richest and most powerful city in southern China, with a keen taste for exotic animals and plants, seen as extreme even in other regions of China. The main reason for this is 2,000-year-old Traditional Chinese Medicine that lists curative qualities in thousands of rare and exotic animals, such as the Sumatran Tiger. The pursuit of these traditions is the driving force behind the $20 billion (£13bn) illegal wildlife network, the worlds third largest elicit trade, surpassed only by arms and drugs. The network activity intensifies in South East Asia home to rich biodiversity, well developed transport infrastructures, high profit margins and lax law enforcement, a haven for wildlife smugglers. Vietnamese authorities recently seized a record haul of smuggled wildlife including two tons of tiger bones, bear paws and gall bladders.

It is believed that Crocodile meat can treat lung Illnesses and improve memory . The destination was China where Tiger bones can fetch up to $70,000 (£50,000). One may of thought that the rise of Guangzhou's economy and subsequent education would have reduced the consumption of endangered animals, but quite the opposite. Rising incomes have allowed more consumers to indulge in exotic foods once considered exclusive delicacies for the rich. The consumption of these endangered animals have now become a symbol of Guangzhou's new wealth. A recent poll taken in Guangzhou found that half the population had eaten wildlife, with snake being named as the favorite of half of those surveyed. A popular saying  has it that people in Guangzhou will eat anything with fours legs accept a chair, anything that flies accept a plane and anything in water except a boat. The greatest defense of animal rights to date was during the SARS outbreak in 2003 when consumption dropped due to public fears about the risk of contracting SARS from wild animals.

Dried snakes at Qingping market. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, snake meat is said to be good for vision and the lower spine . The demand for civet cats decreased so much that 141 farms released 4,000 of the animals into the wild. Bird flu later added to this concerns. In recent years, consumption has recovered. In the latest line of defense stands, the South China Nature Society (SCNS), a young band of four university graduate conservationists. Established in February 2008 by Feng Minghe under the guidance of NGO - Green Eyes China, SCNS faces the mammoth task of challenging centuries of Chinese wisdom in an international hub of exotic wildlife trade. 'Our key objective is to raise awareness and educate consumers on the impact of their consumption. We hope that targeting the next generation will reduce future demand', explains Feng. Raising awareness and educating consumers takes a number of forms. The group organises various workshops and lectures in the local Guangzhou's universities. Each month, they co-ordinate field investigation among the city's live market and record the number of protected species. A tiger farmer attempts to sell a Bengal tiger paw for $3,000 (£2,000) in the Qingping area of Guangzhou.

The global population of tigers has been reduced by 95 per cent as a result of hunting and poaching for their body parts, which are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine . Their findings are reported to the authorities and published on the SCNS and Green Eyes websites. On recent visits to the city's notorious live animal markets of Qingping and Huadiwan, SCNS identified a wealth of protected animals from koala bears to crocodiles to great white sharks. Sun, a veteran snake seller at Qingping, said the market sell fewer protected species than before because many animals are near extinction and government checks are tighter. However, he did admit to selling endangered species 'under the table' including Cobra. 'The demand here is so great if I didn't sell it then someone else would, people will always buy,' he said.

In March, SCNS scored a major victory by protesting outside a Guangzhou restaurant in which was holding a nurse shark in a tiny tank in which it could barely move. Banners reading 'no consuming, no killing' in English and Chinese, caught widespread media coverage from local news channels. In the end, the shark was released to a local marine park.

"Scientists at a Polish company that produce body armour systems are working to put a 'magic liquid' that can harden on impact in their products. The liquid is called Shear-Thickening Fluid (STF), and instantly hardens upon impact at any temperature. In a 'liquid armour' this provides protection from penetration by high-speed projectiles and additionally dispersing energy over a larger area. Scroll down for video of the body armour in action . The new material in its liquid form (left) and the solid form it take on impact (right) The liquid is called Shear-Thickening Fluid (STF), and  does not conform to the model of Newtonian liquids, such as water, in which the force required to move the fluid faster must increase exponentially, and its resistance to flow changes according to temperature. Instead STF hardens upon impact at any temperature, providing protection from penetration by high-speed projectiles and additionally dispersing energy over a larger area. 'This viscosity increases thanks to the subordination of the particles in the liquid structure, therefore they form a barrier against an external penetrating factor,' said Karolina Olszewska, who performed tests on the STF for Moratex. The exact composition of the STF is known only to Moratex and its inventors at the Military Institute of Armament Technology in Warsaw, but ballistic tests proved its resistance to a wide range of projectiles. 'We needed to find, design a liquid that functions both with projectiles hitting at the velocity of 450 meters per second and higher. 'We have succeeded,' said Deputy Director for Research at the Moratex institute, Marcin Struszczyk. Struszczyk said the liquid's stopping capability, combined with the lower indentation of its surface, provides a higher safety level for the user compared with traditional, mostly Kevlar-based, solutions. 'If a protective vest is fitted to the body, then a four centimeter deep deflection may cause injury to the sternum, sternum fracture, myocardial infarction, lethal damage to the spleen,' Struszczyk said. 'Thanks to the properties of the liquid, thanks to the proper formation of the insert, we eliminate one hundred percent of this threat because we have reduced the deflection from four centimeters to one centimeter.' The liquid has been used to create lightweight flexible sheets, which can be placed inside the body armour . When hit by a high-speed projectile, a wide area of the STF hardens instantly, causing the usually massive energy to be dispersed away from the wearer's internal organs. Implementing the solution in body armor required designing special inserts, but the company says those are lighter than standard ballistic inserts and broader range of movement for their users in the police and military. 'The point is for them not to interfere, not change the way of movement, operation of such the product by the user, and at the same time increase their motor skills, increase effectiveness of their decision process and increase their possibilities during the mission at hand,' Struszczyk said. A Bullet test shows the material hardening on impact. Researchers have already tested the material in existing body armour designs. The laboratory is also working on a magnetorheological fluid, which they hope can be also applied in their products. According to the researchers, both liquids can find applications beyond body armor, such as in the production of professional sports inserts, and even entire outfits. Another use could be in car bumpers or road protective barriers.","Clothing can include Moratex pack which instantly hardens on impact .

"A second Liberal Democrat election candidate has revealed he is HIV positive as he launched a scathing attack on Nigel Farage for his comments on the condition during last week's TV debate. Paul Childs, who is running in the Liverpool Riverside seat, said he burst into tears when he was diagnosed with the virus in 2011 following a routine test after starting a new relationship with a man. The air steward said he was revealing he had HIV because he was infuriated by the Ukip leader's 'scaremongering' over the number of foreigners who have the condition. Scroll down for video . Paul Childs (pictured canvassing) is the second Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate to reveal he is HIV positive . Mr Childs said he decided to reveal he had HIV because he was infuriated by Nigel Farage's 'scaremongering' over foreigners who have the virus . The election candidate is the second Lib Dem to go public with their HIV positive status, after Adrian Hyyrylainen-Trett, who is running for the party in Vauxhall, central London, explained that he got the virus intentionally as he embarked on a path of self 'annihilation'. Mr Childs told BuzzFeed that he received a phone call from doctors after the HIV test saying they would like him to return for a second examination - something done after a positive result. 'I was never expecting it to happen. I remember being at work, sitting in a corridor and bursting into tears. I started shaking and getting really scared,' he said. The second test also came back positive, confirming that Mr Childs, who is now 34, was infected. Ukip leader Nigel Farage attacked the high cost of health service treatment for foreigners with HIV in the television debate . He said: 'I cried in front of the nurse – the staff were very supportive. I knew a little bit about what HIV meant because I’d done some work with a gay men’s health charity in Glasgow but I still had in my head that it was a terminal diagnosis. I asked the doctor how long I had to live.' Mr Childs said he felt compelled to tell his story after Mr Farage said that thousands of people with HIV in the UK were not British. During the televised debates, the Ukip leader said: ‘Here’s a fact and I’m sure that other people will be mortified that I dare to talk about it. ‘There are 7,000 diagnoses in this country every year for people who are HIV positive. It’s not a good place for any of them to be, I know, but 60 per cent of them are not British nationals. ‘You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to £25,000 a year per patient. ‘I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.’ Mr Childs, who is hoping to beat Louise Ellman in the safe Labour seat, said Mr Farage was 'scaremongering'. He said: 'You can’t keep blaming a country’s problems on immigrants. HIV is a drop in the ocean compared to what else the NHS is spending money on. 'It’s just scaremongering, scaremongering to get votes. It’s playing on people’s ignorance and fear.' The Lib Dem candidate is the second from the party to reveal they are HIV positive during this election campaign. Adrian Hyyrylainen-Trett, who is running for the Lib Dems in Vauxhall, central London, explained that he got HIV intentionally as he embarked on a path of self 'annihilation' Mr Hyyrylainen-Trett - the first parliamentary candidate to publicly discuss being HIV positive - said he caught the virus when contemplating suicide, thinking it could be a way for him to die. The 36-year-old revealed he attempted suicide on a few occasions, took countless drugs, got involved in the gay wrestling scene and put himself in vulnerable situations during a troubled phase of his life. He told Buzzfeed: 'I thought, ""What's another way of doing it?"" Even though I knew people were surviving from HIV, I thought, ""Perhaps if I can make myself so ill, get the worst strain possible, that would be one way of getting rid of myself.''' But the prospective MP said he realised once he was diagnosed he did not want HIV at all, and that all his actions were just an attempt to 'annihilate' himself. The disclosures have made Mr Hyyrylainen-Trett the first parliamentary candidate to discuss being HIV positive publicly. Labour MP Chris Smith previously announced his HIV positive status when he was leaving the House of Commons for the Lords.","Parliamentary candidate Paul Childs, 34, revealed that he is HIV positive .

"A teenager suffering a rare genetic condition that gave her the body of a 100-year-old has died aged 17. Hayley Okines became well-known three years ago when she was part of a documentary about her premature ageing condition. She suffered from the rare disease progeria which ages the body at eight times the normal rate. Progeria takes its name from the Greek word 'proeros', meaning prematurely old. It involves a mutant protein called progerin that accelerates physical ageing. There are around 74 known cases of the disease around the world and only four in the UK. Scroll down for video . Hayley Okines, who suffered a rare genetic condition that gave her the body of a 100-year-old, has died aged 17 . A 10 year old progeria child will have the appearance of an octogenarian with symptoms including baldness, arthritis and heart problems, but the mind of a 10 year old. Progeria patients normally die from heart attacks or strokes at an average age of 13. But Hayley, from Bexhill, East Sussex, defied the odds to live four more years and even published an autobiography about living with the disease. Last night her mother Kerry posted on Facebook: 'My baby girl has gone somewhere better. She took her last breath in my arms at 9.39pm x.' Today, the Progeria Research Foundation posted on its Facebook page: 'The entire Progeria family mourns together with many as we say goodbye to Hayley Okines, our smart, beautiful and spirited English rose, who passed away today at age 17. 'Gone from our sight, but never our memories, gone from our touch but never our hearts. We will miss you.' Hayley and her family had fundraised for her medical treatment and to raise public understanding of the condition. Her story was catapulted into the limelight after she starred in documentaries called The Girl who is Older than Her Mother and World's Oldest Teenager: Extraordinary People. Her autobiography, called Old Before my Time, detailed pop-star crushes and a dislike of school. But it was also a moving insight into how a child copes with a disease which resulted in Hayley having the body of a 105-year-old. In an interview with The Sunday People in 2013, her mother described the hell of living with the disease. 'The most difficult part is Hayley has the mind of a normal 13-year-old girl locked in an old person's body,' she said.

But Hayley defied the odds to live four more years . Despite pioneering drug treatment in the US that gave her a new lease of life, Hayley was unable to conquer the disease . 'Someone else has to get her a drink as she's too small to reach taps by herself. 'And buying fashionable clothes is tough because she still wears clothes for a five-year-old. Hayley, who turned 17 on December 3, left school last summer. However, despite pioneering drug treatment in the US that gave her a new lease of life, she was unable to conquer the disease. In recent weeks her health had deteriorated and she contracted pneumonia. After being discharged yesterday she died at home last night. Hayley's parents have previously described the heartache her condition had caused. Her mother said: '[When she was born] she had fine blonde hair, blue eyes and her father and I were besotted with her. 'At 10 months she walked for the first time – we were so proud. 'The only concern was she was so petite and didn't appear to be growing. 'But as I'm only 5ft 4ins I tried to tell myself she simply took after me.' At 13 months, Hayley still wore clothes for a three-month-old, so her mother took her to their GP. Tests revealed she had a rare gene mutation called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria. In an interview, Hayley's mother described the hell of living with the disease. 'The most difficult part is Hayley has the mind of a normal 13-year-old girl locked in an old person's body,' she said . In her short life, Hayley went swimming with dolphins, travelled all over the world, met Prince Charles, Kylie Minogue and Justin Bieber and starred in several TV documentaries . Hayley even published an autobiography about living with the disease, called Old Before My Time . Her mother said: 'We looked it up on the internet and were shocked. We found photos of children who looked like little elderly people. 'They had bald heads and one girl was wearing a wig which made her look so odd it frightened us. 'It said sufferers wouldn't reach puberty and would eventually die from age-related disorders, usually before their teens.' Next came the devastating news that Hayley would only live until the age of 13. Determined to make the most of the time she had, the family embarked on giving Hayley amazing memories. Members of the local community raised thousands of pounds to pay for her to go to Disneyland in California. In her short life, Hayley went swimming with dolphins, travelled all over the world, met Prince Charles, Kylie Minogue and Justin Bieber and starred in several TV documentaries. Despite her terrible prognosis, the teenager remained upbeat. 'In many ways I feel I've been lucky.

'At 34, Julie was a bubbly, energetic person. She was happily married with two school aged children, and worked three days per week as a dental hygienist. ""I feel well most of the time,"" she told me. ""But then, five days before my period, everything changes. I suddenly feel headachy and fatigued. I get snappy with my husband and my kids, and I can't seem to stop myself."" Happy days: The naturopathic doctor says that PMS can be banished for good by adapting an anti-inflammatory diet . 'I ordered some blood tests for Julie, and found that her hormones were normal, which is typical for PMS. Some doctors would offer the birth control pill at this point, but I know there's a better way. 'I asked Julie to stop eating desserts and deep-fried foods. Julie also took the nutritional supplements magnesium and vitamin B6, and within the very first month, she noticed a dramatic change. ""I was surprised when my period just arrived,"" she said. ""I didn't even feel it coming."" That's why I love treating PMS. It responds so well to natural treatment.' Breakfast: . Option 1. Unsweetened muesli with mixed berries and unsweetened greek yoghurt . Option 2. Two scrambled eggs on whole grain or gluten-free toast with butter . Option 3. Spinach and goat cheese frittata . Beverages: Water, tea or coffee . Unsweetened muesli with berries (left) and scrambled eggs (right) are among Dr Briden's suggested breakfasts in her 'No-More-PMS' diet plan . Snacks: . Option 1. Handful of raw cashews . Option 2. Rye crackers with half an avocado and lemon juice . Option 3. Fresh fruit . Lunch: . Option 1. Chicken wrap with grated carrot, beet and fresh spinach leaves . Option 2. Large green salad with smoked salmon, avocado and olive oil dressing . Option 3. Sushi with miso soup . Beverages: Water or sparkling water. Tea or coffee . Green salads with oily fish (left) and sushi (right) are some of the delicious and nutritious lunch suggestions . Dinner: . Option 1. Roasted lamb shanks with potato mash and steamed kale . Option 2. Barbecued salmon steaks with oven baked sweet potato chips and spinach salad . Option 3. Chicken and broccoli stir-fry with rice . Beverages: Water or sparkling water with lemon. One glass of wine or beer . Stir-fry (left), lamb with potatoes and kale, or salmon steaks are all dinner options, while a small serving of dark chocolate (right) is a sweet treat for dessert . Dessert: . Option 1. Two squares of 85 per cent cocoa dark chocolate . Option 2. Cinnamon poached pears . Option 3. Gluten-free almond and orange torte made with half the sugar . Dr Briden explains that PMS has often been dismissed as a myth in the past, but that new research has indicated a link between inflammation and PMS. 'PMS has been a controversial diagnosis because researchers have not been able to detect any difference in the blood levels of hormones of PMS-sufferers compared to non-PMS-sufferers,' says Dr Briden. 'In both groups, oestrogen and progesterone levels rise and fall throughout the month just like they're supposed to. 'That has led some researchers to dismiss PMS as a myth, but I see it another way. Hormonal: PMS is caused by your response to the drop in hormones, which depends on the health of your hormone receptors... A primary cause of unhealthy receptors is chronic inflammation . 'Of course PMS-sufferers have normal hormone levels. That's because female hormones are not the actual cause of PMS. Why did we ever think they would be? Neither oestrogen nor progesterone are inherently bad for mood. Quite the opposite. They're both beneficial for mood because they boost neurotransmitters such as serotonin. 'I've worked with thousands of PMS patients, and I'm convinced: PMS is not caused by hormones, or even by the drop in hormones (which is inevitable at the end of the menstrual cycle). Instead, PMS is caused by your individual response to that drop in hormones. Dr Lara Briden has been a naturopathic doctor specialising in women's health for 20 years . 'This is where it gets interesting. Your response to hormones depends on the health and resilience of your hormone receptors, which are the tiny docking stations for your female hormones, and are found in every tissue, including your brain. 'Your hormone receptors translate hormonal messages into real physical effects such as mood or appetite. 'When your receptors are healthy, they're flexible, and they adapt to rising and falling hormone levels by simply dialling up and dialling down their response (depending on the level of hormone). That means no PMS. 'When your receptors are not healthy, on the other hand, they cannot adapt to changing hormones, and that leads to premenstrual symptoms. 'Fortunately, we know what impairs the health of hormone receptors: Chronic inflammation. According to a recent study, blood markers of inflammation are higher in PMS-sufferers. Chronic inflammation is a kind of long-term immune activation that is caused by different things including stress and smoking. It's also caused by certain inflammatory foods, and that's why diet is so effective as PMS treatment.' Off the table: Deep fried and sugary foods are the most inflammatory, and therefore should be avoided . EAT FEWER INFLAMMATORY FOODS . The most inflammatory foods are deep-fried foods and high-sugar foods such as desserts and sweet drinks, so you should avoid those. You should also avoid fruit juice because it is concentrated sugar. Whole fruit is permitted. Sugar and deep fried foods are inflammatory for everyone, but other foods, such as wheat and dairy products, can also be inflammatory if you have a sensitivity to them. Food sensitivities are well known to cause symptoms such as sinus or eczema, but they are also a common cause of PMS. Try avoiding wheat and dairy for three months, and see the difference. If in doubt, speak to your doctor or nutritionist. Tip: PMS is a common symptom of food sensitivities. Eat the rainbow: Brightly-coloured fruits and vegetables such as berries, spinach and kale provide essential nutrients such as folate and magnesium . EAT MORE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY FOODS . The foods that actively reduce inflammation are fruits and vegetables, especially the brightly coloured ones such as berries, spinach, and kale. Fruit and vegetables are anti-inflammatory because they provide essential nutrients such as folate and magnesium, and because they provide phytonutrients. Phytonutrients are beneficial plant compounds that stimulate your immune system and to reduce its inflammatory response. Supplements: Dr Briden recommends mineral magnesium and vitamin B6 to supplement diet . SUPPLEMENT WITH NATURAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY NUTRIENTS . My favourite anti-inflammatory nutritional supplement is the mineral magnesium. Together with vitamin B6, magnesium has done extremely well in clinical trials for premenstrual syndrome. Both supplements are safe and easy to obtain. Speak to your chemist. Tip: The No-More-PMS Diet works to prevent PMS. Please follow it during all the days of your cycle - not just when you're premenstrual. Lara Briden is a naturopathic doctor with nearly 20 years experience in women's health. She's just released her new book Period Repair Manual: Natural Treatment for Better Hormones and Better Periods.","No-More-PMS diet consists of anti-inflammatory foods and nutrients .

"The father of an asthmatic nursing student who died during a traffic stop is threatening to sue police. Anthony Clark Reed was driving around Detroit, Michigan, on Monday night when he was pulled over because he reportedly had illegally tinted windows. The 24-year-old was handcuffed, despite complaining that he had trouble breathing, before suffering a fatal heart attack. Nursing student Anthony Clark Reed (left and right) was driving around Detroit, Michigan, on Monday night when he was pulled over. He suffered a heart attack during a traffic stop after complaining he had trouble breathing . His father, pastor Kevin Clark, claimed his son had been 'driving erratically' because he was having trouble breathing and was searching for his inhaler. He told The Huffington Post that he suffered an asthma attack, and the police were indirectly responsible for his death. 'He was gasping for air, looking for his inhaler [as he was driving],' Clark told the site. 'When Detroit police pulled him out of the car he was already in panic mode … and they handcuffed him, and he's trying to tell them he can't breathe. 'I believe it caused his death ... He dropped dead right there, in the hands of Detroit police officers who were negligent.' He described how he found out about his son's death two hours after the incident. When he arrived at the hospital, he claims no one from Detroit Police was there to tell him what happened. His father, pastor Kevin Clark, claimed his son had been 'driving erratically' because he was having trouble breathing and was searching for his inhaler. He is planning to sue police for their role in his son's death . Only a hospital chaplain was there when he was asked to identify his son's body. It wasn't until the next morning that he was able to speak to officers. Spokeswoman June West said: 'We provided him with answers as best we could at this stage of the investigation and we will be reaching out to the family in the next few days to provide them with updated information as it becomes available.' Jennifer Moreno from the Detroit Police media relations department told MILive: 'Officers did stop the gentleman for a traffic violation and subsequently he exited the vehicle ... had an asthma attack. 'They gave him his inhaler (and) they administered CPR when the gentleman passed out and then (an ambulance) was ordered ...' The coroner's office have yet to determine the cause of death.

"Primary school children have been banned from running in the playground in case they fall over and injure themselves. Pupils at Riverview Junior School in Gravesend, Kent were told they could not move around too quickly because they might bump their heads. Parents are furious about the ban - saying that children need to 'let off steam' during their breaks as well as getting exercise by running around. Banned: Pupils including Bradley, Luca, Mia and Diesel (pictured left to right) have been told they cannot run in the playground at Riverview Junior School in Gravesend . Rachael Sparks said that her 11-year-old son Diesel had returned home upset after being told not to run outside at school. She said that she checked with headmistress Pam Wenbam, because she could not believe that it was true, before realising that a ban had in fact been imposed. 'I went in to school to speak to them as I thought he must have misunderstood,' Ms Sparks said. 'What else is a playground for in a primary school if not for running around and letting off a bit of steam? 'I was lucky enough to get to speak to the head, Ms Wenban. I said, ""I just want to clarify if this is true."" 'She started off by saying we've asked them to slow down a bit, but then it transpired that they had banned running.' Safety: Staff at the school, pictured, say they are trying to crack down on a dangerous 'chasing' game . The school claims that the ban is intended to tackle a specific 'chasing' game which has caused children to hurt themselves. Ms Sparks said: 'She went on to say that due to some children not looking where they were going, there had been incidents of bumped heads. 'She claimed due to this it was her duty of care towards the children that had prompted her to ban running. They are not allowed to play British Bulldog, they are not allowed to play football. 'I know children do get the occasional bump to the head or grazed knee while running around on the playground but having spoken to a number of parents as well as children, 100 per cent of both expressed that running and getting the occasional minor injury was most definitely preferable to not running at all. 'I don't want to run the school down but I think it is a step too far. Kids have been bumping their heads and grazing their knees for hundreds of years.' Ms Wenband said: 'We have asked children to refrain from playing a particular chasing game in the playground as we have found the increasing numbers taking part has caused some injuries, including a fractured collarbone. 'We are concerned for the safety of the children and need to stop this particular game until we can establish a safer way for them to play. 'When the weather is dry and sunny children can run and play more safely on the school playing field.'","Pupils at Riverview Junior School in Gravesend are not allowed to run .

"Antarctica has experienced its highest temperature on record, according to meteorologists. Sensors at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula recorded a temperature of 17.5°C (63.5°F). According to meteorologists this is potentially a new record for the warmest temperature measured on the frozen continent. The new temperature record was measured on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (pictured) where the ice shelf covering the sea has declined considerably in recent years and glaciers are thought to be receding . Over a two day period last week temperatures reached 17.4°C (63.3°F) and 17.5°C (63.5°F). However, the heatwave on the coldest continent on Earth has still to be officially certified by the World Meteorological Organisation. Antarctica's icy edge is disappearing in warming ocean waters, with the last decade seeing the rate of ice loss increase dramatically. This is according to a new study that has combined 18-years worth of ice shelf thinning data from three different sets of satellites. The researchers claim that some ice shelves in West Antarctica have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years. Satellite data from 1994 to . 2012 clearly shows the accelerating decline which could hasten the rise in global sea levels, . scientists say. The findings come amid concern among many scientists about the effects of . global climate change on Earth's vast, remote polar regions. The previous hottest temperature recorded in Antarctica - which is usually the coldest place on Earth - was in April 24 1961 when the temperature reached 17.1°C (62.8°F). Writing for website Weather Underground, meteorologist Dr Jeff Masters said: 'A new all-time temperature record for an entire continent is a rare event. 'This week's record temperatures were made possible by an unusually extreme jet stream contortion that brought a strong ridge of high pressure over the Antarctic Peninsula, allowing warm air from South America to push southwards over Antarctica. 'At the surface, west to east blowing winds over the Antarctic Peninsula rose up over the 1,000-foot high mountains just to the west of Esperanza Base, then descended and warmed via adiabatic compression (without transfer of heat) into a warm foehn wind (a warm dry wind that blows down a slope).' Antarctica is known as the coldest place on Earth where temperatures have dropped to -93.2°C (-135.8°F) on the East Antarctic Plateau. The graphic above shows rates of thickness change around the Antarctic coastline with areas of most loss in the past 18 years indicated by red circles and areas where ice has increased shown by blue circles . However, the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest warming spots on Earth. While most of the continent has experienced an increase in ice sheet mass, nearly 10,000 square miles of ice has been lost from the ice shelves off coast of the Peninsula. Glaciers extending out from the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula have also been retreating, according to researchers. Climate scientists have blamed the changes happening there on human-generated global warming. The collapse of the Larson B shelf (shown above) on the Antarctic Peninsula is one example of the changes that have been taking place on the continent in recent years and have caused concern among some scientists . Marine sediment cores suggest the changes happening in the area are unprecedented at least in the past 10,000 years. Dr Masters said last week's heatwave matched a trend occurring around the world. He said that in 2015 five nations or territories have now set all time records or matched their records for hottest temperatures in history. He added that 46 nations or territories, out of 235, have set or tied all time heat records since 2010. However, despite the new record temperature, climate scientists are urging caution about drawing conclusions from it. This graphic shows how warm water from the ocean may be increasing the flow of glaciers from the Antarctic ice sheet as they cause melting from below while fresh snow accumulates on top of the ice sheet . Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist with Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, told National Geographic that last year Antarctica also logged a record cold temperature. He said that long term climate changes in Antarctica are complex and still have not been complained properly. The new record will also depend on what scientists regard as being Antarctica. Currently the World Meteorological Society records the warmest temperature on the continent as being at Vanda Station on the opposite side Antarctica on 1 May 1974 when temperatures reached 15°C (59°F).","Temperatures at Esperanza Base on Antarctic Peninsula reached 63.5°F .

"MI5 covered up the sexual abuse of boys in the notorious Kincora home, a former Army Intelligence officer claimed last night. Brian Gemmell, a former captain in the Intelligence Corps, said spy chiefs ordered him to ‘stop digging’ when he reported a possible paedophile ring at the Northern Ireland children’s’ home. He spoke out during a meeting with victim Richard Kerr, who claimed he was one of three youngsters trafficked from the home before being molested by ‘very powerful’ figures in a Westminster paedophile gang. Scroll down for video . Brian Gemmell, a former captain in the Army Intelligence Corps (pictured), said MI5 spy chiefs ordered him to ‘stop digging’ when he reported a possible paedophile ring at the Northern Ireland children’s’ home, Kincora . He claimed he was sexually abused by politicians and other senior men at Dolphin Square apartment complex in Pimlico and Elm Guest House, in Barnes, west London, which are being investigated by Scotland Yard amid ‘credible’ claims a Tory MP murdered a young boy. Campaigners claim Mr Kerr’s account provides a clear link between VIP paedophile rings in London and Belfast. MI5 has faced long-standing allegations of covering up child abuse to enable it to gather intelligence on Loyalist politicians during the Troubles. But it has also been accused of not acting to protect leading Establishment figures involved in the crimes. Mr Gemmell, who served in military intelligence in Belfast, presented a report on allegations of abuse at Kincora to a senior MI5 officer in 1975 but to his astonishment was told to quit his probe. Speaking to Mr Kerr on Channel 4 News, he said: ‘That’s the thing that hits me - that if I really pushed the thing through, you could have been rescued. I’m sorry.’ His revelations will strengthen calls for the allegations about the Irish children’s home to be covered by the judge-led abuse inquiry announced by Home Secretary Theresa May. The inquiry will investigate whether public bodies, including governments, charities, the Church and BBC, failed to protect children. It was set up amid claims a child sex gang operated in Westminster in the 1980s. The investigation into historical abuse, which will be led by New Zealand High Court judge, Justice Lowell Goddard, is likely to be able to study files held by MI5. Mr Gemmell said: ‘I think Richard’s transporting over to the United Kingdom mainland to be abused, rather than just being abused in Northern Ireland, speaks volumes. It ties the two together.’ Mr Gemmell met with victim Richard Kerr, who claimed he was one of three youngsters trafficked from Kincora (pictured) before being molested by ‘very powerful’ figures in a Westminster paedophile gang . Speaking to Channel 4 News, Mr Kerr, who now lives in Dallas, Texas, said he and two other boys suffered abuse at Kincora in the mid-1970s before being trafficked to London in 1977, where they suffered further abuse. Boys - many in local authority care - are alleged to have been abused by figures including the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith, Cabinet ministers, clergymen, pop stars, spies, judges and members of the royal household. MI5 has been accused of suppressing allegations of child abuse against the politician, who died in 2010, when they were made during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The Kincora children’s home in east Belfast was run by William McGrath, the head of an extreme Protestant loyalist group called Tara and an alleged MI5 informant. He and two other members of staff – William Semple and Joseph Mains – were jailed in 1981 for sexually assaulting boys in their care. In February, lawyers for victims challenging the refusal to include Kincora in Justice Goddard’s wide-ranging inquiry told the High Court in Belfast that MI5 was aware of the abuse but allowed it to continue to protect those responsible from prosecution.","Brian Gemmell said spy chiefs ordered him to 'stop digging' at boys' home .

"A mother has revealed her addiction to alcohol has cost the NHS more than £100,000. Julie Merner's heavy drinking has resulted in her being admitted to hospital 13 times in the last six years. In January, following her latest admission, the 39-year-old vowed to quit the habit, which has ravaged her liver, causing her to suffer severe cirrhosis. 'I know if I carry on, I will end up dead - they say one more drop will kill me,' said the mother-of-three, who has been left with 'luminous' jaundiced skin. Not a drop of alcohol has passed Ms Merner's lips since January - marking her longest spell of abstinence. Scroll down for video . Julie Merner, 39, has revealed her alcoholism has cost the NHS £100,000. In the last six years, the mother-of-three, who suffers severe liver cirrhosis, has been admitted to hospital 13 times . But the damage to her health is severe. She can barely manage to speak as she struggles for breath. And her stomach regularly bloats with liquid, which is no longer being processed by her liver. Regularly, up to 18 litres of fluid has to be drained away via a tube. Admitting she only has herself to blame, Ms Merner added she does not feel any shame in needing treatment. 'I don't see it as a waste of money, they are helping with a problem I have - an addiction,' she said. Ms Merner, from Bootle, Merseyside, hopes her story will push the Government and society to do more to prevent Britain's killer drinking epidemic. Taxpayers pay up £3.5 billion a year to treat alcohol-related problems, and that figure is set to rise. In the last 20 years, the number of alcohol-related deaths has doubled. While smoking, drug-taking and obesity are increasingly frowned upon, drinking is still socially acceptable, Ms Merner highlighted. After her latest hospital stay in January, Ms Merner  vowed to quit her habit, and hasn't touched a drop of alcohol since - her longest spell of abstinence . Taxpayers pay up £3.5 billion a year to treat alcohol-related problems, and that figure is set to rise. In the last 20 years, the number of alcohol-related deaths has doubled. At the peak of her addiction, Ms Merner was drinking a bottle of vodka a day. More than 6 standard drinks per day for men, and 4 standard drinks for women, is known to cause harm. Long term effects of alcohol on the liver include impaired liver functioning, severe pain, inflammation (hepatitis) and cirrhosis. Research published late last month revealed that binge drinking is costing Britain a staggering £4.9bn every year - or £550,000 an hour. This is because it triggers, for example, a 45 per cent increase in arrests and a 17 per cent rise in road accidents, economists from Bath University calculated. The figures also took into account A&E admissions, police time and court cases. But Marco Francesconi, head of the Department of Economics at the University of Essex, explained his calculations hadn't included costs associated with absenteeism, lost employment, reduced productivity, and long-term health problems. The report came shortly after the head of the NHS warned binge drinking fuelled by cheap alcohol is having a 'huge impact' on health services. Chief executive Simon Stevens said the Government needed to deal with the 'overuse' of alcohol urgently as it is creating problems for over-stretched A&E units. The most recent NHS figures show that more than one million patients are being admitted to hospital for alcohol-related illness and injuries every year – twice as many as a decade ago. She said: 'People aren't as aware of the risks as they should be and alcohol is too cheap. Help for alcoholism isn't advertised anywhere.' Ms Merner began drinking heavily 10 years ago. After splitting up with her partner, the father of her then toddler, she was forced to stay with her brother because she was unable to find a home of her own. Her two older children, now 20 and 16, stayed with their father. 'It was one or two drinks at night at first. A couple of vodkas helped me sleep,' Ms Merner recalled. 'Then it was half a bottle, then a full bottle... and then I started drinking when I woke up.' Six years ago, she started to have withdrawal effects when she didn't have a drink. 'I felt sick, I'd be shaking and sweating. I realised I had a problem,' she said. Ms Merner went to her doctor, and was referred to an NHS rehab clinic. But, six weeks after leaving, she slipped back into her habit, having one drink. Soon she back to drinking a litre of vodka a day. 'I ended up at the clinic nine or 10 times,' she admitted. By this time, Ms Merner had been diagnosed with cirrhosis. Her most dangerous collapse was in 2013. 'I wasn't found for three days,' she said. 'I was in a coma for 12 days. My kids were told I wouldn't see it through the night.' The pattern continued until last December. Once again she fell unconscious for three days after drinking and was in hospital for four weeks. But this time something clicked, and the mother-of-three vowed never to drink again. 'I know if I carry on I will end up dead - and I don't want to die,' she insisted. But her liver will never repair itself. In the meantime, she lives a painful existence and has to take 11 pills a day. 'People say to me ""just don't have a drink"", If it was that easy, don't you think I'd have done that rather than put myself by the pearly gates?' she said, fighting back tears. 'But I'm so grateful for what the hospital has done. I owe everything to them.' At the height of her addiction, Ms Merner, who still has to visit hospital once a week, was drinking a bottle of vodka every day. She has been warned another drop of alcohol could kill her. Ms Merner is seen weekly at the Aintree University Teaching Hospital, by specialist nurse Jenny Pearson. The 30-year-old nurse chose the specialism after losing her father and sister to alcoholism. She agreed society needs to change, urging the Government to take steps to address the growing epidemic. 'I have definitely seen an increase in numbers of patients,' she said. 'This is an epidemic. 'Every day we see 20 to 30 people in varying stages of liver disease, and oral cancer. 'Alcohol is practically poured down our throats. 'Watch daytime TV and they cook lunch with glasses of wine. Sporting events are sponsored by alcohol. It's no surprise people develop problems.' Ms Merner's story is featured in Benefits and Bypasses: The Billion Pound Patients, tonight on Channel 5 at 9pm.","At the height of her addiction Julie Merner drank a bottle of vodka a day .

"An elderly couple have been charged as investigations deepen into the discovery of a mass dog grave  containing the carcasses of 55 greyhounds. The 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg on Thursday. The carcasses were in various states of decomposition when found by a member of the public 360 kilometres  north of Brisbane in Vera Scarth-Johnson Wildflower Reserve, and it is thought that the site is a common dumping ground for unwanted racing greyhounds. Scroll down for video . An elderly couple have been charged as investigations deepen into the discovery of a mass dog grave containing the carcasses of 55 greyhounds . The shocking grisly photos show the decomposed bodies and burnt out skeletons of the greyhounds. Their carcasses lie in thick bush grass and some are still covered in dark brown fur with gun shot wounds clearly visible. There have been reports that the remains of the animals are scattered over an area of 200m around the reserve and no efforts have been made to conceal them. The 64-year-old woman is known in the local area as a greyhound trainer and when police issued her with a search warrant she put up a fight, claiming she had no idea what they were talking about. Police found a .22 calibre gun, ammunition and a baseball bat in the woman's home. The couple, both from Bundaberg, will appear in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court on Friday. A Queensland Police and RSPCA taskforce, set up after the greyhound racing industry was rocked by the live baiting scandal in February, found ammunition shells from a .22 calibre gun at the bush site in nearby Coonarr. The 71-year-old man and 64-year-old woman were charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm after a police search found a rifle and ammunition in a home in Bundaberg on Thursday . Local speculation suggests the site is a common dumping ground for `wasted' dogs used by people in the industry. Police haven't been able to confirm reports that microchips were also discovered. The shocking scene was, in the words of Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth, 'nothing short of abhorrent'. Post-mortem examinations will reveal the cause of death but Ainsworth said: 'I will say that a number of spent .22 cartridge shells were found in the vicinity as well.' And it's unlikely to be the last horrific sight he and his colleagues are met with. 'We've not even tipped the iceberg yet,' he said on Thursday morning. The carcasses were in various states of decomposition when found by a member of the public 360 kilometres north of Brisbane in Vera Scarth-Johnson Wildflower Reserve, and it is thought that the site is a common dumping ground for unwanted racing greyhounds . 'It could be somebody within the industry that knows the remoteness of that area up there and knows that it's a safe place to dispose of greyhounds that can't perform within the greyhound industry,' he said before the couple were arrested. Speaking to 9News, local resident Lloyd Blake said: 'We're quite disgusted that the dogs were dumped in our area and we hope at the end of the day that the severe fire that we had here in November is not related to the burning of the dogs.' Fires ripped through the area in February and police are now investigating whether the fires were deliberately lit and linked to the burning of the greyhound carcasses. It's also believed the animals were killed prior to the ABC's live baiting expose, judging by the level of decomposition. Racing Queensland's own probe into the use of live piglets, possums, rabbits and other small animals to train race dogs has resulted in more than 30 trainers being banned or stood down pending an internal review. The 64-year-old woman is known in the local area as a greyhound trainer and when police issued her with a search warrant she put up a fight, claiming she had no idea what they were talking about . The shocking scene was, in the words of Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth, 'nothing short of abhorrent' It's not yet known if any of those banned or suspended are those operating around Bundaberg that have been identified by police. But Queensland Greyhound Breeders, Owners and Trainers Association president Tony Zammit maintains the wider industry has been tarnished by the action of a few 'villains and rogues'. While horrified to learn of the mass killing, he said comments it foreshadowed even more revelations of animal mistreatment were premature. 'To me, it's an exaggerated statement,' he said. 'We haven't heard the full story yet.' Speaking at a press conference Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller was furious and appalled at the 'mass murder'. 'The people who have perpetrated this crime to me are oxygen thieves , they are cowards and they are pathetic,' she said. Bundaberg Greyhound Club president Stephen Bland took to Facebook to express shock at the discovery. Post-mortem examinations will reveal the cause of death but Ainsworth said: 'I will say that a number of spent .22 cartridge shells were found in the vicinity as well' Australia has one of the largest greyhound racing industries in the world. Live baiting has been banned and criminalised for decades. @QPSmedia@RSPCAQld 'We are appalled by the news and are doing all we can to find whomever is responsible for this disgraceful act,' he said. Greyhounds usually have relaxed, amicable temperaments and the state's Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller used social media to note her outrage.

"Dylan Miller, a senior studying English and philosophy at Juniata College decided to live in a hut for a research project on simple living . A student at Juniata College has lived in a hut built out of fallen trees, leaves and a tarp since September for his senior research project on simple living. Dylan Miller, a senior at Juniata College, in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, studying English and philosophy, decided for his senior project that he would live in a hut deep in the woods about a half-hour's walk from campus to learn about living with only the necessities. With no plumbing or electricity, Miller has spent the last eight months studying by lantern and chasing away the occasional bear as his fellow students live comfortably in their dorm rooms. He hopes living in  his nine-foot-tall, 17-by-17ft hut will teach him about living simply, away from the luxuries of the present day. Miller, a 21-year-old from Meadville, Pennsylvania, told Philly.com he's 'gotten used to roughing it'. 'I'm comfortable sleeping here now and walking around in the woods. I feel very free,' he said. His one-room structure sits on his campus's Baker-Henry Nature Reserve. With the help of trees and rope he formed the structure and insulated it with vegetation. Oak plank floorboards came from a friend's barn. 'I think my generation is going to make a lot of sacrifices for a healthy future when it comes to materialism and energy usage,' Miller, 21, said. 'A lot of people associate giving up things with less happiness. But I want to show people that you can live like a king even if you have very little.' Scroll down for video . Miller, 21, has been living in the one-room hut on Juniata's Baker-Henry Nature Reserve in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, since September . Miller built the hut out of fallen trees, leaves, rope and a tarp. He used vegetation as insulation. There is no plumbing or electricity in the structure, which is about a half-hour walk from campus . Assistant professor of English Will Dickey approved Miller's project and 'thought it was a fantastic idea'. 'Most of us are happy to watch TV at night to unwind,' Dickey told Philly.com. 'But Dylan is interested in a firsthand experience: mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually. As Thoreau said in Walden, I'm fronting only the essentials in life and living it firsthand.' Miller has used a journal to document his lifestyle and thoughts throughout his time in the huts with hopes of better understanding Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. His 21-page proposal for the project provided a lengthy reading list that featured works by Thoreau,  Emerson and Aldo Leopold, plus a Buddhist text called The Dhammapada, according to USA Today. During his daily campus trips, Miller charges his computer and phone and showers at friends' houses when he can. Miller used oak paneling from a friend's old barn to create the floor of his structure. He hopes to use is project to better understand writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson . In order to get the project approved, Miller had to agree to adhere to a series of rules, including having a cellphone for emergencies and a portable toilet . 'But I don't have any Internet access out here. And there's no TV or radio,' he said. 'I have books, and that's about it.' For the project to be approved, Miller had to follow a list of campus and state requirements, including having a portable toilet and cellphone. The campus police also have the authority to decide if weather conditions are too harsh for Miller to stay in the hut. His outdoor portable toiled did, however, become the victim of a bear attack back in October. 'I woke up one night to hear the toilet being bashed against my shelter,' he said. 'The bear ran away. In the morning, I saw the teeth marks and claw holes in the toilet... It was still usable.' As graduation nears for Miller, he's making plans to tear down the hut. 'That will be a teaching in itself,' he said. 'Nothing lasts forever.' Because the hut has no electricity, Miller has to study by candle light and lantern when it gets dark outside . But he often charges his laptop and phone while on campus each day. He also showers at friends' houses when he has the chance .","Dylan Miller is a senior at Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania .

"There is still no relief for hopeful house-hunters in Sydney as the capital city records yet another record boom in property prices after a 'strong' quarter. Dwelling values rose by 5.8 per cent in the Harbour city, a record growth and the strongest increase since April in 2009, according to the latest figures from RP Data. It comes after the Reserve Bank cut official interest rates to 2.25 per cent in February, leading to a weekly 80 per cent auction clearance rate and an investor fuelled market. Scroll down for video . Sydney’s dwelling values rose by 5.8 per cent in the last quarter bringing the average median house price to $690,000 . It's thus no surprise to see properties across the capital city sell for well over the $1 million mark like this Ryde residence in Sydney’s north west which sold for $1.8 million on the weekend . Set on 565 sqm, the four bedroom property features a deluxe spa bath, two terraces, three bathrooms and a fireplace . 'Although household income growth is minimal, Sydney's housing market continues to reach new record highs, with values increasing over the past 35 months,' Tim Lawless, the head of research at CoreLogic RP Data, said. 'It does pose the question of how much longer the growth can persist.' Sydney's performance drove the quarterly national dwelling value to heighten by 3 per cent, despite Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth suffering significant declines over the quarter. 'Although value growth has started 2015 on a strong note, the annual rate of growth has moderated back to 7.4 per cent, which is the slowest annual growth rate since September 2013,' Mr Lawless said. This five-bedroom home at 39 Holmes Street, Maroubra in Sydney’s eastern suburbs sold for $2 million on Saturday . Across two levels it features open plan living areas, a chic kitchen with stone benches and three bathrooms with  a stand-alone bath . Sydney's performance drove the quarterly national dwelling value to heighten by 3 per cent, despite Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth suffering significant declines over the quarter . 'Despite the headwinds of softer labour markets, very low rental yields, increased oversight on lending conditions and heightened economic uncertainty, historically low mortgage rates appear to be adding further stimulus to the housing market, albeit that stimulus is largely being felt in Sydney.' The median house price across the combined capital cities is now $530,000, with Sydney being the only city to surpass the figure with a median of $690,000. Canberra surprisingly performed second best to Sydney over the quarter with a 4.1 per cent increase in dwelling values leading to a $530,000 median house price, followed by Melbourne at 3.5 per cent and $518,000. The remaining capital cities were all under 1 per cent with Hobart at 0.9 per cent and Darwin at 0.4 per cent. Perth took out the last place at -2.7 per cent despite beating Hobart and Darwin over the year. This five-bedroom home at 95 Chelmsford Street, Newtown in Sydney’s inner west, sold for $2.3 million on Saturday . It has four levels on 290sqm with high ceilings, three bathrooms, courtyard gardens and a self-contained studio .

Canberra surprisingly performed second best to Sydney over the quarter with a 4.1 per cent increase in dwelling values leading to a $530,000 median house price . Hobart has maintained its position as the most affordable position by a longshot, with a median dwelling price of just $310,000. Mr Lawless offered a word of caution to investors with their eye on Sydney however, suggesting the market could soon begin to 'lose momentum'. 'There is some risk that recent investors could be left holding a very expensive but low yielding asset with a lower than expected rate of capital gain over the coming years,' he said. 'From there it will be interesting to see if they bide their time in the housing market or exit to other asset classes with a stronger return profile.' This home at 260 Holden Street, Ashbury in south-western Sydney, sold for $1,781,000 over the weekend .

"One of two teenagers feared to have crossed into Syria to join ISIS is believed to be a relative of Hammaad Munshi (pictured), who became Britain's youngest convicted terrorist when he was found guilty of terror offences at the age of 18 in 2008 . A relative of Britain's youngest convicted terrorist is believed to be among two  teenagers who have fled into Syria to join Isis. The pair from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, have not been in contact with their families for several days and cannot be reached on their mobile phones. One of the boys is believed to be a relation of Hammaad Munshi, who was just 15 when he joined a cell of Islamic fanatics targeting the Royal Family. The grandson of a British sharia judge, Munshi was recruited by a leading 'cyber terrorist' who radicalised impressionable Muslims and encouraged them to attend military camps in Pakistan. He was arrested on his way home from a chemistry exam in 2006 and found with two bags of ball-bearings - key material for a suicide vest. He was locked up for two years under the Terrorism Act in 2008. The Times reported that the two 17-year-old boys told relatives that they were going on a school trip, but instead used the Easter holidays as a 'window of opportunity' to flee Britain. They are thought to have boarded a Thomas Cook flight from Manchester Airport to Dalaman in Turkey on March 31, said West Yorkshire Police. Both families have reported the boys missing to police although British authorities now fear that the pair have managed to cross into Syria from Turkey. A family friend said they were in a state 'of total disbelief' and they were 'broken and inconsolable'. The south Dewsbury area has been linked to a number of extremist plots and was home to the ring-leader of the London bombings on July 7, 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan. According to The Times, a member of one of the families said: 'We don't want to talk.' Assistant Chief Constable Mark Milsom, from West Yorkshire Police said: 'We are extremely concerned for the safety of these two boys and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to us. 'Syria is an extremely dangerous place and the public will be aware of the dangers these boys may face. 'The choice of returning home from Syria is often taken away from those that come under the control of Islamic State, leaving their families in the UK devastated and with very few options to secure their safe return.' The force said it has been supporting the missing teenagers’ families and carrying out extensive inquiries alongside the North East Counter Terrorism Unit. The disappearance of the two teenagers follows the arrest of nine Britons by Turkish authorities attempting to sneak into Syria across the Turkish border. Waheed Ahmed, 21, from Rochdale was arrested with his aunt, cousins and four children while attempting to get into Syria. Scroll down for video . 'Seeking jihad': Two teenage boys from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, are believed to have fled to Syria to join Isis militants, seen here taking control of the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus . After the arrest, anti-terror police raided the home of his father, Shakil Ahmed, a respected Labour councillor for the town. Munshi's family comes from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, where his grandfather Yakub Munshi ran the town's sharia court. The schoolboy, who was studying for his GCSEs at Westborough High School in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, was traced through his online conversations with 'cyber terrorist' Aabid Hussain Khan. In one MSN chat, they argued how best to sneak a metal sword through airport security. Munshi had painstakingly scoured the internet for details on how to make napalm and grenades. He claimed he had only done the research out of curiosity but handwritten notes hidden under his bed revealed his burning desire to travel abroad to become a martyr. The boys are from the same town as London 7/7 suicide bomber Mohammed Siddique Khan (pictured) Munshi also had a library of videos, documents and audio clips showing acts of jihad, mujaheddin fighters and Al Qaeda preachings. He was arrested as he walked home from school after an exam. Khan, who acted as an administrator on an extremist website called Activion Publications, downloaded information on the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and Camilla, Prince Edward, the Countess of Wessex, The Duke of York and the Princess Royal. Munshi was convicted of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism. Khan was found guilty of possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism but cleared of a similar charge. A third man, Sultan Muhammad from Manningham, West Yorkshire - Khan's cousin - was convicted of three similar charges and one of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism.","Two 17-year-olds have not been in contact with families for several days .

"As someone who suffers from computer eye strain, I was alarmed to discover that prolonged exposure to gadgets such as iPhones and iPads can cause irreversible damage to the eyes. A Spanish expert, Dr Celia Sanchez-Ramos, has found the LED screens found in most electronic devices can harm the retina - the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye - and may even lead to partial blindness. Research has already shown that the intense levels of 'blue light' emitted from modern gadgets can cause a variety of health complaints, ranging from sleeping and eating problems to headaches and even cancer. Scroll down for video . LED screens found in most electronic devices such as iPhones and tablets can harm the retina - the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye - and may even lead to partial blindness, a doctor has warned . Now, Dr Sanchez-Ramos has discovered that it can also permanently damage the retina. In extreme cases, she says, it may even lead to macular degeneration, which causes dark patches to appear in the centre of the field of vision. According to Dr Sanchez-Ramos, modern LED screens, produced from about 2007 onwards, emit up to five times as much blue light as older technology. This matches my own experience, in which pre-2007 screens tend not to cause discomfort. The average adult now spends up to eight-and-a-half hours in front of a screen every day, and it is not uncommon to be exposed to multiple screens at once. For these reasons, says Dr Sanchez-Ramos, who is based at Complutense University in Madrid, the majority of people are likely to be in the danger zone. Children and the elderly are most at risk on account of their delicate eyes, as well as 'digital workers' and those - like me - who are especially sensitive to blue light. Dr Sanchez-Ramos (pictured) said: 'Never before in human history have we exposed our eyes to light that is so intense, for such long periods, from such an early age' 'Never before in human history have we exposed our eyes to light that is so intense, for such long periods, from such an early age,' she says. 'People who suffer from eye strain are like the canaries in the mineshaft, as they are aware of the damage being done. But it can affect anybody.' The damage, she explains, starts when the photoreceptors - types of neurone found in the retina that convert light into information - begin to die out due to the prolonged saturation of blue light. This puts strain on other parts of the eye, leading to increasing levels of inflammation, discomfort and pain. Eventually, the concentration of blue light in the centre of the retina, an area known as the macula, may cause it to be permanently damaged, leading to visual disorders. However the problem can be remedied by using special screen filters or glasses designed to block blue light, which are available through opticians. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney, clinical adviser at the College of Optometrists, says: 'It has been proven that intense exposure to blue light kills cells in the retina, and it is a perfectly reasonable possibility that it can cause macular degeneration over a period of time. 'More research is needed to prove it to the scientific standard. We need to conduct studies on a large number of people over a long period of time. 'But the proposal is of great interest.' Dr Sanchez-Ramos carried out experiments at the University of Madrid in which human retinal cells, taken from volunteers, were exposed to cycles of LED light of different intensities. She found that exposure to intense blue light caused apoptosis, or cell death. However this was reduced by 83 per cent when a special protective filter was placed between the cells and the light. Based on this research, she designed a screen filter called ' Reticare ', which converts harmful blue light to a gentler frequency more akin to sunshine. Dr Sanchez-Ramos found that exposure to intense blue light caused cell death in the eye. However this was reduced by 83 per cent when a special protective filter was placed between the cells and the light . Her findings prompted her to design a screen filter called ' Reticare ', which converts harmful blue light to a gentler frequency more akin to sunshine . Other treatments are also available. In 2013, Barnard Levit optometrists in London, who are specialists in the field, tested my eyes using a machine called a Colorimeter. Following this, they designed a pair of glasses with a blue tint, which blocked the most harmful part of the colour spectrum. The harmful effects of exposure to gadgets is linked to the high levels of 'blue light', also known as 'short wavelength light', that is emitted by modern screens. According to researchers at Harvard Medical School , 'not all colours of light have the same effect'. In particular, blue wavelengths, which are emitted by most electronic devices produced from 2007 onwards, have been shown to have 'adverse health effects'. Modern LED screens emit up to five times as much blue light as older technology. Researchers have found that using an electronic gadget with a backlit display for just two hours can affect the production of melatonin - the chemical that controls our body clock - and cause sleep problems, particularly in teenagers. A study at Chicago's Northwestern University revealed that prolonged exposure to blue light stimulated the sensation of hunger, even directly after meals, making it a contributor to weight gain and obesity. And experts at the University of Connecticut found a link between cancer and the use of gadgets that emit blue light in the evenings and by night. In addition, Dr Sanchez-Ramos has found that exposure to blue light can damage the retina causing macular degeration, or partial blindness. Children and young adults are at greater risk, as they lack the natural protection against blue light that the human eye naturally acquires. The effects can be reduced by the use of protective filters or spectacles. Prior to this, I had been unable to use iPhones, iPads and other gadgets with LED screens without shooting pain in my eyes, dizziness and nausea. This condition is known as Meares-Irlen syndrome or 'visual stress'. It is thought to be caused by hypersensitivity to particular frequencies of light, whether blue, red or green. In response, the visual cortex - the part of the brain responsible for processing visual information - generates too much electrical activity. This spills over into different areas of the brain, causing a variety of symptoms. About 10 per cent of people with dyslexia are thought to have visual stress. It can also be found in those with autism, ADHD, migraine, photo-sensitive epilepsy and multiple sclerosis, as well as stroke victims. Unusually for a sufferer of the condition, I have none of the related conditions listed above. When I used the blue glasses, however, I found that my eye pain, dizziness and nausea all but disappeared when using LED screens. I later discovered the glasses did not work with every type of screen, possibly because some emit different frequencies of harmful light. When I road-tested one of Dr Sanchez-Ramos' filters, I found my symptoms were reduced significantly on all devices, though the blue spectacles were more effective with certain screens. Dr Sanchez-Ramos says the use of LED screens has become so ubiquitous in such a short period of time that in 20 years' time, severe eye problems could become widespread. She and her colleagues are lobbying Apple, Samsung and other technology manufacturers to make their screens friendlier to the eye, meaning that no protective filters would be needed. This, she says, is an uphill struggle because super-bright screens make more of an impact on the customer, which encourages sales. She has also been putting pressure on various European governments, on both a national and regional level. As a result, a number of Spanish local authorities have ruled that all schools under their jurisdiction must use protective screen filters. Reticare filters are now available online and cost between €12.95 and €49, depending on the size of the screen.","Key culprit is the LED screens found in most electronic devices .

"Britain struck oil in the Falklands yesterday, a discovery likely to escalate already heightened tensions with Argentina over the ownership of the islands. Above, troops walk across the island in 1982 . Britain struck oil in the Falklands yesterday, a discovery likely to escalate already heightened tensions with Argentina over the ownership of the islands. After nine months of exploratory drilling, a group of British companies found oil and gas in a remote field north of the islands. The bonanza, which could be worth billions of pounds, will add to fears of renewed conflict over the British overseas territory just days after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned of a ‘very live threat’ from Argentina. The discovery at the Zebedee exploratory well comes amid worsening relations with Buenos Aires, exactly 33 years after Argentina invaded the islands. Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, said last night the find would lead to further claims by the Argentinians over the long-disputed territory in the South Atlantic. ‘The rhetoric and sabre-rattling from Argentina will grow,’ he added. ‘The Argentinians have always been worried we will find oil and, given their economic state, they will think, “We should have it”. ‘We will have to be careful. The only way to stop them (acting) is to ensure we have sufficient military there. The rhetoric from Argentina will get worse.' Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, leading to a conflict that cost 260 British and 650 Argentine lives. The South American state still claims territorial rights to the islands. Britain pledged last week to invest £180million over the next ten years to defend the islands, with an upgrade of a surface-to-air missile system and the deployment of two Chinook helicopters. The commitment came after it was revealed earlier this year that Russia could be helping to re-arm Argentina. Scroll down for video . Yesterday’s discovery, which could yield 100 million barrels of oil, was announced by the British firms that share the exploration area, Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas. Malcolm Graham-Wood, an oil industry expert and founder of the consultancy HydroCarbon Capital, said: ‘This is good for Britain, good for British oil companies, good for taxes and good for the industry.’ The latest incident sees a heightening of tensions between Argentina and Britain over the Falklands. Pictured is the bombing of the Sir Galahad Troop Carrier, after it was hit by a missile . A map shows the oil has been discovered 130 north of the island by British companies at the Zebedee oil well . Samuel Moody, chief executive of Rockhopper, which is named after the southern rockhopper penguins found on the islands, said: ‘This is a fantastic start to the 2015 Falklands drilling campaign and provides early proof of the significant remaining potential of the North Falkland Basin.’ Shares in the oil-exploration companies initially soared to double digits after the discovery was announced. The row over the sovereignty of the islands, which Argentina calls Malvinas, could be intensified by the oil find. However, Mr Graham-Wood said: ‘Oil is always found in difficult places, geographically and politically – look at Alaska, for instance – but that has never worried the oil industry.’ Oil expert Charlie Sharp, of the investment bank Canaccord Genuity, said the Zebedee discovery was ‘an excellent start to the exploration campaign’. It follows another made nearby in 2012 through a project called Sea Lion, but the price of oil has halved since June, forcing many explorers to cut back on spending. Experts also predict future finds could be even more significant. Stephane Foucaud, oil analyst at First Energy, said the latest discovery is ‘encouraging news’, but another well – called Isobel Deep, 15 miles to the south – is the ‘most important’ in the area. War veterans sing the national anthem and hold the Argentinian flag during a ceremony marking the 33rd anniversary of the start of the Falklands War. Argentina has now written to the UN about British 'aggression' Mr Fallon said last week that existing defences in the Falklands would be modernised, with investment in ‘ageing infrastructure’ and an upgrade of the surface-to-air missile system. It came after news that Russian president Vladimir Putin was reportedly working on a deal to lease 12 Sukhoi Su-24 bombers to Argentina. Intelligence chiefs warned that Argentina could land forces on a remote island, and that commanders needed support helicopters to enable infantry to react to any threat.","British companies found oil and gas in a remote field north of the islands .

"After almost 70 years working in the gossip and entertainment industry, legendary writer and columnist Liz Smith is naming names. The 92-year-old, who started her career in New York City when she was just 25, is sharing a few big scoops that were too scandalous to print over the course of her storied career at papers including the New York Post and New York Daily News. What's more, many of those whose secrets Smith is spilling are from her closest friends, including Barry Diller, who she claims asked her over 20 years ago: 'Do you think I should come out?' Scroll down for videos . Liz Smith is spilling celebrity secrets that she never printed over the course of her 70 year career . Smith claims IAC chairman Barry Diller asked her in 1992: 'Do you think I should come out?' but that he 'worships' his wife Diane Von Furstenberg (above) Smith tells The Hollywood Reporter that this conversation came in the wake of David Geffen, another high profile executive, revealing he was gay in 1992. The gossip columnist claims she advised Diller, the chairman of media company IAC, against it, telling him; 'No, Barry, David Geffen needs to come out. He needs a big story or a scandal or a fight to push him in business and make people afraid of him.' She then added; 'People are already afraid of you. So what will you gain? And also, you like women.' The 'women' Smith was referring to is actually just  woman: famed fashion designer and creator of the wrap dress, Diane von Fürstenberg, whom Smith says Diller 'worships.' Now seen by many as the quintessential New York couple, the pair married in 2001, and are constantly seen out together, though they maintain separate residences.They have been together since the 1970s. She lives above her flagship store in the city's trendy Meatpacking District, while he is very much uptown with a residence at the posh Carlyle Hotel. Diller did not respond to a request for comment. Barbara Walters (above) was a good friend claims Smith, but lost interest in the gossip writer when her newspaper column at the New York Post was cut . Smith, a lesbian, has been with her partner Iris Love (above) for years . This outing of Diller comes as a bit of a surprise, especially after Smith herself was outed by New York publicist Bobby Zarem, who once mailed invitations to members of the media and Social Register alike announcing that she and longtime partner Iris Love were tying the knot. 'It was more of an annoyance than anything. People sent me gifts that I had to return,' she says. 'He hated me for some reason, but he couldn't take me down. I was too popular by then.' Smith previously teased a planned coming out by Rosie O'Donnell, who Smith says 'loses her temper at everything,' in 1997. Ultimately, the talk show host decided against making her sexuality public at that time. This created a very big stir as many began to assume it was Oprah Winfrey who would be announcing she was a lesbian. The rumors became so prevalent following Smith's blind item that Winfrey eventually did publicly come out - as heterosexual. It seems Smith also has somewhat tense relationships with even her closest friends, including iconic television news journalist Barbara Walters. 'Well, it turns out Barbara Walters can do without me, though I still consider her a friend,' reveals Smith. 'She has done so much for me through the years. But when I lost my column and my power, she kind of lost interest in me.' Smith says that two of her closest friends were former Texas Governor Ann Richard (left) and Broadway legend Elaine Stritch (right) Smith has a few Hollywood friends, among them Renee Zellwegger, Helen Mirren and Winfrey - but it is three women who are no longer alive that she seems to have been closest to. Elizabeth Taylor and Smith became friends at the beginning of their respective careers. Smith, who says she 'loved' Taylor, also became close with the actress' longtime partner Richard Burton, and she credits that relationship and the access it allowed her with helping to catapult her career. 'They trusted me and eventually I became the only journalist who could get to them,' said Smith of the pair. Her other two lifelong pals were Texas Governor Ann Richard, who Smith said 'elected herself to be my best friend,' and Broadway legend Elaine Stritch. Smith reveals that Stritch, who passed away in 2013, was just as chaste as she has always claimed to be in her younger years. In fact, when Stritch was with Marlon Brando, he told Smith: 'Liz, Elaine just keeps letting me kiss her but she won't go any further.' Smith then relayed this message to her friend, adding of men: 'They aren't satisfied with just kissing. So you have to stop being a prude or just end it.' None of her relationships however may be more interesting then the one she shares with fellow New Yorker Bette Midler, and which began when the young singer called her up to let her know how upset she was that Smith had revealed she was dating an up and coming artist Barry Manilow. 'She called me up, furious, saying, ""I don't want to be in your f***ing column!"" Which was an odd thing to hear from someone just starting a career in show business,' says Smith. The two are now so close now that Midler used her pull as founder of the New York Restoration Project, a non-profit committed to revitalizing neighborhood parks, to name a city park in Harlem after Smith. Smith's pal Bette Midler (above) used her pull to get a New York City park named after the writer . And while that is all well and good, Smith is still a little steamed from what she perceives as one very major slight. 'I was never asked to be a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,' she says. 'For 50 years, I've done as much for Hollywood as anybody. I'm disappointed Hollywood didn't love me enough to recognize that.' Smith has also had her share of enemies, something that no doubt comes with the territory when reporting gossip, but it is a famed society woman who truly rubbed the writer the wrong way. Lee Radziwill, known by most as the sister of Jackie Kennedy Onasis but some as the mother-in-law of Real Housewives of New York star and author Carole Radziwill, landed on Smith's bad side when she refused to help their friend Truman Capote after he was taken to court by Gore Vidal. Capote had claimed Vidal was asked to leave the White House due to his drunken behavior, and Vidal, who spent most of his early years at war with Capote, sued him for libel. Radziwill had shared the story with Capote, one of her closest friends, but refused to acknowledge that during the trial. Making matters worse, Capote ended up losing the lawsuit. As for Radziwill, her response to it all was; 'Oh, Liz, what do we care; they're just a couple of f**s! They're disgusting.' Smith claims she never spoke to her again. Smith names Lee Radziwill (left with sister Jackie Kennedy Onasis) as one of her least favorite people after she called their friend Truman Capote (right) a 'fag' The current crop of Hollywood stars are also of little interest to Smith, save Taylor Swift. She compares the singer to Lana Turner, but quickly adds she has no interest in hearing her music catalog. As for regrets, the woman who has broken some of the most scandalous stories of this decade says their is one thing she wishes she had been better about - managing her money. This despite the fact that she at one point was taking home over a million dollars a year. 'Yeah, but a million goes quicker than you think,' says Smith.","Liz Smith, 92, is spilling celebrity secrets that she never printed over the course of her 70-year career .

"Kyle Patrick Loughlin from Massachusetts has been charged with sexually assaulting two young boys at a daycare center where he worked . A 21-year-old college student from Massachusetts has been charged with sexually assaulting two young boys at a daycare center where he worked. Kyle Patrick Loughlin, who was enrolled at Bridgewater State University on an early childhood education course, was arrested on Tuesday night after reportedly admitting that he'd molested two boys aged between four and five. Police told The Boston Globe that they then proceeded to search Loughlin's dorm room where they found more than 100 pairs of children's underwear and diapers. The student allegedly said that he started feeling an attraction to young boys as a teenager and he sometimes wrote 'sexually charged fantasy stories' involving children. Authorities later removed a computer and other evidence from the suspect's family home. According to WCVB News, an investigation was launched into the supposed child abuse case last week after one of the children's parents  filed a complaint. There had also been reports relating to Loughlin's 'suspicious behavior', where he apparently got too close to some of the infants in his care. Despite his admittance, Loughlin pleaded 'not guilty' in court on Friday to counts of raping a child and aggravated indecent assault and battery. He will now be held without bail until a dangerousness hearing next week and can't be reached for comment. It's unknown who represents him. University spokeswoman Eva Gaffney says Loughlin was one of several students working at the licensed center and had passed a required background check. Scene of the incident: There had also been reports relating to Loughlin's 'suspicious behavior', where he allegedly got too close to some of the infants in his care . The daycare facility center serves children from age two years and nine months to six years and has a capacity of up to 30 children. Loughlin apparently told police he worked at the center bi-weekly for a total of seven hours but it was not clear how long he had been employed. Other students who worked with him described him as 'socially awkward' and 'extremely strange'. Gaffney says that parents have been informed about the case involving Loughlin and staff will be on hand to address any concerns. The state's child welfare agency is investigating.","Kyle Patrick Loughlin was enrolled at Bridgewater State University .

"A freezer trawler has sunk in a peninsula off the coast of Russia, killing at least 56 crew members. A massive rescue operation involving more than 1,300 people is now underway after the ship, carrying an international crew of 132, sank in the Sea of Okhotsk in just 15 minutes. Rescued crew members reported that the ship, called the Dalny Vostock, was unstable because of empty fuel tanks and a lack of ballast as it sailed through the Kamchatka Peninsula. The Russian freezer trawler, called the Dalny Vostok, that sank while carrying 132 crew members at 4am on Thursday morning local time. At least 54 bodies have been recovered in the huge rescue operation . Map showing the location of the disaster. There are 13 members of the crew are still missing after the trawler tipped over when a fishing net was pulled in, a regional governor told Russian television on Thursday . It tipped over when a fishing net weighing 80 tons was pulled in, said Oleg Kozhemyako, acting governor of the nearby Sakhalin region. Kozhemyako's comments on Russian television came after the federal Investigative Committee said it was considering all possible causes for the sinking, but it was likely that the trawler hit 'an object' floating in the sea, perhaps drifting ice. More than 26 fishing boats in the area have helped to rescue members of the crew, but have also recovered 56 bodies. The disaster happened at around 4am local time, and the trawler did not send any distress signals before it sank, the Interfax News Agency said. Early reports added that the Dalny Vostok sank in just 15 minutes after its engine compartment had been flooded. So far 63 people have been rescued, with survivors suffering from hypothermia and other injuries being airlifted to hospital. At the latest count there are 13 people still missing. An emergency services representative told local media that two of the bodies were found on Thursday evening - one in a lifeboat 105 kilometres (65 miles) away, and the other in the water nearby. Those saved had managed to get into lifeboats and some had put on wet suits. The Russian Emergencies Ministry sent an Mi-8 helicopter with rescuers and doctors aboard to treat and transport rescued crew members to hospitals in the city of Magadan, it said on its website. A rescuer uses a satellite phone while onboard a helicopter as they fly over the Sea of Okhotsk scouring the waters for survivors. Around 1,300 fishermen and emergency staff are involved in the rescue operation . A Russian Emergencies Ministry ship looks for survivors after the Dalny Vostock sank. Temperatures in the water can dip to as low as -2 degrees celsius, and so far it is confirmed that 56 crew members have drowned . A telephone hotline for families of the crew has also been set up. Among the 132 crew members, 78 are from Russia, 42 from Myanmar and the rest from Latvia, Ukraine and Vanuatu. Pyotr Osichansky, president of the Far Eastern Association of Sea Captains, told Russian television that when the trawler last docked in Russia, in January, it had fewer than 70 crew members. The additional crew members were most likely picked up in Pusan, South Korea, and were working illegally, he said. The Sea of Okhotsk is the coldest sea in East Asia with the air temperature plummeting to -20 degrees Celsius in the winter months. Following the tragedy 63 people have been rescued, but the bodies of 56 sailors have been pulled from the freezing sea. Early reports say the trawler sank in 15 minutes when its engine room was flooded . Between October and April the area the area is 'constantly' covered with ice and there is very little rain, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Survivors of the incident are reportedly being interviewed as well as the owners of the trawler, as the police start investigating the disaster. It is understood they are questioning whether there was a violation of safety procedures that led to more deaths, a report in Russia Today said. The 100-metre long trawler was built in 1989 and was equipped to freeze and can fish.","Trawler was carrying 132 crew members when it sank in Sea of Okhotsk .

"When it comes to pulling out wobbly teeth, some people may reach for the pliers, while others might go for the tried and tested door handle trick. However, professional wrestler Robert Abercrombie - known as Rob Venomous in the ring - took a different approach when he tied his son James's tooth to the back of his muscle car. A video Mr Abercrombie posted online shows him revving up the engine of his red Chevrolet Camero before powering forward, pulling his son's front tooth clean out. Professional wrestler Robert Abercrombie, who goes by the name of Rob Venomous, uploaded this video of him pulling out his eight-year-old son's wobbly tooth with a Chevy muscle car . According to posts on Mr Abercrombie's Facebook page, his son James had been asking him for days to perform the DIY removal before he gave in . After the car stops, James, eight, can be seen running up to the camera with blood smudged across his other teeth, saying excitedly: 'It came out!' According to posts on his Facebook page, James had been asking Mr Abercrombie for several days to extract the tooth using his car before he finally relented. Mr Abercrombie's fiancee Bianca Huertas, to whom he has been engaged since 2010, seems to have been less keen on the idea, but eventually gave in, saying: 'Boys will be boys'. In the footage Mr Abercrombie can be seen climbing into his Camero before revving up the engine and lurching forward, pulling James's tooth clean out . At the end of the video the boy can be seen running up to the camera showing off his toothy, if slightly bloodstained, grin - exclaiming 'it came out!' Since it was first posted four days ago, the video has gone viral, attracting more than 3million views and has been reposted across the globe. This is not the first time a car has been used to pull out a child's tooth, after another youngster in Utah used his remote control monster truck to remove the wobbly incisor. The boy, known as Striker Stanger, from Harrisville, is seen sitting in the hallway of his home with a piece of string attached to the miniature truck, and the other end to his tooth. The video is believed to have been shot by Bianca Fuertas (left), Mr Abercrombie's fiancee to whom he has been engaged since 2010. He is pictured right with his eldest son James, who features in the video . Asked by his mother what his is trying to do, he says: 'I'm going to take this remote, the truck's going to go all the way forward to dad . . . and I'm going to see if I can pull my tooth out.' He then presses forward on the remote control, and to his surprise, the truck manages to dislodge his tooth. 'Oh my gosh, It did it!' he exclaims before running towards the camera to show off his new grin. It is not the first time a child has been shown using a car to pull a loose tooth out - although on this previous occasion it was only a remote controlled monster truck . Striker Stanger, from Utah, uploaded this video to YouTube which shows him using his toy truck to free one of his front teeth .","Robert Ambercrombie, a professional wrestler, shot video outside home .

"A teenager has died after falling off the roof of a six-story Bronx building as he fled police officers who were responding to complaints of a group smoking marijuana and loitering. Hakeem Kuta, 17, was on life support and passed away Saturday morning after succumbing injuries from the fall that happened on Thursday night, said the New York Police Department.

Officers had chased Kuta and five other teenagers up the stairs after complaints that they were smoking marijuana in the lobby of the building located on Valentine Avenue in Mott Haven, said spokesman Stephen Davis. When the officers got to the roof, some teens jumped to another roof and ran away, however Kuta and his 14-year-old companion, who has not been named, were pinned in by a dividing wall. Police said Kuta then jumped over a three-foot high wall without realizing there was a gap between the buildings. His friend tried to help by desperately holding onto his jacket as Kuta dangled 60 feet from the ground above an alleyway, according to ABC 7.

The four episodes in February were watched a total of 9,047,000 times while episode two alone was watched 2,645,000 times . Figures for March are expected to see a sharp decline, the Telegraph reports, since only two episodes of Top Gear were shown before Clarkson’s dramatic suspension. On Tuesday, the BBC confirmed Top Gear's £10million live world tour will go ahead with Jeremy Clarkson at the helm alongside fellow presenters James May and Richard Hammond. A BBC Worldwide spokesman said they will fulfil the series of live shows which have already sold 200,000 tickets worldwide - but added that the events will be stripped of all BBC branding and content and billed as Clarkson, Hammond and May Live. That means the shows, which will take place in venues as far afield as Australia, Norway, and South Africa as well as the UK, will not be able to use clips from the show or feature The Stig.

Last Wednesday, BBC director-general Tony Hall announced that Clarkson, a popular but divisive figure during his time at the hugely successful BBC2 motoring show, would not be retained, saying 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Mr Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in a 30-second assault on March 4 and took himself to hospital with his injuries. He was also verbally abused by the former Top Gear presenter. Clarkson reported the incident to the BBC five days later and was suspended on March 10.

"A Philadelphia woman was arrested Friday on charges she tried to join and martyr herself for the Islamic State group, a day after two women in New York were charged with plotting to wage jihad by building a bomb and using it for a Boston Marathon-type attack. Keonna Thomas, 30, was preparing to travel overseas to fight with the terror group, authorities said, but instead was arrested at her home. Authorities said that she communicated with an Islamic State group fighter in Syria who asked if she wanted to be part of a martyrdom operation and that she told the fighter that the opportunity 'would be amazing,' according to the documents. 'I can make that wish come true,' the fighter reportedly replied. She appeared in court this afternoon dressed entirely in black, with just her eyes showing, and will remain in custody until her next appearance on April 8. Scroll down for video . Keonna Thomas was arrested in Philadelphia (above) Friday as she tried to join ISIS . Thomas' home (above), which had been under surveillance by FBI for the past week, had American flags lined up outside . She also actively spoke of her desires on a Twitter account that has since been removed. 'I see why the mujahideen [violent jihadi fighters] Sacrifice Dunya [life on earth] for Akhirah [the afterlife] there's no comparison,' read one tweet according to NBC 4. Another said; 'Only thing I'm jealous of is when I see the smiles of shuhadaa [martyrs].' Her home, which had been under surveillance by FBI for the past week, had American flags lined up outside. In one exchange with the fighter, they discussed how he would shoot or behead his wife if she turned out to be a spy. 'Cutting head is more personal,' Thomas replied. It's unclear if she has a lawyer who could comment on the charges. She is due to make an initial appearance in federal court Friday afternoon. Thomas' arrest comes a day after two women were arrested in New York in another home-grown terror case. They are accused of plotting to wage violent jihad by building a homemade bomb and using it for an attack like the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. The women were ordered held without bail after a brief court appearance Thursday. The lawyer for one of them said his client will plead not guilty. Thomas is charged with providing material aid to terrorists, one of the same charges filed in 2010 against another Pennsylvania woman, Colleen LaRose, known as Jihad Jane, and two co-defendants in a terror plot that prosecutors say also involved online messages and recruitment for overseas terror suspects. Thomas' posts in support of the Islamic State started in August 2013, when she reposted a Twitter photograph of a boy holding weapons, authorities charged. She called herself Fatayat Al Khilafah and YoungLioness and tweeted posts such as ""When you're a mujahid, your death becomes a wedding,"" according to the FBI affidavit filed in the case. A mujahid is one who engages in jihad. She soon began trying to raise money for the cause online and told a Somalia-based jihadi fighter from Minnesota that she soon hoped to have enough money to travel, authorities said. She applied for a passport in February and bought a ticket to travel to Barcelona on March 29, the affidavit said. Authorities would not immediately say why she had not made the trip. She is facing up to 15 years in prison. In the Jihadi Jane case, LaRose got a 10-year term in January for agreeing to kill Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who drew a cartoon that had offended Muslims, while another American woman, Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, got eight years. An immigrant teen from Pakistan got five years.","Keonna Thomas was arrested in Philadelphia Friday as she tried to join ISIS .

Identical twins Marcus and Markieff Morris, who both play forward for the Phoenix Suns, are now the focus of an investigation into a felony aggravated assault which allegedly occurred in January.

No charges have been filed and no arrests have been made, but a Maricopa County Attorney's Office spokesman confirmed prosecutors are continuing to review the case submitted by police, the Arizona Republic reported. The alleged assault happened around 7:30pm on Saturday, January 24, outside the central Phoenix gym, according to CBS5-TV. Hood, 36, told police he knows the twins from when he mentored them while they were growing up in Philadelphia and that he used to support them financially until they had a 'falling out'. He told police he sent a text telling the twins' mother, Thomasine Morris, he'd 'always be there for her' and that another friend, Julius Kane, 25, saw the message and concluded their relationship was sexual in nature. The twins, 25, who are basically inseparable at all times, prefer to be called Team FOE (Family Over Everything) Hood told police he sent a text telling the twins' mother, Thomasine (pictured) he would 'always be there for her' The former basketball player showed police photographs of himself with the twins. In addition to the twins, who like to be called Team FOE (Family Over Everything), Hood also said Kane helped carry out the assault against him. During the reported confrontation, Hood told police he was held down, punched in the head, kicked and then beaten to the point of unconsciousness after he was able to briefly escape. Following the assault, witnesses told police they saw five subjects flee in a Rolls-Royce Phantom. The twin brothers both declined to comment after Phoenix lost to the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night . After the assault, witnesses told police they saw five subjects flee in a Rolls-Royce Phantom (example pictured) Police say five suspects assaulted Hood at the Nina Mason Pulliam Recreation & Sports Complex (pictured) The Morris twins previously denied assaulting Hood . Hood ended up with abrasions, a large knot on his head and a broken nose. The woman he was with corroborated his story and also identified the twins and Kane. The Morris twins have denied assaulting Hood, but Markieff did admit being at the game because he sponsors one of the teams with Marcus. They both declined to comment after their loss to the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night. Markieff and Marcus live together, have the same tattoos, the same agent and recently signed a four-year extension worth $52million which they were allowed to divvy up however they wanted, Rolling Stone reported. (Markieff is now getting $8million a year and Marcus is getting $5million.) Marcus, who is younger by seven minutes, said: 'We've been like this since we were young. 'We've always been doing everything together. 'Whether it's kickball, baseball, whatever – we've always been together.' Before the NBA, the twins attended Kansas University where they both majored in American Studies and took every single class together.","Identical twins Marcus and Markieff Morris, 25, play for the Phoenix Suns .

"In its turbulent 800 year history, Hay Castle has been besieged, set ablaze and become a frequent target for marauding Welsh rebels. But now the medieval stronghold that has already endured so much is at risk of falling to a new army of invaders… which each measure less than half an inch long. An infestation of deathwatch beetles is putting the imposing castle, which towers above the town of Hay-on-Wye on the Welsh border, at peril. Threat: Hay Castle is infested with deathwatch beetles burrowing in to its timber frames . A £5 million battle plan has been launched to repel the insect attackers, with structural engineers and historical building specialists hoping to repair the damage. The Hay Castle Trust, which is co-ordinating the renovation plans, has already received £500,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund and will claim a further £4.9m once they have raised £1.5m from independent sources. Tests have shown the wood-boring beetles are active in the castle’s timbers. The damage is caused by their larvae, which burrow inside the wood, weakening them as they go. The adult beetles live for only a few weeks, but the larvae stage of their life cycle can last for up to 13 years. Hay Castle was built in the late 12th century by the powerful Norman Lord William de Braose and has been added to through the ages. Historic: But the 800-year-old mansion needs a major overhaul to eliminate the threat posed by the beetles . Project: Hay Castle has launched a fundraising drive to ensure its future in the fact of the insect threat . It was sacked by Llewelyn II, the last prince of Wales, in 1233, and rebuilt by Henry III. It was damaged by fire during the rebellion of Welsh chieftain Owain Glyndwr in 1401 and sacked again in 1460. The remains of the castle include a four-storey Norman keep and gateway, a Jacobean mansion was built alongside the tower in 1660, and Victorian terraced gardens. The rescue plan also includes tackling the rambling ivy which is further putting parts of it at risk of collapse after damaging the stonework. Juliet Aston, from historic building specialists Rick Mather Architects, said: ‘The most vulnerable part of the building is the derelict part of the mansion which hasn’t had a roof since 1939. ‘It’s hanging on by hook and by crook. Ivy is holding it together but destroying it at the same time. The walls are flapping about and are not stable. Invader: Deathwatch beetles like this one are living in the timber of the medieval building . ‘When the restoration project is finished it’s hoped it will be possible for visitors to stroll around the castle walls and enjoy a bird’s eye view from the top.’ The walls of the keep, are however, said to remain solid. The plans to restore the castle to its former glory include new driveways, cafe, restaurant, library, a study area and exhibition and display areas. Deathwatch beetles get their name from tapping or ticking sound often heard in the rafters of old buildings. The adult beetles make the noise to attract mates. It is said to be associated with the vigil kept beside dying people. The adult beetles measure 7mm long, and the larvae 11mm. The castle was since the 1960s owned by Richard Booth, the bookseller whose antics turned Hay on Wye in a ‘town of books’ and venue for a famous literary festival, until it was purchased in 2011 by the Hay Castle Trust.","Hay Castle on the Welsh borders faces infestation of deathwatch beetles .

"An airport worker has been awarded $40 million in compensation for a freak runway accident which left him paralyzed from the waist down more than seven years ago. Brandon Afoa, 33, of Puyallup, Washington, was operating a tug to push aircraft at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when the brakes and steering failed, causing him to crash into a luggage lift. The incident, which took place at 2am on December 26, 2007, left Afoa unable to use his legs or right arm. Much of his intestinal tract also had to be removed by surgeons. Afoa went on to sue Port of Seattle - which owns and operates the Sea-Tac airport - in King County Superior Court, saying that the company failed to maintain a safe workplace. Closure: An airport worker has been awarded $40 million in compensation for a freak runway accident which left him paralyzed from the waist down more than seven years ago . But for years the case was locked in the courts because the Port of Seattle claimed it wasn't liable for what happened as Afoa worked for a private firm. In a bid to move things forward, the state supreme court finally ruled in 2013 that the airport had a 'duty' to provide a safe working environment. On Tuesday a King County jury awarded Afoa $40 million because of what the incident has done to his life. Indeed, the paraplegic needs round-the-clock help from caregivers just to survive. In the courtroom a panel was shown video footage of Afoa being craned from his bed by a special lift to a commode and undergoing therapy. Jurors went on to apportion 25per cent of the blame for the accident to the Port of Seattle. Meanwhile, a number of airlines which weren’t part of the lawsuit will pay the rest of the money owed. This is because they had contracts with Afoa's previous employer - Evergreen Aviation Ground Logistics Enterprises - which has since gone out of business. Commenting on the outcome, Afoa told KOMO-TV: 'It was a relief and I'm very thankful for the jury for making an awesome decision.' In a statement, the Port of Seattle expressed its sympathies to Afoa and his family for the accident. The agency says it's reviewing the decision. If it decides to appeal the verdict, it could delay payment of Afoa's award.","Brandon Afoa, 33, of Puyallup was operating a tug to push back aircraft at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when the brakes and steering failed, causing him to crash into a luggage lift .

"Baby Malakai has been alive for seven months and he's never left the hospital. The newborn cannot see, cannot hear and struggles to breath. Doctors say he may not ever be able to walk. Having been diagnosed with a rare medical condition known as Pallister Killian Syndrome (PKS), his mother had to give up her job in Perth in order to provide full-time care for her son. Without an income, Stacy Maitai has been forced to survive on welfare funding of $90 a week to support her baby and her seven-year-old daughter. And the 28-year-old is not eligible for further financial assistance from Centrelink as she is not an Australian citizen. Scroll down for video . Baby Malakai (pictured) has been alive for seven months and he's never left the walls of the hospital . Mother Stacy Maitai had to give up her job in Perth in order to care for her son full-time . The newborn cannot see, cannot hear and struggles to breath. Doctors say he may not be able to walk . About 15 to 20 cases of PKS are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of Australia . PKS is a rare chromosomal disorder which affects about 200 people worldwide and 15 those cases are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome Foundation of Australia. It is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications such as developmental delays, seizures and congenital heart defects. Ms Maitai has told of the heartbreaking moment she learnt about her son's condition. 'I wanted to commit suicide because I thought it was all my fault,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But then I found myself having to choose whether to escape all this and give up my son or be strong for my children by moving forward and staying with them every step of the way. 'It's been a difficult journey so far but also a blessing because I have found hope in Malakai and I know he will make it through.' The condition is often undiagnosed during pregnancy and is identified at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complication . Ms Maitai said she was heartbroken when she learnt about her son's condition . A fundraising page was set up to help the struggling family on mycause , so far raising more than $18,000 . While Ms Maitai juggles her time between the hospital with Malakai (left) and at home her seven-year-old daughter Serenity (right) The single mother says she is trying her best to keep food on the table but was given an eviction notice after being $4000 behind in her rent for her three-bedroom home, which costs $380 . While Ms Maitai juggles her time between the hospital with Malakai and at home with her seven-year-old daughter Serenity, the financial strain of being without a job and dependent on $90 from welfare is taking its toll. The single mother says she is trying her best to keep food on the table but was given an eviction notice after being $4000 behind in her rent for her three-bedroom home, which costs $380 each week. A fundraising page on mycause was set up to help the struggling family, which at the time of publication raised more than $18,000. 'Our power was cut off and I thought we were going to be thrown onto the street,' Ms Maitai said. 'Luckily we've been able to use some of that fundraising money to take it straight to the real estate agent who was understanding enough to let us stay even though we had been behind in rent. 'You know, I came to Australia for a better life and I love it here. It's changed my life. I worked since moving here about four years ago and paid all my taxes. 'I was shocked when Centrelink told me I couldn't get any more assistance because I'm a Kiwi. 'With what I currently get every fortnight, it's hard to afford even just the basic things.' Not having grown up with a proper mother and father figure back in New Zealand, Ms Maitai is determined to give her children the life she never hard. 'I want to be a better parent and I want to be there for my kids,' she said. 'It's just a waiting game with Malakai and the doctors even asked me if I wanted to look after him even with his condition and I said yes. I chose to be there for him and he will make it through - I just know it.' Pallister Killian Syndrome, also known as PKS, is a rare chromosomal disorder. According to the PKS Foundation of Australia, about 200 to 300 cases of PKS have been reported worldwide. About 15 to 20 are known to be in Australia. 'Most of these cases have been diagnosed in the last five years with an increasing diagnosis rate,' the foundation states. The condition is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is more commonly discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications. Symptoms include: global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual impairment, seizures, marked hypotonia (floppiness), hearing and/or vision impairment, difficulty in feeding and oesophageal reflux, congenital heart defects, apnoea, prominent high forehead, coarse facial features as child gets older, broad nasal bridge, streaks or patches of lighter or darker skin, sparse hair or bald patches, high arched or cleft palate, shorter arms and legs, disproportionate to the body and extra nipples.","Baby boy Malakai suffers rare medical condition Pallister Killian Syndrome .

"Keith Cameron, pictured,  was jailed for five years for scamming his dying friend and neighbour out of his life savings . A conman has been jailed for fleecing a dying architect out of his life savings and using the money to fund his lavish lifestyle. Keith Cameron splashed out on a New York flat for his daughter and enjoyed a string of extravagant holidays while his victim's family have been left facing the prospect of selling their home. The 54-year-old scammed his trusting friend and terminally ill neighbour, Jonathan Speirs, out of £476,864 in a complicated ruse. He promised the world-famous lighting architect a £2million return on his investment in just two years, but it was all an elaborate lie. Cameron was today jailed for five years at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. But Jonathan's wife, Elizabeth, 58, said: 'My daughters and I will be dealing with the consequences of his crime both emotionally and financially for the rest of our lives.' Cameron stole the family's money and spent it on his extravagant lifestyle and a New York flat for his own daughter, who attended the American Academy of Drama and the Arts. Meanwhile, Jonathan's youngest daughter faces missing out on a place at her dream university in New York. Cameron persuaded terminally ill Jonathan - his close friend and neighbour for 13 years - to part with thousands of pounds by claiming his telecoms start-up required money to win a valuable contract. He repeatedly claimed the company was trading well and that Jonathan could expect a return on his investment of around £2 million within two years. Cameron, from Edinburgh, instead used his friend's cash to maintain a excessive lifestyle of posh restaurants and fancy holidays. Jonathan died of stomach cancer in 2012. His widow, Elizabeth, from Edinburgh, said Cameron's heartless scheme had stopped her daughter, Erin, 17, from following her dreams. She said: 'Keith Cameron deserved a lengthy prison sentence. I am glad the Sheriff chose to impose the maximum sentence on the fraud charge. 'However, no length of prison term will ever compensate for the dreadful crime he committed. 'My daughters and I will be dealing with the consequences of his crime both emotionally and financially for the rest of our lives. 'If Keith Cameron hadn't defrauded us, Erin could have followed her dreams. But we have to live with knowing that our money was spent on allowing Cameron's daughter to study in New York while my daughter can't. 'Despite having the academic qualifications and the ability to gain a place on this course, we'll probably have to turn it down because we can't afford the fees. Victims: Jonathan Speirs, a world-famous lighting architect, pictured with his wife Elizabeth, was persuaded to part with a total of £476,864 . 'This is so unfair and it's breaking my heart that I can't give her the education she has worked so hard for. 'I am struggling to come to terms with the depths of Keith Cameron's depravity now that I know the full details of how he deceived a dying man.' Elizabeth, a supply teacher, also revealed that Cameron had texted her asking to see her husband just days before he passed away in June 2012. Mr Speirs died of stomach cancer in 2012 after investing in his friends scam . The text read: 'Tell him I don't care what he looks like, he's a dear friend and that's all that matters.' Elizabeth said the family now faced being forced to sell off her home in Edinburgh where she had lived with her husband for 24 years. She said: 'It's still hard to believe that someone who, supposedly, was our friend could behave in such a cold-hearted fashion pretending to care about my husband and pretending to show grief at his funeral, whilst all the time he was knowingly spending our money on luxuries for his family - money we'd worked hard for. 'It fills me with horror to think that anyone could be so cruel and heartless towards a good, kind man but especially towards a man who was facing death. 'A lengthy prison sentence is totally justified.' Police Scotland Detective Inspector Arron Clinkscales added: 'Keith Cameron used his expertise and relationship to make his victim believe that this was a legitimate investment. 'To ensure that others do not fall foul of similar fraudulent activities I would urge the public to fully research any investment they are seeking to make. 'When considering making an investment, consider seeking financial and legal advice to ensure protection against fraudulent investments. 'If in any doubt, do not go ahead, and remember if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.' Mrs Speirs said she now faces selling off the home in Edinburgh she shared with her husband for 24 years.

"You’ve found the house of your dreams – but you want to make sure the costly nightmare of dry rot isn’t lurking under the carpets and skirting boards. The solution? Call in the dogs! The appropriately named Mark Doggett has trained his two animals to sniff out the destructive fungus in old houses where it can hide in places a person would miss. Mr Doggett gave up a ten-year career in construction after hitting on the idea to set up a business using the animals’ sense of smell, which is said to be up to a million times better than that of humans. Skilled: Meg and Jess, pictured with Mark Doggett, were trained for six months to sniff out dry rot . On the case: Four-year-old Border collie Meg gets down to work sniffing out the destructive fungus . When they find dry rot they stop, stare at it and point with their nose, only moving from the affected area when Mr Doggett gives them a special signal . After six months of training, four-year-old border collie Meg and 22-month-old English springer spaniel Jess went to work. When they find dry rot they stop, stare at it and point with their nose, only moving from the affected area when Mr Doggett gives them a special signal. The businessman, 30, from Wolverhampton, whose company is called Enviro-Dogs, said: ‘We’re unique in offering a dry rot detection service using dogs to the public. The dogs can go out to domestic properties or surveyors can hire us as part of their report. Dry rot is wood decay caused by the fungus Serpula lacrymans that digests the parts of the wood which give it strength. By the time there are visible signs, serious damage will have been done. It begins as a microscopic spore but the final stage is a fruiting body which pumps out new spores. Once airborne they can damage all parts of a property, penetrating brickwork and concrete floors seeking a wood source. If not treated, it can destroy a building. “It’s not really work for the dogs – they see it as the best game in the world and they enjoy it because it’s working on their natural instincts. The dogs are so effective because they can detect dry rot at much earlier stages. ‘In hidden places dry rot can grow for years without anyone noticing it. It can be hard to find but the dogs can detect it through carpet and wall panelling. ‘It takes a couple of minutes for the dog to search a room. People are slightly dubious when they first hear about us but after seeing what we can do they’re amazed.’ Prices start at £200 for a call-out and the business has been so successful Mr Doggett plans to expand it by training the dogs to hunt out bed bugs for hotels and hospitals.

Thousands of bacteria colonies were discovered on banknotes and coins chosen at random from scientists’ pockets. The experiment, which involved treating the coins and notes in a substance that allows bacteria to grow quickly, highlights how dirty handling money can be. Thousands of bacteria colonies were discovered on notes and coins chosen at random from scientists’ pockets. This the bacteria found on one five pound note . The money was collected from students at the University of Surrey. It was then submerged in agar - a substance that allows bacteria to grow quickly - and then monitored for three to four days. The students found thousands of bacteria colonies living on their money. While most of the colourful blooms and spots of bacteria was found to be harmless, money has been known to carry dangerous diseases. The most common type of bacteria they discovered living on our coinage was bacillus mycoides, which is harmless.

The scientists did find cases of staphylococcus aureus, which can cause boils and spots on the skin. It is particularly dangerous to people whose immune systems may not be in peak condition, such as people in hospitals. Around 20 per cent of people carry the bacteria in their nostrils, which means they likely touched their nose before handling money. Dr Park added: ‘We found that money, be it coins or notes, harbours very large numbers of bacteria. ‘It is something that we all share so it passes through many many different hands, washed and unwashed. 'It also gets kept in warm and moist pockets, which offer perfect conditions for bacterial growth and survival. ‘Consequently, the populations of bacteria on currency are much larger and more diverse, and money is likely to carry disease causing bacteria.’ While most of the colourful blooms and spots of bacteria was found to be harmless, money has been known to carry dangerous diseases.  This is the bacteria found on a five pound note, including one large bloom .

"A former Fortune 500 executive from New Hampshire who caused a highway crash that killed a Vermont couple and their unborn baby was accused of being 'heartless' in court on Wednesday by angry family members. Prosecutors have said Robert Dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across an Interstate 89 median and smashed into an SUV carrying 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, who was 8 months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Relatives of Murphy and Timmons tore into Dellinger during the first of the two-day sentencing hearing. Amanda Murphy's mother, Tammy Langlois, and Murphy's sister, Ashley Murphy, cry after speaking about the moment they learned of the accident that killed Murphy, her unborn child, and her fiancee, Jason Timmons, during Robert Dellinger's sentencing  on Wednesday . Defense attorney Lucy Karl comforts Robert Dellinger after testimony by the families of Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons. The former Fortune 500 executive has admitted causing a highway crash that killed them and their unborn fetus . 'I have been robbed and violated. I will never see or touch my child ever again,' Timmons' mother, Debbie Blanchard, said as she fought back tears. 'How could you be so heartless? You still have a family; you have taken mine from me', reports the Valley News of West Lebanon. Dellinger appeared to be deeply remorseful during the hearing, the newspaper reported. 'You have my deepest, most heartfelt apology, condolences and remorse for your loss. I am so sorry,' the 54-year-old Dellinger said through sobs. 'My guilt and remorse will be with me forever. I ask for your forgiveness, and I pray for your healing.' Dellinger, of Sunapee, New Hampshire, was a senior vice president and chief financial officer at PPG Industries Inc. when he left in 2011 because of health problems. He also held high-level posts at Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co. Earlier he had  told the court he has 'never been suicidal.' Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013 . Pregnant: This is an ultrasound of the couple's unborn baby who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth . He pleaded guilty in February to negligent homicide for the deaths of the couple, who were from Wilder, Vermont, and to assault for the death of the fetus. He faces 12 to 24 years in prison when sentencing resumes on Thursday. During Wednesday's hearing, Dellinger's wife, Deborah, called him a man of 'ethics, integrity and friendship,' the Valley News reported. 'We are devastated by the deaths of your loved ones,' she said as her husband broke down at the defense table. 'We have been and continue to pray every day for your collective peace and comfort.' Dellinger reportedly broke down in tears at the defense table as his wife was speaking to the relatives of Murphy and Timmons. Defense lawyers have said Dellinger was suffering from delirium due to a 'toxic regime' of prescription medications for multiple sclerosis and depression. In asking for a shorter sentence, they also contend he was suffering from withdrawal of a sleeping aid. Robert Dellinger thanks his family and friends for their support in court on Wednesday. He told a judge that he wasn't suicidal at the time of the crash . Attorney Steven Gordon wrote in a sentencing brief they now know 'a medical event' was the main cause 'of this accident.' Dellinger has been jailed since his arrest in December. His lawyers want a sentence that would see him serve only about eight months in prison after being given credit for time already served. Investigators say Dellinger told them that on the day of the accident he 'had a disagreement with his wife and went to Vermont to drive around. He said he was very depressed and gloomy and wanted to have a car wreck and kill himself.' On Wednesday, Dellinger told the court: 'I have never been suicidal.' Assistant Attorney General Geoffrey Ward said in court that Dellinger's truck reached 101 mph in the seconds before the crash and was going 87 mph one second before he hit the SUV. His truck sheared off the top of the SUV. The medical examiner's report compared the injuries suffered by Murphy and Timmons to those of plane crash victims. Dellinger suffered cuts and bruises. Crushed: This is a picture of the scene of the crash after Dellinger careered over the central median in December 2013 . According to the prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his . medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported. 'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire Susan Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, . however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a . 'productive and exemplary life.' He . took a severance package worth more than $1million in cash plus stocks . when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents . filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Records show that a Dellinger family trust owns four property in the town of Sunapee worth $3million in total.","Robert Dellinger, 54, allegedly tried to kill himself in December 2013 by driving across highway, but instead he killed a young couple .

"COASTLINES: THE STORY OF OUR SHORE . by Patrick Barkham . (Granta Books £20) We are an island race, — which means, in practice, we are a coastal people. No one in Britain lives as much as 70 miles from the sea. Our coastline of 10,800 miles is longer than India’s (Unbelievable? Try measuring the ins and outs of Scotland’s). Many people in the U.S., Russia or China never see the sea in their lives. But most of us are saturated with it in childhood — in holiday homes and beach huts with deckchairs and sandy sandwiches, shivering and occasionally baking in the capricious arms of the sea. People are drawn back to the sea in their retirement, staring once more and feeling as they did as children. Our attachment to the coast is strong. Popular television series explore it, gliding over the cliffs by helicopter as if in a dream. Coastal paths are never short of walkers. Barkham’s book is written to celebrate 50 years of Enterprise Neptune, the National Trust’s campaign to save our coastal beauties from being spoiled — by purchasing them. Beginning in 1965, the Trust has by now acquired 742 miles of coast. Our attachment to the coast is strong. Popular television series explore it, gliding over the cliffs by helicopter as if in a dream and coastal paths are never short of walkers . Naturally, the National Trust mainly bought up the wilder shores to preserve their wildness, which is why you won’t find any popular resorts among them. This suits Barkham’s taste, because his childhood holidays were partly spent on Scolt Head Island, off the emptiest part of the Norfolk coast — an island with only one hut, where his parents chose to stay. He goes back to stay on Scolt alone, evoking not only its emptiness, but also its dreamy union of sea and land — good for meditation for a night or two, though not for a fortnight’s holiday. He also waxes fondly on the loneliness of beaches and headlands. He even has a love affair with Orford Ness, Suffolk, a radar spying station kept top-secret and out of bounds by the Ministry of Defence for 80 years. He likes the spookiness of its decaying laboratories, toxic testing sites and the tales that were told about the secret base called Cobra Mist, which was rumoured to have housed the UFO that supposedly landed in nearby Rendlesham Forest in 1980. But who would want to visit the Ness now we can, heaven alone knows. Barkham sails keenly for two of the inhabited islands off the coast. Lindisfarne and its attendant islands were places of monkish contemplation for Saints Aidan and Cuthbert. Lundy, with a permanent population of 28 get-away-from-it enthusiasts, in summertime adds 60,000 visitors, who come to see the puffins. He loves the cliffs and chasms off Cornwall. Walking the tops of them is, he says, ‘the next best thing to flying’. When I was young, we stared with fascination at another mysterious island because no one was allowed to land on it. Brownsea Island, in Poole Harbour, had belonged since the 1920s to the eccentric Mrs Christie. For 40 years, she kept all human beings out (with an armed guard), while allowing only animals running wild to share it with her. When she died, in 1961, the Trust was given the island by the Treasury in lieu of death duties. It took nearly 50 years to clear the wild rhododendron that had overrun it. Now, it is partly open as a nature reserve, but it lacks its old mystery now it’s no longer surrounded by notices, saying: ‘Keep Out!’ Barkham has provided a tempting introduction to many little-known stretches of our coastline, with helpful instructions on how to get to them (although they do not include places to stay). He is the right man to salute the preservation of our coast: the National Trust’s miles are the only part we actually have the right to stand on as common land. The rest of the waterline belongs to the Crown Estate. As a true coast-lover, Barkham once proposed to a girlfriend by drawing the invitation in the sand and taking her up a dune to read it. She said: ‘Yes’.","As an island race, no one in Britain lives more than 70 miles from the sea .
Enterprise Neptune is the National Trust's campaign to save the coastline .
Since starting in 1965 the Trust has acquired 742 miles of the British coast ."
"A couple from Texas who celebrated their wedding in 2012 claim their photographer wrote hurtful racial slurs on the bottom of photo booth snapshots from the event. The couple, who does not wish to be identified, hired attorney Cathy Hale to sue James Evans the owner of Premiere Photos for allegedly providing a photo booth that printed, 'Poor N***** Party' on the bottom of the pictures. The couple wasn't alerted of the photos until many months after the celebration when the bride's sister told the family about the racist incident at the photo booth the couple rented for the party. Scroll down for video . Racial slur: This racial slur was allegedly printed by Premiere Photos at the bottom of some of the photographs at their wedding event in 2012 . Denies allegations: James Evans who runs Premiere Photo allegedly didn't apologize for the racial slur and told the couple to 'sue' him . Attorney Cathy Hale who is representing the couple said that the sister of the bride  waited to tell her about what happened until after the wedding because she didn't want to ruin her special day or upset her. 'She made the wise decision not to tell her and spoil that specific day,' Hale told Click2Houston. Hale says that when the husband heard about the photos at the wedding he was horrified and called James Evans of Premiere Photo. The groom claims Evans  didn't even apologize. 'Sue me,' James Evan's reportedly replied. Hale told Click2Houston that her clients didn't want to file a lawsuit but they finally decided to press charges after Evans 'did nothing' about the racist comments. The couple is suing the company under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices act claiming that Premiere Photo practiced 'negligence and breach on contract.' When Eyewitness News reached out to Evans and his attorney, Christine Kirchner, they declined an on-camera interview but gave the same responses they gave in civil court. Venue: The couple had their wedding party at beautiful Bell Tower in northwest Houston, Texas . Evans has denied all allegations and claimed that at a party of 100 people, there is no evidence linking the company to the offensive caption. Evans also said the married couple gave 'no sign of any mental anguish.' Hale disagrees and says her clients want an apology at the very least. Mediation is scheduled for tomorrow morning but if the parties don't reach an agreement then the case is set for trial in July. They just want an apology: The couple's lawyer said that at the very least her client wants an apology from James Evans of Premiere Photos and that it isn't about money .","The couple, who does not wish to be identified, is suing Premiere Photos for allegedly printing the caption, 'Poor N***** Party' on the bottom of photos .

"Chilean pickpockets have become the most effective thieves operating in central London, according to undercover police teams. Gangs of up to six follow wealthy shoppers in the West End before stealing their cash and belongings, according to the plain-clothes officers tasked with reducing theft in the area. In one example Metropolitan Police stopped two Chilean women wearing burkas after they had been spotted targeting rich Arab tourists in the Park Lane and Mayfair areas. Chilean pickpockets have become the most effective thieves operating in central London, according to undercover police teams . A bag they were carrying contained €130,000 and £20,000 as well as gold and diamond jewellery. London's busy shopping areas prove a big draw for gangs of pickpockets from around the world including Romania, Algeria and Bulgaria, reports Andy Jones on Vice. But DC Darren Bond, whose team monitors the Oxford Street, Bond Street and Regent Street areas, explained to the the website that Chilean pickpockets 'don't mess about'. He is quoted as saying: 'They are intelligence-led – they don't go after anyone but wealthy tourists – and operate in mixed teams of three to six, often middle-aged. 'They will look like a nice family or group of businessmen to fit in. It allows them to walk through hotels unchallenged, sit down and have breakfast, then walk out with bags, laptops, etc. They are so hard to trace.' Plain clothes police are attempting to drive down pickpocket crimes in busy shopping areas like Oxford Street, pictured . He said many arrive in Britain on a six-month VISA before heading off on a 'European tour' and police are constantly monitoring CCTV to keep tabs on  gangs and their recruits. Organised international gangs of thieves will often spend a short time operating in London before flying to the likes of Madrid, Barcelona and Milan for the same purpose - all as part of moves to avoid detection. DC Bond, whose squad has seen a 50 per cent reduction in thefts over the last year, told Vice that 'anecdotally' about 70 per cent of arrested pickpockets were Romanians or Bulgarians, ten per cent Algerians and five per cent Chileans with the rest UK-based. 'Big city theft is now organised, international crime with bosses and a hierarchy,' he added.","Gangs of South Americans target shoppers in West End, police have said .

"The BBC faced angry criticism for giving an Election platform to ‘mini Russell Brand’ Gareth Shoulder (above) who mocked David Cameron over his disabled son . The BBC faced angry criticism last night for giving an Election platform to a ‘mini Russell Brand’ who has mocked David Cameron over his disabled son. Self-styled ‘angry Leftie revolutionary and magician’ Gareth Shoulder, from Liverpool, has been recruited by the BBC to comment on the Election as a member of its ‘Generation 2015 Election youth panel’. Shoulder, 24, who is a big fan of Brand and regularly messages the comedian on social media, used his ‘@bbcgen2015’ Twitter page to make the disparaging remark about Mr Cameron and Ivan, who died aged six in 2009 after being born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. After Mr Cameron spoke movingly in the first leaders TV Election debate about the NHS care given to Ivan, Shoulder sneered: ‘A new record for Cameron… 34 minutes before he pulls out the Ivan card and pretends he cares about our NHS.’ Shoulder also said that, in the debate, the Prime Minister had ‘really annoyed’ him and made him want to tear politicians ‘a new one’ – a shorthand reference to an extremely offensive phrase. Following Thursday’s TV Election debate, Shoulder then imagined the three female party leaders taking part – SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, Plaid Cymru’s Leanne Woods and the Green Party’s Natalie Bennett – to be the subjects of a lewd parlour game, tweeting: ‘Bennett, Sturgeon, Woods. ****, marry, avoid.’ He also called Chancellor Osborne a ‘briefcase w****r’. The BBC says it ‘hand-picked’ its 200-strong Generation 2015 youth panel to ‘address fundamental questions about the relationship between UK young adults and democracy’. The 24-year-old used his ‘@bbcgen2015’ Twitter page to make the disparaging remark about Mr Cameron and Ivan, who died aged six in 2009 after being born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy .

Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘It is disgraceful that the BBC should give a platform to someone to spew such Left-wing bile.’ Mr Shoulder said: ‘Speak to the BBC,’ and refused to comment further. A BBC spokesman said that Mr Shoulder was speaking in his own capacity, not as a representative of the BBC.","Gareth Shoulder is a member of the 'Generation 2015 Election youth panel'

"Brian Williams started embellishing his stories because he felt insecure following in Tom Brokaw's very large footsteps at NBC, according to a new report. The network handed Williams a six-month suspension in February after he acknowledged he had lied about being on board a helicopter that came under fire while reporting from Iraq in 2003. But according to a report in Vanity Fair, Williams started exaggerating his stories because he felt insecure about Brokaw, whom he succeeded at Nightly News in 2004. 'I always felt he needed to jack up his stories because he was trying so hard to overcome his insecurities,' one executive told the publication. Clash: Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams are pictured in New York in 2004 - the year Williams took over Brokaw's role on the Nightly News. A new report has claimed Williams always felt insecure following him . 'And he had to follow Tom, which brought its own set of insecurities. He likes to sort of tell these grandiose tales... I just saw it as one of the quirks of his personality.' But according to former correspondents who spoke to Vanity Fair, Brokaw wasn't so accepting of the 'quirks'. The stories left him 'incensed', the publication reported. On one occasion, Williams implied they had both been in Berlin together on the day the wall fell in 1989 - but he actually joined the veteran newscaster there the following day. On hearing the tale, Brokaw went into 'spasms of anger', one former exec told Vanity Fair. 'Tom treated that anchor chair as a public trust,' a former employee said. 'He really was our Walter Cronkite.' Others said that the two men had a troubled relationship after Williams took over the role because even though Brokaw pushed for him to get the job, Williams never 'embraced' him. 'I don't know why,' a source said. '[Williams] knows the rank and file will never love him like they did Tom, so he never tries. That's the reason there's not a lot of support for Brian over there.' Exaggerations: During a report in February, pictured, Williams recounted a tale of how he had been on a Chinook that came under fire while in Iraq in 2003 - but he had actually been in a separate aircraft . It also meant that when Williams found himself in hot water over his claim he had been in a downed Chinook - when he had actually been in a separate aircraft - Brokaw didn't have his back. A friend told the publication that while Brokaw - who was 'livid' about the scandal - didn't call for Williams to be punished, he 'didn't try to save him either.' Following the suspension, Williams reportedly declared to a friend: 'Chalk one up for Brokaw.' Not impressed: Brokaw, pictured in February, came 'incensed' when he heard Williams' exaggerations . The article also claimed that when he was called out for lying in his reports and conversations following the 2003 helicopter incident, Williams couldn't bring himself to admit he had made it up - and instead, he suggested he might have a brain tumor. '(He said,) 'Did something happen to (my) head? Maybe I had a brain tumor, or something in my head',' a source said. 'He just didn't know. We just didn't know. We had no clear sense what had happened. We got the best (apology) we could get.' When it came to uncovering the truth behind what actually happened in the 2003 helicopter incident, NBC quickly learned Williams himself would be of no help. 'He was having a tough enough time coming to grips with the idea that he had gotten it wrong in the first place, slash misrepresented it, slash lied,' one insider said. Others suggested that the problem with Williams' work was because the newscaster, who had never been a war or foreign correspondent before taking over at Nightly News, had no interest in reporting on war stories or 'heavy' news and lacked the experience of his predecessors. His appearance on late-night talk shows and comedy series, such as 30 Rock, suggested that instead of getting into gritty news, he actually wanted his own talk show, Vanity Fair suggested. While some NBC employees say this diversity was admirable and something his predecessors had never mastered, others say it did not go down well with the network. 'He didn't want to leave New York,' one source said. 'Getting him to war zones was real tough... but when he did go, he came back with these great stories that kind of put himself at the center of things.' In February, Williams was forced to admit that he wasn't aboard the helicopter that was hit and forced down by enemy fire in Iraq in 2003  - a story he had often repeated over the past 12 years. 'Overwhelmed': Sources told Vanity Fair that Williams, pictured in Iraq, did not want to report on 'hard' news and didn't enjoy politics or war stories, and lacked the experience of his predecessors . Lies: During a report in 2003, he reported how a Chinook, pictured, had been grounded but he later claimed he had been aboard the aircraft that was shot down. In fact, he was on one about 30 minutes behind . It came after he claimed on the Nightly News in January that his aircraft had been hit, causing outrage from the soldiers who had actually been involved. Crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire had told Stars and Stripes that the NBC anchor was nowhere near the aircraft or two other Chinooks that had been flying in formation when they took fire. According to the crew members, Williams arrived about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing. Even though Williams learned about the uproar over his false story on Facebook, he failed to bring it up with NBC execs when he met with them the next day, suggesting deeper flaws within the network and its relationship with staff, former employees told Vanity Fair. Days after the false report, he acknowledged the lie as he spoke to a reporter. 'I would not have chosen to make this mistake,' Williams told Stars and Stripes. 'I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.' While Williams initially believed he'd be back to work within days, he was ultimately suspended for six months, and he accepted that he had to step back, sources said. NBC Nightly News is now being anchored by Lester Holt and it is unclear if Williams will return. Questions: A number of Williams' seemingly outlandish claims also came under scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. But in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams said he saved two puppies. In the same Esquire interview, Williams also revealed he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years, Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Earlier this year, he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' He was later suspended over the incident. Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Williams was suspended  from NBC in February after it emerged he'd lied about being in a helicopter that was shot down in Iraq in 2003 .

Many popular Easter eggs contain more sugar than is recommended in a day by the World Health Organisation . There is nothing as synonymous with Easter as chocolate eggs. A survey released this week found the average child will eat eight of the chocolate treats, totalling a massive 8,000 calories over the long weekend. But while the holiday might be a child's favourite, a nutritionist has warned too much sugar can lead to obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay. Dr Sam Christie, a nutrition scientist, also warned too much of the sweet stuff can exacerbate polycystic ovarian syndrome and behavioural problems like ADHD. The World Health Organisation recommends 50g of added sugar a day (roughly 12 and a half teaspoons), on top of natural sugars that occur in fruit and milk. Dr Christie has calculated that many popular eggs contain more than the recommended daily amount of sugar. Nestle Crunch Medium Easter Egg contains 182 per cent of the recommended daily amount, while a Thorntons Cupcake Medium Easter Egg has 161 per cent. Depending on how physically active the children are, eating too much sugar could trigger insulin resistance, Dr Christie said. This is where the body becomes de-sensitised to insulin, the hormone that controls how much sugar is in the bloodstream. Over time this slowly damages cells and organs in the body, and leads to type 2 diabetes. She said: 'Sugar causes pathological changes, their bodies become resistant to insulin  and have cellular damage to all parts of the body.' It also leads to weight gain. ‘Insulin resistance puts you at a metabolic disadvantage to lose weight. It actually becomes very hard to lose weight once the body can’t break down sugar,’ she explained. ‘Dermatologists used to say “chocolate and sugar doesn’t harm skin”. Now they are saying ‘yes they do’. She added children could also become deficient in other nutrients too. She said: 'If someone's overstraining their insulin system they lose more nutrients in urine, as do trace elements like zinc. They fall into deficit. 'You can upset metabolism by having too much sugar.' Eating too much sugar can lead to obesity, type 2 diabetes, tooth decay, nutrient deficiencies, acne and behavioural problems, a nutritionist warns . This can also lead to other deficiencies as children may fill up on sugar but not eat other, more nutritious food, so they miss out on vitamins and minerals, she added. Having a healthy diet the rest of the year can actually protect against the damaging effects of insulin resistance, which sugar might trigger. ‘Eat wholegrains, fruit and veg, portions of oil rich fish - the nutrients in foods will help make the body more sensitive to insulin. ‘If someone takes multi-vitamins, it helps sensitise the body to insulin, so you’re more likely to burn off sugar. ‘We fail to eat our micronutrients every day and it can actually help the nation become less obese.’ She added that if a person is going to overindulge,  solid chocolate eggs are better for health than ones with sugary fillings. She said: 'Any of the ones with pure chocolate rather than squidgy fillings are better. 'I'd avoid fondant or caramel, and go for solid chocolate. 'Then you'll be eating more polyphenols and less added sugar. 'The squidgy ones have added sugar on top of the sugar in cocoa.' Eating a small treat, rather than gorging on multiple eggs, allows children to enjoy easter without risking their health, she continued. She said: 'Eat a crème egg or a solid egg’s worth, something that can sit on your child's hand instead of covering their entire dinner plate.' Dr Christie recommends Nature’s Best Multi-Guard Balance vitamin supplement, which has added chromium, cinnamon bark and magnesium and claims  to stave off sugar cravings and boost energy levels.","From rowing to Zumba, two nutritionists reveal the exercises you can do to burn off your favourite Easter eggs .

"The world's largest sperm bank is relocating next to one of the country's largest universities in order to tap into 'the abundant donor opportunities'. Cryos International, an online sperm bank, is moving its offices from New York to the Central Florida Research Park in Orlando, right next to the University of Central Florida. While the company says the decision is in part due to the better facilities on offer, it is also due to the 'intense competition for donors' in New York. Cryos International, the 'world's largest sperm bank', is relocating from its offices in New York to this research park in Florida (pictured), which is yards away from one of the country's biggest universities . Cryos supplies sperm online to all 50 U.S. states and 80 countries across the world. Donors are allowed to remain anonymous, and a company spokesman said they can earn up to $750 per month . By comparison, the new site in Orlando is located just yards from the University of Central Florida, which has an undergraduate intake of 52,000 each year, roughly 23,000 of whom are male. The new offices are also across the street from a campus of the Florida Technical College, down the street from Valencia College, and across town from Seminole State College. Jim Londeree, a spokesman for Cryos, told the Orlando Sentinel: 'There’s a huge donor base here aged 18 to 29, because of the universities.' Cryos is looking for donors aged up to 39, and over 5ft 9in tall. Payments are not listed on the company's website, but Mr Londeree said donors can make $750 per month. Donations can be made anonymously, but the company encourages people to become non-anonymous donors, allowing children to know their identity when they turn 18. While the company accepts donations from any race and ethnicity, donors with Danish heritage are particularly popular. After Cryos opened donor clinics in Copenhagen, they helped sperm to become one of Denmark's top exports, after beer and Lego. However, it is bad news for any potential red-haired donors, as the company has previously said it is oversupplied with sperm from ginger men, and at one point stopped accepting it. The University of Central Floria (pictured) has an undergraduate intake of around 52,000 students per year, of which 23,000 are male . As well as providing cash for students, Cryos will also bring around 50 job to the region. Thirteen staff have transferred from New York, but the company's goal is to expand to 65. Medical professionals, such as nurse practitioners and medical technicians, are among the possible openings, the company says. Cryos was founded in 1987 and delivers sperm to all 50 U.S. state and 80 countries worldwide, with founder Ole Schou once boasting that they only place they have never delivered to is the Antarctic. Would-be parents hoping to use the service can fill out a questionnaire online, selecting from factors such as eye color, hair color, race, ethnicity, height, weight, blood type and sperm motility. Donors can chose how much information they wish to give to the recipients of their sperm, but there are options to include baby photos and voice recordings to help people choose. The company is responsible for around 20,000 pregnancies a year, up to four a day in Europe alone, but Mr Schou says it could be as high as 30,000, as often people do not respond to tell them the treatment has worked.","Cryos International is moving from New York to lab complex in Orlando .

"A man charged with assassinating Russian opposition leader Boris Nemstov has told a court he was beaten and pressured into confessing to the murder. Zaur Dadaev is accused of being involved in the shooting of the politician in Moscow on February 27, along with four other Chechan men. Now Russian news agencies have quoted him as telling the court that he had been abducted, beaten and pressured into confessing to Nemstov's murder. Zaur Dadaev spoken to the court in Moscow via a video link from his prison cell. Dadaev had previously confessed to Boris Nemstov's murder but now says he was beaten and pressured into make that statement . Dadaev is one of five Chechan men who have been accused of killing the opposition leader. Nemstov was shot in the back four times on a bridge close to the Kremlin in February, sparking a huge protest march in Moscow . Dadaev was the only one, according to a judge and investigators, who confessed to the killing. When he appeared in court in March, Dadaev didn't admit his guilt for the murder, and later retracted his confession. Human rights activist Andrei Babushkin, who visited the suspect in jail last month, said he had seen signs of torture on Dadaev's body. Zaur Dadaev retracted his confession for the murder of Nemstov last month. A human rights activist said when he visited him in prison he had abrasions on his body and had suffered multiple injuries . Boris Nemstov was an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is understood at the time of his death he was working on a report examining Russia's military involvement in the east of Ukraine . But the Russian state-funded television network Russia Today claimed human rights activists had found no signs of torture on Dadaev's body when they visited him in custody. Dadaev is being held with his cousins, Anzor and Shagid Gubahsev. Khamzat Bakhayev and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov have also been accused of involvement in Nemstov's murder. The outspoken politician was shot in the back four times as he crossed a bridge near the Kremlin and Red Square in Moscow. More than 20,000 people marched through the capital city in protest of his murder, holding posters of his face and signs saying: 'I am not afraid'. An outspoken critic of Putin, investigators say they are still trying to work out who ordered Nemstov to be killed.","Zaur Dadaev is accused of shooting the Kremlin critic, close to Red Square .

"Just like the Channing Tatum movie 21 Jump Street, an undercover drug sting in Houston has lead to the arrest of six high school students following an eight month operation. The bust was spearheaded by one male narcotics officer, who posed as a high school senior between August 2014 and March 2015. On top of the six arrests, an amount of cocaine, marijuana and prescription drugs Xanax and Tramadol was also seized in the bust. Police have not released any further information on the undercover officer or his age, but say it is not the first time they have performed something like this. 'School is not a place that you should come in and try to sell your drugs, or come in and buy drugs, you go there to be educated,' Sgt. James Brawner of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office told Click2Houston. Jumped in undercover bust: Matthew Van Richardson, 18 (left ), has been charged with two counts of delivery of a controlled cocaine, while Aaron Coleman, 18 (right), was charged with delivery Xanax and Tramadol . Charged: Jonathan Gonzales, 17 (left), was charged with two counts of delivery of marijuana and Kevin Lambert, 18 (right), was charged with delivery of Marijuana, one fourth ounce . The two schools hit in this operation were Pearland High School and Dawson High School. However according to Lt. Chris Reioux of the Brazoria County Narcotics Task Force – who jokingly told The Houston Chronicle that he hates the recent Jump Street movies, starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill – said his department has conducted several Jump Street-style undercover operations in recent years. 'I don't think anyone suspects that their classmate is an undercover cop,' Reioux told the newspaper. 'With the recent release of the 'Jump Street' movies, I think they're a little more apprehensive, but it's more of a joking matter – ''you're not '21 Jump Street' are you?'' 'They don't believe the person next to them who shows up to school every day, is doing homework next to them, is an undercover officer.' One adult student and two juvenile students arrested were from Pearland High School. 21 Jump Street ... only in Houston: Dawson High School was one of two schools hit in the bust. Bust: The operation was spearheaded by one male officer, who posed as a high school senior between August 2014 and March 2015, in a plot similar to the 2012 film 21 Jump Street (pictured) Scene: Pearland High School, in Pearland, Texas, south of Houston, has about 3,600 students . The one adult was identified as 18-year-old Aaron Coleman, who was charged with delivery of controlled substance in a drug-free zone (Xanax) and delivery of a dangerous drug (Tramadol). Three adult students were arrested from Dawson High School: Kevin Lambert, 18; Jonathan Gonzales, 17; and Matthew Van Richardson, 18. They were all charged with various drug offenses. However the investigation is continuing. 'There is still ongoing off campus investigations,' Brawner told The Chron. 'We have wrapped up on campus, and now we are moving out into the communities and trying to further it that way.' Hit: 21 Jump Street became a huge hit when it was released, starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, in 2012 . 21 Jump St was released in 2012 and based on a 1980s TV series that starred a young Johnny Depp. In it, two youthful officers, played by Tatum and Hill, go undercover at a high school to bust a deadly drug ring. The actors reprized their roles for the sequel, 22 Jump St, which was released in 2014.","Operation spanned August 2014 to March 2015 in Houston .

"Ed Miliband's claim to crackdown on the super-rich unravelled today after it emerged Ed Balls has warned the idea of scrapping non-dom rules would cost the country money. The Labour leader used a speech to say he will 'abolish' the 200-year-old rule for non-doms, which applies to around 116,000 people, claiming they make Britain an 'offshore tax haven for a few' and can 'no longer be justified'. But in January Mr Balls, the shadow chancellor, said: 'I think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.' Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband has pledged to scrap the controversial 'non-dom' status which allows millionaires to reduce their tax bil . The Labour leader visited Cheswick's Coffee shop  in  Rowley Regis in the West Midlands this afternoon . Mr Miliband argues that non-dom tests 'are not very rigorous' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad . Non-domicile status allows people living and working in Britain to only pay tax on their UK income, but not earnings from overseas. They must prove that they regard a foreign country as their real home. But Mr Miliband argues that non-dom tests 'are not very rigorous' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad. In a speech in Warwick today, Mr Miliband said that everyone who has made Britain their permanent home should pay full UK tax on all their income and gains. He pledged to abolish the non-dom status from April 2016. He told an audience at the University of Warwick: 'Why should there be one rule for some and another for everybody else? 'It is not fair. It is not just. It holds Britain back. We will stop it. The next Labour government will abolish the non-dom rule. 'And we will replace it with a clear principle: Anyone permanently resident in the UK will pay tax in the same way. 'The rules we will introduce are modelled on what other countries do. Real temporary residents, here for a brief period, will only have to pay tax on what they earn here . 'Because they will be paying their taxes in their place of permanent residence. But everyone else will have to pay tax on their worldwide income.' The status, which is unique to the UK having been introduced by William Pitt the Younger in the late 18th century, is used by more than 110,000 wealthy people. In January shadow chancellor Ed Balls warned: 'I think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.' Mr Miliband said non-dom status results from a discredited belief that 'anything goes for those at the top and that what is good for the rich is always good for Britain'. He added: 'There are people who live here in Britain like you and me, work here in Britain, are permanently settled here in Britain like you and me, but aren't required to pay taxes like you and me because they take advantage of what has become an increasingly arcane 200-year-old loophole. 'There are now 116,000 non-doms, costing hundreds of millions of pounds to our country – it can no longer be justified, and it makes Britain an offshore tax haven for a few.' Non-dom status is often inherited through the father so can apply to people who were born in Britain. They must pay an annual fee, of up to £90,000, to take advantage of the rules, which means it is only of us to the very wealthy. Newspaper reports overnight suggested that non-dom rules would be scrapped by Labour altogether. But today it emerged Labour would allow 'real temporary residents' to take advantage of the rules - with the time limit to be consulted on should they take power in the General Election on May 7. Mr Miliband said on Twitter that 'we should all pay taxes by the same rules' ahead of his speech in Coventry . Ex-Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne backed the Labour tax crackdown . Entrepreneur and ex-Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has backed Ed Miliband over the Labour leader's plan to scrap non-dom tax status. It comes after the hotelier signed a letter sent to the Daily Telegraph from more than 100 business leaders stating the 'Conservative-led Government has been good for business' and backing the cut in corporation tax to 20%. He tweeted: 'Ed Milliband says he will abolish non-dom status in UK. This gets my vote I never thought any party would have courage to do this.' Mr Balls said it should be around two or three years - not the five suggested in some reports. But it emerged that when he was a Treasury minister in the last Labour government, Mr Balls insisted that 'the majority of non-domiciled individuals who had already left the UK spent no more than five years here'. And in a January interview Mr Balls said: 'I think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing Britain money because there will be some people who will then leave the country.' Asked by BBC Radio Leeds at the time if he would scrap the status, he said he was looking at tightening the system to 'make sure the non-dom rules work in a fair way'. Chancellor George Osborne said Labour's proposals amounted to 'tinkering around the edges' not an outright ban. 'We have Ed Balls himself saying it would cost the country money,' Mr Osborne said on a campaign visit to a bank in Kingston, south London. 'It is a classic example of the economic chaos and confusion you get with Ed Miliband. It's why they have no economic credibility.' Mr Osborne said the Government's policy of increasing the fees charged to non-doms, which he raised as recently as December, had brought in more than £1 billion. The Lib Dems said the number non-dom numbers 'exploded' under the last Labour government and more than doubled while Mr Miliband was an adviser in the Treasury . Tory Chancellor George Osborne warned the plan could cost Britain 'hundreds of millions of pounds' and stopped short of scrapping the rules, despite Labour's claims . Nick Clegg's party said it would rack up existing fees for non don status as high as £150,000 a year . The Lib Dems were bounced into announcing their own crackdown on non doms by the Labour pledge. They would rack up existing fees for non don status as high as £150,000 a year. The party is also considering its own ban on non doms staying in Britain longer than a decade. But officials said they would not go ahead with this until it was clear it would raise money. And officials said there were 'dangers' that talent could leave the UK if non dom rules were seen to be 'unfair'. Officials said the plans were in the manifesto but brought forward after Ed Miliband's announcement. The Lib Dems would also ban people from inheriting non-dom status from their parent. The party's manifesto will commit to raising the levy on non-doms who have been in the country for more than seven of the past nine years from £30,000 to £50,000. Non doms in the country for 12 of the past 14 years would rise from £60,000 to £100,000 and for people who have been in the country for 17 of the past 19 years from £90,000 to £150,000. Mr Balls told BBC Radio 4's Today that circumstances had changed and there was now a large budget deficit to cut. 'People were saying in the middle of the last decade this will lead to people leaving the country. It's not actually turned out to be the case,' he said. 'The abuse is bigger than we thought. These rules are ridiculous, they are unfair, they are being abused, and I think it's time to act. 'These were introduced in the period of the Napoleonic wars to allow people who were earning money in the colonies not to pay tax in the UK. 'That's fine, it's a different world now, a different time, different choices.' Admitting he was not scrapping non-dom rules completely, he said that Labour would allow 'a short period for existing non-doms to get their affairs sorted out'. Asked about the exemptions, he said: 'What we will do in the future is if people are coming here temporarily to work or to study, then we'll allow a short period, I think five years is probably too long. 'I'm thinking more the length of a normal postgraduate or university degree, say two to three years.' Mr Osborne said 'the right approach' was to hit 'non-doms' with higher annual charges for exploiting the system - effectively making it only worthwhile for the very wealthiest. The Liberal Democrats said they planned to take an additional £130 million from non-doms by reforming eligibility rules and 'significantly increasing the charges'. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'The key tests are what maximises revenue for the exchequer and best supports our economic recovery.' 'Non-dom numbers exploded under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, more than doubling when Ed Miliband was an adviser in the Treasury,' he said. 'We came down hard on those who stayed in the UK for long periods without paying their share - increasing charges on non-doms year-on-year since 2010. Labour used to allow non-doms to sit in the House of Lords, Lib Dems stopped that. 'In the next parliament we want to go further by radically reforming the rules and significantly increasing the charges for non-doms to secure an additional GBP130 million for the public purse.'","Ed Miliband will today pledge to scrap the controversial 'non-dom' status .
The rule allows Britain's richest to avoid UK tax on their worldwide income .
Labour will claim it's open to abuse and offends the moral basis of taxation .
But critics will say it is another example of Labour's anti-business agenda ."
"A devastated couple has launched a desperate search for their beloved pet cat after he disappeared following a 14-hour flight from Abu Dhabi to New York. Felix the cat has been missing for almost a week after he escaped from his crate at John F Kennedy International Airport. The two-year-old grey tabby belongs to Jennifer Stewart, 31, and her 34-year-old husband, Joseph Naaman, who said the airline-approved pet carrier was damaged so badly – apparently while being transferred from the plane  – that Felix was able to get out and run away. Jennifer Stewart and husband, Joseph Naaman, pictured with their cat, Felix, who disappeared April 1 . Jennifer told MailOnline Travel that she isn't satisfied with the way Felix's crate was secured and transported on the Etihad Airways flight. She said his crate was tied down to a large metal pallet and cracked open, apparently when one of the straps got caught on something as it was being moved to a cargo bay after the April 1 flight. She said: 'To find out how he was transported, I was horrified, I was sick. They basically strapped him in like he was an old box. 'If I had known he was going to travel like that we would have looked for other alternatives. 'He is a part of our family. He's like a dog. He plays fetch and hide and seek, and he's the coolest little cat.' The couple was told that the plastic crate broke open after one of the ropes became tangled on something . Felix's plastic pet carrier was tied down to a metal pallet while he was transported on the plane . Jennifer said she isn't sure which company was responsible for transferring Felix from the plane, but a cargo manager called her and her husband into an office after they landed to deliver the bad news. 'We were in shock that this happened. At first I thought he was going to tell me that [Felix] died. 'He told me his cage was crushed.' While in Abu Dhabi she spent weeks researching the best way to transport Felix and she initially booked a ticket with a different airline, but there was a problem with the reservation and she was forced to switch to their flight and Felix's to Etihad Airways. Felix the cat disappeared after his crate was damaged after a flight from Abu Dhabi to New York . Owner Jennifer Stewart said she spent weeks researching the best way to transport Felix to the US . Jennifer, a yoga instructor, and Joseph, a strategy consultant, couple spent $1,200 (£800) to bring Felix  to the US with them after living in the United Arab Emirates for three years. They adopted him seven months ago after they found him wandering on the street in their Abu Dhabi neighbourhood, and they never gave any thought to leaving him behind. The couple hasn't given up hope that Felix will be found, and has sought help from a non-profit organisation, Where Is Jack?, which provided a dog that is trained to track down animals based on their scent. Jennifer and Joseph haven't given up hope and plan to return to the airport to search for Felix . The couple adopted the two-year-old cat seven months ago after he was abandoned in their neighbourhood . They searched the airport on Saturday, but were unable to access secure areas, and plan to return tomorrow morning to look for Felix again. An Etihad Airways spokesperson told MailOnline Travel that it is investigating Felix’s disappearance and continues to search for the cat. The spokesperson said: ‘We are working with the ground handlers and other third-party specialists, paid for by Etihad Airways, to locate the cat. ‘We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search. Jennifer and Joseph have enlisted the help of a non-profit organisation to locate the cat at JFK Airport . Etihad Airways said it is working with ground handlers and 'third-party specialists' to find the cat . ‘We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets travelling with Etihad Airways is a top priority.’ Etihad cargo carries more than 200 animals each year and it is ‘extremely rare’ for one to escape, the spokesperson added. MailOnline Travel has contacted the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees the airport, for comment.","Felix the cat disappeared after he escaped his plastic crate at JFK Airport .

"Nasa has selected a variety of companies to work on projects to create advanced space technologies, including faster methods of propulsion. Other projects to be worked on include improved habitats for humans, and small satellites to explore deep space. And one of the companies in the 12 Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextStep) says they have an engine that could get humans to Mars in just 39 days. Scroll down for video . Nasa has selected a variety of companies to work on projects to create advanced space technologies, including a faster method of propulsion known as Vasimr (illustrated), which could apparently get to Mars in a matter of weeks, not months . The Vasimr engine - which uses plasma as a propellant - is being developed by the Ad Astra Rocket company in Texas. Their engine shot to fame a few years ago when it was revealed that it could drastically reduce the journey time to Mars from months to weeks - although it may require a nuclear power source. And following the successful test of a prototype in 2013, it seems Nasa is now considering it for use on a future mission to Mars. Short for Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, Vasimr works with plasma, an electrically charged gas that can be heated to extreme temperatures by radio waves and controlled and guided by strong magnetic fields. The magnetic field also insulates nearby structures so exhaust temperatures well beyond the melting point of materials can be achieved. In rocket propulsion, the higher the temperature of the exhaust gases, the higher their velocity and the higher the fuel efficiency. Plasma rockets feature exhaust velocities far above those achievable by their chemical cousins, so their fuel consumption is extremely low. ‘We are thrilled by this announcement and proud to be joining forces with Nasa in the final steps of the technology maturation,’ said Dr Franklin Chang Diaz, Ad Astra’s Chairman and CEO, in a statement. ‘We look forward to a very successful partnership as we jointly advance the technology to flight readiness.’ Over three years, Nasa will give the company about £6.8 million ($10 million) to get the engine almost ready to fly in space. This will be achieved with a demonstration of their new prototype, the VX-200-SS, which will be able to fire continuously for more than 100 hours. A previous test in 2013 saw Ad Astra complete 10,000 successful high power firings of a Vasimr prototype. However, this involved short duration bursts for less than a minute. Proving the engine works for more than 100 hours will be key to it one day being used on a spacecraft. The Vasimr engine is seen here being tested. Short for Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, Vasimr works with plasma, an electrically charged gas that can be heated to extreme temperatures by radio waves and controlled and guided by strong magnetic fields . In rocket propulsion, the higher the temperature of the exhaust gases, the higher their velocity and the higher the fuel efficiency. Plasma rockets like Vasimr (illustrated) feature exhaust velocities far above those achievable by their chemical cousins, so their fuel consumption is extremely low . The Vasimr engine could be part of the entire spacecraft that will ultimately take astronauts to Mars. The rocket that will send them on their way will be the Space Launch System, illustrated, which will complete an unmanned flight in 2019 - and it will have room for some secondary payloads to go to deep space . Owing to the orbits of Earth and Mars, there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place. Our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles (54.6 million km), but can be as distant as 250 million miles (400 million km). For this reason spacecraft to Mars, such as the Curiosity rover, have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned. The next window is open from January 2016 to April 2016, and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet. For a future manned mission, they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in another. Just getting there will take up to nine months. The astronauts will then be there waiting for a year until they can come back, again taking up to nine months - a total of around three years. Whether an engine such as Vasimr could shorten the time it would take to cover the distance, though, remains to be seen. With this and other technologies, Nasa said in a statement they want to develop exploration capabilities around the moon, and at Mars. ‘Commercial partners were selected for their technical ability to mature key technologies and their commitment to the potential applications both for government and private sector uses,’ said William Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for Human Exploration and Operations at Nasa Headquarters. ‘This work ultimately will inform the strategy to move human presence further into the solar system.’ Three advanced electric propulsion projects, including Vasimr, will develop engines that operate in the 50 to 300 kilowatt range. By comparison, current electric propulsion used by Nasa - such as the ion engine on the Dawn spacecraft - operates at less than five kilowatts. Meanwhile, seven companies have been picked to work on the habitats that will house astronauts as they make their way to Mars in the 2030s. While the Orion capsule will take astronauts to and from Earth, it can only sustain a crew of four for 21 days. To make the journey to Mars, expected to last anywhere from several months to three years, astronauts will need to live in some other structure. Nasa will be hoping one of the projects it is funding will find a way to house the astronauts for the grueling journey to and from the red planet. While the Orion capsule (shown after test flight in December 2014) will take astronauts to and from Earth, it can only sustain a crew of four for 21 days. To make the journey to Mars, expected to last anywhere from several months to three years, astronauts will need to live in some other structure . Previously, Boeing outlined the six steps needed to land and return on Mars (illustrated). Two are already in production - the Orion spacecraft and SLS rocket. The other four things needed are a large 'tug' spacecraft, a habitat, lander and an ascent vehicle - all of which Nasa is hoping to develop in the next decade or so . Nasa is also asking companies to development capabilities to sustain a crew of four for 60 days in cis-lunar space - between Earth and the moon - with the ability to scale up to Mars missions. The companies selected include Bigelow Aerospace, who are creating an inflatable habitation module - a prototype of which will be attached to the ISS in 2018. And finally, two companies have been selected to develop small satellites - CubeSats - to launch as secondary paylods on the first flight of Nasa’s huge Space Launch System rocket in 2019. As the rocket is so powerful, it will give these CubeSats a rare opportunity to explore deep space, as opposed to remaining in Earth orbit.

"Scottish voters would rather have a referendum on the EU than another independence vote, a new survey has revealed. The idea of having another referendum on Scotland's future in the UK before 2020 was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters. It comes after Scottish First Minister  Nicola Sturgeon last night refused to rule out staging a second independence vote if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections. Scroll down for video . Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was campaigning in Aberdeen today ahead of a second TV debate tonight . When questioned on the issue in last night's Scottish leaders TV debate, Ms Sturgeon insisted an SNP victory in the General Election would not trigger another referendum. But she added it was 'another matter' whether a vote for her party in the 2016 Holyrood elections would bring about a second vote on independence. Ms Sturgeon has also vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. But a poll by Ipsos Mori for BBC Scotland reveals that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union was more popular with voters north of the border than another independence ballot. More than 1,000 adults were questioned for the research, with pollsters asking them to give various issues a score of between one and 10, depending on how important these were to them. A score of one meant a policy should not be implemented while 10 was taken to mean it should be put into action immediately. In last night's TV showdown with the Scottish leaders of Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems, Mr Sturgeon refused to rule out a second independence vote before 2020 . Ms Sturgeon has  vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe . The most popular policy was increasing the minimum wage for those aged over 21, which was given a score of 8.2. Giving the Scottish Parliament power over all welfare benefits was eighth most popular, with a score of 7.1, while transferring full responsibility for income tax to Holyrood came 10th on the list at 6.8. Holding another independence referendum by 2020 was given a score of 5.6, compared to 6.1 for a referendum on remaining in the EU. Scottish National Party election campaign director Angus Robertson insisted the poll showed support for his party's main policies. He said: 'This is a very welcome poll - it demonstrates that the people of Scotland share our view that the Westminster parties are not delivering on their referendum vow, and want far more power for Scotland. 'Electing a strong team of SNP MPs in May is the only way to ensure that Scotland gets the power we need to build social justice and economic prosperity.' Scotland's political leaders, from left to right, Tory Ruth Davidson, Labour's Jim Murphy, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie faced off in a live TV election debate last night . Overall, Scots prefer more public spending ahead of paying off the deficit – but also favour the Government's welfare cap. However, there is also widespread support for a Mansion Tax and an increase in the top rate of income tax to 50p.

'Broadly, Scots want to see measures to improve the standard of living, particularly a higher minimum wage, rises in pensions and lower energy bills. 'There is also a preference for higher targeted public spending even if that means the deficit is not eliminated in the next five years and targeted tax increases for those with the greatest income and wealth.'","Another independence vote ranks 19th on list of 23 policies for Scots .

"They're professionally trained to project their voices for stage and screen, so it's unsurprising that the nation's most popular actors might use one of their best assets to secure lucrative work with the best deals said to be worth around £50,000. However, while voiceover work might be a salary-boosting sideline, it can go down like a lead balloon with other employers, as Coronation Street actress Katy Cavanagh discovered to her peril recently. Executives at Coronation Street have reportedly just overturned a ban on their cast offering their dulcet tones to radio advertising campaigns after rumours of a near-mutiny among its actors, the catalyst for which was Katy's extensive voiceover work. Put a sock in it: In the past Corrie has reportedly tried to silence its stars when they've asked to do voiceover work for television adverts. Complaints from actors have led bosses to revise the ban . Katy, who played Julie Carp on the Coronation Street, pictured here on set with actor Jimmi Harkishin, has been the voice behind many ad campaigns including Whitbread, Lancome, iPlayer Restart and Nestle Kit Kats . According to the Sun, one of the soap's biggest names, Katy Cavanagh, who until last month played Julie Carp, was said to have been given a telling off for taking on a voiceover job for the BBC iPlayer Restart. The show's bosses were said to be disgruntled that Katy was lending her voice to a rival station and thus potentially advertising the Street's biggest competitor, EastEnders. Pressure from fellow actors is said to have caused bosses to relent and enable their 'talent' to take on radio voiceover jobs, although television adverts are said to still be strictly forbidden. For those actors not tied to tricky contracts, the voiceover world can be a very rewarding one with plenty of big-name companies prepared to put their money where their mouths are if it means securing a star that they feel might help them sell more of their product. From Benedict Cumberbatch to Cilla Black, it seems everyone is happy to get behind a microphone and cash in. Below, we look at the stars who've lent their vocal chords to various campaigns: . We could listen to him all day...Benedict Cumberbatch has occasionally branched out from acting to lend his voice to advertising campaigns. Brands that have snapped up the Sherlock star include Jaguar, Dunlop and Pedigree dog food . BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH . The Imitation Game star may be one of the hottest properties in Hollywood but that hasn't stopped the Sherlock actor from enjoying the other opportunities that have come his way. With his particular brand of well spoken English, it's unsurprising that upmarket car manufacturer Jaguar chose him to talk over their ads. A little more surprising is that Mr C also provided the audio for Pedigree dog food. Last summer, the star was paid a rumoured six-figure sum to help the dog-friendly company get their message across about pet dental hygiene. Woof, woof. NOEL FIELDING . With his wacky image and the coolest set of friends on the block, The Mighty Boosh frontman might not seem like someone who you'd naturally choose to advertise a mobile phone company but money talks and Noel Fielding can count Vodafone amongst his voiceover clients. THIERRY HENRY . He uttered the phrase 'Va va voom' and a million women fell in love. Thierry Henry, now playing football in New York, is still available for voiceover work but may never reach the dizzying heights of those Renault ads, which launched his career away from the pitch and also saw him marry his co-star Nicole Merry. The couple have since divorced. The Frenchman's other ads have included Nike and Pepsi. Pitch perfect: Olivia Colman's distinctive intonation has seen her voice used in plenty of advertising campaigns including for Andrex toilet tissue (pictured), Sainsbury's and Airwick . Money down the pan: Gavin and Stacey star Rob Brydon used voiceover work to boost his income inbetween jobs before making it big. Clients included Duck toilet cleaner . OLIVIA COLMAN . The Broadchurch star has become one of the nation's favourite actresses but can boast a surprisingly varied career in the world of voiceovers too. Thanks to her distinctive intonation, Olivia has laid down vocals for companies that include Andrex, Sky Box Office, Sainsbury's and Airwick. Now that Olivia is  expecting a baby at 41, might she turn to the less demanding world of voiceover work once more? BILL NIGHY . The Love Actually actor, 65, has a prolific voiceover portfolio, having got behind the microphone for campaigns for brands including Argos, Lovefilm, Expedia, Costa Coffee and Toyota. He's described by voice over agency Qvoice as: 'a cool, confident, sharp, witty and well-loved English gent with a distinctive familiar and trustworthy delivery.' LIAM NEESON . He's the proudest of Irishmen so it's no surprise that Liam Neeson might put his name to a campaign that would entice visitors to descend upon his homeland for a holiday. For St Patrick's Day this year, the Hollywood actor's velvety tones could be heard on the Tourism Ireland video promoting the Emerald Isle. Neeson said he was happy the 60-second clip would help 'nations come together to celebrate the fun and warmth of the Irish'. The gift of the gab: Liam Neeson recently voiced adverts for Tourism Ireland, which promoted visitors to the Emerald Isle ahead of St Patrick's Day in mid March . Plenty of cash: Eastenders star Shane Richie has used his cockney sparrow vocals to secure work for companies such as Sony Ericcson, Bounty and Plenty kitchen roll (pictured right) In 1973, Elvis Costello's father Ross MacManus sang the famous R Whites lemonade song, The Secret Lemonade Drinker. Acted by actor and mime Julian Chagrin, Ross lent his voice - and his son, who was then known as Declan, rather than Elvis - provided the backing vocals in the cult ad which ran until 1984 and featured a man in striped pyjamas creeping downstairs to raid the fridge for the fizzy drink. Elvis Costello's father sang the famous lyrics, 'I'm a secret lemonade drinker' in the R Whites ad . JULIAN CLARY . It's an instantly recognisable voice, charged with camp and irony. Comedian Julian Clary has supplemented his stand-up and television work by putting down his arch tones for companies such as WHSmiths, Argos and Direct Flooring. Clary is also the voice behind Little Princess, a show for toddlers about a mischievous young royal that appears on Channel 5. ROB BRYDON . Before finding fame in Gavin And Stacey, Dad-of-five Brydon brought home the bacon with various voiceover jobs; his Welsh lilt in demand by the likes of Tesco, Renault, Tango, Abbey National and Sainsbury's. The comedian has described himself as 'affable', a style which clearly goes down well with the nation's consumers. DERVLA KIRWAN . The Irish actress has plenty of stage and screen roles behind her including Ballykissangel and Goodnight Sweetheart but one, very brief, advert has put her into advertising folklore. When she seductively described a chocolate pudding for a Marks and Spencer's advert in 2005, sales soared. She said at the time: 'I went totally over the top. When I hear them on the radio I can't stop laughing. I can barely believe it's me.' The 'This is not just food...' advert was so successful it was reborn again last year...and spawned plenty of spoofs on the internet. NICOLA WALKER . The Last Tango in Halifax star has become one of the most popular faces on screen in recent years. Her voice is pretty recognisable too having provided the soundtrack for adverts for Nationwide, Toyota, Freeview and Max Factor amongst others. The right voice can make millions for a company, as Irish actress Dervla Kirwan proved for M&S in 2005 . How do you make a chocolate pudding sound sexy? Irish actress Dervla Kirwan managed it in 2005 for Marks and Spencer...sales promptly soared and the company used a similar format again last year . The higher end of the vocal range: The master of squeak Joe Pasquale has put his unique voice on ads for National Accident Helpline, while Julian Clary has camped it up for WHSmiths, Argos and Direct Flooring . SHANE RICHIE . As a leading character in Eastenders, Shane Richie's East End twang has long since been his trademark. The London-born actor has used his larynx to great effect in the world of voiceovers, using it to promote Jaffa Cakes, Bounty, Sony Ericsson and Plenty kitchen roll. JOE PASQUALE . The squeaky-voiced comedian has been blessed with one of life's more interesting-sounding voiceboxes so it's unsurprising that he's in demand. Previous work includes the National Accident Helpline and Camelot. JEANNE MARINE . Bob Geldolf's partner, French-born actress Jeanne Marine has worked her Gallic magic on adverts for brands including Evian and Citroen. SALLY LINDSAY . Regional accents can pull in the biggest contracts. Former Coronation Street actress Sally Lindsay has put her Stockport voice to good use in ads for Sainsbury's, Bet 365, Google + and Aardman.

"In the sparse and frozen wilds of Alaska, it is not often that a tasty meal jumps almost straight into your mouth. But that was the case for one bear while hunting salmon in the Brooks River, which runs through the Katmai National Park, in southern Alaska. However, the dozy creature was unable to take advantage of his good fortune, letting the juicy fish slip away, even after it hit him on the nose. Scroll down for video . Fish supper: A bear hunting salmon in Alaska eyes up his dinner as a fish leaps straight at him while swimming up stream in order to reach its breeding grounds . Staring at defeat: This salmon's number appears to be up as it comes face to face with a hungry bear along the Brooks River in the Katmai National Park, Alaska . As close as it gets: As the two creatures come face to face, it looks as if the bear is about to enjoy the most hassle-free meal of its life . Sockeye salmon, which are native to Alaska, migrate up rivers during the spring in order to reach the breeding grounds where they were born in order to spawn. The fish, which spend the rest of the year out in the ocean, will swim against the current in order to reach the spawning grounds, leaping through waterfalls, which is where the bears wait. While the salmon are very fast and difficult to catch underwater, after they leap into the air they have no way of changing course, and so a relatively easy to pick out of the air. Husband and wife photography team Juergen and Christine Sohns captured the moment the bear let his prey get away. The salmon will not eat during their battle upstream, and will undergo a huge transformation, changing from grey to bright red, with their lower lip extending and their head turning green. Swing and a miss: However, nothing is a simple as it seems, and at the very last moment the bear makes a crucial error of judgement, and the Sockeye salmon is allowed to continue its journey . Second time unlucky: Photographer Juergen Sohns explained that once the fish are in the air they cannot change direction, which should make them easy to catch, but not for this bear, as another fish slips away . Once they reach the breeding grounds, usually a freshwater lake, they will mate, before perishing shortly afterwards. These images were captured by Juergen and Christine Sohns, who travelled to Alaska to photograph the salmon migration. Mr Sohns, 56, took the photo and said: 'The bear was just waiting at the best position in the falls to catch the fish when it was leaping.' He said that, while the bear was unlucky on this occasion, he did have more success after moving further up the river. Mr Sohns and his wife, from Germany, are veteran wildlife photographers, and over the last 20 years have travelled to every continent on Earth photographing wildlife.

"They spent the weekend larking around enjoying Easter together. But new reports have suggested that all is not as rosy as it might seem when it comes to Katie Price and Kieran Hayler's marriage. Indeed, it was reported today in Closer magazine that Katie still regularly checks Kieran's phone and makes him tell her whenever she is going out, following his cheating scandal last year. It was also claimed that she no longer allows him to go to the gym as  Katie worries that Kieran's obsession with his looks could feed into his sex addiction. Scroll down for video . It has been reported today that Katie Price still hasn't forgiven her cheating husband Kieran Hayler . The singer Sam Bailey, who is a close friend of Katie's and attended her recent wedding, told Closer: 'Katie panics if she sees Kieran hanging around any women. She's scared he's going to run off with them.' Kieran famously cheated on Katie with not one, but two of her best friends, Jane Poultney and Chrissy Thomas in 2014. At the time, Katie, who was pregnant with her daughter Bunny, slammed both women saying: 'I would not wish it on anyone. It's actually disgusting what those two human beings have done to me and it's cruel.' But the former glamour model - who now has two children with the 28-year-old - decided to stick by her man and Kieran underwent sex addiction therapy for his problems. Kieran cheated on Katie with two of her best friends Chrissy Thomas (left) and Jane Poultney (right) However, the road to relationship recovery has not been an easy one for the pair. Indeed when the couple recently renewed their vows Katie didn't hold back in her wedding speech. She told OK! that she went to town on Keiran: 'It was quite dramatic!,' she said, 'My speech started by saying, ""Some of you are probably wondering why we're sitting here about to renew our vows after only being married two years"". 'Then I said, ""This is why"", and I basically summarised everything that's happened, him sleeping with my best mates when I was pregnant ... I didn't hold back! 'Afterwards everyone was saying to me that it was so hard-hitting they thought I was suddenly going to announce that I didn't want to be with him anymore. 'Then his speech played where he apologised for everything he's done. Then he met me at the end of the aisle and walked me down it.' Katie decided to forgive her husband for cheating, however, relationship expert Tracey Cox has revealed it can be hard for people to move on . Tracey Cox, relationship expert, says that it is possible to forgive someone for cheating but you have to be very clear about where you see your relationship going and how you want it to be. Here's her top tips for getting over an infidelity. 1. Spell Out What You Want  Tracey says: 'You must make it abundantly clear what you will and won't put up with in the future. Spell it out as specifically as possible. What constitutes cheating to you? A flirty text message? A kiss? 'Make them repeat back to you what you've said to them, so there is no chance at all they haven't understood.- Make it clear that you will not tolerate another 'mistake'. Any hint of infidelity and it's over.' 2. You Don't Always Need The Details . Tracey says: 'Ask yourself, do I need to know the details. Some people need to know exactly what happened, why, when, where in order to move forward. Others don't want any details other than why their partner felt the need to stray.' 3. Check Their Transparency . Tracey says: 'Decide on how 'transparent' you need your partner to be. For some, they can only forgive if their partner removes all passwords on emails and their phone, allowing them to look through whenever they feel insecure. However this can go wrong: 'The risk with this is that the person who cheated constantly feels mistrusted, plus emails and texts can be misconstrued. Some people are flirtatious with everyone and what seems to you like a threat, might mean nothing.' 4. Ask For Support . Tracey says: If you feel insecure, ask for reassurance. If your partner isn't willing to do this, they aren't worth giving a second chance. 5. Start Over . Tracey says: 'Start afresh. The old relationship is dead. Start a new, fresh one. Katie also admitted: 'I'll never forgive him and I'll never forget.' Now relationship expert Tracey Cox has revealed that it can be quite common for couples to struggle after and infidelity. She said: 'Once someone has cheated on you, you're forced to rethink the whole relationship. Infidelity breaks the trust bond and destroys the ""You and me against the world"" feeling close couples have. 'It takes time to rebuild trust, sometimes the betrayal is felt so deeply, it's impossible to regain. And it's even harder if the person has cheated more than once: 'If a partner cheats once, with time, some relationships recover. But with repeated cheating, it's much more difficult. 'People do make mistakes but to make the same mistake over and over, that becomes an ingrained pattern of behaviour. 'You take a risk forgiving infidelity even once because you're effectively saying 'You got away with what you did to me'. 'To forgive it several times means you are condoning that behaviour and basically given someone permission to cheat on you.' Representatives for Katie Price declined to comment when contacted by the MailOnline.","Katie Price's husband Kieran Hayler cheated on her twice .

"A former factory girl who earned less than £100 a month is now worth £4.9 billion, and has been named China's richest woman. Zhou Qunfei has shared her incredible 'rags to riches' life story with The People's Daily, after the self-made billionaire's company Lens Technology went public – making her wealthier than Richard Branson. The 45-year-old, whose company supplies protective window glass used in Apple devices, was born into extreme poverty in a village in rural China. Zhou Qunfei, 45, has been named China's richest woman after her company Lens Technology went public . Qunfei's ID badge from when she worked in a factory, making glass for watches. She would send her salary home to her father, who was nearly blinded in an industrial accident. Her mother died when she was five. Her mother died when she was just five years old, and her father was also made blind following an industrial accident. But he encouraged her to study hard to get ahead, and she left home as a teenager to work in a glass-processing factory in Shenzhen, where she was put to work shaping glass for watches. Fed up with her monotonous job, she handed in her resignation after three months – only for her bosses to promote her to a newly-created department. Qunfei said it was perhaps their surprise that a young girl from a rural village was able to write that made them take a chance on her. Bosses at the glass manufacturer where Qunfei started her working life promoted her to head up a new department within the factory after she handed in her notice, having been impressed by the quality of her letter . Qunfei set up Lens Technology when she was just 22 years old. She invented the scratch-resistant glass made by the company after she was inspired when watching how rain would fall on the surface of lotus leaves . 'Maybe it was because my resignation letter was well written and this attracted the attention of the factory supervisor', she said. 'The kept me on and gave me a promotion to head up my own newly created department.' She rose up the ranks to become the director of the whole manufacturing operation, before deciding to set up her own company, aged 22 years old in 1993. It was her rural background that also helped inspire the invention that would help Qunfei make billions. Qunfei says when she was a child she would watch the rain falling on lotus leaves – which later inspired her to create Lens Technology's patented, scratch-resistant coating used on a range of Apple devices. 'Droplets of water would roll around the surface of a lotus leaf and not leave any trace,' she said. 'If it wasn't for my primary school teacher reminding me to be observant I may not have had the inspiration to think of my invention.' Qunfei rented a three-bedroom 'villager apartment' close to Bao'an International Airport to launch her business, using savings of £1,800 from overtime she had completed, as she sent her salary home to her father. In a bold move, she even passed on the contact details of her competitors to her customers in a bid to expand the size of the market, fearing her operation was too small for the amount of work available. Qunfei's company Lens Technology supplies Apple with its scratch-resistant glass. Shares in the company were worth 78 Yuan each on March 31, making the 590 million shares held by Qunfei worth $7.4 billion . Microsoft owner Bill Gates: £45.5 billion . Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg: £17 billion . Landlord Gerald Grosvenor: £7.7 billion (Britain's richest person) Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich: £5.4 billion . Virgin founder Richard Branson: £3 billion . Film director Steven Spielberg: £2 billion . US business tycoon Donald Trump: £2.7 billion . Designer Ralph Lauren: £4.2 billion . Now many of the world's phone manufacturers are her customers, and the number of orders taken by Lens Technology continues to rise. Her company went public on March 18 and she became the richest woman in China officially on March 30 when the market price at close for Lens Technology reached 78.07 yuan per share. This means the 590 million shares held by Qunfei as CEO had a market value of around £4.9 billion, putting her ahead of the real estate tycoon Chen Lihua who is reported to worth £4.1 billion. Qunfei says she is proud of her roots, and invited a former language teacher who urged her to study and be observant to a pre-stock market listing party for her company. Qunfei is part of an explosion of billionaires in China over the past 10 years, many of them self-made.","Zhou Qunfei born in poverty in rural China and started work on shop floor .

"Hundreds of seals are being killed in British waters in order to protect stocks of salmon and other fish which are destined for supermarket shelves. The seal cull even takes place during the animals' breeding season - meaning that some cubs are being left to fend for themselves when their mothers are shot dead. Farmers say the seal killings are essential to stop the animals from destroying fish stocks off the coast of Scotland and northern England, but campaigners insist there are more humane methods of protecting fish. Warning: graphic images . Killed: This picture shows two seals shot in Crovie, north-east Scotland in an attempt to protect fish stocks . Shot: A seal killed near Blackpool; it is legal to cull seals without a licence in England . The practice of seal clubbing in Canada has long been regarded with revulsion around the world - but many Britons may be unaware that the animals are also being killed in the UK. Supporters of the practice claim that seals threaten farmed salmon, wild fish around the coasts and fish which are kept for sporting purposes. Figures from the Scottish government show that 205 seals were legally killed in Scottish waters last year by farmers, fishermen and angling firms. Some campaigners suggest that the real number of dead seals is much higher, as the official figure only includes those which were recorded to the authorities by people who had previously obtained licences. Fishermen have been given licences to kill more than 800 seals this year, although typically marksmen kill only around a quarter of the seals which can legally be culled. Trussed up: Two dead seals which have been thrown in the back of a van after being culled . Disposal: A van winches away the body of a seal after it was shot dead in Crovie to protect fish . Marksman: A gunman waits for the appearance of seals which could threaten stocks of salmon . Activists have called on consumers to more careful about buying Scottish salmon in supermarkets and fishmongers, encouraging them to investigate the origins of their fish. 'People who are horrified by what's happening in places like Norway and Scotland don't realise this is happening on their own doorstep,' said Andy Ottaway of the Seal Protection Action Group. 'The shooting tends to go on in remote locations, so it's not something most people tend to come across. Unlike in some countries, seals are not hunted in the UK for their skin, fur or meat. However, fishermen and farmer are allowed to kill seals which they believe are threatening fish stocks. In Scotland, they must get a licence which restricts the number of animals they can legally kill. But in the rest of Britain, there are no legal restrictions on culling seals, meaning people are free to do as they please. 'It's very simple - ask your retailer before you buy Scottish salmon whether seals were shot in the production of that salmon. 'Not every fish farmer is shooting seals, it's perfectly possible to protect fish without shooting seals.' He insisted that there is no need to cull seals in order to keep them away from fish stocks, saying that acoustic deterrents and strong nets can protect salmon just as well. Around three quarters of farms where seals are killed are certified by the RSPCA as 'Freedom Food' farms, Mr Ottaway added, saying that the animal protection charity should do more to crack down on the practice. He also called on the Scottish government to toughen up its licensing regime, which states that seals should only be killed as a 'last resort'. Mr Ottaway said: 'It's not the last resort if they're not using the best possible deterrents and the best possible nets. 'They recognise the value of seals as a tourist attraction, but have no problem with shooting them.' Threatened: British seal pups could starve if their mothers are shot dead (file photo) Protection: You need a licence to kill seals in Scotland but not in other parts of the UK (file photo) Because there are no restrictions on when farmers can kill seals if they have a licence, breeding mothers are likely to die, leaving their cubs unable to fend for themselves. Outside Scotland, it is legal to kill seals without any need for a licence - meaning that there is no way of measuring exactly how many die every year. The Scottish salmon industry, which produces annual export of £285million, insists that it is necessary to kill seals in order to protect farms. Scott Landsburgh of the Scottish Salmon Producers' Organisation told the Daily Mirror: 'We have championed deterrence techniques that are designed to keep seals away from our fish, and shooting is always last resort. 'When a determined seal attacks fish in our pens it can kill and damage large numbers and it is important that we do whatever we can to reduce the chances of this happening.' A spokesman for the Scottish government said: 'Scottish seals are now better protected than ever before. Since 2011 it has been illegal in Scotland to shoot a seal except as a last resort under strict licensing conditions, and the number of seals shot under licence has more than halved since then.'","More than 200 seals were legally killed off the Scottish coast last year .

"The father branded a 'pikey' during a neighbourhood row over Christmas lights will defiantly switch them on tonight. Kevin Franklin, of Dunstable, Bedfordshire, says he will switch his lights on every evening in April for Autism Awareness Month. Mr Franklin's 15-year-old son Bradley is autistic and the family want to use his Christmas light show to raise awareness for charities working with those with the disability. Kevin Franklin will light up his Christmas lights on the front of his home tonight for Autism Awareness Month . The 53-year-old father put the lights up on his council house last November in preparation for Christmas. But he didn't take them down in January because he wanted to switch the lights on again in April for Autism Awareness Month. The continued presence of the lights in recent weeks has angered some neighbours, prompting a poison pen letter last month. It read: 'I am fed up of seeing your grotesque tacky council house Christmas lights. It is March, for goodness sake. Your house leaves this lovely community looking a disgrace. 'It looks like a state. It sticks out like a sore thumb. I don't want to keep driving past this eyesore, every time I do, my kids scream. I know you live in a council house, but there's no need to make it look like one.' The letter finished 'Yours sincerely, a very disgruntled citizen.' The father kept them up after Christmas ahead of autism week, prompting anger from some neighbours . The continued presence of the light, prompted one local resident to write this abusive message to Mr Franklin . Mr Franklin, who has been medically retired from work after suffering two strokes and a heart attack, said today: 'I will be putting on the lights tonight when it gets dark and switch them off again around 10pm. This will happen throughout April for Autism Awareness Month. 'That was always my plan and it's why, back in January, I decided not to take them down because I knew I would be putting them up again in April. 'I would have taken the lights down after April but now I'm going to leave them on the house out of principle, but I won't be turning them on again until December 2.' The former publican added: 'It's been blown out of all proportion and has turned into a row between council house tenants and those who own their properties. 'Some people think we are scum because we rent, but my house looks a lot tidier than some of those that have been bought by the occupants. 'We are all human beings and the only difference is they have bought their pile of bricks and I rent mine.' He says his nearest neighbours support him in his idea to raise awareness of charities. He added: 'I've even heard some neighbours saying they will donate to charity and I've been told that some people around Dunstable may even put up their own Christmas lights in support.' He said he planned to take them down next month, but now will keep them up 'out of principle'","Father of autistic teenager kept Christmas lights up to raise awareness .

"Nick Clegg is to embark on three days of door knocking in his Sheffield constituency after a shock poll showed he is on course to lose his seat at the general election. The Deputy Prime Minister is trailing Labour by 2 per cent in his formally rock-solid Lib Dem constituency, Sheffield Hallam. Mr Clegg won his seat in 2010 by a huge margin – scooping up more than 50 per cent of the vote. Today he insisted: 'We are going to win Sheffield Hallam. We are confident but not complacent.' Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is trailing Labour by two points in his formally rock-solid Lib Dem constituency in Sheffield, a poll revealed this morning . Aides said he would be out knocking doors on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. But a poll by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft shows 36 per cent of voters in Sheffield Hallam are now planning to vote for Mr Clegg's Labour opponent Oliver Coppard - compared with 34 per cent who said they would support the Deputy Prime Minister. The revelation was included in the latest round of polling of marginal constituencies which could help decide the next election. These include one Tory-held and seven Lib Dem constituencies. The polling suggests that the Lib Dems will hold on in four seats, reinforcing the party's claim that they will do much better than national surveys suggest. On a national level, a poll of polls puts Labour and the Tories neck and neck on 34 per cent, with Ukip on 13 per cent and the Lib Dems trailing on just eight per cent. A spokesman for Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems were confident of winning Sheffield Hallam. He said: 'We are never complacent, we don't take any votes for granted but we are confident on winning because Nick's been the local MP there for ten years, he's got a record in Sheffield that we are happy to defend and his constituents appreciate'. Fourteen-month-old Sophia O'Driscoll met Mr Clegg today as he visited Play Town soft play centre in Bishopbriggs in East Dunbartonshire . Mr Clegg was promoting his policy to treble paternity leave to six weeks with Lib Dem minister Jo Swinson (right) The Lib Dems say internal polling shows an average 9 per cent increase in the vote for their party when candidates are named, but could not say whether this was true in Mr Clegg's case. The spokesman said failing to put the candidates name down, as on the ballot paper, would not yield an accurate result. He said: 'Nick is extremely well known in Sheffield Hallam, and hugely well respected. He has a large personal vote and has ‎delivered consistently over the last 10 years. Labour are talking a good game but they seem to be measuring the curtains already when they are not ‎going to be successful.' Since 2010 there have been 16 local elections in the constituency of which the Lib Dems have won 14. In the last set of local election sin 2014, the Lib Dems won in 4 out of the five wards in Sheffield Hallam. Across the constituency the party got 38.7 per cent of the vote, Labour got 23.6 per cent and the Tories came fifth on 10.7 per cent. Mr Clegg spent today campaigning alongside East Dunbartonshire Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson, including a visit to the Thomas Muir coffee shop in Glasgow . Despite Lib Dem confidence, Labour  claim its candidate in Sheffield Hallam could topple Mr Clegg after building up a 'formidable' campaign team. Tom Watson, Ed Miliband's former election coordinator, said: 'This seat is winnable for Labour. I have never encountered such animosity on the doorstep against an incumbent MP - particularly one as high-profile. 'There are two issues that come up time and again: his position on tuition fees and Sheffield Forgemasters, which has not been forgotten.'","Lib Dem leader is trailing Labour in Sheffield Hallam constituency .

"The Price is Right model who gave away a $21,960 car for free because of dumb mistake has said it's the 'biggest mistake ever in game show history' and the first of her six-year career. Colombian-born Manuela Arbelaez's mind was clearly somewhere else when she removed the wrong price tag during Thursday's show - giving contestant Andrea the prize even though she guessed the wrong price. The model and host Drew Carey both gasped after she revealed the true price of the Hyundai Sonata SE before Andrea had finished guessing. Speaking to the New York Daily News, she described how after the blunder she broke down in tears and 'wanted to go in a wormhole and disappear.' A contestant on The Price is Right has walked away with a $21,960 car for free courtesy of a dumb mistake by model Manuela Arbelaez - who has since said it was the 'biggest mistake ever in game show history' Manuela Arbelaez's mind was clearly somewhere else when she removed the wrong price tag during Thursday's show. She admitted that her body moved quicker than her brain . Model Manuela Arbelaez, left, can't hid her embarassment as contestant Andrea, right, celebrates her win . She added: 'I knew there was no way to fix it. I went to this dark place, and I thought I'd get fired or it would be taken out of my paycheck.' Producers however decided not to punish her, and said there was nothing to worry about during the commercial break. She added that host Carey was 'understanding and supportive' and told her he thought it was the 'funniest thing ever.' ''I'm not in trouble :) phew!,' she wrote on Twitter yesterday. She noted that there have been many model mishaps over the show's 43 seasons. 'There was an occasion when a girl crashed a car into Door 3 and another gave away a trip to Disneyland,' Arbelaez recalled. 'There have been small things like that over the years, but I think my mistake was the most expensive in the history of the show.' However Arbelaez is still mortified by what happened, telling the Daily News: 'I'm a perfectionist. I'm very hard on myself. I do things right,' she said. 'I've never made a mistake in those six years. And of course the one mistake I make, it's the biggest mistake in 'Price is Right' history.' 'I probably would've died if that happened within the first year of me working on the show. In a weird way, I'm kind of glad it happened now.' During the show, when presenters realized what had happened, contestant Andrea shouted out 'I win!' Big-hearted host Carey was left with little opinion but to tell the contestant, 'Congratulations! Manuela just gave you a car! The game is over, folks.' Arbelaez joined the regular rotation of five models on The Price Is Right in April, 2009. In her six-year career, she says this is her first mistake . Despite the blunder, the Colombian said the producers and host were 'supportive and understanding' While Andrea jumps for joy, poor Manuela, 26 didn't know where to hid and she was eventually consoled by both Carey and the delighted contestant. Arbelaez later tweeted about her embarrassment at the heart-warming TV moment. 'I don't usually give expensive gifts, but when I do is a $21,960 CAR,' she tweeted, along with a clip from the show of her looking sheepish.

"A 16-year-old schoolboy has died after falling from a cliff and plunging into the sea in the middle of the night. The teenager, named as Joshua Smith, was plucked from the water by the crew of an RAF rescue helicopter and flown to hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. Police today said that the teen's death was not being treated as suspicious, but have referred it to the police watchdog. Joshua Smith died after falling from a cliff and plunging into the sea in the coastal town of Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northumberland (pictured) A major air and sea search and rescue operation was launched after emergency services received reports that someone had fallen from the cliff at Spittal Point, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland. The coastguard, police, paramedics, firefighters and an RAF rescue helicopter were all scrambled to the scene in early hours of Easter Sunday. Police have said they are not treating Joshua's death as suspicious (file picture) RNLI station manager, John Dunn, said crews used torches from the edge of the cliff in a bid to spot the boy after the alarm was raised at around 2.40am. 'They were just on the edge of the cliff with torches and searchlights trying to spot the guy in the water,' he told the Newcastle Chronicle. 'The helicopter was there doing its job and pulled him out of the water pretty quick.' Joshua, from the Berwick-upon-Tweed area, was plucked from the surf near Spittal Promenade by a crew from RAF Boulmer's search and rescue helicopter and flown to Wansbeck General Hospital, where he later died. Joshua was a  rugby enthusiast and played for his local u16 team. He attended Berwick Academy. Friends described him as a 'lovely lad' who was 'always smiling.' Colin Frame said on the Berwick Rugby Club  Facebook page: 'Tragically we lost one of our rugby family last night. 'On behalf of everyone at Berwick Rugby Club, but especially his Under 16 coaches and fellow players, we send our sincerest condolences to his family and friends. 'At times like this it is difficult to make sense of the world but at times like this we will pull together as a Club to try. RIP Josh. ‪#‎oneclub‬' His headteacher, Alexis Widdowson, said the school was 'devastated' by the teenager's death. 'Josh Smith was a talented boy who touched the hearts of all those who knew him and he will live on in our memories,' she reportedly told the Berkwick Advertiser. 'Our thoughts, now, are with his family and closest friends and we offer them our sincerest condolences.' Flowers were also said to have been left at the scene of his cliff fall. A spokesman for Northumberland Police said: 'At 3.06am police received reports from the ambulance service that a boy had fallen from cliffs at Spittal Point, Berwick. 'Emergency Services attended along with the RNLI and a 16-year-old boy was recovered from the sea. 'He was taken to Wansbeck General Hospital where he later died. 'Enquires are in the early stages to establish the circumstances.' They added that his death has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission 'in line with protocol.'","Joshua Smith, 16, died in hospital after being rescued from the sea .

"Jeremy Clarkson has become a green campaigner, Simon Cowell is going to be put on the £5 note and the Leaning Tower of Pisa is becoming a luxury hotel, it emerged today. But before you get too excited about this string of massive news stories, it might be a good idea to check the date - because all the revelations are nothing more than April Fool's Day pranks. And sharp-eyed readers may have noticed that the Mail also joined in with the trend - our exclusive story about safari park visitors' cars being protected from monkeys with bubble wrap was, sadly, made up. Among the other jokes to sneak into the news today were Tesco's new trampoline aisles, and the claim that the Manchester United team is picked using the power of astrology. Scroll down for video . Made up: Contrary to what the Mail reported, Longleat Safari Park is not putting bubble wrap around visitors' cars . Mock-up: But the safari park in fact has no need of such drastic measures to protect against monkey mayhem . The Guardian's Polli Faro reported that Mr Clarkson had renounced his petrol-loving ways after a 'dark night of the soul', and decided he wanted to devote his post-Top Gear life to campaigning against carbon emissions. He supposedly told the paper that he had started driving a Toyota Prius, and wanted the Government to lower the national speed limit to 20mph, or 45mph on the motorways. 'There comes a time when a man's got to ask himself what he really stands for,' Mr Clarkson is quoted as saying. 'And for me, that's sustainable energy, traffic calming and an end to xenophobia and prejudice.' The Sun revealed that the £5 note is set to be redesigned with Simon Cowell's face on it after a public poll to find the most popular celebrities. David Beckham and Helen Mirren were also reported to be replacing the Queen on banknotes in the near future. Pranks: Jeremy Clarkson is now a green campaigner and Simon Cowell will be put on the £5 note, according to April Fool's Day reports . Innovation: Tesco claims to be introducing bouncy aisles in a publicity campaign including Lucy Mecklenburgh from The Only Way Is Essex . The Independent took a dig at Leicester University's publicity campaign surrounding the discovery of Richard III in the city - claiming that the institution is renaming itself King Richard University in tribute. The university's campus bar will be named 'Carnage@Bosworth', while the main administrative building is to be called Hunchback House, the paper added. It quoted a source as saying: 'Our research shows that up to 10 per cent of people in some countries aren't aware that it was the University of Leicester which found the skeleton of Richard III. Changing the name of the university is the natural next step.' The Telegraph reported that the Leaning Tower of Pisa will be turned into a luxury hotel, called 3.99 Degrees after the angle at which the building tilts. The new hotel will be marketed to Arab tourists, the paper said, but it will require special beds with different-sized legs to combat the slope of the tower. Another story in the paper suggested that top bookshop Foyles had created a new type of bookmark, the 'boo!mark', which emits a loud noise whenever anyone falls asleep while reading. Sacrilege: The Telegraph says that the Leaning Tower of Pisa is going to become a luxury hotel . On sale: The BBC claimed to be offering a replica codpiece inspired by Wolf Hall . Police sparked a Twitter alert after urging followers to vote for their 'favourite' prison inmate to get them freed early as part of an April Fool's prank. Officers in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester used the force Twitter page to post a message on the site at midnight stating: 'Know someone in prison? 'You can get them released early by voting for them on here. The prisoners with the most votes also wins a holiday.' Other tweets on the @GMPRadcliffe page added: 'I have been told it is two weeks in a five star hotel in Cyprus for two people and £500 spending money. It is a goodwill gesture from the politicians due to the election coming soon.' The message sparked a flurry of activity with users claiming prison was a 'holiday camp anyway', and jokingly using the hashtag #NeedHoliday to confess to carrying out their own crimewaves. In the Daily Express, it was claimed that Tesco is set to bring in trampoline aisle which allow customers to bounce up and reach the top shelves with ease. The Daily Mirror turned its attentions to the forthcoming general election, reporting that a new Office for Estimation has been set up which will use social media to decide who should run the country during coalition negotiations. Another political story came from The Sun, which said that Ed Miliband is planning to dye his hair blond in an attempt to become more like the Mayor of London. A Labour source told the paper: 'Through Boris, he has seen that hair is something that people care about.' The Local.es, an English-language news site based in Spain, reported that the popular holiday resort of Benidorm had banned the full English breakfast - a move which could strike terror into the hearts of British tourists. Local officials urged holidaymakers to try Spanish specialities such as tortillas or pan con tomate, the website claimed. Flipped: Visitors to com.google are presented with this mirror image version of the search engine homepage . Drone: An image of the 'Domi-No-Driver', which supposedly delivers pizza without human intervention . Actor David Suchet got together with his radio presenter brother John for one of the more ambitious pranks - he filled in on John's Classic FM show without telling listeners. Many fans expressed concerns that the presenter might have a cold because he sounded so different, only for David to reveal that he was in fact an impostor. Google is usually keen to join in with the April Fool's fun, and this year was no different as the web giant unleashed at least three different pranks. The search engine revealed a mirror-image version of its homepage, which can be accessed by typing in com.google and shows search results flipped around. It also jumped on the selfie bandwagon, announcing a new service allowing users to share instant photographic reactions to any website they visit. And the site's 'Fiber' division, which is rolling out high-speed internet across the US, claimed to have a new dial-up mode which replicates the experience of using the web 20 years ago in order to induce a feeling of zen-like calm. Mumsnet was another website to make a hoax announcement as it claimed to be founding a political party, the MNP, which will represent the interest of mothers. New resident: The Battersea Dogs and Cats Home claimed to have taken possession of a lion . Job ad: The BBC is apparently recruiting for a 'Director of Better', according to an absurdly verbose ad . The sporting world was not immune from April Fool's gags - the Evening Standard reported that Arsenal and Chelsea have commissioned a joint sculpture of controversial footballer Ashley Cole, wearing a shirt with both clubs' colours on it. And it emerged in The Sun that Manchester United boss Louis Van Gaal uses astrology to pick his teams, only choosing players whose star signs are compatible with one another. The Independent had a scoop about a new form of football technology, left-footed balls crafted specifically for players who prefer using their left rather than right. In showbiz, it was claimed in the Radio Times that Ant and Dec were planning to add a third person to their line-up - Strictly Come Dancing's Anton du Beke. The new trio, dubbed 'Ant and Dec and Anton du Beke', will make their television debut on February 30 next year. The BBC also joined in the fun as it announced it would be selling a 'replica Tudor codpiece' based on Wolf Hall, available in Henry VIII, Henry IX and Henry XXL sizes. Local newspapers across the UK took the opportunity to prank their readers - the Liverpool Echo carried disturbing reports off a great white shark in the River Mersey, while the Western Telegraph revealed that Batman star Christian Bale is set to be immortalised in his home town of Haverfordwest with a 12ft gold statue. Workout: Virgin Trains' new 'Fitness Coach' allows passengers to exercise while on the move . Trend: Miz Mooz said it was introducing 'selfie shoes' to cash in on the narcissistic fashion . Domino's was among the companies to make April Fool's announcements, posting a video on Vine of its new 'Domi-No-Driver', a drone motorcycle which can deliver pizzas without any human intervention. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home shared a picture supposedly showing a lion, called April, which is currently living alongside smaller felines in the home, and Australian airline Qantas claimed to have changed its name to 'Quantas' - bringing an end to years of confusion over the bizarre spelling. The BBC took a dig at its own reputation for incomprehensible corporate-speak, issuing a job ad looking for a 'Director of Better' who can 're-set the dial'. Virgin Trains and Virgin Active announced a new 'Fitness Coach', allowing passengers to exercise while they travel, and Transport for London claimed that commuters should now stand on the left and walk on the right, a reverse of the usual situation. Shoe company Miz Mooz made fun of selfie sticks with its 'selfie shoes', footwear with a hole in the end which can fit a smartphone in. Change: Qantas announced that it had added a U to its name to avoid confusion over the spelling . Complaint: A letter from the Royal Albert Hall's archive addressed to Beatles manager Brian Epstein . While April Fool's Day may be thought of as a time for childish pranks, a number of more highbrow institutions also took part by issuing made-up announcements. Nature, one of the world's leading scientific journals, published a hoax paper suggesting that dragons may in fact be real, and charting their prevalence against the rise and fall of global temperatures. The Royal Albert Hall also carried out its own April Fool's prank, releasing a letter supposedly from its archives criticising the Beatles for referring to the building in their song A Day in the Life. In the letter, an official tells the band's manager that they must not claim there are 4,000 holes in the Albert Hall, adding: 'Even if you count the doorways as holes, that would only make 32.'","April 1 has heralded a crop of fake news stories hoodwinking readers .

"YouTube is set to offer an ad free, subscription-based service for the first time. The plan was revealed in an email sent out to YouTube Partners. It will offer consumers the choice to pay for an 'ads-free' version of YouTube for a monthly fee. YouTube is set to offer an ad free, subscription-based service for the first time, according to an email sent out to YouTube Partners. The additional monetization option requires partners to agree to updated terms on YouTube's Creator Studio Dashboard, which notes that the changes will go into effect on June 15, 2015. According to YouTube's updated Partner Program Terms, YouTube will pay creators 55% of the total net revenues from subscription fees – the same percentage associated with advertising revenues. ""By creating a new paid offering, we'll generate a new source of revenue that will supplement your fast growing advertising service,"" the letter said. One thing the letter to creators nor the updated Terms references is the price of the subscription offering itself, nor does it disclose when the service will be offered to the public. 'The June 15 date references when the Terms changes go into effect, but this doesn't necessarily mean that the service will be immediately public to all YouTube users at that time – it could be a staged roll out, or YouTube could have simply wanted the legalese in place ahead of the broader subscription service's launch,' said TechCrunch. YouTube star: Felix's (top right) channel has received seven billion hits since he launched it four years ago - and youTube says people like him could make more money using the new subscription service . He was 2014's undisputed 'King of YouTube' with 4.1 billion hits and he's amassed a staggering 33 million subscribers, who worship the webcam 'PewDiePie' broadcasts from. In fact, if Felix Kjellberg's die-hard fans formed their own country, it would be the world's 34th largest - and more populous than Greece, Hungary and his native Sweden combined. Despite being one of the YouTube generation's most popular and influential figures, the video blogger has chosen a quiet life by the Brighton seaside with a beautiful Italian girl he met online. However, sources told Bloomberg the offering is expected to go live this year. The email promises YouTube Creators will generate additional income beyond what's available today through advertising, and speaks of the subscription service as something that will 'excite your fans and generate a previously untapped, additional source of revenue for you.' 'YouTube will pay you 55% of the total net revenues recognized by YouTube from subscription fees that are attributable to the monthly views or watchtime of your Content as a percentage of the monthly views or watchtime of all or a subset of participating content in the relevant subscription offering (as determined by YouTube),' it says. 'If your Content is included in and viewed by a user in multiple subscription offerings, YouTube will pay you based on the subscription offering with the highest amount of net revenues recognized by YouTube, as calculated by YouTube.' In October, YouTube head Susan Wojcicki, who had been spearheading the monetization efforts, explained at the Code Mobile conference that the option would especially appeal to mobile viewers who are increasingly interested in avoiding advertisements. Earlier this year, after a year of speculation, YouTube officially launched its subscription music service. Called Music Key, the beta version launches today - but is currently invite-only.

YouTube also announced its new Music Tab, which will help find videos and full albums more easily . The desktop site, as well as the Android and iOS apps, have been redesigned to make favourite music videos, recommended playlists, and playlists of trending music more visible. Users can now see an artist's discography, and play a full album with both their official music videos and high-quality songs from music partners.

It matches the options, and price, offered by Spotify for its own paid-for subscriptions, but with the added bonus of videos. It is not be the first time YouTube has experimented with paid-for plans. In May last year, the Google-owned video giant launched a paid-for subscription service that charged users from 79p (99 cents) a month to watch videos on specialist channels, such as Comedy.TV and PGA Digital Golf. Individual channels charge more for a subscription if they choose to, and the majority of UK subscriptions charge £1.49 ($2.50) a month. Over 50 channels were launched as subscription-only, but not all paid-for channels can be subscribed to in the UK - namely Jim Henson Family TV, and National Geographic Kids. The revenue split between YouTube and the channel producers and musicians is expected to be similar to the 45-55 split that YouTube currently has with advertising revenue.

"The state of Oregon on Friday released 94,000 emails involving the fiancee of former Gov. John Kitzhaber, who resigned amid scandal earlier this year over allegations that the former first lady used her relationship with him to land contracts for her business. The emails show the very active role that Cylvia Hayes, Kitzhaber's longtime companion, played in his administration, as well as the tension that it sometimes raised with the governor's staff. Hayes routinely attended meetings, was copied on emails among senior staff and requested information or clerical assistance from state employees. Kitzhaber had downplayed her role in the administration, insisting she was not adviser or public official, which would require her to adhere to the ethics laws that he and his staff must uphold. Scroll down for video . Emails released by the state of Oregon show Cylvia Hayes, (right) fiancee of former Governor John Kitzhaber (left), shows that she played a very active role in his scandalous administration . Kitzhaber, a Democrat, resigned in February, saying the influence-peddling allegations surrounding Hayes had become too much of a distraction. The FBI is investigating and has issued subpoenas for the emails and thousands of other records. The emails released Friday are messages between Hayes and the official email accounts for staff members in Kitzhaber's office. Yet to be released are Hayes' interactions with officials in other state agencies, as well as emails from her personal accounts that discussed state business. Hayes has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the release of her personal emails. The emails show that Hayes was involved in policy meetings, and her input was sometimes sought on policy questions. In one example from April 2011, shortly after Kitzhaber took office, the governor's executive assistant sent an email to an aide assigned to Hayes. She had scheduled a meeting for two policy advisers, Kitzhaber and Hayes, but the governor had to leave early. 'They will discuss natural resource and jobs/economy-related issues,' the assistant wrote. 'The Governor will stay for 15 minutes; but I expect the meeting to last 30 minutes.' A year later, Hayes was asked to weigh in on a bill before the Legislature. 'Cheryl, Regarding bullet 3 of HB 4144, I would not like to see it removed,' Hayes wrote. 'That is counter to where we are headed with the ten year energy plan and implementing carbon accounting.' Hayes routinely attended meetings, was copied on emails among senior staff and requested information or clerical assistance from state employees . Her relations with staff sometimes caused tensions. In December 2012, Hayes sent a note to all staff asking them to buy $100 tickets to a fundraiser. Kitzhaber's chief of staff quickly replied: 'Cylvia, can I ask you not to use folks' state email to do fundraising requests. It puts the team in an awkward position given your role as First Lady.' Last year, Hayes complained to Kitzhaber's communications director, Nkenge Harmon-Johnson, that a speech she gave didn't go as well as it could have because a speechwriter hadn't finished a draft. The writer had shifted to work on a late-scheduled speech for the governor. Harmon-Johnson was later fired, in part because of her frosty relationship with the first lady, according to her termination letter. Hayes often sought opportunities to travel to conferences or speak to audiences. In December 2013, a spokeswoman for the Bend-LaPine Schools learned Kitzhaber and Hayes would be in town and invited them to a fundraiser to support scholarships for after-school sport and club programs. While the governor couldn't make it, Hayes said she would be 'happy to attend and make a few brief remarks about the Prosperity Initiative and how athletic scholarships helped me become a first generation college grad.' When the organizers said there's no room for her to speak but they'd still love her to come, she emailed her assistant: 'please find a nice way to decline.' Shortly after Hayes held a tearful news conference last October to acknowledge that she was paid to enter a fraudulent marriage in 1997 with a man seeking immigration benefits, she replied to an email from a European man she'd met at a conference. 'It sounds like maybe you have not seen the media firestorm I am in the midst of,' she wrote. 'It is very intense, painful and embarrassing. I do know it will pass as the campaign season closes. I will make a note to follow up with you in November to set up a call.'","Cylvia Hayes allegedly used her relationship with disgraced Governor John Kitzhaber to land contracts for her business .

"A Sydney teenage girl last seen leaving for school 40 years ago probably ran away and may still be alive, a coronial inquest has found. Marian Carole Rees was 13 when she disappeared from Hillsdale in southern Sydney in early April 1975 after telling a friend that she had forgotten something and jumped off her school bus. The teenager often talked of running away from home and had said goodbye to her brother on the morning she disappeared, Magistrate Sharon Freund said in findings handed down on Thursday. Marion Carole Rees (pictured) who went missing 40 years ago may still be alive, according to an inquest . Ms Freund said the disappearance did not appear suspicious and there was no evidence suggesting suicide. The teenager probably ran away with the intention of permanently cutting ties with family and friends, she said. 'It is likely nothing has changed in the intervening period.' 'She may still want to avoid detection and not wish to make contact with her family.' She said she was unconvinced, on the balance of probabilities, that Ms Rees is dead. Magistrate Freund said 'the ability to assume a new identity and new life would have been a lot easier forty years ago'. Marion (pictured with her family) was reportedly fed up with taking care of her younger siblings, as her mother had a drinking problem . Marian had only been living in Australia for a year after emigrating when she went missing while on the bus to Matravill High School with her friend Tanya Davenport. The 13-year-old jumped up to say she had forgotten something and got off the bus. She hasn't been seen since, however her mother's boyfriend at the time came out to say he thought he spotted her at a bus stop in Kingsford just weeks after she disappeared. In a statement last year, Mrs Davenport told the Daily Telegraph that Marian was preoccupied during their bus journey and thought she may have seen something when she jumped off the bus. '[Marian] was sitting next to me and from memory she looked a bit upset. During our conversation, she was looking out the window. I don't know whether she saw something or what but she jumped out of her seat and said 'I've forgotten something. I've got to go and I'll see you at school,' Mrs Davenport said. Marian had spoke about running away on numerous occasions according to her aunt and grandmother . Ms Rees would now be 53 years old. It is believed that she may have been running away from her mother Margaret and her two siblings John and Joanne, who she often had to take care of due to her mother's drinking. After her disappearance Marian's relatives, including her grandmother and her aunt, told of how the teenager longed to run away from her normal life. The case has been referred back to the Missing Person's Unit for further investigation as the Magistrate believes there were holes in the police investigation at the time.","A 13-year-old girl who vanished 40 years ago may still be alive .

"This is the moment that a crew of firefighters struggled to haul a giant  pig out of a garden swimming pool. The prize porker, known  as Pigwig, had fallen into the pool in an upmarket neighbourhood in Ringwood, Hampshire. His owners had been taking him for a walk around the garden when the animal plunged into the water and was unable to get out. A team from Dorset Fire and Rescue struggled to haul the huge black pig out of swimming pool water . The prize porker known as Pigwig had fallen into the water and had then been unable to get out again . Two fire crews and a specialist animal rescue team had to use slide boards and strops to haul the huge black pig from the small pool.

'One crew of firefighters from Ferndown and a specialist animal rescue unit from Poole were mobilised to this incident. 'Once in attendance the crew secured the pig with strops, and requested the attendance of another appliance which was mobilised from Ringwood by our colleagues in Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters were also called out to a horse which had fallen into a swimming pool in Heyshott, West Sussex .

Wet and very bedraggled, the exhausted animal put up no opposition when firefighters arrived to hoist her out of the small garden pool in Heyshott. The two-hour rescue operation ended with the wayward horse being fitted with straps under her belly and lifted up into the air with an all-terrain crane before being swung around and deposited back on dry land.

"Ten-man Southampton lifted the Premier League U21 Cup, but they needed extra time, and a brilliant winner, to see off a stubborn Blackburn side. The game was settled shortly before the break in the additional half hour, when Sam Gallagher unleashed a wonder-strike from long-range, after the two-legged tie had ended 1-1 after 180 minutes. Gallagher, who made 18 Premier League appearances for the club last season, but has not been in the first team this time around, smashed a left-footed shot into the bottom corner from 25 yards, giving Blackburn keeper David Raya no chance, after cutting in from the right wing and playing a one-two with Josh Sims.

The Saints players mob goalscorer Ryan Seager after he converted a chance to put them ahead . Earlier, striker Ryan Seager had put Saints ahead with a tidy finish after the ball fell fortuitously to him in the Blackburn box, but the unfortunate Matt Targett turned the ball into his own net to level the game. Targett is the latest of a string of promising left backs to emerge from the club's academy and get a chance in the first team, but he could do nothing when a deflected cross struck him on the head and trickled past Paulo Gazzaniga. Southampton were reduced to 10 men late on in normal time, when midfielder Harrison Reed, who had been superb in the goalless first leg, was dismissed for a second bookable offence. But the hosts held on for extra time in front of 12,000 fans at St Mary's, and the home faithful were rewarded with a winning goal of the highest quality.

"A couple who chose to forsake their dream wedding in order to pay for one final shot at IVF are celebrating giving birth to twins and even found a way to say their 'I do's' Becca Litchfield, 29, and partner Dale, 30, from Gotham, Nottingham, were heart-broken when they discovered their savings would only be enough to cover the cost of a wedding, or fertility treatment. Desperate for a family, the couple chose to sacrifice their dream wedding and go ahead with IVF, but were over the moon when weeks later they became winners of a wedding competition. Becca and Dale Litchfield decided to give up their dream wedding in order to have one last shot at IVF and have since welcomed twins,  Darci-Mai (left) and  Stanley (right) The happy couple said their vows, and were overjoyed when they discovered the fertility treatment had worked - and Becca gave birth to twins Stanley and Darci-Mai. The full-time mother says that the couple can't believe their luck having achieved both of their dreams. 'When we realised we'd couldn't have children and get married, it was heart breaking,' she said. 'It was devastating to give up one of our dreams. We knew that we weren't getting any younger so the best option was to try IVF one last time, and sacrifice the wedding. 'It was a risk, because the IVF could have failed - and we'd have ended up with neither. 'But when we won the wedding competition, and then found out I was pregnant, it was unbelievable. Although they had given up on the idea of their perfect wedding the couple were blessed with yet another stroke of luck when they won a wedding contest which allowed them to finally get married . Before they conceived Darci-Mai (right) and Stanley (left) Becca and Dale had attempted two rounds of IVF . 'Now I've got my dream - the perfect husband and children, I couldn't be happier.' Becca and Dale, first started IVF treatment in 2012 after a year of failing to conceive naturally. The couple spent £5,500 on two rounds of IVF, keeping back an additional sum of money that they planned to spend on their wedding day. But after two failed attempts, Becca and Dale were forced to make a decision, Becca says that it was an incredibly difficult one to make. 'We were spending all of our money on IVF treatment hoping we'd conceive but after we failed twice I wondered if I'd ever get pregnant,' she said. 'We planned to use the spare money to get married but knew because of our ages we'd have to have kids now or never. 'I'd always dreamt of feeling my baby kick for the first time and the bond after giving birth, so I knew we had to try IVF one last time.' After winning the wedding competition the couple were able to have the white wedding they had always wanted . Becca, pictured with Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) In order to conceive, Becca, pictured with Darci-Mai, had to take three hormone injections a day but she says it was entirely worth it . After abandoning hopes of a big celebration the couple decided to at least secure their relationship with a proposal. 'We were advised to wait for a year before trying again - I was just counting down the days,' she said. 'It felt like time was ticking away so quickly. At the end of the year, Dale and I officially became engaged - it was a way to lift our spirits and we thought if we couldn't have a big wedding, we could at least get engaged.' But unbeknownst to Becca, during their year long wait for IVF, Dale, who works as an electrician, entered the pair into a win a wedding competition. Becca says that once again fate was in their favour having initially been runners-up. Becca says that she and Dale couldn't stop beaming when they discovered they were expecting twins . 'We actually came second in the competition, but then the first place dropped out and so we won,' she said. 'We couldn't believe it - after all the heart ache and the decision making, we were getting both. 'It felt like a miracle. I'd always dreamt of a big white wedding and walking down the aisle, but I'd put that to the back of my mind. 'I couldn't believe my dreams were going to become a reality.' After the wedding, the pair changed fertility clinics and had their final round of IVF. It was here that medics discovered Becca had low hormone levels and started to treat her for the problem, giving her three hormone injections a day to increase the chance of her falling pregnant . When Becca first discovered she was pregnant she was so shocked she took four tests to make sure. She gave birth to twins Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) Becca says that it was a challenging period but she was prepared to carry on in hope of having her dream family. 'I felt like a pin cushion while I was having all the treatment but knew it was worth it. 'Then after the eggs were implanted I took two weeks off work to relax and do nothing other than sit with my legs up in the hope it would help us to get pregnant. 'Then we did a pregnancy test and it was positive. We didn't want to get our hopes up but after four more tests said we were pregnant I believed it.' Overjoyed with the news Becca was then astounded to find out that she was not carrying just one baby but two. 'Once I knew I was pregnant I had a feeling we were going to have twins and when doctors confirmed it we couldn't believe it. 'When the doctor told me there were two heartbeats we were all gobsmacked. The twins were born on 27th September last year . Becca says that even when the Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) are screaming she feels lucky to have them . 'Me and Dale sat beaming at each other, we couldn't believe we were about to have one baby let alone twins.' The twins were born in September last year and six months later the couple still can't quite believe their luck. Becca said: 'It's amazing to think how dramatically our life changed in one year - we got married and now have a beautiful boy and girl. 'Even now I still feel so privileged to have children - even when they are screaming I keep thinking thank goodness that they are with us. 'Before I thought of myself as very unlucky, I'd never won anything in my life. 'But since winning our wedding and having kids it still doesn't feel real. 'I've definitely used my life's worth of luck now but I don't care because I've got everything I ever dreamed of so I'm happy. 'Finally everything's gone right, we are finally married parents after everything we've been through it is incredible.'","Becca and Dale Litchfield spent their wedding savings on IVF .

"The White House was stalling for time on Wednesday as talks with Iran over its nuclear program threatened to stretch into another day of overtime. President Barack Obama's spokesman refused to give reporters an update on the status of the meetings or scheduling, saying he would leave those announcements to negotiators. But he confirmed that 'the sense that we have is yes, that the talks continue to be productive and that progress is being made.' Speculation was swirling on Wednesday afternoon that representatives from the six countries, including the U.S., participating in the Switzerland-based discussions with Iran in were on the verge of making a deal as French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius rushed back to Lausanne. Scroll down for video . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, right, checks his watch outside the Beau Rivage Palace Hotel in a break during Iran nuclear program talks in Lausanne. Six world powers and Iran are still trying to reach a preliminary accord on reining in Tehran's nuclear program, after failing to agree crucial details such as the lifting of U.N. sanctions by a midnight deadline the day before . German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier had said earlier in the day that his French counterpart would come back once the discussions 'enter a decisive stage.' A French official told Reuters Fabius' return should not be interpreted to mean a deal was imminent, however. Already on hand were U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Britain's Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. A spokesman for Kerry said Wednesday afternoon that the cabinet-level official would remain in Switzerland overnight and indicated that a political 'understanding' with Iran had not yet been reached. Journalists covering the talks in Switzerland were provided with a 'lid,' or promise that no news would be made, until at least the wee hours of Thursday morning, meaning news of a deal, if one is in the works, could come as early as Wednesday evening on the East Coast. The White House's top spokesman Josh Earnest cautiously discussed the ongoing talks as he fielded more than a dozen pointed questions on the subject during his daily briefing Wednesday afternoon. Rotating between tough talk and a soft-handed approach, Earnest said 'the time has come for the Iranian negotiators to begin to make the kind of serious commitments that international community, including the United States, will insist upon. 'While the talks have been productive, we have not yet received the specific tangible commitments that the international community seeks.' Discussions were scheduled to cease at Midnight on Tuesday if Iran was still unwilling to agree to terms set forth by Russia, China, Britain, Germany, the U.S. and France, known globally as the P5+1. The White House had last week said that March 31 was a hard deadline for a preliminary accord, to be formalized by June 30, and that talks had dragged on long enough. As the clocked ticked down, however, it made an about-face and said the U.S. would continue to work toward a deal as long as it felt progress was being made. Earnest said Wednesday that the United States' thinking 'hasn't changed' and it would not 'arbitrarily' or 'abruptly' end talks if it made sense to continue. At the same time, he said, if the U.S. sense that 'the talks have stalled' they, in conjunction with the international community, would walk away. GOOD NEWS ON THE WAY? From left: British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Senior Director at the National Security Council Robert Malley and Kerry chat during a break in discussions . STALL TACTICS: President Barack Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, refused to give reporters an update on the status of the meetings or scheduling on Wednesday afternoon, saying he would leave those announcements to negotiators . He rejected the notion that the U.S. was giving Iran too much 'leeway' in the talks, telling a reporter, we are 'insisting on a good deal.' A good deal, the White House said said on repeat, is one that would stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and the president will not accept a 'bad deal.' What would happen if an acceptable deal cannot be reached was unclear as the White House was won't to engage in hypothetical scenarios. 'I am at this point reluctant to fast forward to what would happen at the end of the day if an agreement is not reached because they are still discussing an agreement right now as we speak,' Earnest told reporters. If diplomacy, fails, he said that the 'military option' would be considered as would additional sanctions. The White House has resisted bipartisan efforts to put new restrictions on Iran throughout the last several months, saying it would veto sanctions legislation if it came to the president's desk. 'But yeah, if those negotiations break down and the Iranians walk away without demonstrating the willingness to make some serious commitments, then that does bring some of those issues back into play,' Earnest said Wednesday. 'We'll evaluate that when we come to it.' Senators have said they will begin voting on legislation to insert themselves into the process after they return from their Passover-Easter break on April 13 if the White House hasn't sealed a deal. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with the White House's national security team, participate on Tuesday in a secure video teleconference from the Situation Room of the White House with Secretary of State John Kerry, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and the U.S. team in Lausanne, Switzerland . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed Wednesday morning that 'ministers have reached a general agreement on all key aspects of a final settlement of this issue.' Asserting that 'it will be put down in writing over the next few hours, maybe during the day, Lavrov added. And Britain's Hammond said, 'I think we have a broad framework of understanding, but there are still some key issues that have to be worked through.' 'Some of them are quite detailed and technical so there is still quite a lot of work to do but we are on it now and we'll keep going at it,' he noted. U.S. diplomats said it was 'not true,' as Lavrov suggested, that key issues had been worked out. The White House's spokesman did not directly deny that an agreement was already being drafted when he spoke to reporters later that day. 'I think I would only point out that there's not a significant difference between those two verbs,' he said after a reporter asked him if talks had moved on from the negotiation stage to the drafting stage. 'It's possible to do both,' he said, playing coy. 'It's possible to negotiate as you draft or to draft as you negotiate.' A source on the ground in Switzerland following the talks told Daily Mail Online that it 'would shock everybody here' if Iran conceded to the international community's demands to significantly scale back its uranium enrichment program and ship out much of what it has already produced because 'there is no indication that the parties have moved.' The source described the situation as a 's***show' at this point and said negotiators are poised to 'limp across' the finish line. 'The Americans desperately needed something to come back to Congress with,' the source said, predicting that the Obama administration will make a 'face-saving concession' that will be announced late tonight or early tomorrow morning. The White House told reporters on Wednesday that whether a pact is made in the end or not, the president will address the public to explain the administration's rationale.","President Barack Obama's spokesman refused to give reporters an update on the status of the meetings or scheduling .

"George and Amal submitted plans to their council for a 12-seater home cinema . They're newlyweds settling down in their dream home, and this weekend it was reported that George and Amal Clooney have submitted plans to improve their £10million Berkshire mansion - which include the addition of a 12-seater cinema. While this may seem extravagant, according to industry experts, a cinema room is now an 'expected' luxury in properties worth over £10million. Robert Osborn, co-founding director of top luxury property developer Consero London  explained: 'Home cinemas are a growing requirement, particularly for brand new or newly refurbished properties.' 'At the high level, media rooms are a valuable use of space and are expected, particularly in homes priced above £10 million. We also often include pantries or bars as an addition to support the media room.' As extravagant as it may seem, home cinemas are often a clever investment as they make use of low value space in the dark basement. Property insider, Ben Hubbard, an asset manager at OracleAMG explains: 'Cinemas are often situated in the basement of a dwelling because there is no need for natural light.' Ben estimates that cinemas can cost anything from a few thousand to £100,000 to kit out and says: 'Home cinemas can vary from a converted surplus bedroom within an average sized dwelling to a 30-seater theatre in the basement of a much larger home. 'There's a vast difference in the set-up costs depending on how far you want to go,' he said. Ben believes that the home cinema trend is growing, and having a dedicated cinema room is becoming 'important' in high-end properties. But does it ever reap financial rewards when it comes to selling? 'If one was to spend fortunes investing in a cinema equipment for an average sized family home - the chances are it will not add any value to the house as a majority of the purchasers will have different uses for that room,' Ben said. Scroll down for video . The couple's £10m Grade-II listed Berkshire abode, which will undergo renovations including the addition of a home cinema and swimming pool . This Surrey screening room has velvet seats and inset lighting - perfect inspiration for the Clooney in-house cinema complex . 'At the other end of the scale the more space the dwelling has the more likely you’re going to expect to see a cinema room and therefore the more value it will add. Generally though it adds  saleability factor rather than actual value. 'Set-ups can range from large plasma TVs with off-the-shelf surround sound systems in a darkened rooms to tiered theatres with cinema quality digital projectors. 'High-end cinemas will have been constructed to consider the rest of the house and can be soundproofed to prevent noise problems occurring elsewhere, which also increases the cost.' All apartments in the super-prime development in One Hyde Park have access to this amazing home cinema. A three-bedroom apartment is currently on the letting market with Tunstall Property at...£17,000 per week .

But it's not only interior decisions George and Amal will have to grapple with, questions involving audiophile speakers, sub woofers, heat management systems and aerospace grade mirrors (for the projector, not Amal) will also have to be discussed at length.

"Stretching out his arms and looking beseechingly upwards, this is the moment that 16-month-old Noah Ginesi from Penrith in Cumbria reached out for a hug with Prince Charles. The heart-warming moment occurred during a visit to the Rheged Centre in Cumbria, where the Prince of Wales was meeting farmers and charity staff. Charles, who is grandfather to 20-month-old Prince George and has another grandchild on the way, looked delighted and bent down to talk to the little boy who was held by his mother, Genevieve. Scroll down for video . Adorable: One-year-old Noah Ginesi, from Penrith in Cumbria, reaches up for a hug with Prince Charles . The prince was making his first stop on a day-long tour of Cumbria, with rural communities and businesses topping his agenda. Clearly on good form, Charles was visiting the Rheged Centre to inspect a photo exhibition entitled Herdwick: A Portrait of a Lakeland. The work of photographer Ian Lawson, many of the photos feature Herdwick sheep, a breed native to Cumbria and whose name comes from the Old Norse herdvyck - sheep pasture. Charles' visit came as part of his work for the Campaign for Wool and The Prince's Countryside Fund. The former is one of the prince's environmental initiatives and promotes the use of British wool in everything from clothing to furniture. Much obliged: Charles bent down to coo over the infant but didn't pick him up . Jovial: The Prince of Wales was on cheerful form and chatted happily with locals . Warm welcome: Prince Charles, who was wearing a tailored tweed coat, got a warm welcome from locals . It also stages an annual Wool Week which gives a platform to textile producers and farmers, and is enthusiastically endorsed by Charles. The prince's eco credentials have come under scrutiny of late, with the subject believed to be one of those broached in his infamous 'spider letters'. Charles has also been criticised for his use of helicopters, after it emerged on Monday that he had used a chopper for an 80 mile round-trip to Ascot racecourse from Highgrove on Sunday. Getting to that event, The Prince’s Countryside Fund Raceday which included a 'Lamb National' race, used up 200 gallons of fuel and came hot on the heels of a video recorded for Earth Day in which he implored viewers to use less fuel. Today, however, saw him return to travelling by car, with Charles whizzing through an official day of visits and meetings with the Cumbrian farming community. His second stop, which was also in conjunction with The Prince's Countryside Fund, saw him meet members of the Westmorland County Agricultural Society, one of the oldest in the country, and locals working for other country charities. Looking around: Charles was given a tour of the exhibition by photographer Ian Lawson (right) Conservation: The photo exhibition focused on a traditional breed of sheep native to Cumbria . Native: The Herdwick sheep has lived in Cumbria for more than 1,000 years . Passion: The Prince of Wales was there as part of his work for the Campaign for Wool . Among them was the Dry Stone Walling Association, which safeguards the UK's network of historic dry stone walls, and Broadband for the Rural North. Fast internet connection remains a real problem in many rural spots, including those close to London such as parts of Bedfordshire, but is particularly acute in more remote areas. Charles is known to be particularly sympathetic to the cause of high speed rural broadband, in particular because of the limit on job creation that slow internet speeds and dial up connections create. The prince's final stop was at furniture makers Peter Hall & Son where he was introduced to some of the Prince's Trust apprentices who work there.

Pictured: NSW police busted an illegal firearm operation in the Casino and Lismore areas last month . Both suburbs saw an increase of almost 500 guns in their areas over the last five years. Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki (pictured) said US's popular national gun laws and pop culture was likely to be driving the increase . Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki said the United State's popular national gun laws, and the country's influence on Australia through popular culture, was likely to be driving the increase in licence holders in the state. 'There is an element in the community who are swayed by the US culture that guns are a right rather than a privilege,' Supt Plotecki told News Corp. 'Generally speaking however Australians don't have a strong gun culture and recent strong reaction against relaxing our gun ownership laws is indicative of this - Australians don't want lax gun laws'. He added that there did not appear to have been an increase in gun related crime that related to the increase in licences. Although the figures revealed that each person with a licence owns an average of 2.3 guns each, the Firearm Registry's regulations suggest it's not easy to acquire a licence. Each request must include a 'genuine reason', proved through supporting evidence, with each reason in turn holding restrictions on the type of gun that can be owned. Sport, recreational hunting, rural occupation, firearms collection and animal welfare are all listed as 'genuine reasons'.

"She's a household name, having hosted several TV shows, edited the Australian Women's Weekly, and launched her own wellness website 'Balance by Deborah Hutton'... and now Deborah Hutton has added another accolade to add to her merit - she's  releasing a cook book of favourite recipes that she has compiled over the years. This week Hutton has released 'My Love Affair with Food' in collaboration with the Australian Women's Weekly, featuring over 40 recipes as well as some of her cherished food memories and personal photos. The 53-year-old media personality shared her favourite recipes from the book with Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for recipes . Cooking credit: Media personality Deborah Hutton has added 'cookbook author' to her accolades . Despite having a health and wellbeing website, Hutton has chosen not to buy into the 'diet/health cookbook' trend and is bringing back wholesome cooking and real food recipes that make her happy - salt and carbs inclusive. 'I've always had a love affair with food, I love cooking food, shopping for it and while it's always been a challenge since my  modelling days to both enjoy food but still fit into the clothes I like, I think if you set yourself up for a too strict routine you’ll fall off the wagon at some point,' says Hutton. 'There’s enough health books out there, I'm not about to do one,' she said. 'While it’s good to have your diet cookbooks and no sugar,  these recipes are about the things that make me happy.' And if Hutton's confession that 'a gin and tonic and salty chips' after a day on the golf course is one of the things that makes her happy, the cook book is sure to appeal. Confessed carb lover: Hutton bucks 'health trend' in favour of wholesome food - salt and carbs included . Crisp comfort: The 'Crispy Cheese Ravioli' as featured in 'My Love Affair with Food' Ingredients . Method . 1. Place the egg and breadcrumbs in separate bowls. 2. Half fill a deep-fryer or large saucepan with oil and heat to 190°C (the oil is hot enough when a cube of bread dropped in the oil turns golden in 30 seconds). Dip each ravioli in egg, then toss in the breadcrumbs, to coat. Working in batches of five, fry the ravioli for 1–2 minutes or until golden and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel. 3. Meanwhile, heat the pasta sauce in a small saucepan over low heat until hot. Season to taste and stir in chopped basil; transfer to a heatproof serving bowl. 4. Arrange the ravioli on a platter, sprinkle with the extra parsley or basil and serve with the sauce for dipping. Note: If you prefer not to use a cheese filling, any ravioli works just as well. Time: 25 minutes . Serves: 4-6 . This dish makes you look like a star without really trying. I like to quickly cook these after everyone has arrived, so the cheese is still warm and gooey. Just ask your guests to pass the platter. While she is an advocate of juicing, Hutton also believes overall diet trends just don't work. 'I’ve tried just about everything but as a general rule of thumb I don't think fad diets are sustainable, you need a balance. So while I don’t like things  too deep fried or have a sweet tooth, I will take salt and carbohydrates any day, that’s my weakness.' Not to say Hutton isn't a advocate of good health  though. In 2011 she was diagnosed with skin cancer (only two years after her brother had lost the battle to liver cancer) and spent  weeks thereafter in hospital with a face full of stitches. This scare put her life in perspective and now other than a glass or two of wine in the evening, health is her number one priority. Hutton is now an ambassador for the Skin and Cancer Foundation, the founder of Balance by Deborah Hutton - a community website for women 40+ that focuses on sharing health and wellbeing information, and as mentioned, is an avid golfer who regularly spends time on the course. She also confesses that while known for  religiously slip, slop, slapping, in an ironic twist of fate, her doctor recently told her she's now lacking in vitamin D and calcium. Sexy soufflé: Hutton says her banana soufflé is the ultimate date night dessert and is sure to impress . And in Hutton's good humoured nature, she is taking it in her stride and using the news to her foodie advantage. 'When she told me I was highly deficient in both vitamin D and calcium I said - ""so basically I get to play out in the sun and eat cheese?"" and she said yes, and I laughed and told her I loved her!' In her new cook book, you can expect both 'naughty things' 'and 'really good things'. Ingredients . Method . 1. Cook penne in a large saucepan of boiling well-salted water until just tender; drain, cover to keep warm. 2. Heat oil in the same saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic, chilli, zucchini and rind. Cook gently for 1-2 minutes or until softened but not browned. 3. Return the hot pasta to the saucepan with the butter and fetta. Toss together and season to taste. Serve topped with parmesan. Note: Remove the seeds from the chillies for a milder flavour. Cooking time:  20 minutes . Serves: 4 . Trust me when I say, that once you’ve had this, you’ll be back for more. There’s something really refreshing about the crunch of the raw zucchini and the zesty lemon. 'You won’t find it heavy in the dessert section or deep fried, or too many ingredients or eight hours of preparation,' she said. 'There is an amazing chocolate panettone in there. I'd only have that maybe once a year, so not often but I had to include it!' Another favourite is the 'Mediterranean Chicken' which she says is not only delicious but a regular on her entertaining menu because it's easy and means 'you’re not strapped to the kitchen while everyone else is having fun.' Day on the green: An avid golfer, Hutton loves nothing more than a gin and hot chips after a day on the course . And at 53, life is only getting better for Hutton. She has a second cook book in the works focusing  on her love of entertaining and she's more invested than ever in inspiring and supporting women via her website Balance by Deborah Hutton. 'Turning 50 I wanted to be the best version of myself and it really is just getting better. Originally I was excited to turn 40 but I love what I’m doing now. I’m invested in this business - I want to help and connect with women and I also want to inspire people to get in the kitchen,' says Hutton . 'Afterall, there’s no time like the present and I’ve never felt more empowered.' Cheers to that: The 'Venice Dusk' cocktail as featured in 'My Love Affair with Food' Ingredients . Method . 1. Cut rind from watermelon; cut flesh into 2cm cubes, place in a ziptop bag; freeze for 1 hour or until ready to use. 2. Half fill a jug with ice cubes, frozen watermelon and mandarin rind. Stir vodka and sugar in a small bowl until sugar dissolves; stir mixture into jug with remaining ingredients. Serve immediately. Note: Aperitifs are made by infusing herbs and/or fruit in alcohol and water; they have a bitter taste and are characterised by their dark red colour. Use an aperitif such as Aperol or Campari. Cooking time:15 minutes + freezing . Makes: 8 cups . Deborah's perfect menu for date night that is sure to impress any guest . Drink one: A Vodka Martini . Entrée:  A dozen freshly shucked oysters . Main: The sexy pea and mint risotto with additional seared scallops on top. Drink two: A Dry Riesling from the Clare Valley . Dessert: The banana soufflé - it's low fat, has no sugar and the presentation makes you look like a killer chef!

"Twitter has officially rolled out its ‘retweet with comment’ feature, which, unsurprisingly lets people annotate the tweets of others. The new tool lets users embed tweets within their own messages, meaning that users get an extra 116 characters to comment on a tweet. Available on Twitter’s website and the iPhone app, the feature will roll out to Android handsets soon. Twitter has officially rolled out its ‘retweet with comment’ feature, which, unsurprisingly lets people annotate the tweets of others. This image shows the new button, 'Quote Tweet,' which triggers the action . Twitter began testing its tool last summer. Until now, Twitter users have had to embed tweets by cutting and pasting a URL and then adding a comment, within the 140 character limit. But now the process is available at the touch of a button and is going down well on the social network. A user called Simon McCallum tweeted: ‘At last Twitter officially launches “Retweet With Comment” feature so you don't need to edit original tweets,’ while Peter Silk said: ‘Retweet with comment is the best feature since retweet’. The new tool lets users embed a tweet within their own message (shown above), meaning that wordsmiths will get 116 characters to comment on a tweet . To use the feature on Twitter’s website: . 1. Hover over a Tweet. 2. Click the ‘Retweet’ icon. 3. A pop-up will show you the tweet and a comment box. 4. Type your own comments in the ‘Add a comment’ field. 5. Click the ‘Tweet’ button. 6. The tweet will then be shared with your followers as a quote tweet. From mobile apps: . 1. Tap the ‘Retweet’ icon. 2. Tap ‘Quote Tweet’. 3. Add a comment and tap ‘Tweet’. 4. The Tweet will then be shared with your followers as a quote ‘Tweet’. Users can delete quote tweets by clicking the ‘More’ icon and by selecting ‘Delete Tweet’. Celebrity chef and prolific tweeter, Nigella Lawson, has already embraced the tool by commenting on a retweet. She first retweeted a tweet by user AyaReina that said: ‘Huzzah! Twitter unveils revamped ‘quote tweet’ functionality, rolling out to iPhone & web users today.’ The TV chef then commented on another that she shared, which said: ‘Also this is great news for tweeters like @Nigella_lawson who quotes tweets a lot’ simply adding: ‘It is indeed!’ Others made references to Inception and quote tweeted a message about retweeting with comments, to point out the cyclical nature of the roll-out. As well as allowing people 116 characters with which to construct a comment, the new feature preserves the context and meaning of an original tweet,TechCrunch noted. The platform is gradually evolving to let its users express themselves in more detail, instead of simple phrases that fit within the character count. Users have got around the problem by using unofficial techniques such as posting screenshots and using apps such as Jumbo Tweet and Twit Longer that extend the character limit. The feature doesn’t allow users to comment on a string of tweets, to produce one mammoth message and users can’t retweet their own quote tweets.","New feature has been rolled out on Twitter's website and iPhone app .

"A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.","Ian Guffick, 31, allowed pupils to make changes outside exam conditions .

"It has long been considered that a lie-flat bed is the only way to get a good night's sleep on a plane. But Boeing has issued a patent for a bizarre 'upright' sleeping support system that could mean economy passengers can sleep on long-haul flights too. Nicknamed the 'cuddle chair,' the somewhat comical idea could revolutionise the plane sleeping experience by eliminating the need for reclining seats at all. Boeing has just filed a patent for a 'transport vehicle upright sleep support system' known as a 'cuddle chair' It looks like a backpack and fastens to the back of the headrest to allow passengers to lean forward and rest their face and chest on the contraption. According to the patent for the 'Transport Vehicle Upright Sleep Support System,' and illustrative animated video from website PatentYogi, the head cushion will have a 'face relief aperture,' which is essentially a face-front pillow with a hole for breathing. The chest cushion supports the passenger's chest in a natural, forward-leaning motion, which will helpfully aid the traveller in a few precious minutes of shut-eye. Sleeping on a plane can be quite a feat - especially for those who don't have the money to splurge on business or first class seats. While some rely on a personal neck pillow, which is readily available to purchase in airports, Boeing's patent insists that the 'cuddle chair' is a far superior option. For those sitting in economy aircraft seats, the 'cuddle chair' offers a more natural way to get some sleep . The backpack will be located under the seat and straps will attach to the passenger's head rest . A 'face relief aperture,' or a face pillow with a hole for breathing, and chest cushion provide added support . The patent insists that this system is far superior to neck pillows due to sleep's 'natural horizontal tendency' Although a patent was filed, Boeing tells MailOnline Travel that no further information is currently available . According to the patent, the inflatable pillow is 'not a highly successful option due to the natural tendency of a sleeper to relax their muscles and fall to a more horizontal point.' If you're using a neck pillow, this may be the moment that it slips and you wake up. However, it may be a while until we see the 'cuddle chair' installed on Boeing aircraft, as the aviation company tells MailOnline Travel that it 'files many patents every year, but that doesn't necessarily mean we end up pursuing them.' A spokesperson for Boeing adds: 'We aren't providing any further information or comment beyond what was detailed in the patent filing.'","Recent patent filing shows plans for an 'upright' sleeping support system .

"Almost a third of teachers have suffered online bullying at the hands of parents in the last year, a survey suggests. Families are using social media to post obscenities, threats, offensive photos, sexually explicit insults and even covert films of teachers. Around 30 per cent of teachers said they had been the subject of parents’ abusive internet posts. A study of 1,500 teachers found 30 per cent have suffered online abuse by parents - and that this type of bullying is on the rise accounting for 40 per cent of all reported online insults this year . And the poll found that bullying by parents is on the rise, accounting for 40 per cent of all reported online insults this year compared to just 27 per cent last year. The survey, by teachers’ union NASUWT, reveals a disturbing picture of how parents are increasingly using Facebook and Twitter to intimidate staff. One teacher said they had been sworn at by a parent online over a PE lesson, while a female dance teacher said she had been called a ‘paedophile’ for wanting to film a performance. Others said they had received insults from parents about their appearance and weight, with one told she was ugly and her ‘husband could do better than her’. Of those harassed online by parents, 15 per cent had threats made against them, compared to seven per cent in 2014. The poll  also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year . Around eight per cent saw allegations of inappropriate behaviour with students, six per cent saw videos or photos taken without consent and three per cent were told they had behaved inappropriately towards parents. The poll of 1,500 teachers also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year – increasing from 21 per cent to 60 per cent. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ‘It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. 'Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse.’ He added: ‘The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers’ health and wellbeing and undermining their confidence to do their job.’ The survey found that many teachers had received racist, sexist and homophobic remarks online – with one teacher called a ‘wog’ by a pupil and others called ‘lesbian’ and ‘slut’. And teachers said that 60 per cent of the abusive comments online had been written by pupils. Over half of the pupils responsible for abuse were aged between 14 and 16, while 38 per cent were aged between 11 and 14, the teachers’ poll found. One teacher received the comment ‘I hope she gets cancer’, while a heavily pregnant worker was sworn at, called ‘fat whore’ and ‘ugly’. Another said they had been harassed for seven months by pupils who sent sexually explicit messages and set up a fake social media account in their name. A number of teachers reported pupils had used their identity to set up bogus Facebook profiles and post sexually inappropriate messages. One man only found out months afterwards and feared it could be used to ‘smear him’ and destroy his career. Just under a third of bullied teachers did not report the incidents to their school or to police. Mrs Keates went on to say: ‘While there has been some improvement in action taken on reported abuse, there are still too many cases where no appropriate action is taken and teachers are being left devastated, humiliated and traumatised.’ The union called for the next government to require schools to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to online abuse and use all sanctions available to address any bullying of staff. Some of the most disturbing examples of online abuse from parents include: . A female attacked by parents for her appearance and the size of her nose. She was told she was ‘ugly’ and ‘her husband could do better’. Another was called ‘rubbish’, with a mother incorrectly claiming that she had ‘tried to kill her daughter’ by making her do PE without an inhaler. A parent posted comments saying that a female dance teacher was ‘a paedophile’ for videoing performances. A teacher was sworn at and told he was ‘pathetic’ for asking a pupil to replace equipment he had broken. Family members falsely accused a teacher of having sex with pupils – making him fear for his career.","Survey found one third of teachers suffer online bullying by parents .

"The daughter of two respected solicitors and a Scotland Yard detective who are accused of running an upmarket vice ring appeared in court today. Beatrice Nokes, 21, faces claims she incited a ring of prostitutes operating out of properties in Central London. The University College London chemistry student is suspected of grooming three young women to sell their bodies for sex. Beatrice Nokes, 21, pictured left and right outside court today, faces claims she incited a ring of prostitutes operating out of properties in Central London. She is accused of running the vice ring with Daniel Williams . She is accused of running the vice ring in the capital last year with 37-year-old Met police officer Daniel Williams. He faces several further offences including voyeurism and hiding the profits of their activities in socks stuffed up the chimney of his home. He is accused of committing the crimes while on and off-duty. Nokes, a keen horsewoman, artist and charity fundraiser, is the daughter of two highly experienced legal professionals. Her father, Jonathan Nokes, 66, is a partner at respected law firm Anthony Gold where he specialises in commercial property law. Her mother, Ceinwen Rowles, 59, specialises in education law, discrimination and complaints and is taking a case to the European Court of Human Rights. The detective constable, who is suspended from duty, was based at Tooting police station in Wandsworth, South West London, pictured. He is accused of committing the crimes while on and off-duty . They both accompanied her to Westminster Magistrates’ Court when she went before a judge for the first time last month. Today, Nokes appeared at Southwark Crown Court her name. Williams was also present. The both face three charges of ‘causing or inciting’ prostitution ‘in the expectation of gain’ in September and October last year. Williams faces seven further charges including controlling prostitution for gain in the 10 months up until his arrest by anti-corruption colleagues on October 8. The detective constable, who is suspended from duty, was based at Tooting police station in Wandsworth, South West London. Several weeks after he was first arrested Williams was also accused of  spying on unsuspecting women hotel guests at at the Jury’s Inn in Milton Keynes (left) and The Mandolay Hotel, Guildford, Surrey (right) He is accused of two counts of misconduct in a public office, firstly by running the prostitution ring and secondly by using police computers to check clients. A further charge alleges he concealed a ‘large quantity of cash’ by stuffing it in socks and hiding it in the chimney of his Putney home. Several weeks after he was first arrested Williams was also accused of using hi-tech hidden equipment to spy on unsuspecting women hotel guests. He is said to have watched the victims at the Jury’s Inn in Milton Keynes and The Mandolay Hotel, Guildford, Surrey, between January and October last year. Williams, of Putney, south west London, and Nokes, of Islington, north London, are both on bail and will return to Southwark Crown Court on 15 May to enter their pleas. The trial which is fixed for 12 September next year is expected to last between four and six weeks.

"While most people are used to hiding chocolate eggs and enjoying dinner with family and friends, Easter celebrations in parts of the world can take on a very different appearance. In southern Germany, hundreds of people braved the snow for a traditional Easter Monday procession on horseback, while in Slovakia women were doused with buckets of water as part of their weekend celebrations. A similar age-old tradition takes place in Hungary, where after being sprinkled with water, the women give the men beautifully coloured eggs in return. Scroll down for video . In southern Germany, hundreds of horse riders and spectators braved the snow for their traditional Easter Monday procession . Local residents of Traustein, dressed in historical costumes, ride through the snow to get blessing for men and beast . The Easter horseback parade, known as the Georgiritt, is held in Traustein, Germany and dates back to the 18th century . Also part of the celebration in south-east Germany is a sabre dance, which symbolises the victory of spring over winter . Held in Traustein, Germany, the Easter horseback parade, known as the Georgiritt, dates back to the 18th century. Despite today's heavy snow, the Bavarian riders, clad in traditional costume, and some 400 horses, took off toward a church in nearby Ettendorf to receive blessings. Along with the procession, the town in Germany's south-eastern region also stages a sabre dance each year that is meant to symbolise the victory of spring over winter. Meanwhile in Male Trakany, Slovakia, more than 550 miles from Traustein, men in the community celebrated Easter Monday by throwing buckets of water at women. In Male Trakany, Slovakia, men throw buckets of water on women as part of the Easter weekend celebrations . Known as Śmigus-Dyngus, meaning Wet Monday, the celebration is held in several other Central European countries, such as Poland . In the village of Cicarovce, men and boys take great delight in pouring water over the local women, clad in traditional clothing, as part of the weekend's celebrations. Other rituals are often included in the celebration, such as reciting verses and holding door-to-door processions. In some communities, the boys dress up as bears. Known as Śmigus-Dyngus, meaning Wet Monday, the celebration is held in several Central European countries, such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. This unusual tradition is almost on the brink of extinction, with only a few villages in Slovakia still celebrating Easter this way . In Nyiregyhaza, Hungary, a similar tradition occurs, with young men dressed in folk dress sprinkling water on the village's local women .

"A talented body painter is travelling across America merging members of the public into beautiful backgrounds. Natalie Fletcher's '100 Bodies Across America' project sees painted individuals blended into the likes of tourist hotspots, forests and ruins. For each work Natalie travels to a certain spot in the country before selecting volunteers - not models - who she then paints. Scroll down for video . Talented body-painter Natalie Fletcher has been travelling around the United States painting different people in each town - here she painted two people as a brick wall in Carolina . Katie and Dez were painted as part of a beach scene raising their arms happily in the air . So far Natalie, 29, has created works in front of the likes of the Welcome to Las Vegas sign and Superstition Mountains in Arizona. Each work takes here between 45 minutes and three hours to complete, with her subjects wearing only underwear whilst being painted. Creative Natalie, from Bend in Oregon, USA, hopes to complete the entire series by September this year. She said: 'I have been preparing for this for three years - it's my dream project. I've been on the road for so long now I no longer know the days of the week. In this stunning picture the model, Alondre, is painted as a dessert scene as she perches on a rock . This lady called Nicole is painted as a water scene and a bike, with blue water covering her body and the mountains across her chest . 'The people I have met, painted and just hung out with have been incredible. I want to put out a positive message of 'love your body' - it's the only one you are going to get. 'That is why I make people on art: each canvas is unique and beautiful.' Natalie began her project in March and plans to paint two people in each state that she visits. On her website the artist encourages those that want to be painted to get in touch with their ideas. This model is painted as a lake, blending into the background as part of Natalie's project . Joel and Amber were painted together as a forest with their bodies blending in to the beautiful trees behind them . Natalie has been making her journey around the States in a van. Describing the journey so far on her blog she said: 'I’ve always enjoyed traveling but there’s always something nice about going home and just being lazy sometimes. 'I’ve had to put that desire out of my head. I no longer know days of the week, or even what date it is. 'I’m very disorganized, my van is a wreck, my hair is becoming dred-locked. Shaving my legs has become a luxury. Home cooked meals have never tasted better. And yes, I’m pretty tired.' This lady, named Sam, was painted to look like tree bark, although it is unclear as to why she is carrying a gun . Todd (left) wanted to be painted into the Las Vegas sign, whilst Kelc and Becca (right) were painted as a wall . Erin looks relaxed as she poses having been painted by Natalie as a field of flowers .

"A lesbian honors student who was told by her school principal that she was not allowed to wear a tuxedo to her senior prom has now been informed that she may wear the attire, it has emerged. Claudetteia Love, 17, said last week that she and her friends would not go to Carroll High School's prom in Monroe, Louisiana, because Principal Patrick Taylor had told her she had to wear a dress. Her comments sparked an outpouring of support from across the country - from her classmates, who signed a petition to persuade the school to change its mind, to gay rights groups and strangers. But now, Principal Taylor and Monroe City School Board President Rodney McFarland - who had backed Claudetteia - have reportedly told the student that she can wear a tux to the prom after all. Result! Claudetteia Love (pictured), 17, was told by her school principal that she was not allowed to wear a tuxedo to her senior prom. However, she has now been informed that she may wear the attire after all . On Tuesday, the National Center for Lesbian Rights said in a news release that the pair had contacted the teenager to inform her of their decision relating to the event on April 24. In the release, Claudetteia, who is openly gay, said she had been inspired by the countless supportive comments and offers she has received in the wake of her controversial tuxedo ban. The support included a local businessman's offer to create a prom for her and her friends, and a letter sent to school superintendents in the state by the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. “The outpouring of support has been incredible and inspiring; it is a source of strength that I will keep with me as I move on the next phase of my education and life beyond high school,' said Claudetteia. She added she was 'thankful' for the school's latest decision. 'I am looking forward to celebrating the end of my senior year with my friends and classmates at the prom, like any other student,' she said. Last week, Claudetteia's mother, Geraldine Jackson, who is 'fully supportive' of her daughter's gay identity, said Principal Taylor had told her staff would not supervise the prom if girls wore tuxes. Principal: Claudetteia said last week that she and her friends would not go to Carroll High School's prom in Monroe, Louisiana, because Principal Patrick Taylor (pictured) had told her she had to wear a dress . Release: But now, Principal Taylor and school board president Rodney McFarland have told the student she can wear a tux to the prom, according to a news release (pictured) by the National Center for Lesbian Rights . 'That's his exact words. ""Girls wear dresses and boys wear tuxes, and that's the way it is"",' she told The News-Star, adding that staff members had not acted on the petition started by students. Meanwhile, Claudetteia told the newspaper: 'I told my mom, ""They're using me"". They put me in all these honors and advanced placement classes so I can take all of these tests and get good grades and better the school, but when it's time for me to celebrate the fact that I've accomplished what I need to accomplish and I'm about to graduate, they don't want to let me do it the way I want to.' She added: 'There are people in the world that won't accept you but they don't have to be so judgmental and make you feel like you're less of a person and that you shouldn't express yourself.' Ms Jackson and Claudetteia are both now 'very happy' after Caroll High School reversed its ban. Inspired: In the release, Claudetteia (left and right), who is openly gay, said she had been inspired by the countless supportive comments and offers she has received in the wake of her controversial tuxedo ban . Last week, Principal Taylor told the News-Star that the earlier decision was part of the school's dress code and not anything personal. However, Claudetteia and her family said they did not believe it. McFarland told the paper that Principal Taylor's stance was not backed up by board policy. 'Banning her from her prom just because of what she wants to wear - that's discrimination,' he said. 'As far as I know there is no Monroe City School Board policy saying what someone has to wear to attend the prom. You can't just go making up policies.' McFarland said he planned to ask Superintendent Brent Vidrine to talk to Principal Taylor. School: Claudetteia is a top-performing student at Carroll High School (pictured) She will represent the school at an annual scholars' banquet and has a full scholarship to Jackson State University once she graduates . In Tuesday's release, NCLR Executive Director Kate Kendell said: 'We are pleased to hear Principal Taylor and the Monroe City School Board corrected this wrong before any serious harm was done. 'Forbidding girls from wearing a tuxedo to the prom would have served no purpose other than to reinforce the worst sorts of harmful stereotypes and censor a core part of Claudetteia’s identity.' Last year, Claudetteia was one of a group of students presented in a Monroe City School Board meeting as part of the school's high achieving medical magnet program. She will represent the school at the annual Scholars' Banquet, an event for the top students in Ouachita Parish, and has a full scholarship to Jackson State University. Neither Principal Taylor nor McFarland immediately returned calls for comment from AP.","Claudetteia Love, 17, had planned to go to her prom with group of friends .

"McDonald's says it's simplifying its grilled chicken recipe to remove ingredients people might not recognize, marking the latest sign the company is rethinking its menu to keep up with changing tastes. The company says it expects the new 'Artisan Grilled Chicken' to be in its more than 14,300 U.S. stores by the end of next week, in products including a new sandwich, as well as existing sandwiches, wraps and salads. It says the biggest change is the removal of sodium phosphates, which it said was used to keep the chicken moist, in favor of vegetable starch. The new recipe also does not use maltodextrin, which McDonald's said is generally used as a sugar to increase browning or as a carrier for seasoning. Jessica Foust, director of culinary innovation at McDonald's, said the changes were made because customers said they want 'simple, clean ingredients' they are familiar with. 'Maltodextrin is just not something they have in their pantries,' Foust said. Easy to follow: McDonald's is simplifying its grilled chicken recipe to remove ingredients people might not recognize. Its 'Artisan Grilled Chicken' will be included in a new sandwich and existing menu items . The change comes as McDonald's fights to hold onto customers amid the growing popularity of places like Chipotle that position themselves as more wholesome alternatives to traditional fast-food. Already, that 'clean label' trend has prompted numerous restaurant chains and packaged food makers to reformulate products, even while standing by the safety and quality of their previous recipes. Subway also introduced a new grilled chicken recipe earlier this year that it said had no artificial flavors or preservatives. And Panera Bread has said it plans to purge artificial colors, flavors and preservatives from its food by 2016. As ingredient quality becomes a more powerful marketing advantage, executives at McDonald's have also been trying to freshen up the company's image and shake perceptions that it serves junk food. TV ads and signs in stores, for instance, are playing up the fact that Egg McMuffins are made with freshly cracked eggs. And last month, McDonald's announced it would start asking suppliers to curb the use of antibiotics in raising chickens. As for the new grilled chicken recipe, McDonald's said it will now be cooked with a blend of olive oil and canola oil, instead of liquid margarine. And Foust said she thinks customers will notice that it has 'more of a lemon herb type flavor.' 'It's a very real chicken experience — something closer to what you make in your own home,' she said. Battle: The change comes as McDonald's fights to hold onto customers amid the growing popularity of places like Chipotle that position themselves as more wholesome alternatives to traditional fast-food (file) Roger Clemens, an adjunct professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Southern California's School of Pharmacy and a former president of the Institute of Food Technologists, said sodium phosphates could be used to help chicken keep its moisture and texture when it's being frozen and shipped. 'If you're going to cook a fresh chicken, it's not a big concern. But if you're going to ship a chicken, there's a change in structure,' he said. Maltodextrin, meanwhile, might be used as a coating on chicken to distribute seasonings evenly, he said. On its website, McDonald's lists ingredients for its new 'Artisan Grilled Chicken' including salt, vegetable starch, sugar, garlic powder, lemon juice concentrate, honey and onion powder. Terri Hickey, a McDonald's representative, said the new chicken will have 12 ingredients, compared with 18 ingredients for the previous grilled chicken recipe. Mike Andres, who took over as president of McDonald's USA last year amid ongoing sales struggles, had said in December the company was looking at shrinking its ingredients lists. Whether the new grilled chicken recipe helps change perceptions about the food at McDonald's remains to be seen. The change comes after McDonald's Corp. saw sales and customer visits at established U.S. restaurants slip two years in a row. In January, the company named Steve Easterbrook, its chief brand officer, to take over as CEO for Don Thompson. That change took effect in March, right before a 'Turnaround Summit' for U.S. franchisees. McDonald's says it's simplifying the recipe for its grilled chicken in the latest sign the chain is trying to keep up with changing tastes. Here's a look at the ingredient lists for the new grilled chicken, compared with the previous ingredient list: . NEW RECIPE: . Ingredients: Boneless, skinless chicken breast with rib meat, water, salt, vegetable starch, sugar, garlic powder, lemon juice concentrate, honey, onion powder, dried vinegar, natural flavor (plant source), baking soda. Prepared with canola oil/olive oil blend and herb seasoning (sugar, garlic powder, salt, lemon juice concentrate, parsley, onion powder, dried honey, citric acid, spice, dried vinegar, natural flavor (plant sources) OLD RECIPE: . Ingredients: chicken breast fillet with rib meat, water, seasoning (rice starch, salt, sugar, yeast extract, canola oil, onion powder, maltodextrin, chicken skin, paprika, flavor, sunflower oil, chicken, garlic powder, chicken fat, spices), sodium phosphates .

"There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy – and now Nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington today, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, said. Scroll down for video . During a talk today, Nasa announced that humanity will encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' said Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, (pictured) at a Washington panel discussion . 'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Jeffery Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' Stofan said. 'We are talking about little microbes.' The announcement has been prompted by the recent discovery of water by Nasa in surprising places. Jim Green, director of planetary science at Nasa, noted that a recent study of the Martian atmosphere found 50 per cent of the planet's northern hemisphere once had oceans a mile deep. Scientists using the Hubble recently provided powerful evidence that Jupiter's moon Ganymede (pictured) has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice . The same study found that water had been present on the red planet for up to 1.2 billion year. 'We think that long period of time is necessary for life to get more complex,' Stofan said. Nasa associate administrator John Grunsfeld said he is excited about seeing what form life beyond Earth may take. In their hunt for alien life, astronomers have so far focused on looking for Earth-like planets around smaller, cooler suns. But these exoplanets - despite having a chance of holding water - are believed to be locked in a rotation around their sun which causes only one side of their surface face the star. Now astronomers claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their stars, and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a day-night cycle similar to Earth – increasing the chance of finding alien life. Planets with potential oceans could have a climate that is much more similar to Earth's than previously expected,' said Jérémy Leconte, a postdoctoral fellow at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) at the University of Toronto. 'If we are correct, there is no permanent, cold night side on exoplanets causing water to remain trapped in a gigantic ice sheet,' he said. 'Whether this new understanding of exoplanets' climate increases the ability of these planets to develop life remains an open question.' 'Once we get beyond Mars, which formed from the same stuff as Earth, the likelihood that life is similar to what we find on this planet is very low,' he said. 'I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation [away] on a planet around a nearby star. Scientists using the Hubble recently provided powerful evidence that Jupiter's moon Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's satellite Enceladus are also thought to have an ocean of liquid water beneath their surface in contact with mineral-rich rock. This, according to Nasa, means they may have the three ingredients needed for life as we know it. 'The science community is making enormous progress,' said Green. 'And I've told my team I'm planning to be the director of planetary science when we discover life in the solar system. At the same conference last year, Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden made a more conservative estimate. He claimed that we will find life within the next 20 years - with a high chance it will be outside our solar system. Nasa next Mars rover, scheduled to launch in 2020, will search for signs of past life and bring samples for a possible return to Earth for analysis. New Horizons took this image of the icy moon Europa rising above Jupiter's cloud tops. The space agency is planning a mission to Europa, which may launch as early as 2022, to find out whether the moon is habitable . Nasa also hopes to land astronauts on Mars in the 2030s, which Stofan says is crucial key to the search for Mars life. 'I'm a field geologist; I go out and break open rocks and look for fossils,' Stofan said. 'Those are hard to find. 'So I have a bias that it's eventually going to take humans on the surface of Mars — field geologists, astrobiologists, chemists — actually out there looking for that good evidence of life that we can bring back to Earth for all the scientists to argue about.' The space agency is also planning a mission to Europa, which may launch as early as 2022. It hopes to find out whether the icy moon is habitable. Meanwhile, the agency's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will launch in 2018 to scope out the atmospheres of nearby 'super-Earth' alien planets.","The comment was made today by Ellen Stofan, chief Nasa scientist .

"Ed Miliband vowed to end casual employment contracts yesterday but his crackdown backfired spectacularly as he forgot Labour use them . Ed Miliband was accused of hypocrisy last night after Labour town halls and MPs were revealed to be hiring thousands of workers on zero-hours contracts. The Labour leader yesterday vowed to end casual employment contracts that ‘undermine living standards and family life’. But his crackdown, which was intended to regain the political initiative after boosts for the Tories on jobs and incomes, backfired spectacularly. In a disastrous day for Labour’s General Election hopes: . Speaking in Huddersfield, Mr Miliband said a Labour government would legislate to require employers to offer a contract to anyone who had been working regular hours for 12 weeks. He made a stinging attack on both David Cameron and firms that use ‘exploitative’ contracts which fail to guarantee minimum hours of work. Scroll down for video . ‘The Conservatives believe by looking after a few big firms and individuals at the top, everyone else will be OK,’ said Mr Miliband. But, far from being the preserve of business, the contracts are being routinely used by charities, the public sector and the Labour Party itself. It emerged that 68 Labour MPs had also signed up researchers and other staff on zero-hour contracts in the last two years including shadow health secretary Andy Burnham (right) and shadow chancellor Ed Balls (left) Freedom of information requests circulated by the Conservatives reveal that Labour councils are behind 21,798 zero-hours contracts. In December last year, the director of finance at Doncaster Council admitted to still having 300 relief workers on their books. Among the worst authorities are Wolverhampton, which had 738 staff on zero-hours contracts as of May 2014; Liverpool with 442 as of September 2014; and Ealing with 278 as of January 2015. In an even greater embarrassment, it emerged that 68 Labour MPs had also signed up researchers and other staff on the deals over the past two years. They included shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, shadow chancellor Ed Balls, Mr Miliband’s parliamentary bag carrier Karen Buck and his election supremo Lucy Powell. The Labour politicians said they had been told by the Parliamentary expenses watchdog to use the contracts in order to pay a living wage. Freedom of Information requests found 22,000 zero-hours contracts were handed out by Labour-run councils, including Doncaster (pictured) where Mr Miliband is standing for MP . Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘It’s the same old hypocrisy from Ed Miliband. 'On the day he generates a load of hot air about zero-hours contracts it emerges that his party is one of the most prolific users of them. ‘It’s chaos in the Labour Party that would cause chaos for the country. Ed Miliband’s not up to the job because he says one thing and does another. A hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing, experts warned last night. Sterling has already fallen nearly 5 per cent against the US dollar in the past five weeks amid jitters about the outcome of the General Election. George Buckley of Deutsche Bank said: ‘The 2015 General Election is set to be the most unpredictable for nearly a century. There may be no good outcome for investors.’ David Buik, of stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said: ‘Markets are incapable of dealing with uncertainty.’ 'If you can’t trust him on the basics you can’t trust him to lead the country.’ Conservative candidate Charlie Elphicke added: ‘This is total hypocrisy from Ed Miliband. 'Labour did nothing about zero-hours contracts during its 13 years in power, and now we learn that Labour MPs and councils use them routinely.’ The spotlight was also turned on a number of startling claims made by Mr Miliband yesterday – whose speech worsened already bad relations with big business. His suggestion that Britain has an ‘epidemic’ of zero hours contracts was rubbished by official statistics from the ONS. The ONS had explicitly warned the 697,000 people who reported having a zero-hours contract between October and December 2014 should not be compared with the 586,000 in the previous year. The UK’s official statistician said: ‘It is not possible to say how much of this increase is due to greater recognition of the term zero-hours contracts rather than new contracts.’ However, Mr Miliband still made the claim the centre-piece of his headline grabbing announcement yesterday. The organisation Full Fact said the Labour leader’s claims were unjustified. The Tories say they have tightened the law to end abuse of zero-hours. Employers can no longer insist on ‘exclusivity’ deals which ban staff from working for other firms. Last week David Cameron said he could not live on an ‘exploitative zero-hours contract’. Labour MP Karen Buck (left) and Mr Miliband's election supremo Lucy Powell (right) also use zero-hours . Chancellor George Osborne made similar comments last night, saying: ‘Of course it would be very difficult … There are some zero-hour contracts that people want.’ Christian May of the Institute of Directors said Labour’s plans ‘go too far’. Matthew Irvine, associate at the law firm Thomas Eggar, said: ‘To many this will seem an eye-catching and attractive policy with Miliband championing workers rights over capitalist employers who are putting profit above workers’ welfare. The risk, however, is that this proposal goes too far and would endanger the continued economic recovery. ‘In reality, employers may well choose to dismiss workers before they reach 12 weeks or be reluctant to offer work in the first place. 'Miliband’s proposal would potentially undermine job creation, jeopardise zero-hours workers’ current jobs and increase their insecurity.’ Yesterday, opening up yet another front in his war on business, Ed Miliband pledged a Labour Government would ‘end the exploitation of zero-hours contracts’. Here. JAMES SLACK sorts the Labour leader’s emotive claims about the contracts from the very different reality. CLAIM: We have an epidemic of zero-hours contracts in our country. REALITY: According to the Office for National Statistics, between October and December last year a total of 697,000 people said they were employed on zero-hours contracts in their main job. This represents only 2.3 per cent of people in employment – or one in every 43 workers. This hardly constitutes an epidemic. CLAIM: There has been a 20 per cent increase in the last year alone. REALITY: It is true the number of people reporting they were on a zero-hours contract rose by 110,000 in the year to December 2014, but the ONS says the two sets of figures are not comparable. In some cases, they will have been on the contracts for years but only just become aware of the fact… because Miliband had spent so much time talking about them. Labour was warned by statisticians not to use the figures – but carried on regardless. CLAIM: Zero-hours contracts ‘undermine hard work, undermining living standards, undermining family life.’ REALITY: Far from inflicting untold misery on the majority of workers, by making it impossible for them to make ends meet, 66 per cent said they did not want to work more hours. Only one in ten on zero-hours contracts said they would like a different job. The average number of hours worked was 22.6 per week. Almost one in five were in full-time education, which would make it hard for them to work any more hours even if they wished to. CLAIM: The Tories won’t end the exploitation of zero-hours contracts. We will. REALITY: Last June the Conservative-led Government took action to ban so-called exclusivity deals which prevented people on zero-hours contracts from working elsewhere. Labour’s record, by contrast, is nothing to boast about: Tony Blair promised in 1995 to ban them after it emerged they were used in UK fast food chains but his Government failed to act in three terms in power. CLAIM: If it’s not good enough for us, it’s not good enough for you. One rule for all. REALITY: Mr Miliband said he could not survive on one of the contracts – but plenty employed by Labour councils and officials have to do so. Some 68 Labour MPs are reported to have employed staff on the contracts over the last two years, including Ed Balls, Mr Miliband’s parliamentary bag carrier Karen Buck and his election chief Lucy Powell. Meanwhile, Freedom of Information requests show Labour-run town halls are responsible for 21,798 of the contracts – including 300 in Doncaster, where the Labour leader is seeking re-election as the local MP. CLAIM: The Conservatives believe by looking after a few big firms and individuals at the top, everyone else will be OK. REALITY: It’s by no means only big business that appreciates the flexibility the contracts can provide. A survey of employers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development found that a third of voluntary sector organisations used zero-hours contracts, along with a quarter of public sector employers. The figure for private firms – once again the target for an attack by Mr Miliband – was only 17 per cent. PS: Even the ever-meddling EU does not object to zero-hours contracts. Despite intense lobbying by Labour MEPs and the party’s trade union paymasters, Brussels has opted to stay out of the row. It insists only that workers should not work more hours than permitted by the Working Time Directive and should be entitled to any holiday rights they have accrued.","Ed Miliband vowed yesterday to end casual employment contracts .

"Convict: Small time drug dealer Rudy Guede, 29, is currently serving a 16-year sentence for the murder . The only person convicted for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher has declared that he will seek a retrial, following the sensational exoneration of Amanda Knox. Small time drug dealer Rudy Guede, 29, is serving a 16-year sentence for the murder in Perugia, Italy. The Ivory Coast national's DNA was found all over the bedroom where Miss Kercher was found half-naked, her throat slit in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox. Knox and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito served four years for the murder, which prosecutors claimed was a sex game gone wrong, before being conclusively cleared last month by Italy's highest court. The Supreme Court's ruling throws a new lifeline to Guede, who was convicted by the same court of being an accomplice to a murder 'committed in the company of others'. Lawyers for Guede are likely to argue that the two sentences are incompatible, forcing a revision of his conviction. Speaking from prison in Viterbo, where he is described as 'a model prisoner' Guede claimed that his conviction is rendered 'impossible' by the exoneration of Knox and ex boyfriend Sollecito. He said: 'Look at me: I committed the impossible crime. How can I be the accomplice in a murder without any accomplices? ' Guede who is now halfway through his sentence said: 'I want a retrial.' He said his lawyers are waiting for the reasoning behind the innocent sentence of the Supreme Court, to be published which will be within 90 days of the Knox verdict. 'I am convinced that we will find elements to overturn the verdict,' he said. Cleared: Amanda Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito served four years for Meredith Kercher's murder before being conclusively cleared by Italy's highest court last month . Tragic: Meredith Kercher was found half-naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with  Knox . Already the overturning of Knox and Sollecito's guilty sentences has left the Kercher family 'shocked' and with many unanswered questions. If Guede too were absolved, on a judicial technicality, it would leave no one paying for their daughter's murder. The Italian justice system is currently being overhauled because of its cost, contradictions and inefficiency. It has a backlog of around nine million legal cases. The Supreme Court, which hears 80,000 appeals a year, 100 times more than comparable countries, upholds only a fraction of convictions. The state were forced to pay €84million in compensation for miscarriages of justice and legal delays in 2011. Raffaele Sollecito (centre) speaks during a press conference in Rome flanked by his lawyers Giulia Bongiorno (left) and Luca Maori after being acquitted of murdering British student Meredith Kercher last month . Amanda Knox vowed to return to Italy just two days after being cleared of murdering British student Meredith Kercher. She is pictured (left) speaking after last month's decision and (right) after her initial acquittal in 2011 . Guede, who lives on a wing for violent sex offenders said that Knox and Sollecito had been 'fortunate'. But he told La Repubblica newspaper that the granting of their appeals had given him fresh hope. He said: 'Destiny has been less kind to me but I will not lament. Today I have a new reason to go on.' The 29-year-old, who came to Italy from Agou in Cote-d'Ivoire aged 7, has almost finished a degree in history from Rome Tre university. Once freed he wants to find a job in Italy and move forward. 'I want to prove to everyone that I am not a monster and forget my past. ' He said his only mistake was to opt for a fast track trial. He said: 'Here in Italy the fast track trial is seen as an admission of guilt. But I thought I would be able to prove my innocence straight away. ' Guede is eligible for day release this year.","Rudy Guede, 29, is currently serving a 16-year sentence for the murder .

"A husband convicted of beating his wife to death after she filed for divorce has been sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning for second-degree murder in the death of his wife Kelly Robarge, 42, who disappeared from her Charlestown home on June 27, 2013. Her badly decomposed body, with her hands and head detached, was found 10 days later in Unity. The judge said he took into account the extent to which Robarge went to conceal his wife's killing and body, as well as the couple's history of domestic violence. James Robarge (above pictured in court last month), 45, of Vermont was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison . Robarge was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his wife, 42-year-old Kelly Robarge . The couple's daughter, Ciera Robarge (pictured above, center, with her sister Gabriel Robarge Pellerin, right, in court last month) said her mom did not deserve this . Robarge has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years, according to Valley News. In the statement read by his lawyer on Friday, he told his daughters, 'I love you guys more than life itself' and called their mother 'the love of my life.' One of the couple's daughters, Ciera Robarge, said in court that she loved and missed her mom. 'I love and miss my mom more and more every day,' she said. 'My mom didn't deserve this.' Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr., faced Robarge on Friday and told him, 'I hope you rot in hell.' Kelly's brother, Ron Prouty Jr, told Robarge (above) he hoped he 'rotted in hell' during the sentencing on Friday . During his murder trial, he testified that he had not killed his wife, but a New Hampshire jury convicted him of second-degree murder after deliberating for more than 12 hours over three days. After the verdict was handed down last month, Robarge's two daughters left the courtroom sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief. According to police, Kelly had filed for divorce after 24 years of marriage on June 27, 2013 — the day she disappeared from her Charlestown, New Hampshire, home and her body was later found. The jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed 'extreme indifference to the value of human life.' Prosecutors said the entryway to Kelly Robarge's home contained 'countless' spatters of blood. Family members of Kelly react in court on February 11 to the not guilty verdicts on charges of first- and second-degree murder before the announcement of a guilty verdict for the charge of second-degree murder for reckless conduct against Robarge . And James Robarge's disabled car was found several miles from where her body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it. However, most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence. The closest thing to an eyewitness was a Unity man who said he saw Robarge, wearing latex gloves, crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in Unity the night Kelly  disappeared. Her body was found off a logging road not far from there, and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched Robarge's shattered oil pan. Due to the condition of her body, a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached but concluded she died as the result of 'homicidal violence.' Robarge (pictured in court in January) has served nearly two years behind bars which means he could be eligible for parole in about 28 years . Meanwhile, one of the last people to see Kelly alive the day she disappeared was Frances Uptegrove, a physician assistant who had treated her for anxiety and depression for several years. Uptegrove testified that Kelly Robarge told her she was heading to court to file for divorce. He said: 'She seemed clear-headed, determined. She'd made up her mind.' In testimony spanning two days, Robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife and stared straight ahead when the verdict was announced. Robarge claimed that he didn't know his wife had filed for divorce, but he acknowledged that just days before, he found a letter from her on their kitchen counter saying she wanted one.","James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was sentenced in court on Friday morning .

"Smartphone use may be to blame for a drop in the number of times couples are having sex each month, a leading expert has suggested. Research has revealed that the frequency with which Britons are having sex has been in decline since the emergence of the internet. It comes after Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, revealed in a new book how a typical heterosexual couple was now having sex three times a month. Research has revealed that the frequency with which Britons are having sex has been in decline since the emergence of the internet (file picture) This was compared to four times a month in 2000 and five times a month in 1990, according to research published in Prof Spiegelhalter's book Sex By Numbers. According to the Daily Telegraph he told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme: 'We used to have a very big separation between our public lives and our private lives - now they are so mixed up and integrated. 'People are checking their emails all the time, you do not have the same sort of quiet empty time that there used to be.' In his book, Prof Spiegelhalter pointed to a number of possible factors for the decline in sexual activity with one possible explanation being that more people are living on their own. Passion killed: People are check their emails 'all the time', according to Professor David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University (file picture) But he added: 'A more realistic explanation is that as we’ve become better connected technologically, our lives have become busier with the boundaries eroded between home, work and the outside world. This has squeezed out time we would have spent with our other halves. The statistician quotes Catherine Mercer, a researcher on the British National Survey, as saying: ‘With an increasing number of competing demands on our time, sex just falls down our list of priorities.’ She adds that dealing with work emails late in the evening can mean that ‘come bedtime, we’re just still too connected with everyone and everything out there to be able to focus just on our partner.’","Typical heterosexual couples in Britain are having sex three times a month .

"Louis Jordan, 37, released a three-paragraph statement on Monday in which he said he stayed inside his cabin to keep dry and avoid sun, wind, waves and sea spray during his ordeal. The man rescued from a disabled sailboat off the North Carolina coast has responded to critics of his story by claiming that he avoided sunburn and blisters by staying in the vessel's cabin and that he survived by rationing food and water. Louis Lordan released a three-paragraph statement on Monday in whcih he said he stayed inside the cabin to keep dry and avoid sun, wind, waves and sea spray. 'Every time I went outside, I exposed myself to getting my clothes drenched, which would have made it harder for me to keep warm,' Jordan said. 'My blankets were already soaked, and often there was no way of hanging up my clothes to dry. Keeping dry was vital to my survival.' Jordan also said he set up a makeshift mast with a small sail to get the boat headed in a westward direction. He said he rationed food and water and kept his calorie expenditure low. 'That meant I had to stay inside the boat as much as possible, therefore I didn't have a sunburn, or blisters, as if I were found clinging to an upside-down boat,' Jordan said. Jordan was spotted by a German-flagged boat on Thursday, more than two months after sailing out of a South Carolina marina. Coast Guard crew members who retrieved him said they were surprised by his fit appearance and overall health. Too good to be true? A surprisingly healthy-looking Louis Jordan pictured soon after  being found off the North Carolina coast on Thursday . Thomas Grenz, the captain of the German tanker ship that spotted Jordan last week and brought him aboard, said Jordan's U.S. passport described him as weighing 290 pounds, but he was probably down to 200 pounds when the crew found him. Officials with the U.S. Coast Guard say it wasn't clear how long after he left the marina in Conway, South Carolina, that his boat first capsized. Jordan's sailboat was upright when the German boat found him. Jordan told his family that he was going into open water to sail and fish, according to his mother, Norma Davis. He told WAVY-TV that he was sailing north when he encountered bad weather. He said he saw a wave crash into his window and that his boat eventually filled with water. The Coast Guard began a search on Feb. 8, but it was abandoned after 10 days. Some sightings of Jordan were reported by other sailors, but they couldn't be confirmed. Jordan's statement thanked the Coast Guard rescuer who dropped down from the helicopter to lift Jordan off the boat. He also thanked Grenz and his crew for turning their ship around to save him. Jordan was spotted by a German-flagged boat on Thursday, more than two months after sailing out of a South Carolina marina. Coast Guard crew members who retrieved him said they were surprised by his fit appearance and overall health . 'Their sacrifice demonstrates that our basic humanity is to care for and protect one another,' Jordan said. ' I'm grateful for all of your support and for your honoring my story.

God is truly great.'","Louis Jordan, 37, released a three-paragraph statement on Monday in a bid to answer critics suspicious of his amazing survival story .

"Protesters opposing the construction of a $1.4billion telescope on a mountain in Hawaii they consider to be sacred were arrested after blocking a road leading to the site. Police arrested 12 protesters Thursday when they tried to block trucks heading to the peak of Mauna Kea where one of the world's largest telescopes is being built. While the Native Hawaiian groups do not oppose the Thirty Meter Telescope itself, they disagree with the location of the construction on Mauna Kea - the highest point in the state which is considered a home of deities. About 300 people took part in the demonstration and those who were arrested were released after they each posted a $250 bail. Scroll down for video . Department of Land and Natural Resources officers arrest a Thirty Meter Telescope protester at the telescope building site on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hilo, Hawaii on Thursday . Thirty Meter Telescope protesters chant after being arrested from the telescope building site on the summit of Mauna Kea . Native Hawaiians believe the site where the telescope is being assembled is sacred because it is where their creation story begins, said Kealoha Pisciotta, an opponent of the telescope project. And scientists believe the site is ideal location for one of the world's largest telescopes because of its remote and sheltered position, nestled in the crater of a dormant volcano. 'It is the burial grounds of some of our most sacred and revered ancestors,' said she said. 'It is a place where we go for sanctuary and release from the world around us, and it is also the home of our god.' All of the highest points in the islands are considered the home of deities, according to Pisciotta. 'I wouldn't consider it civil disobedience. We consider it civil assistance,' protestor Kahookahi Kanuha said reports Hawaii News Now. 'We were attempting to assist the authorities in upholding the law. 'And those who are being disobedient to the law are those with TMT, who are continuing to break the regulations of developing on conservational land.' After the vehicles were allowed to pass, about 40 to 50 people began following the trucks, which moved slowly because of their heavy loads. Protesters are preventing construction of a giant telescope near the summit of a mountain held sacred by Native Hawaiians. Some consider the $1.4 billion Thirty Meter Telescope project as desecrating the Big Island's Mauna Kea (on Monday protesters formed a road block outside the Mauna Kea visitors center) Department of Land and Natural Resources officers lead Thirty Meter Telescope protesters from the telescope building site on the summit of Mauna Kea on Thursday . Work got underway after protesters were arrested and their path was cleared to the summit, Sandra Dawson, a spokeswoman for the project, said in an email to The Associated Press. Police said they warned protesters after an incident Monday that anyone who blocked the road would be arrested. On Monday, more than 50 protesters formed a roadblock Monday that stopped about 15 vehicles carrying workers up Mauna Kea, causing workers to wait more than eight hours before making their way down the mountain. 'We regret that police action had to be taken to enable our legal access to the project site,' Thirty Meter Telescope project manager Gary Sanders said in a statement relating to Thursday's arrests. Opponents who question whether land appraisals were done correctly and whether Native Hawaiian groups had been consulted have tried to prevent the construction of the telescope. A Department of Land and Natural Resources officer, center left, comforts a Thirty Meter Telescope protester on the summit . Protests also disrupted a groundbreaking and Hawaiian blessing ceremony last year, but no one was arrested. In fact, some protesters who yelled during the ceremony later apologized to event organizers and helped put away chairs, Pisciotta said. 'We said aloha to each other, and we hugged,' she said. University of Hawaii spokesman Dan Meisenzahl said in a telephone interview that the university is saddened about the arrests, but that access to site must be maintained. 'If the university had a heart, it would be broken right now,' he said about Thursday's arrests. However, 'we have to make sure the road is safe for whoever wants to be there.' The university sub-leases the land atop Mauna Kea for the telescope project, and it has always maintained that protesters would have free access to the site as long as they were not breaking any laws, he said. Meisenzahl said he was not certain why the arrests were made. The observatory is expected to be operational by 2024, the same year a 39-meter telescope is expected to be completed in Chile.","12 protesters were arrested after blocking road leading to construction site of one of the world's largest telescopes, Thirty Meter Telescope .

"Video footage of a young woman being led away in handcuffs - allegedly because she was sunbathing on a private beach reserved for tourists - has gone viral in Mexico and sparked a heated debate. The 26-year-old woman, Laura Alicia Caldero, claims she was sitting under a palm tree on the Mamitas Beach in Playa del Carmen when armed police forcibly removed her. According to friends of Caldero, guards were preventing locals from going onto the sandy stretch, which is located in the tourist area of Quintana Roo in eastern Mexico. The woman's friends said she was arrested when she refused to pay a fine of about £70 . Video footage of a woman arrested on a beach in Playa del Carmen, Mexico has caused outrage . Her friend Marc Paez Chacon, 27, said: 'We told the guards you were not allowed to privatise the beach and went and sat under the shade of a palm tree. 'But then they suddenly turned up and told us that we had to pay for the use of the palm tree. 'We thought it was a joke, but when we refused police turned up. 'They told us we would have to pay a fine and move on, but Laura refused and ended up being arrested.' Laura Alicia Caldero, 26, says she was arrested for suntanning on a beach reserved for paying foreigners . The beach, located in tourist-friendly Quintana Roo, is most popular among those from Europe and the US . The beach is one of the most popular among tourists from Europe and the United States, and the video footage of the young woman's arrest has caused widespread outrage. 'They took me because I was sitting under palm tree,' Caldero, clad in a light blue bikini and being led away by police, explains in the video. 'The palm tree is apparently not for the public although it was a public beach.' Someone off camera then asks her where she is, to which she replies: 'In Mamitas, I was under a palm tree.' According to the woman, police told her and some friends that they were required to pay for use of a palm tree . Online commentators included Gabriel Hernandez, who wrote: 'Our beaches are for Yankees and Europeans, get used to it.' And another named Leviathan added: 'According to the law, you can't privatise a beach. She should issue a complaint.' Underneath Pedro had added: 'An opportunist who rents palm trees there probably called the police.' And Adriana Salez Hernandez added: 'Had she been a foreign tourist, they wouldn't have touched her.' However, police insist that the woman was removed because she had 'assaulted a group of private guards' Video commentators are visibly outraged, saying that had she been foreign, she wouldn't have been bothered . Police confirmed the arrest of the young woman, who was with three male friends. While they had all opted to pay a 1,600-peso fine (£70), the young woman had refused, and was then arrested. But Juan Carlos Pereira Escudero, secretary of the Playa del Carmen Council, denied that the local was taken because she refused to pay for the shade from sitting under a palm tree. He said the young woman 'assaulted a group of private guards'.","Laura Alicia Caldero, 26, removed from Mamitas Beach in Playa del Carmen .

Discussing how different women's bodies react during pregnancy, Dr Venkat, Director at Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'If a woman is healthy - physically and mentally - to start with and if she looks after herself well then she will look radiant. 'The hormones are elevated during pregnancy and women react differently to the hormones. Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.' Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman. When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy. Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established.

"Police believe they are on the verge of solving a brutal cold case murder that occurred 35 years ago. Ronda Blaylock was just 14-years-old in 1980 when she and a friend took a ride home from a stranger after finishing the day at Atkins High School in Rural Hall, North Carolina - a town so quaint and wholesome that it was the model for the fictional Mayberry in 'The Andy Griffith Show.' Her friend got dropped off first, but Ronda never made it back home. Three days later, her partially clothed body was discovered in a heavily wooded area almost 20 miles away from the bowling alley parking lot where she and her friend had hitched a ride. She had been violently assaulted and then stabbed to death. The man who gave her a ride home that day was never found. Scroll down for video . Ronda Blaylock (above) was just 14-years-old in 1980 when she was found stabbed to death and brutally assaulted . This after she and a friend had taken a ride home from a man (above) after school in Rural Hall, North Carolina . Surry County Sheriff Graham Atkinson (above) said in a press conference on Monday the man still lives in the area and they are close to getting him . The Camel City Dispatch reports that the investigation into Ronda's death was relaunched after her mother, Rebecca, called in to authorities recently to ask what progress had been made on her daughter's case. 'Within a day or so after receiving her call there were developments that I cannot discuss here today, but this task force is actively pursuing good leads,' Surry County Sheriff Graham Atkinson said in a press conference on Monday. What they already knew is that the man was in his early twenties back in 1980, drove a blue pickup truck with a white shell over the bed and went by Jimmy, though he told the girls his friends called him Butch. He would now be in his mid-to-late fifties. And while it has been years since the incident, some witnesses have been able to provide better information now than they could at the time the tragedy occurred. 'This is because they were young when this murder occurred and they feared getting into trouble with their parents or the law; they are no longer close with those who, in confidence, has discussed the homicide with them,' explained Sheriff Atkinson. 'The witnesses did not realize Ronda’s murder is still an open case.' More importantly, police can now test some of the DNA evidence from the scene, something they could not do back in 1980 due to a lack of technology. Ronda had been violently assaulted and stabbed to death when her body was found . The man was in his early twenties back in 1980, drove a blue pickup truck(similar to the one above)  with a white shell over the bed and went by Jimmy, though he told the girls his friends called him Butch . What's more, Sheriff Atkinson does not think law enforcement has to search far to find the man. 'We think he lived and still lives in the immediate area,' he said. 'We feel like he has blended into the community and he's lived with this for a long time and we're hoping he does the right thing and comes forward.' And if he does not come forward, Sheriff Atkinson has a message for him: 'Make no mistake. We are coming for you.' Ronda's mother meanwhile just wants closure after years of pain. 'I want them to be put in prison for the rest of their lives because I've been in prison, so to speak, for almost 35 years,' she said.

"British banker Rurik Jutting appeared before a packed courtroom in Hong Kong on Thursday accused of the murder of two young Indonesian women whose mutilated bodies were found in his apartment. Wearing the same black T-shirt and dark-rimmed glasses as in previous hearings, Jutting, 30, returned to magistrates' court after being deemed fit to stand trial in November following psychiatric tests. The former Merrill Lynch Bank of America employee faces life in prison if he is convicted of the murder charges. British banker Rurik Jutting (L), charged with grisly murders of two women, sits in a prison van as he arrives at the eastern court in Hong Kong, on April 2 . Jutting is accused of the murders of two Indonesian women. His case has been adjourned for five weeks . But the case was adjourned until May 8 after the prosecution asked for more time. One-time securities trader Jutting, who has not yet entered a plea in the case, was attentive but looked tired. He spoke twice to say: 'I do' when asked whether he understood the two charges against him. Seneng Mujiasih and Sumarti Ningsih, both in their 20s, were found dead in Jutting's upmarket flat in the early hours of November 1 after he called police. Mujiasih was found in the living room, naked and with knife wounds to her legs and buttocks. The decaying body of Ningsih was found hours later in a suitcase on the balcony. High-flying Cambridge graduate Jutting is being held at Hong Kong's maximum security Siu Lam psychiatric prison -- a walled hilltop compound on the outskirts of Hong Kong. Defence counsel Tim Parker accused the prosecution of ""yo-yo-ing"" for initially saying that they would need until July to present a case, then coming back to court, only to delay once more. 'It was an unnecessary waste of cost... My client was forced to come here,' said Parker, who added that the prosecution had sent the defence its committal papers - the case documents - too late. Magistrate Jason Wan turned down an application for costs, saying that it was 'not unusual' for a complex case to take time. Once all the evidence is submitted, after being reviewed by both sides, the magistrate will commit the case to the High Court, which handles murder cases and where an official plea must be entered. In a city generally regarded as safe by residents and known for its high-end shops and glitzy skyscrapers, the killings were unusually brutal and shone a spotlight on the seedy underbelly of the finance hub. Police have said they were investigating whether the two women were sex workers after cocaine and sex toys were found in the apartment, just a few streets away from Hong Kong's red-light district, where Jutting was reportedly a regular. But their distraught parents told AFP they believed their children had been working at restaurants. Mujiasih had entered the city on a domestic worker visa in 2010, but that had lapsed in 2012, while Ningsih came in on a tourist visa in October last year.","Jutting was deemed fit to stand trial in November .

"A single mom and her three kids who 'lost everything but their lives' in the East Village apartment explosion last week are getting an incredible outpouring of support from their fellow New Yorkers. Diane McLean says she's been overwhelmed by the generosity of her friends, neighbors and strangers after her four-bedroom rent-stabilized apartment at 45 East Seventh Street went up in flames. Dr McLean, a 58-year-old child psychiatrist in the South Bronx, says she and daughter Rose, 8, and twins James and Annabelle, 5, had nothing more than the clothes on their backs after the disaster. Diane McLean, 58, and her three children lost 'everything but their lives' when fire destroyed their apartment last week . Rose, 8, (left) and twins James and Annabelle, 5, lost everything except the clothes on their backs in the fire that destroyed their apartment building . The three kids have had the parents of classmates reach out and offer places to stay and clothing. A GoFundMe campaign has raised nearly $90,000 . 'My heart goes out to the families who lost loved ones. We lost everything but our lives,' she told PIX-TV. Two people died in the explosion, Moises Ismael Locon Yac, 26, and 23-year-old Nicholas Figueroa. Nineteen people were injured, some of them critically, and dozens were left homeless. That's when New Yorkers stepped up. A GoFundMe account has raised more than $87,000 for the family. Local businesses, like the bagel joint that Dr McLean frequents, have even chipped in. They're currently staying with friends, though the families of several of her children's classmates have also opened up their homes for them to stay, if needed, People magazine reports. Other families have donated clothes and other essentials to help get the family back on their feet. Hole in the ground: Three buildings on a crowded block in the East Village were utterly destroyed in the explosion and subsequent fire last week . The fire injured 19 and killed two people. Investigators believe an illegally tapped gas line may have been the cause of the blaze . Dr McLean didn't have renter's insurance, so she won't be reimbursed for any of her losses from the fire. 'We might not have a home, but we are far from homeless. It's an extremely comforting feeling,' she told People. Perhaps the biggest loss, though, was the apartment itself. Dr McLean paid just $1,500 a month for the 1,100-square-foot, four bedroom apartment because it was rent stabilized. She had lived there for 37 years. Realtors say that Dr McLean was paying thousands less than market rate for the popular neighborhood. Rent stabilized apartments are hard to find below 96th Street in Manhattan these days. Four bedroom apartments with rent that low are even harder to come by.","Diane McLean's four-bedroom rent-stabilized apartment was destroyed in the explosion last week .

After doctors in the UK started turning him away, he began jet setting to other countries for cosmetic surgery - even approaching Botched doctors Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif about getting back implants on last season's show, who ultimately said no to his request.

While Dr Dubrow said that Mr Alves' look is not their 'aesthetic' per se, he noted that the show's guest star hasn't asked for any of his surgeries to be reversed.

'It doesn’t define the man that I am - I’m much more than silicone and cosmetic surgery - but once you get started it’s difficult to stop.’ Mr Alves had his first surgery in 2004 after he moved to London and found himself feeling unattractive compared to the people he met. A generous inheritance from his grandfather allowed him to embark on his questing with perfection, beginning with a nose job.

"Pensioners and neighbours have criticised the £750,000 refurbishment of sheltered accommodation which they say has made it look like Legoland. All of the 36 units at the Redlands House sheltered accommodation have been given the colourful treatment which has been labelled an 'eyesore' by local residents. But the local council defended the colour scheme, claiming it will help residents with poor eyesight find their way home. Graham White, 76, from Penarth said the changes to the property looks 'more like a children's playscheme' The 36 homes as they were before the council spent £750,000 including funds from the Intermediate Care Fund on the renovation . One pensioner, Graham White, 76, said residents think the property looks 'more like a children's playscheme than sheltered accommodation'. Mr White, who has lived in one of the flats for three years, told the BBC: 'It is a total waste of public money. The colours are totally unsuitable for the older people that live here. 'They should put up a sign saying ""Welcome to Legoland"".' The residents' rent, of £103 a week plus bills, has remained the same since before the refurbishments took place. One neighbour, who lives opposite Redlands House and who did not wish to be named, described the building as an 'eyesore'. She said: 'It would be great if it was for kids. If it was a nursery it would look lovely. It looked much better the way it was before they put the colour on it.' However Sue Barter, who lives on Redlands Avenue, said she was 'not indifferent to it'. She said: 'I can see how residents might not like it. It's a shame it is not somewhere where more people can see it and appreciate it. But I wouldn't complain about it.' Hayley Selway, head of housing for Vale of Glamorgan council said the aim of the refurbishment was to 'change the look and feel of the property and bring it into the 21st century'. Mr White said after the colourful renovations that: 'They should put up a sign saying ""Welcome to Legoland"".' She said: 'It is quite loud and vibrant. The design won't suit everyone's tastes and not everybody is going to like it. 'This was about making a statement saying this is somewhere a little bit different.' She said the vibrant colours, both internal and external, were chosen to help residents with low levels of dementia and those with sight problems. She said plans for the redevelopment were on display for residents before any construction began and no concerns were raised prior to the work starting. She said: 'It is a matter of taste. Some residents rave about it. For others it is a huge departure from where they lived before but not everybody hates it.' Not impressed: Mr White stands outside the newly refurbished flats where he has lived for more than 3 years .","Locals say the bizarre refurbishment is more suitable for a playground .

"Jailed: Jordan Sim-Mutch posted pictures of stolen money and drugs on Facebook after targeting businesses across Greater Manchester . A 24-year-old man who carried out a series of raids on petrol stations and convenience stores has been jailed after boasting about his crimes on Facebook. Jordan Sim-Mutch posted pictures of stolen money and drugs on the social networking site after targeting businesses across Greater Manchester. The career criminal, who claimed he worked in 'midnight removals' in his online profile, was part of an armed gang responsible for 29 robberies and burglaries. Sim-Mutch, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, was jailed yesterday after admitting to a string of offences at Minsull Street Crown Court. On Wednesday night, hours before he was sentenced, Sim-Mutch uploaded a picture taken inside the courtroom that shows he and his fellow gang members in the dock. The photograph of the smirking men - which is now being used as the criminal's 'cover picture' on Facebook - was illegally taken by a friend in the public gallery. A number of supportive comments have since been left on the image, with one saying 'love you Jord' and another posting 'lads on tour'. The court was told the gang carried out a series of armed raids on petrol stations, convenience stores and a pub to pay for cannabis. The men used a number of stolen cars fitted with false licence plates, including a BMW and an Audi A5, to use as getaway vehicles, it was heard. They targeted businesses in groups of four, armed with a variety of weapons including bricks, baseball bats, a meat cleaver, axes, and, on one occasion, an imitation firearm. Three men would enter the premises and hold up staff as the fourth remained in the car. Prosecutor Adam Smith told the court that on one occasion, the men stole nearly £4,000 worth of cigarettes and £1,000 in cash from a BP garage in Bredbury. In another robbery, three of the group walked into a pub and threatened customers with a meat cleaver. Mr Smith said: 'A customer was threatened and told to ""get in the back"" towards the rear cash office where there was a safe. 'One was threatened with the cleaver and two took the member of staff to the office where they were forced to open the safe before they took £2,000.' The gang were involved in 29 robberies and burglaries across areas of Stockport and Greater Manchester. The men were first caught in November 2013, but were granted bail by the courts. When they re-started the operation in February last year, the gang had to carry out their crimes during the day because they were subject to curfews and electronic tagging orders. The gang were caught after police, suspecting they were behind a spree of recent robberies, started to monitor them. Sim-Mutch pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to commit burglary, conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to possess an imitation firearm.

"More than $440,000 has been raised for an Indiana pizzeria that said it would refuse to serve gay marriage ceremonies under new religious freedom laws after it was reportedly forced to close its doors. Kevin O’Connor, who owns Memories Pizza in the small town of Walkerton, told reporters he has temporarily shut the restaurant's doors after he received abusive phone calls and was trolled online. A contributor from Glenn Beck's The Blaze set up a fundraising page on GoFundMe for the pizzeria, with a goal of helping 'the family stave off the burdensome cost of having the media parked out front, activists tearing them down, and no customers coming in'. Scroll down for video . Shuttered: Memories Pizza in Indiana, whose owners Crystal and Kevin O'Connor (pictured) said they would refuse to cater a gay wedding, has closed its doors after being abused over the phone and online . Family business: The pizza joint  had been in operation for nine years before closing today, according to TMZ, although the O'Connors say the move is only temporary while the dust settles . Controversy: The O'Connors made their comments a week after the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed, forbidding state or local government from 'substantially 'burdening' a person's right to their beliefs . The news comes a week after Indiana passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics say will allow businesses to openly discriminate against gays, and just two days after his daughter told a local news station they would refuse to serve a gay marriage ceremony. Speaking to ABC57 on Tuesday, Crystal O'Connor said: 'If a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding, we would have to say no.’ The comments sparked fierce debate after they were published, and now TMZ is reporting that the pizzeria has closed its doors until the dust settles. According to the gossip site, O'Connor also tried to clarify his views, saying he would never refuse to serve gay customers, but as a Christian he disagrees with gay marriage, and so would refuse to serve a same-sex wedding. However, it is not all bad news for Memories, as supporters have hit back, raising more than $440,000 for the embattled owners via a fundraising page in just one day. Lawrence Jones, a contributor for the show Dana, hosted by Dana Loesch, organized the page to coincide with a Wednesday phone interview with Crystal O'Connor. The pizza joint  has been in operation for nine years. The interior of the old-fashioned eatery is adorned with crosses and bible quotes. Just outside the pizzeria, a signs states that the staff begin each morning with a prayer. 'We are a Christian establishment,' Crystal O’Connor confirmed, but pointed out that their business practices are not biased. ‘We're not discriminating against anyone, that's just our belief and anyone has the right to believe in anything,’ insisted O'Connor. Two thumbs down: The pizzeria's Yelp page was targeted by those who disagreed with the O'Connors' statements, attracting hundreds of one star reviews . Several reviewers invoked Adolf Hitler and the KKK in their eviscerating assessments of the pizzeria . When Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a Republican, signed the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law last week, the O’Connor family in Walkerton applauded his decision. The measure prohibits state and local government from ‘substantially burdening’ the ability of people — including businesses — to follow their religious beliefs. Pence said in a statement last Thursday that the bill ensures ‘religious liberty is fully protected under Indiana law.’ Critics of the legislation said it could allow discrimination against gay people, but its supporters claimed the bill merely seeks to prevent the government from compelling people to provide such things as catering or photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds. Crystal O’Connor, of Memories Pizza, dismissed discrimination concerns, saying the law is not targeting gays - it merely helps people that have strong religious beliefs. She added that as a devout Christian, she does not support same-sex marriage – a conviction shared by her father. He said: ‘That lifestyle is something they choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual. Why should I be beat over the head to go along with something they choose?’ Divisive bill: Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a Republican, signed the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law last week . The pizzeria owners made it clear that if a gay couple came to the restaurant, they would not deny them service - they simply would not cater a same-sex reception. The story of a small-town pizza joint backing a divisive piece of legislation has sparked backlash online, with people from across the country leaving strongly worded comments on the restaurant’s Facebook account. Before the comments were broadcast, the eatery had just two reviews on Yelp, but as of today it has nearly 700, with an average of just two stars. The picture section of the review page has also been swamped with images, some of which contain explicit content, supporting homosexuality and gay rights. Public outcry: Critics of the legislation said it could allow discrimination against gay people . Demonstrators  gather outside the City County Building on March 30 in Indianapolis, Indiana. The group called on the state house to roll back the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act . One five-star review, written from the point of view of 'Adolf. H,' stated: ‘Memories Pizza had been recommended to me by my buddy Herman years ago - and his praise was well deserved. ‘The largely Aryan ownership manages their subhuman staff quite well. No y*** or q****s to speak of and the tomato sauce was pretty decent for canned.’ User Marco V. wrote in his review in part: 'You don't want sinners coming into your business? guess what? We are all sinners.' The review was accompanied by a meme of Crystal O'Connor with a speech bubble that read: 'Jesus said bigotry is great for sales!' Many Yelpers mocked Ms O’Connor’s suggestion that anyone would want to order pizza for their wedding reception. 'As a pizza loving lesbian - I would NEVER serve pizza at my wedding. Morons,' fumed Laura D from Long Beach, New York. Another critic of the Walkerton establishment joked that their discriminatory practices did not go far enough. A sign reading 'This business serves everyone' is placed in the window of Bernadette's Barbershop in downtown Lafayette, Indiana March 31, 2015. The store is one of several who display such stickers . ‘I’m ANGRY and will never order pizza from these people again because they're simply not discriminatory enough! I mean, just ""gays""? What about anyone who works on Sundays (Leviticus 23:3)? People who wear makeup (Jeremiah 4:30)? Hungry people (Proverbs 23:2)? Men without beards (Leviticus 19:27)? Tattooed people (Leviticus 19:28)? People who eat shellfish (Leviticus 11:10)? People with messy hair (Leviticus 10:6)? New mothers (Leviticus 12:4-5)? Psychics or mediums (Leviticus 20:27)?’ A small number of people have come to the O’Connors' defense amid an avalanche of negative comments. Lori Childers wrote on the eatery’s Facebook page: ‘God Bless you for standing up for your rights, its YOUR business and you should run it however you see fit. Sick of LBGT denying me of my God given rights. Go find another store to shop at or hey open your own store.......’ Governor Pence addressed the backlash against the bill in a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece published Monday, writing that he abhors discrimination. 'If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn’t eat there anymore,' he said. However, the GOP official noted that the new law reflects not only federal law, but also legislations passed by 30 states. The following day, Pence announced that he wants a new bill clarifying that the Religious Freedom act does not allow discrimination on his desk by the end of the week.","Memories pizza, in Walkerton, Indiana, has reportedly closed its doors .

"An Italian model who accused Harvey Weinstein of groping her breasts and putting his hand up her skirt attended the Hollywood mogul's new Broadway show just a day after his alleged attack. Ambra Battilana, 22, told police Weinstein asked her for a kiss and then groped her during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night. However, the very next day she snapped a picture of her matinee ticket to a preview showing of Finding Neverland, which Weinstein is producing, from the Lunt-Fontanne Theater and posted it on her Instagram. Scroll down for video . Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein groped her during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night . The next day she snapped a picture of her matinee ticket to a preview showing of Finding Neverland, which Weinstein is producing, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater and posted it on her Instagram . Sober: Directly after the show, Battilana posted a picture of an empty glass of water from the Tribeca HOtel where the NYPD picked up Weinstein very soon after . A movie industry source said Weinstein gave Battilana the $227 sixth-row-center-seat ticket during their Friday night meeting and told her he would be backstage during the show . A movie industry source told Page Six Weinstein gave Battilana two $227 sixth-row-center-seat tickets during their Friday night meeting and told her he would be backstage during the show. The source said: 'Why would she go, knowing he was nearly 100 percent likely to be there?' Indeed, directly after the show, the beauty queen uploaded another picture to her Instagram feed. Battilana posted an empty glass of water from the Tribeca Grand Hotel, from where cops took the movie supremo in for questioning a short time later. This has led some to speculate that the 22-year-old tipped off the NYPD as to Weinstein's movements and was actually waiting to see them apprehend him. Weinstein, 63, was questioned by the NYPD this weekend and denied Battilana's allegations. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted that the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Surveillance footage from outside the Tribeca office is being analyzed, according to police sources. Weinstein, 63, has denied Battilana's allegations. The married father of five was reportedly interviewed by the NYPD Special Victims Squad on Saturday after going to the police precinct voluntarily . Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010 . Weinstein, a married father of five, was reportedly interviewed by the NYPD Special Victims Squad on Saturday after going to the police precinct voluntarily. No charges have been filed and he has promised full cooperation with the probe. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. It was revealed that Battilana also alleged to Italian police in 2010 that she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means'  when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. It was revealed that Battilana also alleged to Italian police in 2010 that she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage . The age of sexual consent is 14 in Italy but it is illegal to pay for sex or to have sex with a prostitute who is under the age of 18. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his ""playmate""'. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with €2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the €5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.

Harvey Weinstein seen with a smile on his face as he enters his office building in New York City on Tuesday . The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Battilana posted a picture that showed seats at the Spring Spectacular in Radio City Music Hall, where she reportedly met  Weinstein on Thursday . Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. Marcello Cassano, a fashion photographer and ex-boyfriend of Miss Battilana, told the Daily News that the legal battle was probably the reason they broke up. 'That's probably why we ended,' he said. 'She's a victim of her beauty.' He added: 'She's a good person, but she suffered so much.' After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. The 22-year-old recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. She established a new Twitter account on Monday and posted the message: 'Don't stop Dreaming just because you had a Nightmare.' The Manhattan District Attorney has yet to decide whether charges will be filed against Weinstein. The DA's office declined to comment to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online on Tuesday. Weinstein reportedly first met the former Miss Italy contestant the night before the alleged attack at his New York Spring Spectacular show in Radio City Music Hall. The 22-year-old model posted a picture on her Instagram account from Radio City Music Hall on Thursday night. The pair exchanged emails and arranged for Battilana to come in to his office for an audition and to 'talk business'. Ambra Battilana gave previous statements to Italian authorities after claiming she had been invited to one of ex-Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi''s now infamous orgies at his Milan mansion in 2010. In statements she told investigators: . Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter.

"A passenger plane trying to land at a Texas airport turned back when the pilot discovered that the runway lights had been switched off. American Eagle Flight 2536 was scheduled to fly about 125 miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Wichita Falls, Texas, on Sunday night. The plane left nearly a half-hour late, and when it got to Wichita Falls, the pilot told passengers that the runway lights were turned off and there was nobody at the airport to turn them on, according to officials in the city of 100,000 people. Plane: American Eagle Flight 2536 was scheduled to fly about 125 miles from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Wichita Falls, Texas, on Sunday night (file photo) Wichita Falls officials first said that the Eagle pilot had the wrong radio frequency to turn on the lights on the main, 13,000-foot runway. Like many other small airports where control towers are not staffed around the clock, pilots in Wichita Falls can operate the runway lights with their radio system. But on Tuesday, city aviation director John Burrus said that Sheppard Air Force Base, which shares the facility, had closed the runway and turned off the lights. Burrus said Sheppard notified pilots of the closure. He added that the American Eagle jet could have landed on an adjacent, 10,000-foot runway that was lit. A spokesman for ExpressJet, a regional carrier that operated the flight under contract with American Airlines, said late Tuesday that the airline was still trying to determine what happened. 'The pilot attempted to activate the lights, but he couldn't do so,' said Jarek Beem, the ExpressJet spokesman. He said he didn't know why the pilot didn't land on the shorter runway. 'We're still reviewing the entire incident.' Beem said the pilot circled Wichita Falls for about 30 minutes before giving up and turning back to DFW. The plane, with 45 passengers, made an otherwise uneventful midnight landing at DFW after a one hour, 40-minute flight, according to tracking service FlightAware.com.

"Esa’s Rosetta spacecraft has survived a hair-raising encounter with comet 67P after the probe ran into difficulties during a recent flyby. On Saturday the spacecraft had dipped to within nine miles (14km) of the surface to take a closer look at the jets that are being ejected from its surface. But during the manoeuvre, Rosetta lost sense of where it was due to the amount of dust and gas and was placed into ‘safe mode’, causing it to momentarily lose contact with Earth. The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft (illustrated) has survived a hair-raising encounter with comet 67P after the probe ran into difficulties during a recent flyby. Rosetta launched into space in 2004 and entered orbit around 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August 2014 . ‘Not the best month to choose to go dry…’ Rosetta project scientist Dr Matt Taylor quipped on Twitter, as the team back on Earth sweated over the safety of the spacecraft. The problems arose due to Rosetta’s limited vision owing to the amount of material it was flying through. The spacecraft uses two star trackers to work out where it is in space, in addition to a sun sensor, navigation cameras and three laser gyroscopes. Crucially, the star trackers allow Rosetta to know where it is with respect to the sun and Earth, so it can correctly orient its antenna to send and receive signals from ground stations on our planet. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 3.3ft (one metre) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Philae managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power. Rosetta, meanwhile, is continuing to orbit and study the comet. From data collected by the two proves, Esa said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. When the star trackers are not working properly, the antenna  drifts, causing communications to be temporarily lost. And during the recent flyby, the spacecraft started to mistake comet debris for stars, causing it to lose sight of Earth. The spacecraft autonomously attempted to readjust itself but struggled due to its close proximity to comet 67P. Esa said that ‘hundreds of “false stars” were registered’ and it took nearly 24 hours before the spacecraft could properly start tracking again. During this dramatic event, the antenna had become mis-aligned with Earth, so that only a very weak radio signal was being received. Once the tracking system was restored, the off-pointing was immediately correct and the operations team on the ground saw a return to full signal strength. Some issues with ‘false stars’ were still occurring, though, and attempts to eradicate them caused the same problem to occur. This time, the spacecraft but itself into ‘safe mode’ to preserve its safety, during which it switched off its science instruments to replace them. Esa said it took until Monday to get the spacecraft back into ‘normal’ status. On whether the problem could cause Rosetta to lose permanent contact with Earth if it happened again, Dr Taylor told MailOnline that they were 'looking at ways to minimise this from happening.' ‘Plans for the future are being discussed now,’ he added. He also said they had been ‘flying at a very low relative velocity to the comet to reduce the chance’ of any lasting damage being caused by debris. The spacecraft is now performing a wide sweep around the comet, giving engineers ample time to make sure the problem does not occur again. 'We are looking to examine the best way to mitigate the chance of re-occurrence,' said Dr Taylor. The spacecraft completed a manoeuvre yesterday that will bring it from about 250 miles (400km) of the comet to within 90 miles (140km) by Wednesday next week. The spacecraft uses two star trackers (shown in red) to work out where it is in space, in addition to a sun sensor, navigation cameras and three laser gyroscopes. The star trackers allow Rosetta to know where it is with respect to Earth, so it can send and receive signals. The high gain antenna is in the background . Rosetta was tasked with studying the jets coming from its surface (shown in image). It is hoped that continuing studies like this could reveal what the comet's interior is composed of - but engineers will be hoping that this 'false stars' anomaly does not occur again . This diagram shows an example of Rosetta's recent flyby trajectories at Comet 67P. The spacecraft completed a manoeuvre yesterday that will bring it from about 250 miles (400km) of the comet to within 90 miles (140km) by Wednesday next week . The purpose of flying in so close is to examine 67P's geysers. These jets are formed when ice on the surface sublimates - or vapourises - and they become more active as the comet approaches the sun. It is getting closer and closer over the next few months, with its point of closest approach taking place in August. As it becomes more active, Rosetta has a fantastic opportunity to sweep through the increasingly large jets and gather data. Studying the jets could reveal vital data on how gas and dust flows out from the surface, and it could also reveal the connection between the comet’s atmosphere - its coma - and the surface. Despite the drama, Esa was still able to release some amazing images recently taken by Rosetta. This stunning scene was created from two Rosetta frames acquired at 12 miles (19.9 km) from the comet centre on 28 March. The scale is about 1.7 m/pixel and the image measures 3.1 x 1.7 km . The latest images include ones of Earth and Mars which were taken when the probe was attempting ‘gravity assist manoeuvres’ in which it used other planets to slingshot its way towards the comet. Pictured is Mars as seen by Rosetta in 2007 . As the comet gets closer to the sun, scientists will also be hoping to hear from the Philae lander on the surface. The washing machine-sized Philae probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet 67P on 12 November 2014. But after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface, the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power. Now, as the comet approaches the sun, it is hoped that solar rays will recharge Philae’s batteries and bring it back to life.

"A teenage farmer who struggled with anorexia died after she took an overdose of an animal medication. Charlotte Cobbald, 17, took the deadly medicine, which her father Stephen was keeping illegally, and injected it after saying she felt like a 'failure'. She then ran away from her father, saying 'let me die', before she collapsed in a field and her family called 999, an inquest heard. Paramedics fought to save her and took her in an ambulance to hospital, but Charlotte died from the effects of the drug. Overdose: 17-year-old farmer Charlotte Cobbald died while suffering from anorexia and depression . At the time she died in August, Charlotte was visiting the family farm in Acton, Suffolk while on day release from a mental health unit where she was treated for anorexia and depression. She was an A* GCSE student who had a talent for sheep farming, but was a 'perfectionist' who had battled anorexia and depression, the hearing was told. On August 4 she came home and took some training sheepdogs out with her father, then told him she felt she was a 'complete failure'. They returned to the farm office where farm secretary Katherine Turner was working. While her father stood at the door, Charlotte went over to a fridge full of veterinary medication, found the antibiotics - used to treat farm animals - and injected herself with the drug. Mrs Turner said: 'I knew she was unwell but she didn't seem too bad, there was no immediate cause or concern. 'I don't know how we didn't see. Mr Cobbald seemed to know something had happened. He said, ""Have you done something?"" and she replied yes. 'She just ran. I got in another vehicle and followed them. She was saying, ""Leave me alone, let me die, leave me to die."" 'She slumped and she was carried into the back of the car. In the office he sat on a chair holding her and he said she'd stopped breathing.' 'Perfectionist': An inquest heard that Charlotte suffered from a desire to be the best at all times . When paramedics arrived, they had to ask their colleagues to Google the medicine because they had no idea of its effects. David Hall, inspector at the Veterinary Medical Directorate, visited the farm after Charlotte's death and said her father admitted buying the antibiotic from a lorry driver, but had forgotten that he still had some left. He did not enter the drug into his farm's medicine book, which is a legal requirement. Dr Sukhi Khaira of the North Essex Partnership University NHS Trust told the inquest that Charlotte should not have been allowed to visit the farm without a formal risk assessment. She had lost around 20kg in 2013, and went through a period of not talking to her father. She also had a history of self-harming. Clinical psychologist Dr Kevin Beardsworth said she was a 'perfectionist', adding: 'There was a significant sense of hopelessness and helplessness. She had exceptionally high standards for herself, she did not feel good enough. 'If she got 99 out of 100 she would be unhappy, she was a perfectionist and this is seen in anorexia. She was bullied at school and began to isolate herself because she was focussed on her work.' Coroner Yvonne Blake recorded a narrative verdict, saying she could not be sure that Charlotte meant to kill herself and suggesting that her actions were a cry for help. 'Charlotte battled with mental health illnesses including anorexia,' she said. 'She was hospitalised and started to improve so she was allowed on home leave to her father's farm. 'From what I've read from Charlotte's state of mind and from the professionals caring for her, she did have problems with self-harm and impulsive acts. 'She told someone straight away which suggests she wanted help for what she'd done.' After the hearing, Charlotte's mother Hilary said: 'Before she became unwell she had an inner zest for life and excitedly made dreams and plans for her future. 'Her beautiful smile and cheeky laughter was like the sunshine in summer, never far away and readily present. 'The acute trauma she tried to battle, despite the therapy received, supported by ourselves and her friends, took away her sunshine and she lost her battle to live.'

"Zero-hours worker? University John-Jo Pierce enjoys a cigar . Labour's efforts to fight off accusations of hypocrisy on zero-hours contracts were in chaos last night. Party chiefs had scrambled to shore up support for Ed Miliband after it emerged that dozens of Labour councils and MPs employ staff on the controversial contracts, which he has pledged to ban. In a further blow, Parliament’s expenses watchdog rejected claims by Labour MPs that they employ staff on zero hours only because they are forced to by the Westminster system. And Labour’s biggest donor Unite also lost a humiliating tribunal ruling over an employee who claims he was sacked for complaining about being employed on a zero-hours basis. On Wednesday, Mr Miliband vowed to end the ‘epidemic’ of zero-hours contracts – and blasted the Tories for failing to protect ordinary workers. But he was accused of ‘total hypocrisy’ on the issue after it emerged 68 of his MPs – including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls – had employed staff on that basis in the past two years. Labour councils, including Mr Miliband’s own authority in Doncaster, have also issued 22,000 of the contracts. As the revelations emerged, party chiefs engineered a letter, signed by 100 workers and employers from ‘all walks of life’, that was also designed as a riposte to a letter signed by dozens of business leaders who backed the Tories this week. But the move backfired spectacularly last night after it emerged the signatories included a benefit fraudster, a boss who has used zero-hours workers, affluent students and a string of union and party activists. They include: . BENEFITS FRAUDSTER . One of the signatories identified herself as someone who had ‘worked on [a] zero-hours contract’, but Labour removed her name yesterday after it was revealed she had been convicted of benefit fraud in 2012. Scroll down for video . A court in Manchester heard that Kemi Saidu, 43, moved to Britain after she had a ‘marriage of convenience’ in Nigeria in December 2007. According to tax officials she lived with her ‘husband’, who was the holder of a British passport, ‘briefly or not at all’. She was not entitled to benefits because she was subject to ‘immigration control’, but she submitted a tax credits application and a child benefit claim for three children, two of whom did not live with her. The court heard that she moved in with a new partner but claimed £27,888 in tax credits in two and a half years as a single person. Boss: Fashion designer Wayne Hemingway, whose firm employed intern on zero-hours contracts, and Harrods fan Tunji Offeyi, from Tooting, south London, who had treated himself to some perfume . She was caught after she applied for leave to remain in Britain on the basis of her ‘marriage’. Officers found she had been fraudulently claiming benefits and had allowed others to use her name and national insurance number to work illegally in the UK. In July 2012 she was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and 150-hour community work order after she pleaded guilty to immigration and fraud charges along with her ‘husband’ who had been working at HMRC as a security officer. A Labour spokesman said last night: ‘More than 6,000 people have now signed our letter from all walks of life across the country. ‘Of course we were unaware of the background of this person. The fact still remains that the epidemic of zero-hours contracts are a symbol of the failure of this Government’s economic plan.’ CIGAR-SMOKING STUDENTS . Other signatories included 21-year-old Manchester University students John-Jo Pierce and Rory Somerville. Facebook pages of the pair – who said they were working zero-hours contracts – included photographs of them smoking cigars whilst dressed in black tie. Black tie: Rory Somerville, aged 19, pictured at a university ball . Mr Pierce, who is studying maths, is registered on the electoral roll at his mother's £1million house which is set in woodland near Leatherhead, Surrey. His mother Deirdre, 55, yesterday said he was ‘just a kid’ who ‘knows nothing about politics’ but had signed the letter after he was asked to by a fellow university student ‘he vaguely knows’. She told the Mail: ‘All he did was sign a petition that somebody called Andrea asked everybody to sign. He knows a little but not much. It’s the first time he’s been interested in an election.’ She declined to discuss what work he was doing on a zero- hours contract. Mr Somerville, who is in his final year studying economics, is registered to vote at his mother's house, in an affluent area of Belfast. Mr Pierce was also photographed at a party in front of a sign that said ‘Drugz Room’, but Mrs Pierce said it was just a ‘joke’ sign that was a reference to the US television programme Breaking Bad. She said: ‘John-Jo has never done drugs in his life. It’s a joke about Breaking Bad. That’s what people of that age do. They all make jokes.’ Mr Somerville did not respond to a request to comment. The ZERO-HOURS BOSS . Fashion designer Wayne Hemingway went into meltdown on live television after it was pointed out that his own firm took on interns on a zero-hours basis. Mr Hemingway, co-founder of the fashion label Red or Dead, was one of the few business figures willing to put their name to Labour’s letter. He said he had agreed to sign up ‘because I want to see a party that starts to commit to reducing the inequality gap’. But he became angry when BBC reporter Tim Willcox pointed out that his own firm had advertised for staff on a zero-hours basis. Mr Hemingway said the policy had now changed, adding: ‘It is in the past – we have changed. Are we not allowed to change? We realised it was wrong and we changed two years ago.’ He said there was a big difference between using unpaid interns and employing someone on zero-hours. Yesterday, the firm said it still takes on unpaid interns on a short-term basis, although those staying longer are offered payment. HARRODS SHOPPER . Last night, it was revealed that trade union officials had hurriedly tried to persuade supporters to sign the pro-Labour letter just hours after the critical letter from business leaders had been published. Tunji Offeyi, from Tooting, South London, who had previously worked on a zero-hours contract as a hospital porter, said he got an email from Unite on Wednesday. Party chiefs  scrambled to shore up support for Ed Miliband after it emerged dozens of Labour councils and MPs employ staff on zero-hour contracts . His Facebook page showed him posing with a Harrods shopping bag in December last year. Mr Offeyi last night said he had not been on a zero-hours contract at the time and had treated himself to some perfume. Others listed as workers on zero- hours contracts included Stacey Booth, an administration assistant at Leeds Council, who is a convenor for the GMB union. Another signatory, Rema Boumerdassi, was found to be a member of the shop workers union Usdaw. Her Twitter page describes her as a single parent and shows her and other union members posing with Russell Brand. Baris Yerli also said he used to work on a zero-hours contract, but his online CV revealed his other former jobs included working as a political office assistant at Unite. LABOUR LUVVIES . The letter claimed to be from people from ‘all walks of life’ but among the signatories were Labour councillors and a former MP. Derek Wyatt, 65, was MP for Sittingbourne but stood down at the last election. Others included Stephanie Elsy, the former Labour leader of Southwark Council who now runs her own political consultancy, and Kevin Craig, who is a Labour representative on Lambeth Council. Billy Boyle, the scientist husband of Kate Gross, a former No10 aide who ran Tony Blair’s Africa charity and died on Christmas Day aged 36, was also a signatory of the letter. EX-BBC BOSS . Sir Michael Lyons, a former chairman of the BBC Trust, was among signatories to the letter – despite his own high earnings and questions over his role in approving fatcat pay-offs at the Corporation. In 2013, he faced a grilling from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee over pay-offs, including a £1million package for outgoing director-general Mark Byford in 2011. At the BBC, Sir Michael’s salary was £131,000, despite the fact he worked a four-day week. His jobs since leaving the broadcaster have included a lucrative role on the board of construction firm Mouchel, where he was interim chairman on a £300,000 salary for a time. He is also an ex-Labour councillor and wrote a report for Ed Miliband in his role as his housing guru. THE PLUS SIZED BLOGGER . Callie Thorpe is listed on the letter as a receptionist, but online she also describes herself as a ‘plus-size style and lifestyle blogger, fan of lipsticks, food, travel and self love’. The 25-year-old, who lives in London, wrote on her web page: ‘Travelling the world has always been a passion of mine, especially Thailand and I thought I would share with you the best five weeks of my life hoping that I can impart some knowledge if you too are looking to travel around Thailand or Cambodia.’ She has also posted photographs of trips to Berlin, Paris and Amsterdam. She is a size 18 to 20.","Ed Miliband accused of ‘hypocrisy’ after 68 MPs used zero-hour contracts .

"A mother whose boyfriend is accused of repeatedly raping her 10-year-old daughter abandoned the girl at her grandparents' home before moving back in with the man, it has emerged. The child, Corinne Gump, and her grandparents were killed in a massive house fire in the early hours of Monday, just hours before Robert Seman, Jr., 46, was to go on trial for allegedly sexually abusing the girl over several years. After the three bodies were found in the  home in Youngstown, Ohio, police went to Seman's home and found Corinne's mother, Lynn Schmidt, WKBN reported. She was taken to the police station to be interviewed but she has not been arrested. Loss: Corinne Gump, 10, and her grandparents were killed in a house fire on Monday - the day her mother's boyfriend was set to go on trial for raping her. Her mother is pictured heading to the police station, right . Left behind: Her mother, Lynn Schmidt, reportedly left the girl with her grandparents and went back to her boyfriend's home, even after she knew he was accused of sexually assaulting her daughter . It has emerged that, following the rape allegations against Seman, Schmidt and her daughter moved in with her parents, Judy and Bill Schmidt, but she eventually headed back to her boyfriend's home. Seman was under electronically-monitored house arrest at the time of the deadly fire but he was taken back into custody on Monday, accused of trying to bribe a witness in the rape case. Investigators said they have found no evidence that the origin of the blaze was suspicious but that they continue to investigate and his trial has been postponed. Corinne Gump and her grandparents, 61-year-old Judy and 63-year-old Bill, who were both deaf, lost their lives in the early-morning blaze after neighbors reported hearing loud explosions. 'It was fully involved,' Fire Chief John O'Neill told The Youngstown Vindicator. 'We had quite a bit of fire in the basement, so that's the likely origin. They had fire all through the house, top to bottom. The floors were giving way almost immediately upon entry.' Accused: Robert Seman, Jr., 46, was back in custody on Monday (pictured) after it emerged he allegedly tried to bribe a witness in the case. He was under house arrest and electronic monitoring at the time of the fire . Taken away: Seman, who allegedly raped the young girl over several years, remains in custody . The three bodies were found on the second floor; all were out of their beds and the way their bodies were positioned looked as if they were trying to get out, Fire Chief John O'Neill told The Vindicator. It is not yet clear if they had smoke detectors in the home. Smoke detectors for the hearing-impaired can send vibrations, sound or light to alert residents. Steve Leland, director of Easter Seals Youngstown Hearing and Speech Center Community Center, told the Vindicator that the local deaf community is mourning the loss of the couple. 'Bill and Judy were always willing to talk to parents who'd just found out they had a deaf child,' he said. 'They would often discuss options for raising a deaf child, talking about their own personal life experiences, being deaf themselves, and raising deaf children.' The couple had three children, two of whom are deaf. William Schmidt was a retired AT&T lineman, while his wife taught deaf people sign language, the publication reported. 'They were very outgoing, very sweet people, always ready to help,' Leland added. Battle: Firefighters pulled the three bodies from the second floor of the home on Monday morning . Destruction: Fire officers said the blaze quickly ripped through the home from bottom to top. But they said there was no evidence that the cause of the fire was suspicious . Questions: Fire Captain Kurt Wright and a State Fire Marshall look into the back of the house on Monday as an investigation continues into the cause of the fire. Neighbors reported hearing explosions . Corinne was a 4th grade student at South Range School, where officials have assembled a crisis team to counsel students and staff affected by the tragedy. Seman, himself a father of a two-year-old, had been accused of abusing Corinne from when she was just four years old until she was eight, WFMJ reported, citing an indictment from a year ago. His trial has been delayed in light of the deaths but no new date has yet been set. Prosecutors are hoping to convince the judge to allow statements the girl made to a social worker and a nurse before her death. He has been charged with four counts of rape and four counts of gross sexual imposition and could face life in prison if convicted.

"Charles Darwin argued that animals can express emotions with their face and body, like humans do. Now researchers have found that rats can recognise pain the faces of their fellow rodents. The study suggests that as well as expressing their emotional state, the pained faces of rats may have a ‘communicative function’. They may even use expressions to warn other rats of danger or ask for help. Researchers have found that rats can recognise pain the faces of their fellow rodents .Researchers based at different institutions in Tokyo, noted that rats flatten their ears, narrow their eyes and puff up their cheeks when they are in pain (shown in the images on the right) – an observation in previous studies . Researchers based at different institutions in Tokyo, noted that rats flatten their ears, narrow their eyes and puff up their cheeks when they are in pain – an observation in previous studies. The experts wanted to find out whether the rodents do this as a reflex reaction, or to communicate their discomfort to others. They found that Long-Evans rats can read pain on other animal’s faces and use the information to makes decisions, Popular Science reported. The scientists first took photographs of rats who were in pain and others with neutral expressions. To test the rodents' response to rats’ pained expressions, they showed them the photos in a specially made cage, to test whether they responded to the face, rather than the smell of another animal, for example. The rats chosen are described as ‘naive’ in the study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, and were between eight and 12 months old. Individuals were put into a cage composed of three interconnecting rooms, one of which had images of a rat in pain, which had been given an electric shock. To test the rodent’s response to rats’ pained expressions, they showed them the photos in a specially made cage (pictured). They found that rats spent less time in the room showing rodents in pain, than they did in the other compartment showing rats with neutral facial expressions . Male mice sing to woo females, scientists claim. They also change their tune depending on whether she is within sight or not. The females, meanwhile, seem to like some of the songs more than others. In a quirky study that could shed help shed light on autism and other conditions that involve difficulties in communication, researchers from Duke University in North Carolina studied male mice that were either placed in a cage with a female – or one with just her scent. Special equipment was used to record and analyse their squeaks, which are so high-pitched that people can’t hear them. This revealed that they sang one song when they could simply smell a female and another one when they could see her. When they could merely smell a potential mate, they belted out an extremely shrill and complex song, perhaps in an attempt to make themselves known. But when she was within sight, they serenaded her more softly. These songs also had a more simple structure and were longer. They entered one-by-one through a central compartment without any images on the walls and made their way to a compartment off the central room with pictures of pained rats on the walls and another offshoot room with photos of happier rats on the walls. Each rat was allowed to wander freely around the cage for 10 minutes while the researchers recorded how long it spent in each room. They found that rats spent more time in the rooms where they didn’t have to confront the image of a rat in pain. '…the rats stayed longer in the compartment with the images of neutral expressions than in that with the images of pain expressions,’ the study says. ‘This indicates that the rats were able to discriminate the category of emotional expression.’ On average, they spent one minute less in the pain room, than the compartment showing a rat with a neutral expression. While the scientists didn’t say that the study suggests mice can empathise, they believe that their facial expressions have evolved to communicate pain. They wrote: ‘emotional expression in rodents, rather than just a mere “expression” of emotional states, might have a communicative function.’ ‘The emotional expression of pain might have an adaptive function for both the expresser and receiver, such as emitting a warning signal or promoting carer behaviour from the receiver,’ they hypothesised. Previous studies have shown that several kinds of primates make faces and can discriminate between different expressions.","Researchers  in Tokyo placed rats in a  cage with three compartments .

"Prison officer Thomas Jordan Driver, 25, was arrested on Thursday. He and fellow Klan members planned to kill a black inmate after his release in retaliation for a fight, officials said . Three Florida prison officers who belong to the Ku Klux Klan have been charged with plotting to kill a black inmate after his release, officials said on Thursday. The KKK men believed the prisoner was infected with HIV and hepatitis and he bit one of them during a fight, officials said. Klans men Thomas Jordan Driver, 25, David Elliot Moran, 47, and Charles Thomas Newcomb, 42, each face one state count of conspiracy to commit murder, according to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's office. The supposed hit man was an FBI criminal informant who recorded those scenes and others over the past year. Investigators said he faked pictures of the black man's death to help build a case against three Klan members who worked at a Florida prison. The case is the latest black eye for the troubled state prison system. The state said the murder plot started after Driver, an officer at the Department of Corrections Reception and Medical Center in Gainesville, rural north Florida, had a fight with the inmate. Moran is currently a sergeant there. Newcomb was fired in 2013 for failing to meet training requirements, according to the department. Bondi's office said the three were also members of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The group has garnered attention in recent months for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists. The FBI was alerted to the murder plot by a confidential informant inside the Klan, according to an arrest affidavit. Scroll down for video . David Moran, a prison employee (pictured left), who together with another employee of the Florida Dept. of Corrections and former employee Charles Thomas Newcomb (right) were arrested for plotting to kill a black inmate who had allegedly bitten one guard during a fight . The informant was present when Driver and Moran talked with Newcomb, identified as the KKK chapter's 'Exalted Cyclops' or leader, and recorded many of their conversations. In late 2014, authorities say Driver gave the Klan chapter, called a klavern, a photograph of the inmate, who'd been let out on supervised release. 'Both Driver and Moran ... told the (confidential informant) that they wanted (the inmate) 'six feet under',' the FBI's affidavit said. The informant recorded all three men making plans to murder the inmate, according to the affidavit. In the recordings, the men often refer to the inmate using a racial epithet. Their first attempt to find and kill the inmate failed and the informant recorded a conversation with Driver to confirm he still wanted him dead, the affidavit said. 'Do you want this guy terminated?' the informant asked. 'Yes sir,' Driver replied, according to the affidavit. The American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has garnered attention for distributing flyers that likened protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, to terrorists. A recent flyer from the Klan provided byWTXL-TV is seen here . In March, the FBI gave the informant a burner cellphone with the doctored photograph of the inmate who looked like he'd been fatally shot. The informant showed all three men the picture and recorded their jubilant reactions. Moran and Driver both smiled when they saw the picture, and Driver shook the informant's hand in gratitude, according to the affidavit. The case highlights an ongoing stream of high-profile problems in Florida's prison system. Last fall, prison system officials fired nearly 50 employees, including several over allegations that they punched and beat inmates. The deaths of inmates Randall Jordan-Aparo and Darren Rainey also drew attention. Jordan-Aparo was reportedly gassed in a confinement cell at the Franklin Correctional Institution. Rainey, a mentally ill prisoner, was punished in 2012 with a shower so hot that his skin separated from his body at Dade Correctional Institution. The warden there was fired. Department of Corrections Secretary Julie Jones, who was hired late last year to lead the troubled agency, called the arrests 'disquieting.' 'We are moving swiftly to terminate the employees arrested today and working closely with Office of the Attorney General to assist in their prosecution,' she said in a statement. 'Our Department has zero tolerance for racism or prejudice of any kind. The actions of these individuals are unacceptable and do not, in any way, represent the thousands of good, hardworking honorable correctional officers employed at the Department of Corrections.' The case will be prosecuted in Columbia County in north Florida. Driver and Moran were being held in Union County jail. Newcomb was in Alachua County Jail with bond set at $750,000. Frank Ancona, imperial wizard of the KKK group to which the three men were said to belong, did not confirm or deny their membership. 'We at the TAK do not in any way condone, tolerate, or support any type of illegal activity in our organization and because of this we would stand by any of our members pending a decision by a court of law, not a decision of the court of media or public opinion,' Ancona said.
