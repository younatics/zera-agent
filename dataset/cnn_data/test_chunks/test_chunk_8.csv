"With a surfboard strapped to his feet, a thrill-seeker soars through the air as he showcases a new extreme sport. This action shot was taken at Estavayer-le-Lac in Switzerland where the latest water sports craze of Jet Surfing has taken off. The contraption can be seen leaping up above the surface, almost resembling scenes from the film Back to the Future where Michael J Fox's character Marty McFly climbs on to a futuristic hoverboard. Scroll down for video . Flying high: Jet surfing is the latest craze in extreme water sports as thrillseekers take it to the next level . Taking off: This action shot was taken at Estavayer-le-Lac in Switzerland where the latest water sports craze of Jet Surfing has taken off . Futuristic: The jet-surfing looks like Marty McFly's famous hoverboard from the Back to the Future series, although Michael J Fox's character was unable to get across the water with his board . But unlike in the 1985 classic, this Jet Surf board, made in the Czeck Republic, is designed for travelling across water - and is so powerful it can help propel riders into the air off waves or the wake from passing boats. Jet surf boards have a top speed of 33mph and weigh just 15kg. Its makers say the sport is easy to master and that the boards are nimble and responsive. It is equipped with a specially-designed two-stroke engine which uses up to two litres of fuel an hour depending on the model and conditions. Extreme: Jet surf boards have a top speed of 33mph and weigh just 15kg. Its makers say the sport is easy to master and that the boards are nimble and responsive . A bit more traditional: The surfers can get down to the water if they fancy something a little more sedate . The risks and dangers are minimal mainly because of the light weight design and the auto cut-out feature which stops the engine as soon as the rider lets go of the handle, according to a spokesman . A spokesman from the company, said: 'The experience of Jet surfing is exactly what it sounds like - surfing with jet power. 'It's a massive adrenaline rush to accelerate on a board which, in terms of the power to weight ratio and the lack of friction, is one of the most powerful craft of any type in the world. 'Jet surfing can transform a calm body of water into a surfer's playground. Wave power: Surfers are still recommended to surf while wearing a helmet and life vests . It is equipped with a specially-designed two-stroke engine which uses up to two litres of fuel an hour depending on the model and conditions . 'If there is some wake from a boat or a choppy surface then it's full of kickers and jumps where riders can get some serious air, allowing big grabs, tweaks, method airs and even back flips.' Jet surfing is less risky and dangerous than other extreme sports, according to the company. The spokesman said: 'The risks and dangers are minimal mainly because of the light weight design and the auto cut-out feature which stops the engine as soon as the rider lets go of the handle. 'Obviously, we recommend surfers ride within their limits and wear life vests and helmets, also to stay aware of prevailing water conditions and respect other water users.'","Motorised surfboards weigh just 15kg and travel at speeds of up to 33mph .

"Ashley Young is desperate to avoid being part of the first United team to lose five successive Manchester derbies. United have more silverware in their trophy cabinet, but City have had the better of their local rivals during the last couple of years. Last November's 1-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium was the fourth successive derby win for City. The last time they achieved that feat was 60 years ago. Ashley Young (right) wants to avoid a fifth successive derby defeat by neighbours Manchester City . Ander Herrera celebrates scoring as United move above City for the first time this season . United have lost the last four derbies to City: . 8 April 2013         United 1-2 City . 22 Sept 2013       City 4-1 United . 25 March 2014    United 0-3 City . 2 Nov 2014          City 1-0 United . United have never lost five straight matches to their local rivals and Young wants to end City's dominance this weekend when the Blues come to Old Trafford. 'That's something you want to put right,' the United winger said when asked about City's recent dominance in this fixture. 'It will be another massive game.' Despite City's recent success in derbies, United go into the match as favourites after registering five straight league wins. That run has helped United move into third, one point ahead of City, who slipped to their third defeat in five games at Crystal Palace on Monday. The champions defeat by Crystal Palace was Manchester City's third loss in five games . Young thinks United have a good chance of defeating the Barclays Premier League champions if they maintain their current form. He said: 'We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, and add to that, it's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points. 'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play.' Finishing above City would represent a major coup for manager Louis van Gaal, especially after the way his team started the season. But, wary of the fact that seven matches remain, Young is not letting himself get too carried away despite United's recent upturn in form. Sergio Aguero (right) celebrates after scoring the winner in the last Manchester derby in November 2014 . 'It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes,' the 29-year-old said. 'It is obviously going to be another tough one against City next week but we will prepare as well as we can do as we always do.' Young's form has been key to United's recovery. The former Aston Villa midfielder has been so good recently that he has kept record signing Angel di Maria out of the United team. That has not been enough to get him back into the England squad though. Many tipped Young to earn an England recall after 19 months in the wilderness, but manager Roy Hodgson left him out of his squad to face Lithuania and Italy. Young is hoping his revival at Old Trafford can force him back into England reckoning . Young revealed Hodgson did not call him to explain his absence from the 24-man party when it was announced. 'There was no conversation (with Hodgson),' said Young, whose last England cap came against Ukraine in September 2013. 'Obviously I will always want to represent my country. I was a little bit disappointed not to be in the squad, but I have just got to make sure I am playing well here at United and hopefully I will get the call at some time soon.'","Manchester United have lost the last four derbies to Manchester City .

"A population of wild wood bison were successfully reintroduced to the United States to freely roam the plains of Alaska for the first time in over a century. The moment was captured on video and shows Alaska Department of Fish and Game Biologist Tom Seaton leading 100 wood bison to freedom on a snowmobile. The land mammals were freed from a temporary pen, where they had been kept for just over a week during the transition, and followed Mr Seaton to their new home. They journeyed for a distance of about a mile and crossed the Innoko River before reaching the grass meadows of Lower Innoko, which is surrounded by the Yukon River. Wood bison are North America’s largest land mammal, but the native Alaskan species disappeared from the state more than 100 years ago. In the video the animals can be seen chasing after the snowmobile in a herd from within side a fenced track. Wood bison were imported from Canada to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center in 2008 but restoration of the threatened species was delayed. The population of wild wood bison were successfully reintroduced to the United States for first time in over a century . Alaska Department of Fish and Game Biologist Tom Seaton lead 100 wood bison to freedom on a snowmobile . Landowners didn't want their property listed as critical habitat with additional federal oversight. The state and federal governments agreed to consider the Alaska wood bison as 'experimental' without the usual Endangered Species Act requirements. With the help of corporate and non-profit sponsors, the department moved 50 cows and 50 juveniles aged two or less to the village. But the task was not without its risks as the large mammals were vulnerable to broken limbs, or if they fell, trampling. Two wood bison bulls photographed grazing at the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center in Portage, Alaska . Wood bison cows resting and grazing at the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center  in Portage, Alaska . Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologist Cathie Harms, said: ‘When you're transporting a very large, not completely domesticated animal, you always have to worry about injuries.’ To minimize jostling in the cargo plane the juveniles were transported in small groups within special bison boxes. Cows had individual pens, which provided them with enough room to stand for the one-hour drive from the conservation centre to Anchorage and a one-hour flight to the village. Once arrived, the bison moved on their own from the boxes to the snow-covered fields in a fenced area outside Shageluk. The land mammals chased after the snowmobile, which dropped alfalfa cubes, in a herd from within side a fenced track . The wood bison journeyed for a distance of about a mile and crossed the Innoko River before reaching the grass meadows of Lower Innoko . Ms Harms said: ‘Some of them trotted out, some of them galloped out. Some of them made it all the way to the opposite end of the pen, as far away from people as they could get. ‘Some of them stopped 15 feet from the box and started eating hay.’ Over the next seven to 14 days the bison were moved on a daily basis from one pen to another to keep them from settling into one place. Before the snowmobile coaxed them with alfalfa cubes and led them to their new permanent location, which should start producing an abundance of sedge – one of the bison’s natural foods – once the snow melts. Like we never left! The bison arrive at their new home, which will have sedge for them to feed on once the snow melts .","Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologist delivered the animals .

"Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic are on another collision course in Miami after the Serbian beat David Ferrer to reach the semi-finals of the Miami Open. With Murray set to face Tomas Berdych in his semi-final, the man who beat him to the Australian Open and then again in the semis of Indian Wells secured his own last-four spot with a 7-5 7-5 success. Ferrer made a fast start taking the opening three matches as he dominated the world number one, but he was unable to keep the pace and was eventually hunted down on his 33rd birthday. Novak Djokovic celebrates reaching the Miami Open semi-finals after his 7-5, 7-5 success over David Ferrer .

'I wasn't feeling the ball that great at the beginning, but I knew that I'm going to have my chances if I stayed committed, if I kept on working,' Djokovic - looking an unbreakable force this season - said on the tournament's official website. 'But I had to earn my points. I had to fight for everything that I got tonight on the court, because he wasn't going to give it to me. I knew that coming onto the court. 'I knew that he's a great competitor, that he grinds a lot, runs, and makes you play always an extra shot. That's why he's been top-10 player for so many years and he's tough to beat.' John Isner is up next for Djokovic after the American made it back-to-back wins over top-10 opponents. Hot on the heels of Tuesday's gruelling three-set triumph over Milos Raonic, the world number 24 had a more straight forward evening against fourth seed Kei Nishikori, winning 6-4 6-3.

Serena Williams and Carla Suarez Navarro will contest the women's final after they both came through their semis on Thursday. Fresh from her 700th career success on Wednesday, world number one Williams saw off Indian Wells champion Simona Halep 6-2 4-6 7-5. Halep - who has won more games than anyone on tour this year - was broken twice in the first set but found a way to combat Williams in the second, attacking her forehand and drawing 37 errors on it but, after winning the second set, she lost her serve in what proved to be the final game of the decider.

'I hit more errors than I did in my last match, which I thought was impossible,' Williams told the tournament's official website. 'I'm just not at my best level right now which is a little frustrating.' Williams has held top spot in the rankings for 110 weeks, though, and knows what improvements she has to make. 'I feel like the match was on my racquet and I really had opportunities in the second. I just didn't take them,' Williams added. 'That is something I can't do going into the grand slams coming up.'

"The Irish challenge for next week’s £1million Crabbie’s Grand National looks like being eight strong after trainer Robbie Hennessy confirmed Rubi Light a definite runner.

Rubi Light had the option of running Friday’s shorter Topham Chase but Hennessy said: ‘He is going to run. There is only one National. One of his runs over three miles was when he was second in the Lexus Chase to Synchronised and he went on to win the Gold Cup that season. Irish trainer Robbie Hennessy confirmed Rubi Light is a definite runner in the Grand National . ‘Rubi Light is not as fast as he used to be but his jumping has been fantastic this year and he is in great form.’ The Irish challenge also includes Jim Culloty’s Lord Windermere (Robbie McNamara) and Spring Heeled (Nick Scholfield), Willie Mullins-trained Ballycasey (Ruby Walsh), Mouse Morris’s First Lieutenant (Nina Carberry) and Gordon Elliott’s Cause Of Causes (Paul Carberry). On Saturday Maurice Phelan confirmed Portrait King (Davy Condon) an intended starter while Peter Fahey said Owega Star (Robert Power) also runs.

But Nicholls denied he had deliberately identified the opportunity to put Bowen up. The trainer said: ‘I am not thinking about the Grand National, just that Virak has top weight and I am taking five pounds off.

"Trainer Paul Webber was on Sunday praying the ground at Fairyhouse dries out further for Cantlow, who will attempt to give AP McCoy a glorious send off in Ireland with a second victory in Easter Monday's Irish Grand National. The 19-time champion won the 2007 running on Butler’s Cabin and success aboard Cantlow would be a fairytale start to what could be McCoy’s final week as a jockey. He has vowed to immediately retire if he wins Saturday’s Crabbie’s Grand National at Aintree on favourite Shutthefrontdoor, the gelding which won last year’s Irish National under Barry Geraghty. AP McCoy will attempt to win the Irish Grand National on Cantlow in his final race meeting in Ireland . That Cantlow disputes favouritism for Monday's race is largely due to the presence of McCoy on his back. The champion jockey could have ridden Alderwood or If In Doubt, who both also carry the colours of his boss JP McManus. Cantlow’s form this season is not inspiring but he finished a creditable eighth in last year’s race when asked to carry top weight – only three of the last 20 winners have carried more than 11st - and Webber has identified a reason why the 10-year-old pulled up quickly at Kempton on his latest run. The trainer said: ‘He choked at Kempton when he looked to be about to run a decent race on slightly better ground which would have helped. We have never had a breathing problem before with him. Cantlow disputes favouritism for Monday's race largely due to the presence of McCoy on his back . ‘He has worked well with tongue tie twice since with AP on board. I hope it dries up a bit, it is soft to heavy which wouldn’t help. ‘He ran blinder last year and it is an almost impossible race to win off top weight.’ McCoy had a double at the track on Sunday, which included a typically determined success on Enda Bolger-trained Gilgamboa in the Grade One Ryanair Gold Cup, which looked unlikely jumping the second last. Bitofapuzzle (Noel Fehily) gave trainer Harry Fry a first grade one win of his career in the EBF Mares’ Novice Hurdle Championship Final.

"Mark McCall believes neutral territory offers Saracens hope of toppling mighty Clermont to reach a second successive European final. Marcelo Bosch landed a long-range penalty in the final act of Sunday's showdown with Racing Metro to clinch a 12-11 victory that has set up a last-four trip to St Etienne's Stade Geoffroy-Guichard on April 18. Awaiting in the Champions Cup semi-finals are Clermont, who are bristling with confidence after their remarkable 37-5 rout of runaway Aviva Premiership leaders Northampton. Marcelo Bosch launches a long range penalty towards the posts with the final act of Saracens' quarter-final . The Argentinian centre is then mobbed by his team-mates after landing the match-winning kick . However, McCall believes that facing Clermont outside of their Stade Marcel-Michelin stronghold, where they have not lost in Europe since 2008, is a different proposition. 'Given Clermont's home record, it's bit of a relief to be playing them on neutral territory. We're still going to France, but it's not quite the same as going to their own ground,' McCall said. Saracens' prospects against the Top 14's second-placed team are likely to be improved by the return of centre Brad Barritt from an ankle injury, while there is an outside chance fly-half Owen Farrell could recover from his knee problem in time. 'We have some pretty tough fixtures coming up - Leicester next Saturday is a massive game for us and after Clermont we have Northampton in the Premiership,' McCall said. 'We have some players coming back and will have to spread the load during this period. Brad should be back for the Champions Cup semi-final, Owen is touch and go.' Northampton's players look shell-shocked after they were demolished by Clermont Auvergne . Saracens hardly sent shockwaves across the continent after dispatching Racing in an arm wrestle decided by Bosch's nerveless penalty, but McCall insists the result is all that matters. 'Sometimes the games are the way they are and we mustn't over analyse these things,' McCall said. 'We've come away to France and played a big, strong, very good team with outstanding half-backs, but we've won. 'We shouldn't worry too much about how we won, but just that we won and reached our third consecutive semi-final in this tough competition. That says a lot about the players we have. 'When you look at Ronan O'Gara at Munster and Jonny Sexton at Leinster, they lost quarters and semis over the years before they started winning them. Mark McCall watches on as Charlie Hodgson warms up before Sunday's dramatic European win . 'We lost the quarter to Clermont four years ago and the semis to Toulon two years ago, and you saw out there that Racing didn't really know how to win the game. 'They had this big strong wind they didn't use because of the pressure they were under, and that was down to our team.' Racing's Jamie Roberts expects to end speculation over his future this week with the British and Irish Lions centre likely to sign a dual contract in Wales. 'Hopefully it will be sorted this week. I don't want to say anything until it's sorted,' Roberts said.","Saracens through to Champions Cup semi-final after beating Racing Metro .

Utility back Saili, who made his All Blacks debut against Argentina in 2013, will move to the province later this year after the completion of his 2015 contractual commitments. The 24-year-old currently plays for Auckland-based Super Rugby side the Blues and was part of the New Zealand Under-20 side that won the Junior World Championship in Italy in 2011. Saili's signature is something of a coup for Munster and head coach Anthony Foley believes he will be a great addition to their backline.

"England star Anthony Watson believes the pain of Bath's European Champions Cup exit can be a driving force in their push to make this season's Aviva Premiership play-offs. Watson and company were left to reflect on what might have been at Dublin's Aviva Stadium as six Ian Madigan penalties gave three-time European champions Leinster a tense 18-15 quarter-final success. Bath dominated for large parts of the second period and claimed tries through fly-half George Ford and captain Stuart Hooper, but hopes of reaching a first top-flight European semi-final since 2006 floundered on their indiscipline. Anthony Watson carries during an impressive Bath performance, but the English side came up short . Attention will now quickly return to the Premiership, with Bath having four games left - against Newcastle, London Irish, Harlequins and Gloucester - in the quest for a top-four finish. 'The overriding emotion is that we are absolutely disappointed,' said Bath full-back Watson, whose counter-attacking brilliance was repeatedly showcased against an often stretched Leinster defence. 'To have battled out of the group as we did (Bath lost their first two games) and then obviously to get into the quarter-final, to get so close and then fail at the end, it is obviously massively disappointing. 'But we have to try to take the positives, and I think a disappointment like this is going to help us in the Premiership.' Bath stayed true to the ball-in-hand attacking principles that have lit up much of this season's Premiership campaign, and at times, Leinster struggled to cope. Ian Madigan was perfect from the tee to hand Leinster the victory in a game where they were second best . In Madigan, though, they had a relentless marksman, whose 100 per cent goalkicking return ultimately sent Leinster marching on and Bath left to focus solely on domestic matters. 'To put on an attacking performance and go through the phases like we did against a quality side like Leinster is just going to add more confidence,' Watson added. 'I think the way we have been playing this year has been a revelation to be a part of, and I have really enjoyed playing for this club. 'I think the progress we have made throughout the year has been awesome. I think the ethos and everything we are building at the club is going in the right direction.' Watson, meanwhile, paid tribute to his Bath and England team-mate Ford, who scored a brilliant solo try and made a darting break that set up Hooper for a second-half touchdown that meant the visitors were always in sight of their opponents on the scoreboard. It was a huge disappointment for Bath, but Watson hopes they can channel the pain to their league campaign . 'I cannot speak highly enough of him (Ford), to be honest,' Watson said. 'He is probably the best ball player I've played with, albeit in a short space of time of two or three years. 'He has got a very mature head on young shoulders, and it's a real privilege to play outside him.' Bath head coach Mike Ford could not mask his disappointment with the result, believing his team paid the price for an opening 40 minutes when they struggled for fluency and kept giving Madigan scoring chances. 'There is a lot of disappointment,' Ford said. 'The first-half performance, especially, we are a lot better than that. 'That last 10-15 minutes, I was pretty convinced we were going to win the game, but it's small margins. George Ford scored one try and created anotehr in a superb performance, but it wasn't enough . 'At half-time, we talked about composure. 'We hadn't been able to build any pressure with ball in hand, and there was also the discipline side of things. Madigan was pretty dead-eye, which cost us. 'We put it together second-half, and I think this will make us stronger. We will look back at the end of the season at this game, particularly, and say this is where Bath became very strong. 'I thought Anthony Watson was on fire at full-back, and George made two good breaks for our tries. It was in our control, we thought. Even at 15-5 down, we were confident we could win the game.' And Bath skipper Hooper said: 'When you get to this stage of the competition, it is about winning. 'The disappointment is two-fold. One is obviously losing the game and the other is probably the individual mistakes we made, particularly in the first half.'","Bath dominated Champions Cup quarter final against Leinster .

"Tiger Woods says the Par-3 Contest is all about 'having fun, enjoying it and not winning'.

"Jack Grealish has a message for Premier League referees: you can keep telling me to pull my socks up but there's no chance of me listening. The Aston Villa teenager is renowned for keeping his stockings just above the roll of his shinpads. And Grealish says, due to superstition, that he'll carry on that way after making his first Premier League start on Tuesday night. Jack Grealish is renowned for wearing his socks low when he takes to the field for Aston Villa . The Ireland Under 21 international wears children's shinpads - and says isn't about to change . 'It's a superstition that I've done all my life and I'm going to keep it that way,' Grealish told the BBC. He appears not to wear shinpads on first glance, but does in fact use a children's size. 'A few referees have tried telling me but I've got to keep it like that,' Grealish added. 'I haven't had a kick on my shin yet and hopefully not any time soon.' His first league start for the club came in the pulsating 3-3 draw against QPR on Tuesday, but the Republic of Ireland Under 21 international was glad to get it out of the way. Grealish was pleased to have finally made his first Premier League start for Villa against QPR . 'It was a bit of a tough game to get my first start, in a big relegation scrap, but I'm pleased even if I'm not happy about how the game ended up,' he added. 'I try and see it as any other football match but it's nice that the gaffer has got that faith in me and hopefully I can try to get a few more starts before the end of the season. 'He said I deserve my start which is nice to hear and it really gives me a bit of a boost.'","Aston Villa's Jack Grealish earned first Premier League start this week .

"Tim Bresnan insists a good start to the domestic season with LV= County Championship holders Yorkshire could help him make a case for an England Test recall. Bresnan last played in the England whites during the 5-0 Ashes defeat in the winter of 2013/14, though in recent months he enjoyed a pre-World Cup training session with the squad in Australia and also turned out for the England Lions on their tour of South Africa. More importantly perhaps, the double Ashes-winner helped end Yorkshire's 13-year wait for a title last season, taking 30 wickets in 10 games at an average of 31.57 and making 95 against Nottinghamshire on the day the championship was clinched. Tim Bresnan is keen to give England's selectors no choice but to pick him with wickets and runs for Yorkshire . The right-arm quick last played in whites for England during the Ashes whitewash of winter 2013/14 . With New Zealand and Australia still to come this year, the Headingley faithful's belief of 'strong Yorkshire, strong England' is already showing good signs with six White Rose players currently on tour in the West Indies. Bresnan says: 'The only thing I can do is get runs and take wickets for Yorkshire' And when asked if he would like to make it number seven, Bresnan said, 'That's up to the selectors.' 'If I do get a load of wickets at the start of the season and get a few runs then I put my case forward, that's all I can do - then it's up to the selectors. 'Obviously, the only thing I can do is get runs and take wickets for Yorkshire. 'That's what I'm looking to do. Whatever happens after that we'll just let it play out. 'We're defending champions, so we're going to do our utmost to defend the title. 'If we play the consistent cricket we did last year - which we are capable of - we'll be there and thereabouts again.' Bresnan did take a step towards that good start on Wednesday, when he reached 400 first-class wickets during Yorkshire's game against Leeds-Bradford MCCU at Headingley. But regardless of his own selection, Bresnan is confident England can put in a good showing against New Zealand and Australia after a turbulent year that also included an early World Cup exit. 'I think we'll do well,' Bresnan said. 'I think they've got all the talent. Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale celebrates as Yorkshire beat Notts to win the 2014 LV County Championship . Yorkshire go to Worcestershire on Apil 14 for the first match of their four-day title defence . 'They just need to start implementing it, start applying that talent and playing good attacking cricket. They are very capable of doing it.' Bresnan did express his disappointment at England's tour matches against St Kitts and Nevis, where some of the Three Lions side have padded up for the hosts in a bid to give the bowlers a higher-quality challenge. 'Obviously, they've tried to make the best of a bad situation,' he said. 'It's very difficult when you go on tour and you don't get decent opposition to practice games. 'But at the end of the day there's nothing England can do about it.'","Tim Bresnan pushing for Test recall as LV= County Championship begins .

"Stuart Broad came through an injury scare and Jonny Bairstow fell just short of a century against his own team-mates as England's Test warm-ups descended into a glorified training drill. Events at Lord's, where the decision was made to cull England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton, seemed rather more relevant to the future of English cricket than the mix-and-match day at Warner Park, where four members of the touring party were parachuted in to bolster the local team. Jonathan Trott (nought) and Gary Ballance (17) largely failed to do so, but Bairstow made 98 and Joe Root ended the day 87 not out in a score of 303 for nine. England paceman Stuart Broad (left) bowls at Jonny Bairstow on Wednesday . It seemed entirely in keeping with the unsatisfactory nature of England's Test preparation week that Bairstow, the only member of the seconded quarter not likely to feature in the series, had the most productive day. At least Broad averted serious injury when he collapsed clutching his left ankle in the second over. Broad initially looked in trouble when his boot slid through the crease and he tumbled to the ground, and coach Peter Moores was concerned enough to stride out to the middle to assess the damage. But he spent just short of an hour off the field with an ice pack and later returned to the attack. Broad required lengthy treatment on the pitch after clutching his left ankle following his fall . Broad was concerned enough about the run-ups to summon the groundstaff the ball before coming to grief. He initially suggested bowling round the wicket in search of firmer footing but decided to go back to his original angle of attack after sawdust was applied. When he went down the game was just 10 balls old - the same number of deliveries that were possible in the infamous abandoned Test in Antigua six years ago. By that stage, the first of England's honorary Kittitians had already come and gone. England captain Alastair Cook (right) watches on as ground staff make running repairs to the crease . Trott opened the batting but lasted just three balls, guiding James Anderson straight to James Tredwell at third slip. That was hardly the added steel England were looking for. The same was largely true of Ballance, who seems short of his best after a troubled World Cup, and managed only 17 before an ill-judged cut against Tredwell ended up in Jos Buttler's gloves. Ben Stokes had earlier ripped out Shane Jeffers' middle stump and Tredwell had Sherwin Peters lbw offering no stroke. Bairstow, whose likely Test role is as Buttler's back-up, reached lunch on 33 not out in a score of 55 for four. Bairstow fell just short of a century against England on Wednesday . He continued to score briskly in the afternoon and was just two short of a ton when Stokes found his outside edge to have him caught behind. The game lacked all semblance of competitive edge, even as Root compiled a trouble-free half-century of his own, but there were some possible pointers ahead the first Test in Antigua. James Tredwell clearly outbowled Adil Rashid in the race for the spinner's role and Chris Jordan failed to take a wicket despite seeing plenty of the ball. He came into this game in pole position but could fall behind Liam Plunkett or Mark Wood, who will open the bowling for St Kitts & Nevis on Thursday morning. Jonathan Trott opened the batting St Kitts & Nevis but lasted just three balls . Bairstow gave little away about dressing room reaction to Downton's departure, partly because he was ready to go out and bat as the news was delivered in the lunch interval. 'We just found out at lunch,. No-one said anything, it was straight back out and get on with our job out here in St Kitts,' he said. 'I don't know what the role entails or anything like that, it's a decision that's taken above us...I don't know what the job description is. 'It's our job out here to get on with the task at hand and win a series for England.'","England's Stuart Broad collapsed clutching his left ankle in second over .

"Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has revealed he wants to bring in extra investment so the club can improve their Selhurst Park home. The Premier League side, who beat champions Manchester City 2-1 on Monday night, have been reportedly targeted for a takeover by Josh Harris - an American businessman who already owns the Philadelphia 76ers NBA team and the NHL outfit the New Jersey Devils. But Parish, who has been at Palace since he and his consortium saved the club from the brink of financial collapse in 2010, has since insisted he would remain involved and that investment rather than a complete takeover was his preferred option. Jason Puncheon scored a second-half free kick as Crystal Palace beat Manchester City 2-1 on Monday . Palace chairman Steve Parish says Alan Pardew will have funds to improve the squad in the summer . And now he has given his reasons for why he believes extra funds are required, insisting the current set-up would allow manager Alan Pardew to bring in the desired summer transfer targets but that other areas require more investment. 'The only reason for us to get money in is to improve the infrastructure,' he told BBC London. 'There is no rush and we are in a good place. If it happens, it happens. We've done well enough that I think we can fund the player things we need to do out of our own resources. 'We are long overdue some ground improvements. They are very costly. We need to make sure we get that done. If that means bringing in other people, and they are the right people, then we'll do it.' Parish would, however, like investment in the club to carry out improvements at Selhurst Park . The CPFC2010 consortium took over with the Eagles having only just survived relegation from the Championship and, in under five years, have overseen a return to top-flight football. They finished last season in 11th place, ensuring for the first time that their stay in the Premier League would last longer than a solitary campaign. Pardew has guided them to the same position after being appointed at the turn of the year and Monday night's victory over City all-but guarantees a third Premier League season. Glenn Murray and Jason Puncheon had put Palace two goals up against the visitors, who could only find a consolation goal through Yaya Toure. Puncheon applauds the Manchester City supporters after a missile was thrown from the stands . Puncheon was also the target of a number of items thrown onto the pitch from the area housing Man City's supporters as he prepared to take a second-half corner. The Football Association are aware of the incident and will take appropriate action once they have their findings. It is not the first case of items being thrown onto the pitch at Selhurst Park this season, with Newcastle defender Fabricio Coloccini struck by a coin thrown as he celebrated a goal for his side. Just days later another item was thrown onto the playing area in the FA Cup meeting with Liverpool and Palace threatened to ban for life anyone found guilty of such acts.","Crystal Palace beat Manchester City 2-1 at Selhurst Park on Monday night .

"Jack Grealish wants to replace the Wembley misery he suffered as a fan with joy as a player when Aston Villa face Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final. Twice the teenage winger visited the national stadium to cheer on his boyhood club in 2010 but Villa lost both times, to Manchester United in the League Cup final and Chelsea in the FA Cup final four. Grealish, 19, was handed his first Premier League start by Tim Sherwood in the 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers and is hopeful of retaining his place for the April 19 date. Jack Grealish made his first Premier League start for Aston Villa against QPR on Tuesday night . Grealish saw Villa lose twice at Wembley in 2010 - in the League Cup final and in the FA Cup semi-final . ‘I went twice to Wembley as a fan, the Man U game and Chelsea game five years ago,’ said Grealish. ‘Unfortunately we didn’t win either of them, hopefully this time we can go and get a result. ‘It would be brilliant to stay in the team for Wembley but at the end of the day the gaffer will pick who he thinks he will win.

You can see what he did at Tottenham with the young lads, bringing them through. Grealish expressed his gratitude towards manager Tim Sherwood for giving him his first start . ‘Here he’s brought the younger lads to come and train next to the first team, which is so little but means so much.’ The return to form of Christian Benteke also inspires survival hope. ‘Yes, when you have Christian in the team who can score goals every game,’ Grealish said. ‘We are going to go in Saturday's game (at Tottenham) positive and 100 per cent we will stay up.’","Aston Villa take on Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final on April 19 .

"It was not particularly pretty but Andy King’s 86th minute winner has kept Leicester City’s hopes of Premier League survival alive, at least for now. There was a frantic sense of do or die in the closing stages at the King Power stadium. Pearson and his players surely knew anything less than three points against West Ham, a side who have not won away from home since December 2nd, would see them doomed to relegation. At the final whistle, the players went to all four corners of the stadium to applaud their fans. Just four points behind Sunderland with six of their eight remaining games to be played at home, it is very much game on for Foxes. Andy King was the hero as Premier League strugglers Leicester City struck late to earn a vital three points against West Ham United . Leicester City hero King is joined by veteran striker David Nugent following the Welsh midfielder's late winner against West Ham United . Seasoned professional Nugent had the chance to all but secure Leicester City victory but the striker missed from the spot . Nugent saw his penalty kick thwarted by West Ham United's Spanish goalkeeper Adrian during the Premier League clash at the King Power . It was eyeballs out, quickfire action from the 80th minute. The Hammers had a flurry of chances with Schmeichel forced into two good saves and at the other end Aaron Cresswell made a miraculous block on the line to deny a Andrej Kramaric effort. But substitute Kramaric supplied Jamie Vardy whose scuffed shot was tapped in by King from two yards out. Pearson and his opposite number Sam Allardyce embraced and shared a raucous laugh before kick-off. Both are somewhat relieved of pressure. Nugent rues his missed opportunity as the former England international is denied a goal for relegation threatened Leicester City . West Ham United instantly punish the Foxes as Senegalese international Cheikhou Kouyate  scores their past Kasper Schmeichel .

West Ham United's Senegalese international Kouyate  celebrates after scoring to make it 1-1 while Wes Morgan appeals to the linesman . Leicester City take the lead via a spectacular effort from footballing legend Esteban Cambiasso at the King Power Stadium on Saturday . Cambiasso celebrates after scoring to make it 1-0 during the Premier League match between Leicester City and West Ham United . West Ham have had their Premier League survival all but assured since before Christmas and it appears even securing a finish outside of the Premier League’s bottom six for a third successive season – a feat not achieved since the last century – cannot win Allardyce a new contract. Meanwhile nobody realistically expected Leicester to escape their current predicament at the foot of the Barclay’s Premier League and seven points from safety before this game. If they do it will represent a remarkable turnaround in results. The message pre-match from Pearson and midfielder Jamie Vardy was that if they could recapture the spirit they showed in a 4-3 defeat against Leicester a fortnight ago they would overcome the Hammers. In starting the consistently lively Riyad Mahrez, an attacking intent was demonstrated and the home side were lively from the start. James Collins, the 31-year-old Welshman, made several important clearances in the first ten minutes for West Ham and the travelling fans responded with a chorus of ‘he’s the ginger Pele.’ But it was as he retreated to goal that the ball ricocheted off his back and into the path of Esteban Cambiasso who cooly put Leicester ahead after 12 minutes. The ball bounced kindly for the Argentinian whose sublime right footed strike just outside the D sailed in. As his teammates rushed to celebrate, he showed a wise head by urging them to get back into position. Cambiasso slides to his knees as he celebrates in front of the Leicester City fans following his opener for the relegation threatened Foxes . Leonardo Ulloa  draws a foul from Carl Jenkinson  during the Barclays Premier league match Leicester City and West Ham United . Moments later referee Mark Clattenburg made the right decision to award the home side a penalty after Carl Jenkinson brought down Leonardo Ulloa. But David Nugent's effort from the spot was woeful, low, right down the middle and easily saved by Adrian. They were left to rue the missed opportunity when the Hammers pulled one back in the 32nd minute. Alex Song sent a floating ball into he box which soared over the head Jeffrey Schupp and was controlled by Cheikou Kouyate, the Senegalese firing low and powerfully into the bottom left corner past a helpless Kasper Schmeichel. Kouyate was close to doubling his goal tally in the 73rd minute, his shot from Sakho’s lay off hitting the post. Meanwhile Vardy had two good chances in as many minutes. In a thrilling display of end-to-end action both sides demonstrated the best of their attacking wares and some rather poor defending too but ultimately Leicester deserved to come out on top.

"Paul McShane has told his Hull team-mates it’s time they woke up and realised they are in a relegation battle. It might have been handy if someone had shared the message before they got off their bus in Swansea on Saturday. If Hull do go down, and their final fixtures suggest it is a distinct possibility, then this will be among the missed opportunities they regret the most. What a curious sight to see Steve Bruce’s players so lethargic, disinterested almost, in the first half against a side with nothing tangible to play for. Paul McShane scores against Swansea but Hull still fell to a 3-1 defeat at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Hull defender McShane is keeping faith that the Tigers will avoid relegation despite a tough run of games . Hull have only scored twice in their last six away games in the league. Stranger still when you consider their final seven games include fixtures against Southampton, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United. They didn’t manage a shot on target until they were two goals behind and, as they did against Chelsea a fortnight ago, they waited until the game was almost out of sight before stringing a few passes together. That won’t cut it on this run-in and McShane, whose goal briefly had Hull in the game at 2-1, knows it. He said: ‘It’s like we need to go 2-0 down to get going and that’s not great from our point of view. Bafetimbi Gomis lifts the ball over Hull goalkeeper Allan McGregor to seal a 3-1 victory for Swansea . Gomis celebrates his second goal of the afternoon to push Hull close towards the relegation zone . ‘The situation is worrying. It’s always worrying when you are down there because there are always twists and turns in the last few weeks. ‘This has got to be a massive wake-up call because it’s all right when you are a few places above the relegation zone but you look at the points difference and it’s nothing really, a weekend can change it. ‘We are definitely bang in it. It’s always the same, every year there are teams that put runs together and others who get dragged into it. Gomis unleashed a thunderous overhead kick before half-time to capitalise on some poor Hull defending . David Meyler's red card left Hull in a difficult position, when they were threatening to get back into it . ‘We have to realise that we are fighting for every point. We need to sort it out.’ Ki Sung-Yueng put Swansea ahead and Bafetimbi Gomis scored a brilliant bicycle kick for 2-0. McShane got Hull back in the game before David Meyler was sent off and Gomis finished the job in stoppage time. The Frenchman has now scored eight times this season but it remains to be seen if he stays beyond the summer following his agitations for a move in January. Garry Monk said: ‘We cannot afford to lose any quality players and Bafe is a quality player. We are only looking to add which we have to do if we want to do well next season.’","Hull lost 3-1 to Swansea to slip towards relegation zone .

"Haris Vuckic admits he does not know where he will be playing next season - but believes Rangers would be a 'good option' if Newcastle let him leave. The St James' Park youngster was one of five loanees sent to Glasgow by the Magpies on the final day of the January transfer window.

He still has another 12 months on his deal with the Barclays Premier League club and owner Mike Ashley is certain to play hard-ball with Rangers if they try to sign him early after his recent boardroom battle with Dave King. But if a deal can be done, Vuckic would be happy to talk. He said: 'It's not true that I'm going to quit Newcastle and stay at Ibrox. What I have always said that I respect both clubs - Newcastle because I still have a contract with them and Rangers because I have a loan deal here. Vuckic has won over Rangers fans with six goals from 10 games, including this strike against Hearts . 'We will see what is going to happen in the summer but Newcastle have to say what options I have. 'I will choose the best one for me. 'If Newcastle let me go, would I like to stay at Rangers? That would be a good option for me. 'At Newcastle, I didn't have the chance to play first-team football.

'I like the feel of Rangers. Every player doesn't want to just train on the training ground, they want to be recognised in the games and score goals. They want to be recognised in the city.

James Ward-Prowse had just led England Under 21s to a thrilling 3-2 victory over Germany, scoring the winner after a remarkable 34-pass move. That should have guaranteed he would be besieged by well-wishers on his way to the team bus but, on this occasion, serenity reigned. ‘I enjoy signing autographs and giving something back to the fans,’ said Ward-Prowse with a smile, ‘but it was dead! There wasn’t a soul around! It was wet and windy, so everyone decided to go home.’ James Ward-Prowse is beginning to get noticed after starring displays for England U 21s and Southampton . The Saints rising star was speaking in an interview with Sportsmail's Dominic King (left) Ward-Prowse poses with the ball outside of Southampton's impressive Marchwood training ground . The quiet life suits Ward-Prowse. He started at Southampton trying not to be noticed — he and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain used to travel on the same train from Portsmouth to the academy hiding their club tracksuits — and has been happy making progress away from the public gaze. The thing is, though, his situation is beginning to change. More and more people are becoming aware of this talented young midfielder who can bend free-kicks like David Beckham, but he is now ready for the journey to begin. From the moment he sits down at Southampton’s Marchwood training ground, the impressive facility on the edge of the New Forest, it is clear that the buzz he got from sinking Germany has not yet subsided. ‘I couldn’t sleep afterwards,’ said Ward-Prowse. ‘I was up until 4am. The rush of adrenaline was unbelievable. I just kept running through the goal in my mind and the celebration with the lads. I was lying down but I just couldn’t shut my eyes. ‘I decided to stay up in Middlesbrough as I thought I would get a good sleep before flying back down here but there was no chance of that. As soon as I saw the goal had been tweeted I was watching it and reliving it. It was surreal, something every kid dreams of doing.’ Ward-Prowse scored the winner in England U21s memorable 3-2 victory over Germany . The 20-year-old admits not being able to sleep for thinking of his goal on the night after the match . Ward-Prowse celebrates after scoring a stunning free-kick against Brazil in Toulon last year . Not every kid, however, gets the chance to live out their dreams. Ward-Prowse, now 20, is one of five children and grew up a Portsmouth fan until Southampton’s scouts spotted him when he was eight. His father, John, is a barrister but young James had only one ambition. ‘When I was little I’d kick balloons or socks around,’ said Ward-Prowse, whose Saints debut came as a 16-year-old against Crystal Palace in the League Cup in 2011. ‘Dad took me to football but there was never any sense I would follow him. ‘I was taken to my first game at Fratton Park. I was so tiny I just remember sitting on dad’s knee eating sweets! But I made the decision (to switch allegiances) based on my career. I knew this was the right place to be. I’m at a club that trusts you to go out and play.’ His progress has been consistently striking and those who have worked with Ward-Prowse all say the same: he is a professional in every sense, someone who wants to squeeze every last drop out of his ability by doing everything right. ‘The club has changed a lot since I’ve been here but nothing changed for me personally,’ he said. ‘I never want to have regrets. I aim to make sure I have given it my all and that I become the best I can be.’ The former Portsmouth fan makes his debut for Southampton in 2011 Carling Cup match against Palace . The talented midfielder has earned a reputation as a free-kick specialist at St Mary's . Saints boss Ronald Koeman, who could take a mean free-kick himself, has given Ward-Prowse some tips . That involves relentless practice, particularly with set-pieces. Former Saints boss Mauricio Pochettino saw Ward-Prowse’s potential in that area and last summer, representing England in the Toulon Tournament, he scored a free-kick against Brazil that a Brazilian would have been proud of. He has continued to hone his technique at Marchwood and there have been pointers from current manager Ronald Koeman, a man who knows all about producing a telling free-kick when needed. ‘As soon as he was appointed I looked for his goals on YouTube,’ said Ward-Prowse. ‘He could strike a free-kick, couldn’t he? He gives advice on where to put the ball and the mind games you can play with the keeper. ‘I take a bag of balls out on my own. I won’t hit too many as I don’t want muscle fatigue but I read about Steven Gerrard and David Beckham hitting free-kicks after training and that is what I do. They were my childhood heroes. ‘I have tried to follow in their footsteps because that is the level that I want to reach. I put a bib in the corner of the net and try to hit it. My accuracy isn’t too bad. If you are taking 10, you want to be hitting the bib six or seven times. ‘I used to watch all Beckham’s goals on YouTube. There are bits of his technique which I have tried to implement. I also think he is a top role model. I haven’t met him but I’d love to get some advice from him. He is a fantastic guy. ‘I got Gerrard’s shirt. I’ve met him but never had a proper chat. Being up against him on the opening day, I was thinking, “Wow — it’s Steven Gerrard, my boyhood idol”. Those two are tremendous characters, men I will always admire.’ Ward-Prowse’s long-term ambition is to emulate his heroes by captaining England but he also realises that becoming firmly established at Southampton and helping England at this summer’s European Under-21 Championship are the first peaks to conquer. Ward-Prowse practises his free-kicks diligently in the hope of reaching the standard of David Beckham . Beckham takes one of his trademark free-kicks for England against Northern Ireland . The Southampton youngster battles for the ball against childhood idol and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard . At Marchwood it is impossible to escape the feeling that Southampton are going to be in the top flight for some time and the same could be said about Ward-Prowse, who returned from a broken foot earlier this season to sign a five-year deal. ‘It showed the faith the club have in me but also the faith I have in the club,’ he said. ‘They have put a lot of time and effort into making sure I am the person and player I am today. I want to pay that back. It’s a great club to be at.’ With the interview over, a few photographs are required and as the shots are being taken, an eagle-eyed coach has spotted what is going on. ‘F****** hell, Prowesy!’ comes a shout. ‘Scored a goal have you?!’ Ward-Prowse joins in the laughter but moments like this show that he will not be able to hide under the radar for much longer.","James Ward-Prowse scored the winner for England U21s against Germany .

"Tony Pulis believes Joey Barton 'probably had a point' when claiming West Bromwich Albion's players 's*** themselves' during defeat to Queens Park Rangers earlier this season. In December West Brom were two goals up but lost to a Charlie Austin hat-trick, leading to Barton's scathing judgement and plunging Alan Irvine to the brink of the sack. Barton said then: 'West Brom went 2-0 up and I turned to Dunney (Richard Dunne) and said, 'they've scored too early.' They don't know how to get over the finishing line.'

The teams meet again at the Hawthorns on Saturday with Pulis having instilled a solid core to the point Albion have not conceded after scoring first in a game. 'Whatever Joey says or whatever he does he's entitled to hid views and his opinions,' Pulis said. 'The club were 2-0 up and lost 3-2 so he most probably had a point, or he felt he had a point to say something on that subject.' Pulis recalled his own misfortune from leading 2-0 and losing as Gillingham manager in the Second Division play-off final of 1999. 'I've managed teams that have been 2-0 up with only for or five minutes to go and ended up drawing then losing on penalties. 1999 Man City Wembley,' he added. 'So I can't talk about being indestructible in respect to leads. 'We've played really well I don't think they've just been good results. The performances have been really, really good.

"It’s that time of year when the English challenge in Europe fades in the face of overwhelming firepower and the thorny issue of the salary cap re-surfaces. This time, Dai Young has sounded the annual alarm. Wasps’ director of rugby could not have asked much more from his gallant side as they pushed Toulon all the way before losing their Champions Cup quarter-final at Stade Felix Mayol on Sunday. Yet, the scale of what they were up against was illustrated by the sight of Matt Giteau and Juan Fernandez Lobbe – two of the world’s finest players – coming on as replacements for the hosts. A pair of Springboks, Bryan Habana and Juan Smith, were among a glittering non-playing contingent. Wasps coach Dai Young has called for reform to the Premiership salary cap so English clubs can compete on the European stage - the comments came after his team lost 32-18 to Toulon on Sunday . Lozowski makes a diving pass while his ankle is grasped by the Toulon player on the ground . Toulon's English speedster Delon Armitage makes a break for the defending champions . CLERMONT v SARACENS, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, St Etienne, Saturday, April 18, 3.15pm (GMT) TOULON v LEINSTER, Stade Vélodrome, Marseille, Sunday,     April 19, 3.15pm (GMT) Young quipped that the absence of Leigh Halfpenny from the Toulon ranks meant that Wasps only had ‘about five world-class full-backs to worry about’. The joke hinted at a more serious point; the personnel gulf between the wealthy French elite and their Premiership rivals. The English clubs simply can’t compete when the leading Top 14 sides play to their potential, due to the disparity in budgets. Yet again, the salary cap — currently £5.5million — is back on the agenda. ‘There are pros and cons for everything,’ said Young. ‘The salary cap has worked; all the clubs have been sustainable for a long period, it’s the most competitive league in Europe and there have been two or three different title winners in the last few seasons, too. Wasps' No 10 Alex Lozowski kicks away from Michalak during their European Champions Cup quarter-final . Toulon playmaker Frederic Michalak pulls the strings for the defending European champions . ‘It has also meant a lot of young English players are getting exposure at that level, so it has done what it was intended to do. But maybe we need a a re-think about how important Europe is to the English teams and how the salary cap leaves us when playing against the big French teams. ‘Realistically, Premiership teams need a bit of luck to arrive at these games with their best team fit. With the salary cap, there’s no way we can match the massive squads these clubs have.’ Wasps couldn’t match Toulon’s depth of playing resources, but they did trouble the holders thanks to the dynamic efforts of two young Englishmen — centre Elliot Daly and scrum-half Joe Simpson. Their electric running maintained the form Young believes should put them in contention for a place in England’s World Cup squad. ‘I don’t know what more they can do,’ said the Welshman. ‘If England want to win the World Cup, these are the type of players you have to get in your team.’ New Zealander Williams rises to celebrate his try which came minutes after he should have been sin-binned . Ali Williams crosses for a late try for Toulon as they put victory over Wasps on Sunday beyond doubt .","Dai Young wants to reform the current salary cap in English top flight .

"Tottenham Hotspur are moving forward with the next step towards their new stadium development at White Hart Lane with demolition beginning on the final opponent to the move, Archway Sheet Metal Works. Spurs plan to open a new 'world-class' 56,000-seater stadium in just over three years time, and having secured the appropriate planning permission and fought off a legal challenge against a compulsory purchase order, progress is being made. The north London club's neighbours, Archway Sheet Metal Works, fought a long court battle with Tottenham over the development but having failed with an appeal earlier this year, their premises are beginning to be demolished. Tottenham Hotspur are moving forward with the next step towards their new stadium development . The final opponent to Tottenham's £400million move, Archway Sheet Metal Works, is being demolished . The new stadium development (bottom) got given the go ahead after Archway lost a long-running court battle . A former factory belonging to Archway Sheet Metal Works begins to be pulled down behind the North Stand . Tottenham flags fly in front of the already partly-demolished building in north London on Thursday . April 2008 - Spurs began investigations into the Wingate industrial estate adjacent to White Hart Lane with a view to stadium expansion. December 2008 - Designs for the new stadium are unveiled. An intended completion date of the start of the 2012-13 season was revealed by Daniel Levy. April 2009 - Tottenham announce they will issue 30m new shares to raise £15m for the first stage of the proposed development. October 2009 - Planning application to Haringey Council is submitted. May 2010 - Tottenham withdraw planning application and submit a revised plan. March 2013 - West Ham are confirmed as Olympic Stadium tenants and Tottenham focus all attentions on the current project. April 2013 - Public Inquiry is held about last remaining properties to be acquired. July 2014 - Secretary of State Eric Pickles grants compulsory purchase order for the last piece of land. February 2015 - Archway are informed there is no legal flaw in Tottenham's compulsory purchase order, removing the final hurdle. April 2015 - Archway begins to be demolished. Diggers have moved in to knock down some of the buildings in Paxton Road that back on to White Hart Lane's North Stand ahead of the major regeneration project that is expected to cost in the region of £400million. The rest will be demolished when Archway find a new premises. Archway asked a judge to quash Communities Secretary Eric Pickles' decision to confirm the CPO on the grounds that it was 'unlawful and invalid' but were told earlier this year that there was 'no legal flaw' in the decision-making process. The Metal Works was were denied permission to appeal but they were allowed to directly ask Court of Appeal judges to reconsider the case, although they did not take up the option. That meant Spurs could finally secure the last patch of land needed to start work on the new stadium that they hope will rival that of north London rivals Arsenal. The plan for the design of the stadium itself includes a one-tier stand - similar to Liverpool's famous Kop - at one end, and will be bowl-shaped in a similar style to  Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. The project further aims to regenerate the Tottenham area with a central square, shops, housing and the refurbishment of existing buildings included in the club's plans. Last November, a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, which is alongside White Hart Lane's North Stand. The owners also say they received 'bomb threats'.

"Ronny Deila agrees with Gary Teale's claim that St Mirren have one of the best pitches in the Scottish Premiership - but believes that is an indictment rather than a boast.

"Karim Benzema hailed team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo as a 'phenomenon' after the Portuguese struck five goals in Real Madrid's 9-1 mauling of Granada. It was the first time in his career that Ronaldo has scored five goals in a single match and saw him become only the third player to reach the 300-goal mark for Madrid, a tally achieved in only 287 appearances. On Sunday, Benzema said on his club's website: 'Cristiano is a phenomenon, he is always looking for goals and ways to help the team. He deserves everything he has achieved.' Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) scored five goals during Real Madrid's 9-1 La Liga victory against Granada . Benzema also scored twice after Gareth Bale had opening the scoring as Madrid's much-vaunted 'BBC' strikeforce combined to score eight of their side's nine goals, with the other coming from a Diego Mainz own goal. The Frenchman added: 'Him (Ronaldo), Bale and me, we're in good form, like always. We're helping the team and sometimes we score and other times we don't, but we're in good shape to continue like that until the end of the season.' Ronaldo, meanwhile, was quick to highlight the role his team-mates played in his five-goal haul as he inched closer to becoming the club's all-time record scorer.

Madrid's performance was a timely one, coming after they had lost three of their previous five matches in La Liga and the Champions League - including a 2-1 loss to bitter rivals Barcelona in their last outing. Sunday's win saw Madrid close the gap to Barca back to one point ahead of the league leaders' clash at Celta Vigo on Sunday evening, and coach Carlo Ancelotti is looking to the future with optimism. Gareth Bale scored for Wales last week and kept up his scoring form with a goal against Granada . He said: 'Everything went to plan. My team are in good physical shape, the players are fresh and we showed that throughout the match. 'We played with a good tempo and scored bags of goals. We come away from this happy but this is just one game and we have other important ones coming up. 'It's simple mathematics. It's better to win nine games 1-0 than one 9-1. But today we have to point out the good play, the team are back to playing as desired, just like they have played many times before. What mattered most was winning and playing well and we have achieved that.' On Ronaldo, the Italian added: 'He has improved just as the team have. So, what can I say... This is the first time he has scored five goals in a game and that is good news for everyone: for him, for the team and in terms of the upcoming fixtures'.

And Van Gaal's emotions got the better of him when the players came in at half-time with a 1-0 advantage thanks to Herrera's 43rd minute strike.

Van Gaal admitted that he was so pleased with Herrera's opening goal, he kissed him at the interval . 'He has a very good kicking technique and he should be more composed,' Van Gaal said to MUTV. 'I said to him 'you have to control the ball before you shoot'. 'I said that to him again in yesterday's training session, and then I kissed him at half-time because he had controlled the ball for the first time in his life and then he shot. 'But then I came to him after the second-half and he said 'without control I can do it also!' United strengthened their place among the top-four of the Premier League by emerging 3-1 winners against Tim Sherwood's side at Old Trafford on Saturday, with Herrera at the double. Herrera (centre) netted twice as United ended up beating Villa 3-1 at Old Trafford . They moved above local rivals Manchester City and into third on 62 points, but will drop back to fourth if City win at Crystal Palace on Monday.

"England left for the Caribbean on Thursday knowing they must beat the West Indies on their return to Test cricket to salvage the futures of key personnel and silence speculation that continues to swirl around Kevin Pietersen. The stakes are high for England after a disastrous World Cup and the introduction of a new ECB chairman in Colin Graves who has made it clear that jobs will be on the line in a three-Test series that begins in Antigua on April 13. Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey in an attempt to win back his Test place, was the name on everyone’s lips at Gatwick Airport as beleaguered coach Peter Moores and returning captain Alastair Cook put on a united front ahead of a five-week tour they cannot afford to go wrong. England captain Alastair Cook faces the media at Gatwick Airport on Thursday morning . Coach Peter Moores (left) answered questions about the possible return of Kevin Pietersen . ‘Kevin’s not on this trip so I don’t have to focus on Kevin at all,’ insisted Moores, who initially lost his job as England coach after clashing with Pietersen at the end of 2008. ‘My focus is to support Alastair as captain and work with the 16 players we have here to try to make sure we play the sort of cricket people want to watch and help us win. ‘From my point of view Kevin isn’t on the radar. I can only say it so many times. He can’t be in mine nor Cooky’s focus at all. Kevin is not my decision. I have enough decisions to make already with 16 players. It is not about me getting personal. This is about focusing on an England team. ‘We have not mentioned the fact we have new players here and there is frustration for me that we have players whose dreams are being made by going on this trip and they’re not being mentioned at all. People who have worked so hard to get their chance – Adam Lyth and Mark Wood, for instance – are not being mentioned at all. I understand Kevin is a huge subject but Cooky and I can’t get drawn into that.’ Cook, who made it perfectly clear last year that he did not want Pietersen in his side again even before his bitter autobiography that appeared to sever all ties with England, concurred with his coach. Pietersen (left)  controversially celebrated Australia's World Cup win with his friends James Faulkner . Yorkshire opener Adam Lyth (centre) will get a chance to impress on the West Indies tour . ‘Contrary to what you may read in the media I’m a long way away from that decision. It’s down to Paul Downton, Tom Harrison and Colin Graves about Kevin, it’s not down to us,’ said an England captain who was dropped from the one-day side after of a World Cup where England failed to negotiate the group stage. ‘We’ve got 16 guys going to West Indies who are desperate to start turning round English cricket from what’s happened over the last three months. ‘We need to get back to winning ways and it’s about a brand of cricket and trying to win this series. It’s about 16 guys and the support staff. The ECB will have to deal with everything else.’ Cook spoke in Abu Dhabi last month where he played for MCC against Yorkshire of his anger at frustration at missing out on the World Cup. On Thursday he was more conciliatory, particularly towards the coach who dropped him. ‘I have known Mooresey for years and I love working with him,’ said Cook. ‘I have had time away and the thing I’m looking forward to most is leading England again in that first Test. From my point of view it is all about that. ‘It’s been a different couple of months to what I thought I was going to have before Christmas. Every cloud has a huge silver lining and spending three months at home has been fantastic if I’m being honest with you. Durham fast bowler Mark Wood is another new face in England's Test squad . ‘I’ve been living a normal life again which I haven’t had for a long time and it’s been great spending time with family and friends and being at home. From that point of view it’s been really refreshing and enjoyable. A lot has gone on since that last win against India at the Oval when we had three outstanding Test matches to come back from one down in that series. ‘A lot has happened since and to say we can get back straight away is going to be a challenge and it’s up to the players and the leadership to try and do that because as I say, in the last three Tests we played we played some good cricket.’ Moores would not go as far as to say he regretted the decision to drop Cook and make Eoin Morgan one-day captain ahead of the World Cup. ‘We can look back at everything. Me and Cooky have spoken and I’ve gone through a lot with Alastair. He was disappointed not to go, it didn’t work out, but we’ve got to look forward now. We can go no further than the next five weeks. ‘I really think we’ve got to keep it simple. There’s been a lot of noise around English cricket and a lot of emotion which is understandable but I think now we’ve got 16 players who are going to the West Indies under Alastair and we’ve got to go and try to play some really good cricket.’ New chairman Graves, who has heaped pressure on England by encouraging Pietersen to return to county cricket, caused another stir when he called West Indies mediocre and said there would be an inquiry if England failed to win. And Moores acknowledged that jobs are on the line in the Caribbean. Both Cook and Moores were keen to talk about the squad and not about Pietersen . ‘From my point of view it’s not about the coach. It’s about the players, it’s about winning and it’s about English cricket. We’ve got a very committed bunch of players and support staff who desperately want to win for England. So I’m going no further than the next five weeks when we’ve got three Tests against tough opposition. If we do well we’ll get some momentum going into what is a very big summer. So that’s got to be the focus, on playing the right sort of cricket because that’s what the fans want. But has he been given any assurance over his position and those of others? ‘No, it doesn’t work like that,’ said Moores. ‘I think we all know we’re in a results business. Tom Harrison and Colin Graves have come in and Tom has been great since he’s been here. For me I’m just focusing on what’s in front of us. ‘For me and Alastair it’s pretty clear. We’ve got some new players coming in and we’ve got Jonathan Trott coming back. We’ve got to make sure that the side moulds quickly. We’ve got a couple of practice games and we go straight into the Test series and we don’t need to go any further than that.’ He knows, though, that his job will probably not go any further than the West Indies if England fail to win. And Pietersen will be a constant presence in the background piling on the pressure.

"Christian Benteke faces a substantial pay cut if his goals are not enough to keep Aston Villa in the Premier League – but is set to attract interest should he continue his scoring streak. Whatever Villa's Premier League status this summer, Benteke's future will be discussed as his contract, worth £50,000 per week, enters its final two years and the Belgian striker has ambitions to play European football. Wolfsburg have kept tabs on Benteke since before he ruptured his Achilles 12 months ago and remain on the lookout for a striker. The wealthy German club, currently second in Bundesliga, should have funds available from Champions League money, even after their £42million splurge on Chelsea duo Kevin De Bruyne and Andre Schurrle. Christian Benteke celebrates his opening goal against QPR at Villa Park on Tuesday . Villa value their top scorer at £25million however, and even then would remain hugely reluctant to sell with manager Tim Sherwood a big fan. Randy Lerner is set to offload the club come the closed season and new owners will have their own thoughts. A hat-trick by Benteke in the 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers, capped by a brilliant free-kick, underlined his return to form under Sherwood. He has scored seven goals in his last five Villa games, earning the team an additional three points in the process – the current gap to the drop zone. Benteke went on to net a hat-trick which salvaged a vital point for his side . But should Villa slip below the dreaded dotted line and out of the Premier League, Benteke is in line for an approximate 30 per cent reduction on his wages to £35,000 a week. The 24-year-old would look to leave Villa Park in that scenario, rather than play in the Championship, with a host of clubs likely to express interest. There is, however, no relegation release clause. Even if Villa stay in the Premier League Benteke will assess his options. Two years ago he handed in a transfer request to try to force a move to Tottenham Hotspur following his debut season in England yielding 23 goals. The arrival of Tim Sherwood at Villa Park has rejuvenated Benteke's form in front of goal this season . He signed a new four-year deal on vastly improved terms. Last season was less successful, bringing 11 goals before serious injury struck last April ruling Benteke out of the World Cup. His form suffered on return to the side last October, and at times he cut a bereft figure starved of service under Paul Lambert's regime. Lambert even dropped Benteke in his penultimate game in charge at home to Chelsea. Sherwood's arrival has seen Benteke return to his best, with a goal every 87 minutes. That kind of strike rate should keep Villa up, but also alert top-flight clubs. Spurs are looking to sign young players around the £15million mark, though, while Liverpool would need to shift Mario Balotelli. Jack Grealish is convinced Benteke's goals will ensure Villa's Premier League survival this season . Benteke is comfortable with life in Birmingham and at Villa, but holds desires to play higher up the league and in continental competitions. Qualification for the Europa League is still a possibility through the FA Cup for Villa, of course. Teenage winger Jack Grealish, who started his first Premier League match against QPR, is adamant Benteke will help keep Villa safe. 'Yes, when you have Christian in the team who can score goals every game,' he said. 'We are going to go in Saturday's game (at Spurs) positive. 100 per cent we will stay up.'","Christian Benteke is currently paid £50,000 per week at Aston Villa .

"Arsenal target Paolo Dybala has admitted that these could be his last days at Palermo, with the club ready to cash in on their star man. The Argentine forward, 21, has been linked with a number of Europe's top clubs after some dazzling performances in Serie A, and scored his 13th league goal of the season on Saturday. Palermo president Maurizio Zamparini says that Arsenal and Juventus have already approached the club with bids, and while Arsene Wenger has denied interest, £30m-rated Dybala seems set on a move this summer. Paolo Dybala says he could be playing his final games for Palermo as Arsenal and Juventus prepare moves . 'I try not to think too much about the transfer market,' he told Dia Dia. 'I am completely focused on the last 10 games, because they could be my last here.' Liverpool are also thought to be admirers of the youngster, who also visited the Nou Camp to watch Barcelona play earlier this season. However, Dybala insists he was only there for the football, and not to discuss a potential transfer. He added: 'I went to Camp Nou merely as a spectator. There were a lot of great players out on the pitch, it was a great game and it helped me because I learned a lot from watching it.'

"With James Rodriguez returning to the Real Madrid squad, Spanish publication Marca have splashed about how Carlo Ancelotti has his 'six nations' available again. The former Monaco playmaker has been out of action since the beginning of February with a foot injury, but has been named in the Real starting XI for the visit of Granada on Sunday. And with that, Ancelotti has a fearsome front line of different nationalities ready to chase down Barcelona in the La Liga run-in.

"Chelsea are discussing the possibility of a post-season tour, a move that could upset numerous international managers. Jose Mourinho didn't rule out a potential 12,000-mile round trip to Japan, home of new sponsors Yokohama Rubber, . No final decision has been made on a destination but if a tour goes ahead, the squad is likely to fly out on either May 28 or 29 for a two-match, week-long trip. Jose Mourinho did not rule out the prospect of a 12,000-mile round trip for a pre-season tour in Japan . The news may concern a string of international bosses who will be relying on Chelsea players for their mid-June friendlies and qualifiers. For instance, Belgium face France in a friendly on June 7 before a vital Euro 2016 qualifier against Wales on June 12. England, Spain and Serbia, who all have Chelsea players in their squads, all have games between June 12-14. Likewise, the proposed tour would also have implications for Chelsea's South American contingent, including Oscar, Willian and Juan Cuadrado, ahead of the Copa America on June 11. FIFA rules state that nations are entitled to players 14 days before the start of a tournament. It is highly likely that those players involved in the Copa America would be given permission to miss Chelsea's post-season tour. Chelsea are yet to finalise plans for their pre-season as they lead the way at the top of the Premier League . Mourinho said: 'I think we'll go on an after-season tour to play a couple of matches in some destination where people will be very enthusiastic to have the Premier League champions, if we win it. 'It's something we are thinking about, a good way to celebrate. Not a victory parade, but a trip, a week where we play a couple of matches but, at the same time, can be together without the pressure of winning every match, without the pressure and tension of the last weeks of the Premier League. 'We can also relax and go to holidays with that good feeling. But we still have nine matches to play. 'Mr Bruce Buck and the board are talking with me. We want to go somewhere where people are enthusiastic to have a club like Chelsea. 'Japan? I don't know but that would make some sense.'","Chelsea are considering a pre-season tour to Japan this summer .

"Blackburn Rovers manager Gary Bowyer has hit out at FA Cup rules which prevent him from fielding one of his own players against Liverpool in Wednesday night's sixth round replay at Ewood Park because he was on loan when the first tie was played on March 9. Bowyer, who has a lengthy injury list at his Championship club, wanted to include 21-year-old midfielder John O'Sullivan to face The Reds having recalled him from a loan spell with League One Barnsley last month. However, there was no dispensation because O'Sullivan was at Oakwell when the initial 0-0 draw between the teams was played at Anfield. Blackburn midfielder John O'Sullivan (right) is ineligible to play in their FA Cup fifth round replay vs Liverpool . Gary Bowyer says it 'doesn't make sense' that he can't use O'Sullivan, who's been recalled from Barnsley . Bowyer said: 'It will be a huge achievement to beat Liverpool in these circumstances. Because of the embargo (for breaching FPP rules) we are only allowed a squad of 24 players and have played 13 games in 43 days. 'So to be told we can't even play one of our own players because he was sent on on loan before the first game doesn't make sense to me. He's only been a Blackburn player for six years! 'We sent John away to help his development. He's back now, he'd be eligible for the semi-final if we get there, but not the quarter-final replay.' Ewood Park will have a capacity crowd for the first time since they were relegated from the Premier League in 2012 and Bowyer hopes the fans take a lead from Crystal Palace supporters. O'Sullivan (left), who was on loan at Barnsley, will be available to play if Blackburn reach the semi-finals though . 'The Palace fans got them over the line against Manchester City on Monday night and we need our supporters to be the 12th man, 13th man or even 14th man. 'There were six thousand of our supporters at Anfield and they never shut up. The players talked about it afterwards and we need them again. There is a buzz around the place.' Liverpool have had a torrid fortnight and arrive in Lancashire without suspended players Emre Can, Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel. In addition, a contract issue with Raheem Sterling has been a distraction while the club have lost their last two league games against Manchester United and Arsenal. 'It's still ridiculous to talk about them as a club in crisis. We are massive underdogs,' added Bowyer, who is without 14 senior professionals including Josh King, Chris Taylor, Grant Hanley and possibly Craig Conway on Wednesday.

"Burnley manager Sean Dyche has complete confidence that his side will beat relegation. The Clarets are gearing up for the final eight games of their Barclays Premier League survival battle reinvigorated after a warm-weather training camp. Sean Dyche's squad - minus the four players on international duty - spent last week in Spain preparing for a run-in that begins with Sunday's tricky visit of Tottenham. Sean Dyche believes his Burnley side are more than capable of avoiding the Premier League drop . They have a tough battle ahead but recent performances - not least last month's defeat of champions Manchester City - have given hope that a side rated as pre-season relegation favourites can escape the bottom three. The idea of a late-season getaway worked wonders last year, as Dyche's men returned to secure a promotion spot and he hopes for a similar boost this time. The 43-year-old said: 'Last year we found it gave the lads a change and a change is almost as good a rest. We came back and we did the business by getting ourselves promoted. Star man Danny Ings will need to be in top form to get the better of the Tottenham Hotspur defence . 'It's a different kind of challenge this time but we want the same outcome which is to win games and be in the Premier League. 'Wins have been hard to come by - or certainly harder to come by - and it's a big jump in quality but I think slowly but surely we're refocusing on what the job is, learning as we go and delivering good performances. 'I have total belief we will be in the Premier League.' George Boyd (21) celebrates after scoring the winner against Manchester City at Turf Moor . Burnley were written off by many after failing to win any of their opening 10 games but have since proved they are no pushovers. They remain in the relegation zone but were still just three points off 15th place ahead of the weekend fixtures. The Spurs clash is followed by another tough task against Arsenal but Dyche has no doubt his side will push hard. He said: 'I don't know what they're thinking (about us) but I think they know we'll give everything to win a game. That's well documented. They know about the energy and physical desire of the team and behind that there is quality there. Harry Kane has been the player of Tottenham's season and will need to be watched carefully on Sunday . 'Of course that's got to win games. We beat Man City but we need more of that, and it's not always good play but a bit of luck, a decision to go your way every now and then. 'I think our performances have been decent at least. We know they're tough games and the next one will be Tottenham but we'll be ready.' Dyche has dismissed suggestions that his side, inexperienced at the top level, could start flagging as the heat intensifies in the coming weeks. Michael Duff (left) challenges Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez during their clash at the Emirates Stadium . He said: 'Last season there was no sign of that and this season there is no sign of that. 'We will be playing hard in every game to get the points we need to be in the Premier League. It feels like there is no slowing down in what I believe, no slowing down in the training schedules. 'We will be training equally as hard - if not harder on certain days - to be ready for the challenge.'","Sean Dyche says his side can avoid relegation from the Premier League .

'I demand that they work with me and for a common purpose, with full commitment to the fans and the city.

With stewards and police present, the scenes did not descend into violence but the message delivered from those in attendance was clear - they want Oyston to depart a team that this week became the first in the Football League to be relegated. On the pitch, Jamie O'Hara's early penalty was cancelled out by Grant Hall's unfortunate own goal just 20 seconds after the restart as the basement-dwelling Seasiders' winless run was extended to 13 games. Some of the supporters who congregated in front of the West Stand did not even walk into a half-empty stadium for the game and they missed their side taking a sixth-minute lead. Zat Knight got the wrong side of Sheffield Wednesday loanee Gary Madine and tripped him from behind, allowing O'Hara to step up and stroke the resulting penalty into the corner as Adam Federici guessed the wrong way.

The cut-up pitch arguably denied the hosts a second as the ball bobbled away from David Perkins, who had orchestrated a three-on-two break, on the edge of the Royals' penalty area. Winger Michael Jacobs then blasted into the side-netting from 25 yards as Blackpool entered the interval with a one-goal lead. That disappeared 20 seconds after the restart, though, when the Royals made a lightning start to the second period. Pavel Pogrebnyak made inroads down the left flank and he squared for Yakubu, whose shot back across goal smashed against the unfortunate Hall before going over the line. Hall stayed on the turf and after woozily returning to his feet, he was replaced by Niall Maher. Perkins bent an effort narrowly past a post but Joe Lewis and Federici remained largely untroubled, as did Blackpool substitute Elliot Parish when he replaced an injured Lewis, with Pogrebnyak's header off target the closest either side came to a winner. The result leaves Lee Clark's side on 25 points, still one point shy of the lowest points tally ever accumulated by a team in the second tier when there have been 24 teams competing.","Jamie O'Hara scored from the spot after just six minutes .

A controlled thick edge from the first ball of the day brought him an 11th boundary of the innings and in the following over he punched the ball for two off the back foot.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers accepts his side cannot afford not to turn up in another big game if their top-four ambitions are to survive. Prior to the international break the Reds' 13-match unbeaten league run was ended at home to Champions League-chasing rivals Manchester United, leaving them five points adrift of the qualification places. Defeat at third-placed Arsenal would be a huge blow to their aspirations of returning to Europe's elite for a second successive season. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has urged his team to perform well in the clash with Arsenal on Saturday . Rodgers knows they must avoid a repeat of the disappointing first-half display against United which led to their defeat. 'We've made it difficult for ourselves because of our last performance and result, but it's certainly achievable,' he said of their top-four chances. 'Over the course of the last three months, apart from the last game, we've performed very well and we have got results. 'I think people might look at it (the trip to Arsenal) as a must-win game. For me, it is a must-perform game, we want to perform well and we know that when we do that we've got every chance of winning, whether that's at home or away. Rodgers watches over training as he prepares his side to face Arsenal at the Emirates on Saturday . The Liverpool boss addresses his players ahead of the pivotal clash with Arsenal in North London . 'We've had a long two weeks, it's probably one of the few games where after the international break we've had to suffer a little bit, because we didn't perform and lost, but there is extra motivation there to get something from the game and that is something that we clearly want to achieve. 'These final eight games are going to be exciting games and there is still every possibility for us to make the top four.' Many see the two sides as being similar in their approach to how they play, particularly in relation to how they like to keep the ball. That was a feature missing in the United game and it cost them dearly and Rodgers has spent a fortnight over the international break assessing where it went wrong after enjoying so much success in the previous three months. 'Our possession wasn't good enough in our last game,' he added. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is suspended having been sent off against Manchester United . 'The key for us in the first-half against Manchester United was that we didn't keep the ball well enough and, positionally, we were never in position to receive the ball and press the ball. 'We've talked about that, we've analysed that and we've worked on that; in order for us to maximise how we've been working we need to keep the ball better and be technically better. 'That's a huge part of our game, and it's Arsenal's game. But for us, we'll go there and tactically we are very clear on the idea of the game and we need to get something from the game, that's clear. 'But that was the same before we played the Manchester United game; Arsenal was a game that we wanted to ensure that we got at least a point from and that will be the case at the weekend.' Daniel Sturridge trained on Thursday ahead of Liverpool's trip to Arsenal in the Barclays Premier League . 'We'll be going there looking forward to the game and really motivated to get back to winning again.' Liverpool have been boosted by striker Daniel Sturridge's return to training after a hip injury, while fellow England international Adam Lallana is also expected to be fit after pulling out of Roy Hodgson's squad. However, they will be missing centre-back Martin Skrtel, a virtual ever-present in the league this season, as he begins a three-match suspension alongside captain Steven Gerrard.","Arsenal host top four rivals Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday .

"This was as far away from the Ashes cauldron as it is possible to be but a quiet day of run scoring against sub-standard opposition in picturesque Basseterre at the start of England’s Caribbean tour meant everything to Jonathan Trott. It must have seemed to Trott that he would never again bat for England when he suffered that brutal dismantling at the hands of Mitchell Johnson during England’s ill-fated last Ashes tour almost 18 months ago. Yet here he was, recovered from the mental condition that forced his departure from Australia and now certain of a new role opening the batting in the first Test in Antigua next week. It is quite a comeback. Jonathan Trott and Alastair Cook combine impressively as England produce dominant display . Cook plays behind square as wicketkeeper Jaison Peters  looks on in Basseterre, St Kitts . If Trott’s return with 72 was the most pleasing aspect of a dominant day for England then an unbeaten 95 for captain Alastair Cook was almost as important. The pair came together here at the top of the order yesterday for the first time since a brief experiment in Bangladesh five years ago in what was a low-key return to work after the embarrassment of England’s first round World Cup exit. Neither Cook nor Trott could be blamed for that nor for the careful way they went about their batting in this two-day practice match against a St Kitts Invitational XI that would struggle to defeat a decent English club side. Stuart Broad bowls in the Carribean sun as England take on a St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI . Cook and teammate Jonathan Trott talk in between overs during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI game . Such was the scale of England’s World Cup embarrassment that they find themselves very much on trial again now even though they ended last year’s Test summer with three successive wins against India. The failure of Sam Robson to convince alongside Cook has opened the door for the return of Trott ahead of Adam Lyth and he made the most of his chance in a stand of 158 with his captain made in the most comfortable of circumstances. England had barely broken sweat in bowling St Kitts out for 59, another returnee in Ben Stokes taking three wickets in five balls, before Cook and Trott overwhelmed a local side who had bizarrely warmed up in Inter Milan shirts. Perhaps they are better at football than cricket because there was little to concern two players with much to prove for different reasons in Cook and Trott. The captain is back after being demoted from one-day office and looked the more fluent, despatching anything short and moving on to his 50 off 95 balls to follow the three half-centuries he has scored in his last four Test innings. Trott was the only casualty of the day for England and he had to be almost dragged from the crease when he was eventually caught at short leg. ‘It’s almost like he’s never been away,’ said Stokes. ‘It was really good to see the way he just settled back to how he has been over the last few years.’ Quite how much the England attack got out of their morning work-out was questionable because this was a shockingly indisciplined batting display from a St Kitts side who included just seven players with first-class experience. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad eased their way back after their own humbling World Cups but the most penetrative bowling came from Stokes, who swung the ball consistently on a typically slow and flat Warner Park pitch.

Trott plays to the offside to reach his fifty during the St Kitts and Nevis Invitational XI England tour match . England plan to use Stokes, who was left out of the World Cup after a dreadful run, as their all-rounder in this series, batting at six at least until the return of Moeen Ali which they hope will come ahead of the second Test. Stokes and Chris Jordan are clearly ahead of Liam Plunkett and the newcomer Mark Wood in the pecking order while Adil Rashid and James Tredwell appear to be competing for the solitary spinner’s place next week. Both took a wicket towards the end of the St Kitts innings while Tredwell added a spectacular one-handed slip catch.

"Jacques Burger encapsulates all the values rugby union’s marketing people love to espouse. Fiercely loyal, brave beyond words, strong and dedicated. At Saracens, who take on Racing Metro in Paris on Sunday in the European Champions Cup quarter-final, the flanker is loved by his team-mates every bit as much as he is loathed by opponents who fear the reckless abandon with which he is prepared to play the game. With a face left battered and bruised by years of punishment, Burger is the man you want on your team. ‘I change into something else when I play rugby, my personality changes,’ said Burger. ‘When I step off the pitch I will be somebody else again. It is pretty weird. You go out there and do your job then you step off and pick up your kids and you are soft again. When it is time to go, there is a switch that turns you on for a big match. Saracens ace Jacques Burger looks to get to grips with Harlequins Marland Yarde . Burger of Saracens tackles Harlequins ace Chris Robshaw in the Aviva Premiership match . ‘My dad always says he doesn’t want to die a healthy man. I don’t want to go down healthy. Hopefully there’ll be a bit of wear and tear. I’m happy to crack on and give 100 per cent every time I get the opportunity.’ Therein lies the challenge facing rugby today. For all we love about these young men who risk serious injury every week in order to entertain us, are the risks becoming too great? Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall described Burger as ‘unique among rugby players’, praising his willingness to ignore risks to his own wellbeing. Burger and Schalk Brits of Saracens tackle Damien Chouly of ASM Clermont Auvergne . Burger  bursts through to score a try during the Aviva Premiership match between Saracens and Harlequins . His continued presence on a rugby field is something of a miracle after undergoing pioneering knee surgery in South Africa more than three years ago which a British specialist refused to carry out because he considered it too extreme. At the very least he will need a full knee replacement in the not-too-distant future. ‘I feel massively blessed,’ said the 31-year-old Namibian farmer’s son from Windhoek. ‘I never thought I’d have come back and played so many games after the surgery. I went through a lot of pain. ‘The physio says I’m a bit like Benjamin Button. I’m going back in time and healing up again. I will probably regret it after rugby when I’m sitting at home having to do some work. But that’s for the future. I’ll worry about that when I get there.’ Sitiveni Sivivatu  is tackled by Burger and Kelly Brown during the Heineken Cup semi final . But while he can be very cavalier with his own body, Burger believes players do need to be protected from themselves at times. ‘It is annoying for players sometimes because you want to crack on and keep playing. But players’ health after rugby has to be the No 1 priority because it is such a short amount of rugby you play in your life.’ The 31-year-old will run out against Racing Metro on Sunday off the back of a performance against Harlequins at Wembley last Saturday that McCall believes was his best since the astonishing man-of-the-match display he produced against Clermont Auvergne in last year’s European semi-final. ‘It’s going to take a big game to bring it home,’ said Burger. ‘The European knockout stages is when you get tested. That’s when some guys become stars and I’m up for that.’","Jacques Burger prepares for battle with Racing Metro in quarter-final clash .

"Jose Mourinho has declared that he doesn't care where Chelsea win the Premier League, so long as they end up claiming the title. The Blues lead the table by six points, with a game in hand, and face Stoke City at home on Saturday in the first of their final nine games of the season. 'I dont care if it is in the hotel or away or at home, I just want to win it,' said Mourinho, as Chelsea trained at Cobham on Friday. Jose Mourinho was speaking at Chelsea's press conference ahead of their Premier League clash . Eden Hazard will start for Chelsea against Stoke City on Saturday following a tiring international break . Mourinho (right) watches as his players Filipe Luis (left) and Nemanja Matic train . 'In any occasion I think the club who wins it gets the trophy in our last match at home, and our last game of the season is at home (to Sunderland). 'So if we win the title we get the trophy at our house. But I don't care, even if somebody loses the trophy and we don't get it I am happy with that. I just want to win it.' Mourinho will start Eden Hazard against Stoke on Saturday despite the player suggesting he is tired. The Belgian said earlier this week he is feeling weary as the season reaches its climax. But the Chelsea manager, who also confirmed Diego Costa has recovered from a hamstring injury, will not take his wing wizard out of the firing line against the Potters. Hazard started both of Belgium's Euro 2016 qualifiers during the international break. Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois gets down to his left to make a save in training . Juan Cuadrado (left) battles team-mate Cesar Azpilicueta (centre) for the ball . Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas attempts a pass under pressure from team-mate Ramires . 'Hazard is tired because he played two matches in three days,' said Mourinho. 'He travelled and didn't sleep because he arrived in Belgium at 5 or 6 in the morning after playing in Israel. We think he can recover in these couple of days, but he plays tomorrow (Saturday). 'That's football. That's what a season is like for a player who is important for both his club and national team. I want to play him every time and the coach of his country wants to play him every time. 'He is a team player that plays with the ball, creates, dribbles and players with lots of intensity so it is not a surprise that he can be a bit tired.

Spain striker Costa missed the international break with injury, but could yet feature against Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening after training for the last couple of days. However Mourinho refused to confirm whether his top scorer would start the game. 'Diego trained on Thursday and Friday with the group,' continued Mourinho. 'He is not injured but I don't know if I will start with him or not. I need to analyse the situation with him and make a decision.' 'He dedicated himself to getting fit on his days off, working hard in the morning and afternoon. We can say that we did all the tests and scans to confirm  that scientifically at this moment the muscle is fine. 'But in football you need the confidence to know you  are free to express maximum intensity, and that's our doubt. So we'll see in the next 24 hours then decide.'

Costa vies for the ball with fellow Chelsea striker Didier Drogba (left) at Cobham . Louis van Gaal's Manchester United still have a chance of winning the league, according to Mourinho . Although they sit six points clear at the top of the league with a game in hand on all their nearest rivals, Mourinho still believes that there is still a four-horse race for the title this season. 'Look at the points difference,' he said. 'You have to say four (teams) now. Not five, because there's a gap from fourth to fifth and, with eight matches to go, that's a difficult gap from first to fifth. 'But the points difference between second, third and fourth makes me think and feel that they are there.' He added: 'We need six victories and one draw from nine matches. It is a good situation for us, and one all the other clubs would like to have. But it's pure mathematics. We need to win six matches and draw one. We need to do that, and we haven't done it yet.' And despite Manchester United's inconsistency this season, Mourinho still believes Louis van Gaal's side are still in with a shot at the title. 'The number of the points is the number of points,' Mourinho added. 'They are there. The points are there. In the last few matches they've become consistent in results and the quality of their performances. They are there.'","Eden Hazard will start for Chelsea against Stoke City on Saturday .

"The importance of Saturday's match against Arsenal for Liverpool’s Champion’s League ambitions cannot be overstated. The reverse fixture, a 2-2 draw in December, prompted Liverpool’s renaissance into the Premier League’s form team. Thereafter, they went 13 top-flight games without defeat and put themselves in contention to qualify for Europe’s top competition before losing to Manchester United in a drama-filled match two weeks ago. Juan Mata's acrobatic volley two weeks ago left Liverpool five points adrift of Manchester United in fourth . Brendan Rodgers' side need to beat Arsenal on Saturday to keep up their chances of a top-four finish . Liverpool have been in good form since they last played Arsenal, but are not in the Champions League spots . A defeat could leave Liverpool eight points adrift of the top four with just seven games to play, a massive mountain to climb. The statistics suggest victory at the Emirates is an unlikely scenario. In six games against the Premier League’s other top-five sides, Liverpool have won just one and picked up four points compared with Manchester United who have won three of five games against their toughest competition. In Arsenal they face a side who have cemented their Champions League spot with four top-flight wins in as many games in March. For their efforts, Arsene Wenger was given the Manager of the Month award for a 14th time and striker Olivier Giroud the Player of the Month trophy. Liverpool are likely to face a side riding on a wave of confidence and optimism so it will be a tough ask to get a result. With more money on offer than ever before, Liverpool know they need to be at Europe's top table . Raheem Sterling and Phlippe Coutinho train ahead of the vital trip to Arsenal on Saturday . It is not just the pride of fans at stake in this game but also the financial security of the club. A Sportsmail study this week revealed the race for Champion’s League has gained even more importance after UEFA announced significant increases in prize money for their top competition from next season. Cash for appearing in the group stages onwards is increasing by up to 50 per cent, and for English clubs there will also be steep hikes in 'market pool' money from UEFA's TV incomes. If an English club were to win next season's Champions League, they would earn around £75m at today's exchange rates from central UEFA funds alone. Ticket income plus any commercial bonuses would be on top. Under current prize money arrangements, clubs reaching the group stage receive £6.4m each plus £750,000 per group win and £370,000 per draw. The basic fee will rise 40 per cent to  £8.9m and each win will jump 50 per cent to £1.1m. Prize money for reaching the last 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals will leap up 57 per cent, respectively to £4m, £4.44m and £5.2m. The prize for being tournament runner-up will jump from £4.8m to £7.8m while the winner's prize will jump from £7.8m to £11.11m. For a team like Liverpool, who enjoy a big worldwide profile, particularly in Asia, money like that could solidify their position among the European elite for the next decade. Securing European football will also be vital to ensure they attract world-class players and keep the ones they already have at the club. Even with Champions League qualification Liverpool were unable to hold on to Luis Suarez last summer . Sterling's contract situation demonstrates how important it is for Rodgers' side to qualify . The contract wrangling with Raheem Sterling in recent weeks will undoubtedly have been a distraction to the player himself and the focus of manager Brendan Rodgers but they will have to put that to one side if they are to overcome Arsenal. On the Sterling subject, it would be much easier to resolve his future and persuade him to remain in Merseyside come the end of the season if Liverpool have the certainty of Champions League football to offer as an enticement. Players want to compete on the biggest stage they can. Regardless of how much money each week is being offered, the chance to play against the best teams in Europe is priceless.","Champions League qualification is more lucrative than ever .
Liverpool are already five points off the top four with eight game to go .

"Olivier Giroud's Barclays Premier League player of the month award makes the French the league's outright most successful foreign nationality, with the Arsenal striker becoming France's 16th winner of the accolade. Giroud netted five times in Arsenal's four consecutive league wins last month as Arsene Wenger's side took all 12 points on offer to claim the award for March. And in doing so he joined a long list of his compatriots to be ranked as a month's best player in the English top flight, alongside the likes of Thierry Henry, Eric Cantona and Nicolas Anelka. Olivier Giroud won the Barclays Premier League player of the month award for March after his run of form .

November 2008: Nicolas Anelka, Chelsea . March 2010: Florent Malouda, Chelsea . December 2010: Samir Nasri, Arsenal . March 2015: Olivier Giroud, Arsenal . Giroud's prize sees his country edge out Holland as the most successful nation in terms of player of the month awards, beaten only by the native English on home territory. Much of that success comes down to Giroud's club, Arsenal. They have provided 10 French winners with Henry, Anelka, Emmanuel Petit, Sylvain Wiltord, Robert Pires and Samir Nasri have all won it while in north London. Former Arsenal striker Henry is the top Frenchman was four awards, trailing only Steven Gerrard (on six), Wayne Rooney and Alan Shearer (both five), and sitting in good company, level with Cristiano Ronaldo, Dennis Bergkamp, Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes. 'I'm really pleased with it,' Giroud told Arsenal's official website after winning the March prize. 'I would like to thank my team-mates and of course the fans, because it's a collective sport and I couldn't do it on my own. 'It's a great honour to have been selected as Player of the Month, especially because we wanted to bounce back from the Champions League disappointment. Manchester United's French forward Eric Cantona was named player of the month in March 1996 . Emmanuel Petit is pictured with another Frenchman, Arsene Wenger. He won the award in April 1998 . Nicolas Anelka won the award twice: with Arsenal in February 1999 and then with Chelsea in 2008 . Louis Saha's performances for Fulham saw him crowned as the month's best player in August 2001 . England - 88 . France - 16 . Holland - 15 . Spain - 8 . Republic of Ireland, Wales - 6 . Portugal - 5 . Argentina, Nigeria - 4 . Brazil, Italy, Scotland, Trinidad and Tobago - 3 . Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, Ghana, Russia, Senegal, Sweden, Uruguay - 2 . Australia, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Costa Rica, Croatia, Germany, Iceland, Jamaica, Paraguay, Serbia, Turkey - 1 . 'That's what we've done and we've come back really strongly. We all want to finish strongly and this award will give me more confidence for the following games.' Giroud averaged a goal every 72 minutes throughout March, and his excellent levels of performance are no change for the French on English shores. Aside from the Arsenal contributions,  Ginola, Louis Saha, Anelka (for Chelsea) and Florent Malouda have all been named as the player of the month at some point during their spells in England. Spanish, Irish, Welsh, Portuguese, Argentine and Nigerian players have all done well too, but every country aside from England and Holland have, at most, half the number France have. And to make the point of their dominance even more, look to European rivals Germany. They have had just one winner, the first: Jurgen Klinsmann in 1994. Sylvain Wiltord's early season form saw him claim the player of the month prize in August 2002 for Arsenal . Another Frenchman playing for Arsenal, Robert Pires, was a winner in February 2003 at Highbury . Florent Malouda was the second of two French winners coming from Chelsea when he won in March 2010 .

"Liverpool head to Arsenal on Saturday in the lunchtime Premier League kick-off, and we could be in for a goal-fest if the history of this fixture is anything to go by. Five hat-tricks have been scored in this match-up since the inception of the Premier League, one more than has been netted in Newcastle United vs Manchester United games. Whats more, their meeting in December at Anfield ended in an entertaining 2-2 draw after an injury-time equaliser from Martin Skrtel.

Fowler has scored two of the five hat-tricks that have been netted in Liverpool vs Arsenal fixures . This fixture's first hat-trick hero in the Premier League era was Robbie Fowler, who scored three times at Anfield in August 1994. His goals, with just four minutes and 35 seconds between the first and the third hitting the net, is in fact the quickest hat-trick in Premier League history. And it was Fowler again who scored a treble 16 months later.

"Kenwyne Jones came from the bench late on to score within three minutes of his Bournemouth debut and rescue a point away to Ipswich. The pass the parcel of the Championship top spot continued as Bournemouth could only draw after falling behind to an early Freddie Sears goal. They dominated the match, but had to wait until the 82nd minute for Jones, taken on loan from Cardiff 10 days ago, to power in a header.

Subs not used: Gerken,, Anderson, Williams, McGoldrick. Manager: Mick McCarthy . Booked: Chambers . Goal: Sears, 6 . Referee: Robert Madley . Attendance: 22,672 . ‘We scored an un-Bournemouth goal,’ manager Eddie Howe admitted afterwards. ‘But it was equally effective as any, from a set piece. It’s good to see, we haven’t come back from being behind much this season. ‘Jones is a presence, but he’s more than that he’s got good feet, he was excellent when he came on. He’s very important in terms of scores like this and the situation the game was in. That’s when he’s probably going to play his biggest part. It’s his job to turn those into points for us. He could be invaluable.’ All it took was a split second lapse in concentration from Bournemouth’s defence and they were behind in only the sixth minute. The first half was still taking shape when Daryl Murphy was afforded time and space on the right inside the box to bring a cross under control with a lovely touch and pass into Sears to fire in first-time. The striker, formerly of West Ham, was so free he looked over to the linesman, fearing he was offside, but the flag stayed down and he notched up his 19th goal of the campaign. Ipswich goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski was diving left, right and centre for the remainder of the game to keep his side ahead. Twice he denied Ryan Fraser and again a powerful effort from Matt Ritchie. But Jones was thrown on in the 79th minute and rose to meet Ritchie’s left-hand side corner to finally beat the Polish keeper. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy said: ’They put a very, very, very expensive acquisition on. He is pretty good in the air. I’ve just watched it and Tommy Smith is head-to-head with him, it’s one of those you get your head on it sometimes it flies in sometimes it doesn’t. He’s started to pay a bit back, I’d say.’ Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy shakes hands with Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe before the game .

Bialkowski pulled off his save of the match in stoppage time, making a one-handed stop at full-stretch to reach substitute Yann Kermorgant’s header from another Ritchie corner. Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, but no-one is able to get a grip at the top of the Championship table. ‘I’ve not known a league change hands so much,’ Howe added. ‘I’ve not known it so tight. It’s crazy. I said a few weeks ago there could be plenty more twists and turns. ‘I think everyone is hoping they can be the team which breaks away. With so few games to go now it looks unlikely. It all goes down to the team who can hold their nerve the most and who can continue to avoid the pressure of what’s at stake.’","Freddie Sears put Ipswich ahead from close range after six minutes .

"Australia coach Darren Lehmann has defended his players following criticism of their behaviour during Sunday’s World Cup final win over New Zealand. Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin came under fire for his send-off of Kiwi opener Martin Guptill, and a photograph of Haddin and all-rounder James Faulkner mocking Grant Elliott after his dismissal cast a shadow over the Australian’s fifth World Cup triumph. Brad Haddin clapped in Martin Guptill's face after the New Zealand batsman was bowled during the final . But Lehmann insisted Haddin was following team orders. And he was able to cite the ICC’s failure to censure his team as evidence that they hadn’t gone over the top. ‘He’s copped a bit, hasn’t he?’ Lehmann said. ‘No one got reported out of the game, so we must have played it fair. It was a little bit disappointing, but people are entitled to their opinions and you’re going to have good and bad times. You accept that and you move on. ‘We’re happy with the way we played, obviously. We knew we wanted to be really aggressive against them, and look, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.’ Grant Elliott (left) was also given a less-than-sporting send-off by Haddin and James Faulkner (second right) Boorish behaviour on Sunday cast a shadow over the Australian’s fifth World Cup triumph . But Sportsmail’s David Lloyd, who is part of the ICC’s umpire selection panel, has added his voice to the chorus of criticism aimed at the Australians. ‘I was very disappointed at some of the behaviour in cricket’s showpiece event, particularly from the Australians,’ he said. ‘Watching it on my TV, and as a president of a local league, I know what will happen: this will be repeated in leagues across the land, because the players will think it’s macho. It’s not.’ Meanwhile, ICC president Mustafa Kamal has resigned after falling out with his colleagues. Kamal, a Bangladeshi, had labelled the ICC the ‘Indian Cricket Council’ after his side’s quarter-final loss to India was marred by questionable umpiring, and was barred from presenting the trophy at the MCG on Sunday.","Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin came under fire for send-off of Martin Guptill .

"Mark Wood spent a day this week donning his newly arrived England suit. ‘I wore it around the house a bit too much really but I was absolutely buzzing just to have it on. ‘Trying it on is when the mixture of nerves and excitement started,’ says Wood, one of the uncapped members of Alastair Cook’s squad who fly to the Caribbean on Thursday for a three-Test series against West Indies. The 25-year-old would be forgiven for checking the fit, because standing at 5ft 11in and weighing just over 12st, he is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler. Mark Wood has been called up by England for the Test series against West Indies . When he’s not steaming in to bowl at 90mph Mark Wood can find himself fielding for long stretches of time. Thankfully the Durham paceman has the perfect remedy to keep things interesting during a lengthy stint on the boundary rope. ‘There are times when it gets boring in the field, so I bring out the imaginary horse and try to joust my team-mates,’ Wood said recently. ‘I don’t know how the England boys will take it, but I’ll have a go. I like to have a trot and feed him apples — he loves Granny Smiths. ‘Sometimes it’s just the pick-me-up the lads need. The horse will probably come with me to the Caribbean if he gets through immigration. If they don’t like it then I can just tie him up and leave him somewhere.’ But England are looking for something different in the wake of their woeful World Cup and Wood, whose ability to hurry batsmen from a short run-up is reminiscent of Craig White and Simon Jones from previous eras, fits the bill. Several players on the county circuit last season would testify that he was the slipperiest bowler they faced. ‘I can hit 90mph but it’s not something I tend to concentrate on,’ said Wood. ‘The quickest ball I have been clocked at on the telly was 91 but I am sure I can bowl quicker than that. ‘You know yourself, without the speed guns, when it’s coming out lovely and the rhythm’s there. ‘When I bowl I am not just trying to blast people out, I would like to think that being the slight lad that I am with a short run-up, it is more the surprise element that gets batters in trouble. I tend to rush them a little bit but would like to think I have more skills than just raw pace.’ Primary among those skills is a mastery of reverse swing. It was no coincidence that his first three County Championship appearances for Durham all came at Trent Bridge, where the abrasive nature of the square roughs the ball up perfectly for exponents of the art. Durham paceman is not the shape or size of your traditional fast bowler . But he has also displayed a marked improvement in his use of the new ball, swinging it to good effect whenever he got it during the 2014 season. Previously, he faced a battle to prise it from the hands of his Durham team-mates Graham Onions and Chris Rushworth. So a marker of his progress was provided at the turn of this year when he was opening the bowling for England Lions on the tour of South Africa. That breakthrough moment on the field has been replicated off it, with Wood’s devotion to the ECB’s fitness regime enabling him to play a string of matches following a career punctuated by injuries, including stress fractures of the back, a cyst on his left ankle, knee trouble and side strains. ‘My body type has changed a lot since I was the lad who broke through into the first team,’ he said. ‘I have done two winters now where they have basically pumped us up in the gym to get us stronger and fitter. ‘I did a four-week camp in Potchefstroom, South Africa, before Christmas when I was smashing myself along with the other fast bowlers. That got me the Lions call-up and off that, maintaining that strength, got me the Test call-up.’ Wood has sought advice from former Durham and England fast bowler Steve Harmison . His first-class haul of 74 wickets at 26 runs apiece is creditable even if his number of appearances, 23, is a bit thin. But as he showed in taking four Australia A wickets in as many overs in a Durham win at Chester-le-Street three years ago, he has the knack of getting good players out. It may help him sneak ahead of Liam Plunkett or Chris Jordan in the pace pecking order. ‘I am not going to the West Indies to make the numbers up. I want to play a Test match, whether it be the first, middle or last one,’ he said. ‘It’s a good opportunity. As an England fan it has been frustrating to watch during the winter but everyone will agree that to put things right we have to start in the Caribbean.’ It was for the carnage created at Sabina Park, Jamaica, that Steve Harmison, another cricketing son of Ashington, was renamed Grievous Bodily Harmison 11 years ago. ‘There’s no pressure on us, is there?’ said Wood. ‘The last lad from Ashington took seven for 12. But if I get half of that I will be doing all right. Steve’s a family friend so he’s offered me advice on what the pitches will be like and how I should go about things. The main thing he told me is that the stumps don’t move — we had a bit of a joke about that because of the ball he bowled in Brisbane (the first delivery of the 2006-07 Ashes, which went straight to Andrew Flintoff at second slip) — his point being that if you make sure you get the first one on target you’ll be fine after that.’ They are big shoes to fill but Wood appears comfortable in his own.","Mark Wood part of the England squad flying to the Caribbean .

"England batsman Ian Bell has signed a three-year contract extension with Warwickshire that will keep him at the club until the end of the 2017 season. Bell signed his first contract with Warwickshire in 1999 after progressing through the youth ranks from the Under-11 team. The 32-year-old has gone on to play 105 Test matches and 161 one-day internationals for England. Ian Bell has won five trophies with Warwickshire, including the the County Championship in 2004 and 2012 . Bell said: 'As a Warwickshire man through and through, I'm absolutely delighted to commit to this fantastic club for another three years. 'I have many ambitions I'm still desperate to fulfil, both on a domestic and international level, and I look forward to hopefully achieving these over the coming years as a Bear.' Bell has won five trophies with Warwickshire, including the the County Championship in 2004 and 2012, the B&H Cup in 2002, the Clydesdale Bank 40 in 2010 and most recently the NatWest T20 Blast at Edgbaston last season. Bell (centre) leaves the field following England's World Cup loss to New Zealand in Wellington in February . He has scored 48 centuries in 246 first-class matches.

"Yorkshire have signed India international Cheteshwar Pujara until the end of May after cancelling the contract of Younis Khan. Younus was set to be Yorkshire's overseas signing for 2015, but the batsman is now looking to be part of Pakistan's potential touring party to Bangladesh, effectively ruling him out of any playing time in the LV= County Championship. Pujara will instead link up with the Division One champions - subject to receiving a work permit - having spent time at the back end of last season with Derbyshire, scoring 219 championship runs for them. Yorkshire director of cricket Martyn Moxon announced in a statement that Younus made his international intentions clear on Sunday, and added: 'We have moved quickly to bring in Pujara and he is a superb player. Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara has joined Yorkshire on a deal until the end of May . 'He is an outstanding young Test cricketer, who is hungry to perform in the English game. In the brief conversations I have had with him, he is very much looking forward to be joining Yorkshire and being part of our plans.' Pujara, 27, made his international Test debut in 2010, and with six centuries in the five-day game is a highly rated part of India's squad with many seeing him as the natural successor to Rahul Dravid. Pujara, who boasts nearly 9,000 first-class runs, will turn out for Yorkshire until Australian Aaron Finch is free of Indian Premier League commitments with Mumbai Indians. 'I was looking to return to the UK after my previous experience of county cricket, which I greatly enjoyed, and when Yorkshire made the offer I didn't think twice,' Pujara said. 'To wear the same white rose Sachin Tendulkar did is going to be a great feeling for me. I hope I can contribute to further success.'","Indian batsman joins Division One champions until end of May .

"Former Rangers striker Marco Negri has revealed he quit the Scottish giants after fearing he was HIV-positive. Negri joined the Ibrox outfit from Italian side Perugia for £3.5million in 1997, scoring a staggering 23 goals in his first 10 league games for the club. However, a series of injuries destabilised his career in Glasgow including a reserve match against Aberdeen on November 13, 2000. Ex-Rangers forward Marco Negri has revealed that he quit the club after fearing he had AIDS . Cosenza (Italy) - 19 goals in 34 league games - (1994-95) Perugia (Italy) - 33 in 60 - (1995-97) Rangers - 32 in 30 - (1997-2001) Vicenza (Italy, on loan) - 1 in 9 - (1999-00) Bologna (Italy) - 0 in 3 - (2001-02) Cagliari (Italy) - 2 in 5 - (2002) Livorno (Italy) 8 in 10 - (2002-03) Perugia - 0 in 3 - (2004-05) During the encounter the then 30-year-old forward was on the receiving end of a crunching tackle that caused his right shinbone to bleed profusely. After hospital tests and treatment for what was perceived as a 'deep wound', Negri returned to action in the New Year to train with the reserve team where he suffered a shooting pain in his right knee and leg. Further scans at Ross Hall Hospital showed an inflammation of the shinbone and more worryingly that properties of his blood had been attacked by a lymphogranuloma or lymphosarcoma - common symptoms for those that suffer with HIV/AIDS. However, in his imminent autobiography 'Moody Blue - The Story of the Mysterious Marco', which is serialised in the Daily Record; the now 44-year-old reveals that his worst fears weren't confirmed after flying to Italy for treatment. 'I was immediately hospitalised. I hadn’t even considered the possibility of being HIV positive but the harsh reality was there in front of me in the medical report, and it was hard to ignore and digest,' Negri wrote. In his  autobiography, Negri (left) reveals his nightmare started after a reserve match vs Aberdeen in 2000 . After months of hospital scans in Scotland, Negri (right) was told in Italy that his blood was absolutely fine . 'I didn’t feel able to deal with such a thing alone. I needed my family around me and wanted to undergo further tests in Italy to understand exactly what was going on, the risks and chances of recovery. 'I had to return to Italy, and not on a temporary basis. I asked my lawyer to speak to Rangers about an early dissolution of my contract. 'They had no objections to the premature ending of our relationship, which was something I really appreciated, although it also showed me how serious my condition was. 'Luckily, I didn’t have to wait long to learn I was simply suffering a stress fracture of the tibial axis of the knee. This diagnosis was given by doctors in Bologna. In Scotland they hadn’t got it right this time, even if the results of three blood tests confirmed some anomalies that couldn’t be overlooked. 'Further tests found my blood to be absolutely fine and there was no need for medication or invasive treatment. My drama had been resolved in the best way possible, and I put behind me the endless days of terror when the worst case scenario was swimming around in my head.'

Muliaina, who earned a century of caps for New Zealand before retiring after the 2011 World Cup, signed for Connacht at the beginning of the season and has made 11 appearances for the Irish province so far. Moments after his side's 14-7 loss at Kingsholm, the Kiwi veteran was led away to a police van with the entire incident broadcasted live on TV.

Muliaina's arrest was captured live on Sky Sports following the Challenge Cup quarter-final . Muliaina, who announced this week that he would be moving to Italian club Zebre next season, started at full-back against the Cherry and Whites playing 35 minutes before withdrawing with a leg injury just before half-time. Details of the alleged incident are yet to be confirmed but Muliaina was in action for Connacht against Cardiff on March 6 in a Guinness Pro12 clash at the Cardiff Arms Park. A spokesman for Gloucestershire Police said: 'A man in his 30s was arrested at Kingsholm Stadium on Friday 3rd April on suspicion of sexual assault in relation to an incident in Cardiff in March. 'The man has been handed over to officers from South Wales Police who are investigating the incident.' Connacht released a statement late on Friday night stating: 'Connacht Rugby can confirm that player Mils Muliaina is currently assisting the South Wales Police with enquiries relating to an alleged incident in Cardiff in March of this year. As this is a legal matter, Connacht Rugby will be making no further comment at this time. Muliaina earned 100 caps for New Zealand and retired following the 2011 World Cup on home soil . A powerful and skillful full-back, Muliaina made his Test debut when he appeared as a replacement in New Zealand's 15-13 loss to England in Wellington. The Samoa-born player quickly established himself as first-choice No 15 featuring in the subsequent Tri-Nations series and the 2003 World Cup. Muliaina was ever-present in the black jersey for the next few seasons and played a starring role in the All Blacks side that demolished the British and Irish Lions 3-0 in the 2005 series. The former Waikato Chiefs three-quarter was part of the New Zealand outfit which crashed out of the 2007 World Cup following a shock quarter-final loss to France at the Millennium Stadium. Israel Dagg's emergence seemed to spell the end of Muliaina's All Blacks career but he still made it to his third World Cup campaign in 2011 and played his final Test against Argentina in the quarter-final in Auckland winning his 100th cap in the process. A shoulder injury put an end to his tournament, however, as his country went on to lift the William Webb Ellis trophy. A two-year spell playing with NTT Docomo Red Hurricanes in Japan followed before he returned for second stint with the Chiefs back in New Zealand.

"On the eve of his 40th birthday, John Hartson has reflected on his battle with cancer and admitted his major health scare forced him to stop drinking as much, battle a gambling addiction and become a loyal husband.

In his column in the Scottish Sun, Hartson recalls how he felt 'as good as dead' upon receiving the news. Former Celtic striker John Hartson (centre) has reflected on how cancer made him change his life . Hartson (right) was diagnosed with testicular cancer that had spread to his brain and lungs in 2009 . Hartson admitted to having a gambling problem that he faced up to after beating cancer . 'When anyone goes through a life-changing experience they say it alters their perspective,' Hartson wrote. 'I virtually begged for a second chance at life. 'I’ll be honest with you here and now — I used to be a drinker, a s****er and a gambler. I’d have Sunday afternoons on the sauce when I’d down 11 pints and go home smashed. I was unfaithful to my wife.' The former Luton, Arsenal, West Ham and Celtic striker admitted cancer  forced him to face up to a gambling addiction and he changed his ways as he slowly recovered.

"Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has claimed that Red Bull have launched a bid to buy the Championship club. Cellino, who is currently serving a Football League disqualification, said that Leeds' majority shareholder Eleonora Sport was considering the offer. But Leeds chairman Andrew Umbers said he was not aware of an offer from Red Bull when contacted by BBC Radio Leeds on Saturday morning. Leeds United are the subject of a takeover bid from Red Bull, according to owner Massimo Cellino . Cellino told the Yorkshire Evening Post that majority shareholders Eleonora Sport were considering an offer . Cellino told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'There is an offer. I didn’t know about it but I spoke just now with Giampaolo Caboni, one of the directors of Eleonora Sport. 'He said Red Bull has made an offer for the club. The shareholder will have to think about it. I don’t know what they will do.' The soft drink giant already own three clubs - RB Leipzig in Germany, Red Bull Salzburg in Austria and MLS side New York Red Bulls - as well as two teams in Formula One. After being linked with a bid in November, Red Bull issued a statement saying: 'Red Bull has no plans to take over Leeds Utd nor take a stake in the club.'

"Steven Gerrard leaves his beloved Liverpool at the end of the season after an illustrious career and amazingly club legend Steve Heighway predicted that he'd be a success - in a newspaper article in 1992. The former England captain moves across the pond to MLS side LA Galaxy, where he embarks on a new challenge. A fresh-faced Gerrard was pictured in the paper at just 12-years-old, when he was an up and coming talent in Liverpool's academy. A young looking Steven Gerrard was pictured in the paper alongside the article written in 1992 . 'Outstanding potential has to be recognised and nurtured and Stephen Gerrard, a gem from Huyton, could be the next on our production line. 'He has enormous natural talent and is a Liverpool fan through and through. His attitude to coaching and personal development is a joy to see and our staff are genuinely excited by his prospects. 'Stephen has already been brought to the attention of the FA National Coaching staff as ""one for the future"" and no effort will be spared to create the right environment for him and his talents to develop at this club.' Heighway, who played for the club for 11 years in 1971, highlighted the importance of 'nurturing' the midfielder and described him as 'outstanding.' The former Ireland player  was reporting on a game between England Schoolboys and Republic of Ireland and cast his eye over a young Gerrard, touting him as a next generation gem. He wasn't wrong as his prediction was the midfielder has gone on to make 499 appearances for his boyhood team, winning a number of major honours.

"A Brazilian online football store claims to have next season's Chelsea kit for sale on its website - and it can be purchased with Gareth Bale's name on the back. The website has published three Chelsea kits with the incoming 'Yokohama' sponsor across the front, albeit without the Adidas emblem, the club's kit manufacturer. But perhaps most bizarrely, or interestingly from the perspective of Chelsea supporters, the alleged new kit can be bought with 'Bale 9' on the back. A Brazilian website is claiming to have the new Chelsea kit for sale, with Gareth Bale's name on the back . Bale (centre) has struggled at Real Madrid this season and reports have linked him with a return to England . The website has the new sponsor on the front of the kits but not the Adidas emblem . Bale's struggles at Real Madrid have been well documented, with fans and the Spanish media casting him as the man to blame as Ancelotti's stuttering side have been replaced atop La Liga by Barcelona. Reports both in England and Spain have linked the Wales international with a return to the Premier League. Skeptical Chelsea supporters who wish to purchase the kit without Bale's name on the back may also want to avoid getting one with a mention of Didier Drogba. Drogba's Chelsea deal expires at the end of the season and he has not yet signed a new contract . Drogba shirts can be bought despite his uncertain future, while Chelsea's away shirt (right) is also for sale .

"Darren Gough makes no secret that he'll always be the first man into bat for Kevin Pietersen no matter how sticky the wicket. England's ninth most successful wicket taker of all-time is a loyal friend to the controversial batsman and was best man at his wedding. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in a last-ditch bid to earn his place in England's Ashes squad this summer - and all eyes will be on Cardiff for the start of his campaign against Glamorgan in just over a fortnight. Darren Gough, Kevin Pietersen's close friend, says his pal only has a small chance of returning for England . Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in the hope of earning a place in the Ashes squad for England this summer . But Gough believes there is still only a slim chance of his friend adding to his tally of 104 Test match appearances when England start their Ashes series on the same ground a few months later. 'I would say it's a pretty small percentage chance of seeing Kevin playing for England again,' said Gough, who is taking part in the second Investec Ashes Cycle Challenge to raise funds for the Lord's Taverners in July, the UK's leading youth cricket and disability sports charity, with the inaugural event raising over £280,000 for the Lord's Taverners and other charities in 2013 . 'It requires England's batsman to fail in the West Indies and then again against New Zealand, which is obviously something no England fan wants. 'The new ECB chairman has given Kevin a lifeline and he's got to make the runs now and put the pressure on. Gough believes Pietersen will 'disappear to the Caribbean Premier League' if he doesn't get an England call . Gough says he has huge respect for Pietersen for pulling out of a big money deal in the India . 'Good luck to him, if the others fail and he scores hundred after hundred, which I think he would have to do, the dream might just come true for him but realistically I would say the door is shut. 'If Kevin isn't selected for the first Test against Australia then he will probably disappear to the Caribbean Premier League and that will be that. 'I have huge respect for him for making that call and pulling out of a big money deal in the Indian Premier League to give it a shot, it shows just how much he wants it. 'If he got to the point where he's retiring and he didn't give it that last go, I don't think he would have been able to deal with that mentally. 'It's similar to me when I left Essex to go back to Yorkshire, I had unfinished business in Yorkshire and I went back for a couple of years. 'I can live happily ever after on that because I went back and fulfilled what I wanted to achieve and it's the same for KP.' Controversial batsman Pietersen and current England coach Peter Moores have a fractious relationship . England face Australia in just under 100 days time - a team with soaring confidence after their World Cup win . Pietersen and current England coach Peter Moores have a fractious relationship but even proud Yorkeshireman Gough believes the former Lancashire coach must be give a bit more time - despite last month's World Cup horror show. Moores admits he's a man under pressure ahead of the three Test series in the Caribbean, which starts in Antigua in just under two weeks. And it doesn't get any easier with two Test and five one-day internationals against in-form New Zealand followed by the arrival of Darren Lehman's Australia in just under 100 days time - a team whose confidence is soaring. 'We've got a good coach with England and he knows what he is doing but his personality is more about percentages,' added Gough. 'He gets a lot of stick about stats but every team uses stats.' Gough plans to competes in the Investec Ashes Cycle Challenge to raise funds for Lord's Taverners charity . While England toil this summer Gough has other plans as he competes in the Investec Ashes Cycle Challenge which will raises funds for the Lord's Taverners charity. Gough, the first to admit he's not got the physique for lycra, will lead a cricketing peleton as they cycle between England's Test match grounds over four days this summer, with the challenge taking place between 12 and 15 July 2015 and will cover over 300 miles between the famous 2005 Ashes venues, with the Kia Oval the finish line in four months' time. 'I'm okay on a motorbike but a bike is going to be a big challenge,' he said. 'We are hoping to raise enough funds to buy five minibuses that can be used to help disadvantaged and disabled children get into sport. 'I've always liked a challenge and when it's raising money for a wonderful cause you want to get involved.'

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini accepts his side are now facing a fight to stay in the Champions League places. City appear to have lost too much ground to Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race and their recent form has led to a further worry, with the sides behind them catching fast. The fading champions could even find themselves in fourth place before they next play - at Crystal Palace on Monday - if results go against them over the weekend. Manuel Pellegrini (centre) shakes hands with David Silva during Manchester City training . Martin Demichelis (left), Wilfried Bony (centre) and Fernando during Friday's session . Frank Lampard (right) looks to play a pass as he and his team-mates are put through their paces . This is not a battle they envisaged having to fight at the start of the campaign but Pellegrini realises nothing can be taken for granted after a frustrating second half of the season. Pellegrini said: 'I think in this league you can never be sure you are going to have a Champions League place. You have six or seven teams that, from the beginning, all of them play for that position. 'At the moment, for the whole year, we have been in a position of the Champions League. I hope that we will continue.' Pellegrini believes his side are now in a battle for the Champions League places and not the title . Manchester City have struggled to keep up with Chelsea, who are closing in on the Premier League trophy . The ramifications of dropping out of the top four, however, are not really something Pellegrini wants to consider, given that he still has hopes of landing the title. With just eight games remaining and a significant deficit to make up on Chelsea that looks a forlorn task, but Pellegrini is not giving up. The Chilean said: 'Of course if we want to continue in the first position of the table we must not drop any more points. It is easy to say but not easy to do it. 'We just know that from now until the end of the season we will try to win all the games and we will see if we can do it. We have to play eight finals from now until the end.' Sergio Aguero has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks but will hope to find the net on Monday . James Milner is in line to return after withdrawing from the England squad with a knee problem . City will hope to be at full strength for the trip to Selhurst Park. Pellegrini reported nothing other than 'small problems' when asked about any injury concerns at his pre-match press conference. That means a likely return for key midfielder Yaya Toure, who missed the 3-0 victory over West Brom a fortnight ago with an Achilles problem but has since played for Ivory Coast. Fellow midfielder James Milner has also been troubled by a knee problem in recent weeks - and withdrew from England's midweek friendly in Italy - but the issue is not thought serious.","Manuel Pellegrini says his side are  in a fight for the Champions League .

"Harry Kane should not go to the Under-21 European Championship with England this summer, instead saving himself for Roy Hodgson's first team, according to Kenny Dalglish. Kane won his first senior caps for England last week, but is still eligible for Gareth Southgate's Young Lions. But Dalglish believes he has proven himself capable of making the step up, and should be kept fresh for the full European Championships in 2016. Harry Kane celebrates after scoring his first England goal, just moments after coming off the bench . Kane showed against Italy that he can cope with playing against some of the world's best defenders . Kane is ready to be a permanent member of the full squad, rather than the Under-21s, says Kenny Dalglish . 'Harry Kane doesn’t need to go back to playing Under-21 football,' said Dalglish in The Mirror. 'He proved that the other night against a defence which included two players from Italy’s best team, Juventus - he didn’t look bad, did he?' 'Playing Under-21 football this summer won’t help him. It will just tire him out.' The former Liverpool and Blackburn boss claimed that the Young Lions have done their job if they produce a player ready for the first team, and neither Kane, nor the other eligible players, should be bounced between the two squads. 'I don’t think the Under-21s is there to win tournaments - although it’s nice if you do, and you don’t want to encourage someone that losing is good. 'But it is more important you look at the individual, and if Roy Hodgson thinks Kane is going to be part of his squad for Euro 2016, then that is what they should be gearing towards.'

"Arsene Wenger says that Arsenal will have to be perfect until the end of the season if they want to challenge for the title — but maintains that they will be ready if Chelsea slip. Arsenal thrashed Liverpool 4-1 at home with goals from Hector Bellerin, Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Olivier Giroud and are seven points behind Chelsea, with the Premier League leaders having to visit The Emirates in two weeks’ time — although Jose Mourinho’s team still have a game in hand. And Wenger says his team have to focus on winning every game in order to be ready for any setbacks that Chelsea may suffer. Arsene Wenger is not letting his team get ahead of themselves despite an excellent win on Saturday . Hector Bellerin celebrates after putting Arsenal 1-0 ahead against Liverpool in the first half on Saturday . ‘If the opportunity presents itself, we will have to be perfect and Chelsea have to be not perfect,’ said Wenger. ‘The only thing which we can master is to be perfect. Chelsea have a difficult programme and so do we. ‘We want to keep the momentum — win, win, win and win again. We know the top four is in our hands now. The title is not in our hands. We are looking up, but we are looking at our next game because that is all we can control. What we can master mathematically is the top four. Let’s focus on what we can master — our own performance.’ Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers praised Raheem Sterling, despite Liverpool's heavy defeat . Liverpool won their penalty after Sterling (top) was fouled by Bellerin (bottom) in the second half . But Wenger insisted that the performance against Liverpool demonstrated that had they not be hampered by injuries and the late return of World Cup winners Ozil and Per Mertesacker, then they would have been closer to Chelsea in the table. ‘We have moved forward,’ he said. ‘We missed important players at the start of the season when we dropped too many points. When you look at the points we’ve made since everyone is back, I believe that shows you we have the quality to fight at the top.’ Mesut Ozil scored a glorious second for Arsenal with a sumptuous free-kick on 40 minutes . Meanwhile, it has emerged that Liverpool must give Raheem Sterling’s first club, QPR, up to £15 million of the profits if they sell the 20-year-old. The winger, who has controversially put contract talks on hold at Anfield, has admitted that he has been flattered to be linked with Arsenal. Liverpool agreed a 25 percent sell-on clause with QPR when they signed Sterling in 2010 as a 15-year-old for £500,000. It means QPR would be entitled to £12.375m if Sterling is sold for £50m and is seen as an important reason why Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is keen to keep the talented winger.

"Consumers could soon have to pay goods and services tax (GST) on their movie and music downloads in a government moves to reel in extra billions of dollars in revenue. Treasurer Joe Hockey said the states had agreed to work toward applying the 10 per cent GST to movies and music downloaded from streaming services such as Netflix and Apple. The changes may also affect consumers buying any products for less than $1,000 online from overseas, thus affecting companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and eBay. But consumer advocacy group Choice says tech-savvy Australian consumers might be able to avoid the tax by concealing their location through virtual private networks, which make them appear to be outside the country. Scroll down for video . Australian movie and music downloaders could soon be slapped with a 10 per cent tax in a move that could reel in billions of additional GST revenue for the federal government . Choice argues that the government should instead be tackling the exorbitant domestic costs of TV shows, music and movies, and difficulties accessing them.

It comes after News Corp Australia chief executive Julian Clarke slammed the foreign companies' ability to avoid paying tax, consequently leading to an unlevelled playing field in the advertising market.

"Arsenal moved nine points clear of their top four rivals Liverpool on Saturday afternoon with a 4-1 win at home in the Premier League. Goals from Hector Bellerin, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez put the Gunners 3-0 ahead, before Jordan Henderson pulled one back from the penalty spot for the visitors. Olivier Giroud completed the scoreline with a sumptuous strike in injury time. Here, Sportsmail's Matt Barlow casts his eye over the two teams' performances at the Emirates. Arsenal (4-2-3-1) DAVID OSPINA - 6.5 . No shots to save first half, although out smartly once or twice. Made a flying save to thwart Can in the second-half and almost saved Jordan Henderson's penalty. HECTOR BELLERIN - 6.5 . Scored a wonderful goal with his left foot. Unfortunate to be booked for a foul by Mathieu Flamini and then lucky not to be sent off for a foul on Sterling which conceded penalty. Hector Bellerin celebrates after putting Arsenal 1-0 ahead against Liverpool in the first half on Saturday . PER MERTESACKER - 6.5 . Coped quite well with the nimble trio of Liverpool strikers. LAURENT KOSCIELNY - 6 . Performed well until replaced early in second half by Gabriel. NACHO MONREAL - 7 . Solid defensive display, up against Lazar Markovic and Philippe Coutinho. FRANCIS COQUELIN - 7 . Offered vital bite in midfield, especially during period midway through first half when Liverpool were at their best. Alexis Sanchez celebrates after netting the Gunners third on the stroke of half-time at the Emirates . SANTI CAZORLA - 6.5 . Heavily involved in the middle of midfield, but without any of the creative frills which often decorate this game. Early shot forced a save. Hit a post late in game. AARON RAMSEY - 7 . Started very well, wide on the right. Missed a good chance after a Kolo Toure mistake and set-up Alexis Sanchez's goal with a neat touch. Faded and replaced early. ALEXIS SANCHEZ - 7 . All action as ever, including a fabulous strike before half time make it 3-0. MESUT OZIL - 7.5 . Produced silky touches and a brilliant free-kick for the second which put Arsenal in control. Mesut Ozil added a glorious second for Arsenal with a sumptuous free-kick on 40 minutes . Ozil was all smiles as he celebrated his strike in a silky personal display from the midfielder . Ozil (right) posted on Instagram after the match: 'Seven wins in a row! and so happy!' OLIVIER GIROUD - 7 . Forced early mistake from Toure which his team failed to capitalise on. Denied in the second half by a good reflex save. Scored the fourth with another stunner. SUBS: GABRIEL (for Koscielny 49 min); FLAMINI (for Ramsey), WELBECK (for Ozil) Subs not used: Macey, Gibbs, Rosicky, Walcott. MANAGER: ARSENE WENGER - 7 . Wonderful first half for the Arsenal boss, but his team do not have the knack of killing a game. There will always be chances to score. Sent on Flamini in a bid to protect the clean sheet, but Liverpool got one back. Olivier Giroud (right) added a late fourth with a brilliant strike to complete the scoreline for the Gunners . Liverpool (3-4--2-1) SIMON MIGNOLET - 5.5 . Beaten three times in eight minutes before the break, but made fine early saves from Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey as well as a splendid reaction save from Olivier Giroud in the second half. EMRE CAN - 5 . Not comfortable on the right of three centre-halves or at right-back where he played after the break. Sent off for two yellow cards, the second a stupid tackle from behind on Danny Welbeck, near the corner flag. Emre Can (right) was sent off late in the second half for Liverpool to compound a miserable afternoon . Liverpool's Kolo Toure (centre) had a torrid afternoon in defence on his return to his former club . KOLO TOURE - 4.5 . Error-strewn performance defined Liverpool’s first-half. Escaped an early mistake which gave Ramsey a chance but not others. Better in back four in second half. MAMADOU SAKHO - 5 . Erratic as if disturbed playing alongside Toure in absence of Martin Skrtel. JORDAN HENDERSON - 6 . Did not contribute a great deal from right-wing-back in the first half, but more involved when he moved forward in the second half. Scored from the spot and returned to right-back after Emre Can’s red card. Jordan Henderson pulled one back for the Reds from the penalty spot on 79 minutes at the Emirates . JOE ALLEN - 6 . Ticked over in midfield. Won some tackles and passed it well, but did not protect his defence when they needed help. LUCAS LEIVA - 5.5 . First start in two months and very sluggish and wasteful in the early exchanges. Like Joe Allen, better in second half, but the game had gone by this point. ALBERTO MORENO - 5.5 . Offered nothing in attack and unreliable in defence. Easily beaten by Hector Bellerin for the opening goal. LAZAR MARKOVIC - 5 . Flickered on the counter-attack but opted to pass to Sterling when clean through and ought to have shot. Replaced at half-time. Lazar Markovic (left) wasted a glorious chance to give Liverpool the lead and was substituted at half-time . PHILIPPE COUTINHO - 5 . Unable to impose himself. One pass to Markovic created a first-half chance. Nice touches, here and there but nothing more. RAHEEM STERLING - 6 . Bright and well poised on the ball. Movement good and influential when moved to the left after the break. Won penalty. Liverpool won the penalty after Raheem Sterling (top) was fouled by Bellering (bottom) in the second half . SUBS: DANIEL STURRIDGE (HT for Markovic) Liverpool were better with him on. 6. Subs not used: Jones, Johnson, Lovren, Manquillo, Brannagan, Borini. MANAGER: BRENDAN RODGERS - 6 . Awful first half for his team in absence of  Skrtel and Steven Gerrard. Started badly, improved a little but beaten by three terrific goals in eight minutes. Switched from back-three to back-four to try and get back into the match as well as sending Daniel Sturridge on in response. But it was over when Can was dismissed. REFEREE: ANTHONY TAYLOR - 6.5 . There were mistakes and he missed small things, but overall let it flow. Got the penalty right and the red card, but made a mess of Bellerin’s cards.","Arsenal beat top four rivals Liverpool 4-1 at the Emirates on Saturday .

"A section  of Arsenal and Liverpool fans left their seats empty at the Emirates Stadium for the first 10 minutes of their lunchtime Barclays Premier League clash in a protest against ticket prices. Supporters from both clubs say they are 'disgusted' at the continuing rise of ticket prices, with the protest coming in the aftermath of the announcement of the Premier League's £5.14billion TV rights deal with banners held up inside and outside the ground. With tickets at the sold-out Emirates starting from £64 for the 12.45pm kick-off, protesters hope the image of empty seats around the ground will raise awareness of the struggles fans face to meet the rising costs of following their clubs. Fans inside the Emirates Stadium display a banner reading: '£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket' The cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were £64, some of the highest prices in the Premier League . Supporters of both sides gathered outside the 60,000-capacity stadium before kick-off to show off banners against the rising costs of modern football. A banner inside the stadium, held between the home and away ends, read: '£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket'. Ahead of the game, Kelvin Meadows of Arsenal's Black Scarf Movement - who organised the event with Liverpool's Spirit of Shankly and Spion Kop 1906 fan groups - called ticket prices 'extortionate'. 'In the pursuit of money football has sold it's soul,' he said. 'The fans are that soul and no one cares about the match going fans. Arsenal and Liverpool fans unite outside the Emirates Stadium in a protest against ticket prices . Fans show off a banner reading 'FOOTBALL WITHOUT FANS IS NOTHING' outside the stadium before kick-off . 'We put up with late fixture changes, unreasonable kick off times and ridiculously high prices. We do it 'cos of the love of our team. 'But the tide is turning. Old rivalries are being put aside as fans from all clubs come together. Away fans help make the event but have to pay extortionate prices. Then we're told to ""sit down, shut up"".' Roy Bentham of Spirit of Shankly said: 'We want tangible reductions in line with what working class people earn. We may lose a generation or more of fans otherwise unless the footballing authorities wake up.' Further protests are expected after full-time at the Emirates.","Arsenal and Liverpool fans left seats empty at kick-off as part of a protest .

"Prosecutors say they're dismissing almost three dozen criminal cases connected to four  Fort Lauderdale police officers who lost their jobs following an investigation into a racist video and text messages. The Broward State Attorney's Office reported on Thursday that they had already dropped 12 felony cases, 19 criminal misdemeanor cases and one juvenile case involving one or more of the officers. Nearly 20 more dismissals expected. The arresting officers in the cases, which include burglary, cocaine possession and aggravated assault with a firearm, are no longer on the police force. Scroll down for video . Criminal cases connected to four former Fort Lauderdale police officers have been dismissed after an investigation into a racist video and messages sent by the four cops. Above, Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Frank Adderley (far right) speaks about three of the officers' firings at a press conference in March . All of the four officers committed misconduct involving racist texts 'exchanged among themselves and former police officers', Chf Adderley said. Above, in this text, Christopher Sousa refers to killing n******' In another text message, Holding writes: 'Id have that noose ready' - in reference to black men. Jason Holding, James Wells and Christopher Sousa, all of Fort Lauderdale. were fired in March for 'department misconduct'. Alex Alvarez resigned in January . Officials say 22-year-old Alex Alvarez resigned, while 30-year-old James Wells, 31-year-old Jason Holding and 25-year-old Christopher Sousa were fired after a five-month investigation, according to The South Florida Sun Sentinel. The investigation began after a woman - Alvarez's former fiancee - filed a complaint in October. The series of text messages were filled with the N-word and other slurs, and the video included a doctored image of President Barack Obama wearing gold teeth, images of a Ku Klux Klan hood and a police dog attacking a black man. In their cellphone messages, the officers sent each other 'racial, sexist and ethically inappropriate' images and other content, including offensive comments against both Hispanics and homosexuals. They also 'criticized their coworkers' grammar, appearance, work ethic and referred to an entire shift as lazy (expletives)'. And they even talked about killing and injuring black people, CBS reported. In one text, Sousa reportedly wrote: 'Holdings we are coming and drinking all your beer and killing n******.' In another, Holding said: 'Id have that noose ready (sic)', according to the Sun Sentinel. Officer Alex Alvarez, 22, who apparently created the video (pictured: a still), resigned from the city's force in late January - before the investigation into he and his colleagues' exchanges was complete . The video for the fictitious 'The Hoods' film, which apparently used the N-word repeatedly, featured pictures of a wanted poster for 'an escaped slave' and black men looking down the barrel of a gun (pictured) The video also included photos of black men being bitten by a dog (pictured), a police investigation determined . The disturbing footage, which apparently used the N-word repeatedly, also featured pictures of a wanted poster for 'an escaped slave' and a caricature of President Obama with gold-capped teeth. All of the four officers involved in the case committed misconduct involving racist texts 'exchanged among themselves and former police officers', Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Frank Adderley said . Chief Adderley, who is African-American, added that the officers did not engage in criminal behavior, 'but their conduct was inexcusable and there is zero tolerance for this kind of behavior' in the force. A spokesman for the state attorney's office says all of the dropped cases involve black defendants. Sherman Bynes is one of the defendants whose criminal case has been dismissed. He was arrested by Holding in March 2014 . 'This is a serious matter. We continue to review each case in which these former policemen were the principal officers involved in the arrest,' spokesman Ron Ishoy told the Sun Sentinel. 'We are dropping charges against the defendants where it is appropriate.' One of the first felony cases dropped was Holding's arrest of Sherman Bynes, 36, in March 2014. Gordan Weekes, a chief assistant in the city's public defender's office called the arrest 'a classic case of driving while black'. Bynes was pulled over by Holding after rolling through a stop sign in a new Kia owned by the rental car company he worked for. Holding called for a police dog to search the car and Bynes's person and found a baggie of marijuana in Bynes' pocket and 14 grams of marijuana, a digital scale and several small plastic bags in a backpack in the trunk. He also said that Bynes was not wearing his seat belt. Holding arrested Bynes, who was charged with possession with intent to sell cannabis and traffic violations. Bynes said Holding was 'extremely aggressive toward him in his demeanor,' but used no racially offensive language during the stop, according to Bynes's lawyer. 'Holding's bias was insurmountable as he was clearly engaging in racially predatory policing that was consistent with his offensive text conversations,' Weekes said. Broward Public Defender Howard Finkelstein said that between January 1, 2014, and the time the officers left the force, they were involved in 56 felony arrests of black and other minority suspects. Chief Adderley (pictured) revealed the four officers had told him they had been just joking around. 'Based on the investigation, they felt, in their words, that it was a joke,' he said at a news conference in March . The three fired officers are disputing their termination from the force and are trying to get their jobs back. They have arbitration hearings on April 15. Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler said in March that he was 'very disappointed, disgusted and shocked' by the inquiry's findings, describing the officers as 'a few bad apples' in a 'diverse' police department. He added city and department leadership had agreed that the multiple sackings were appropriate. Meanwhile, City Manager Lee Feldman said: 'It's extremely unfortunate that these acts of racism and hatred took place'. He also expressed his thanks toward Alvarez's fiancée for coming forward. The police department in south-east Florida, which has around 500 agents, has now created a human diversity class that all officers must attend on an annual basis in the wake of the incident. The Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #31 represents the officers. FOP President Jack Lokeinsky said everyone is entitled to due process, and the officers have the right to a fair review of the facts.

"A desperate leukaemia patient is lying over hot coals every day in the hope it will kill off cancer cells. Jia Binhui, 25, cannot afford hospital treatment and hopes his alternative treatment will fight the deadly disease. He claims experts advised him that temperatures higher than 42 degrees Celsius can kill the cancerous cells in his body, according to the People's Daily Online. Brave: Jia Binhui, who cannot afford hospital treatment, hopes his home-made alternative treatment will fight the deadly disease . He built a human barbecue in his garden in Yunlong County in southwest China's Yunnan Province, which he lies on above a fire below, like a spit roast. Jia, who was diagnosed with blood cancer in 2013, has had a bone marrow transplant, costing £55,000, which was funded by well-wishers. Coming from a family of poor farm workers, further hospital treatments have used up his remaining funds.

But it's nearly impossible to keep water constantly at 42 degrees Celsius, so I'm using this method instead' he said. Jai added that he will continue using this unorthodox treatment before returning to the hospital to see if his condition has improved.","Jia Binhui cannot afford hospital treatment for deadly disease .

The bus came under armed attack as it drove to the airport following an away match at Caykur Rizespor in Turkey's Super Lig. Fener said on their official website the bus driver was wounded in the attack and taken to hospital and there was no mention of any injuries to anyone else.

The injured driver, with blood seeping from a head wound, seeks help  after the attack . A statement on the club's official website on Sunday said: 'We consider that as long as this attack is not solved in a way that satisfies Fenerbahce and public opinion, a suspension of the championship is inevitable. 'Blood ran and football was silenced. Finding and punishing the culprits is of vital importance for Fenerbahce.' Following the incident, Fener midfielder Mehmet Topal told Sky News: 'We cheated death. God protect us. I hope our driver will be all right. Words fail me. It's unbelievable.' The club posted several pictures of the bus on their website after the attack which showed a shattered side window and damage to the front windscreen.

"Fran Kirby staked an impressive claim for a World Cup starting role with England Women as she created the first goal and scored a brilliant second in a 2-1 win over China. England began in thrilling style, with Kirby fashioning the opener for strike partner Jodie Taylor after just a minute of play. Reading striker Kirby then fired home the second goal of her short international career - this was her eighth cap - to put the home side in apparently full control at Manchester City's Academy Stadium. Jodie Taylor celebrates following her opening minute strike against China in Manchester . But as 5,665 watched on, England struggled to build on their early assault on the China goal. Wang Shanshan cut China's arrears after shaky defending, and might have had an equaliser in the second half but mis-kicked as England feared the worst. Kirby, a 21-year-old playing in the second division of the Women's Super League, was impressive throughout, a nimble-footed presence who China struggled to deal with. She was player of the match when England played the United States in February, and was again arguably a class apart, although this time midfielder Jill Scott took the champagne. Fran Kirby (left) is congratulated by her England team-mates after she netted the second goal for his side . China were caught cold when Kirby dribbled the ball down the left and curved a tremendous ball with the outside of her right boot to Taylor, who fired past Zhang Yue for the early opener. The architect turned predator to put the hosts 2-0 in front in the 10th minute, meeting a right-wing cross from Jordan Nobbs with a clever touch on her chest that took out her marker before smashing home from 10 yards. Just two minutes later the lively Reading striker, with 10 goals in her last three club matches, forced Zhang to push away a 20-yard drive. Jade Moore hit the left post after a hopeless kick out from Zhang, and England were rampant. Kirby was in imperious form during the first half as she created the first goal and scored the second . That changed once China cut the deficit after 16 minutes, with hesitant defending at a corner allowing Wang to head past Siobhan Chamberlain from close range. Chamberlain had to save well to turn away a free-kick from Li Dongna before the break, with defensive insecurities becoming a worrying feature of England's game. This was England's last home game before Mark Sampson's squad head to Canada in May, ahead of a World Cup campaign that begins against France in Moncton on June 9. England made their first change after 61 minutes as Toni Duggan, on her home ground, replaced Jade Moore. Shanshan Wang races away to celebrate after she pulled a goal back for China in the 16th minute . Kirby almost created a third goal but her cutback after a run down the left went just astray of white shirts. Alex Greenwood prodded a corner just over the China bar, and Duggan headed at Zhang, as chances began to arrive more frequently for England. Kirby departed, with the experienced Eni Aluko taking her place, Wang missed her sitter, and England clung on, the world's sixth-ranked team fending off a side rated 16th globally by FIFA. Ellen White, introduced in stoppage time, won her 50th cap.","Jodie Taylor fired England into the lead in the opening minute .

"Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney added to his collection of wonder goals at Old Trafford with a stunning strike in a 3-1 win against Aston Villa that lifted his side above Manchester City into third place in the Premier League. United were leading 1-0 after 79 minutes when Rooney spun brilliantly before hammering a half-volley with his right-foot past Brad Guzan. It was his sixth goal in eight matches for United since being restored up front by manager Louis van Gaal after a spell in midfield.

"Wayne Rooney knows Champions League qualification is Manchester United's to lose, making this weekend's clash with Aston Villa all the more important. Louis van Gaal's side sit fourth in the Barclays Premier League standings as the season enters the closing stages, boasting a five-point cushion over the chasing pack after winning so impressively at Liverpool before the international break. Juan Mata's brace earned United a deserved 2-1 triumph at Anfield to give them a buffer over the Reds, as well as fellow top-four contenders Southampton and Tottenham. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney feels the club are on course to qualify for the Champions League . United midfielder Juan Mata scored a fantastic brace against Liverpool to secure his side a 2-1 win at Anfield . The second of Mata's goals was a brilliant improvised scissor kick to give United a 2-0 lead in the second-half . However, Rooney is well aware how quickly things can change, admitting nothing less than victory will suffice when Aston Villa come to Aston Villa on Saturday. 'Yes it was (a six-pointer at Liverpool), but that means nothing if we don't beat Aston Villa on Saturday,' the United captain said. 'Obviously Arsenal play Liverpool as well, so if we can get the win against Villa that will be an even better result than Liverpool was for us. 'I think there are still eight games left. We are in a good position at the minute so it's in our own hands, so have to make sure we do it.' Rooney and several of his United team-mates only returned home from international duty on Wednesday afternoon after a technical fault on the England team plane delayed their departure from Turin. It meant an extra night in Italy, where it looked like they would be leaving after a night to forget as Graziano Pelle punished the Three Lions' poor first-half display. However, Andros Townsend's wonder strike saw England secure a 1-1 draw following a much-improved performance after half-time, when Roy Hodgson's bold substitutions paid off - as did his decision to partner Rooney with full debutant Harry Kane. The England skipper had spent the first half in midfield role as Hodgson tinkered with his side, although he is not allowing that experimentation to be an excuse. 'I think it's important in tournament football you might need that, so that's what we were doing,' the 29-year-old said. Rooney competes for the ball with Italy defender Andrea Ranocchia during Tuesday's international friendly . Rooney runs forward with the ball during the friendly match at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on Tuesday . 'We were trying a few different things out because you never know with injuries and suspensions in tournament football. The best time to do it is obviously in the friendlies. 'You could clearly see in the first half that it didn't work so I think the manager made good changes at the right time which helped us to get back into the game. 'Obviously I haven't played in midfield for a few weeks. Sometimes it is difficult to go from up front to midfield or from midfield to up front - sometimes it does take time. 'I had a few chances and could have scored, so I felt I played better when I went up front.' United team-mate Phil Jones was another to struggle away from his preferred position, looking lost at times at the base of the diamond. He looked more assured when he dropped back into defence after Chris Smalling complained of feeling unwell and was replaced by Michael Carrick late in the opening period. The 33-year-old had not played for England since October 2013 before these matches and Rooney loves having his club-mate around. 'I felt Michael Carrick was the best player on the pitch by a mile,' he said. 'He gave us great composure, he slowed the game down when we needed to and started our attacks really well.' Asked if Carrick has been under-rated throughout his career, Rooney said: 'Not from me and certainly not from Manchester United fans. 'I think he is a fantastic player. He has been a big reason why, at United, we have won so many trophies over the last few years. So from myself and his team-mates, he has not been under-estimated.'

"Mourinho with his wife Matilde Faria at the 2014 Victoria's Secret Fashion show in London . Chelsea football manager Jose Mourinho has revealed that he talks to God every day, but never about football and never discusses the game with his wife. The father-of-two said that he and his family 'know about poverty' and have been privileged to have worked with the Word Food Programme as an ambassador against hunger. The 52-year-old football manager said that he tries his best to separate his professional and his family life. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Mourinho admitted that he has a strong faith in God. 'I believe totally, clearly. Every day I pray; every day I speak with Him. I don’t go to the church every day, not even every week. I go when I feel I need to. And when I’m in Portugal, I always go.' The former Real Madrid manager said he only prays for things in is personal life, never about Chelsea. 'I can say the reality is I never go to the church to speak with Him about football. Never!' Despite his intensely arrogant persona on the sideline, Mourinho claims that he is a good person. 'I think so. I try to be. And I think I am. I don’t have problems with family or friends. I am a good family person; I am a good friend. I try to support people that I don’t even know. 'Do I make mistakes? Yes. My professional area is not only very competitive – it is competitive and emotional and [you must] push people for a certain kind of behaviour – absolutely, yes. But the professional life is only part of a person; a person is much more than that.' Chelsea are currently top of the league and are playing struggling QPR this weekend. Earlier this season, Mourinho was fined £25,000 by football authorities for claiming there was a 'campaign' against Chelsea after Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving against Southampton.

"A young English cricket fan who wrote a letter to Richie Benaud asking for tips on spin bowling almost 20 years ago has shared the Australian cricket great's response in the wake of his death. Jonathan Stevenson was just 16 years old when he asked for Benaud's advice on left-handed leg spin and he shared the lengthy response on Twitter on Friday as a tribute to the 'great man'.

Accompanying the letter from Benaud, dated September 27, 1996, was a full sheet of notes about spin bowling for left-hand bowlers. 'Your letter was timely because it was the first from a left-hander and it reminded me that there is a difference in coaching and not just in the fact that one youngster might bowl with the right hand and another with the left,' Benaud wrote. 'The ball, although coming out of the hand in the same manner and going in the same direction towards the batsmen, in fact spins differently for the two types of bowlers.'

He was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets. 'I hope you enjoy your cricket and your bowling,' Benaud said. 'Yes, the left-arm over-the-wrist bowler who spins the ball into the right-hander from outside the off-stump is said to have bowled a Chinaman. The same bowler who spins one away from the right-hander has bowled a wrong'un.' After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia .

'If I knew, when I was at school and playing in my early cricket days, the problems that would have come if I didn't do something about protection of the head and using sunscreens and all sorts of things like that, I'd have played it differently.

Benaud scored three Test centuries and once hit 11 sixes in a first class innings. As captain he led Australia to four consecutive series victories, beginning with a 4-0 demolition of Peter May's 1958-59 tourists (Benaud took 31 wickets in the five tests).

"Ukip's election campaign chief has admitted that the party sometimes resembles a 'rugby club on tour' with members who can be 'boorish' and 'chauvinistic'. Patrick O'Flynn, who is also the party's economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to 'work harder' as it is 'lagging' behind with female voters. As he launched the party's 'policies for women' alongside the Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans and MEP Diane James, Mr O'Flynn was forced to defend its 'blokeish' image under Nigel Farage. Patrick O'Flynn, who is also the party's economics spokesman, said Ukip needs to 'work harder' as it is 'lagging' behind with female voters . Polls suggest around 15 per cent of men are planning to back Ukip, compared to only 10 per cent of women. Mr O'Flynn: 'Nigel has said sometimes Ukip has resembled a rugby club on tour. I think that's becoming less and less true and indeed the two top rank female politicians sitting alongside me today are two of the main reasons for that. 'But we need to work harder and there still are occasions where people in the party, men in the party, who should know better, have occasionally resorted to boorishness or chauvinism. When that happens I make sure I express my own displeasure. 'We're a very fast-growing party, we're increasing our attraction – it clearly is daft for us to see a political context where we're not maximising our support in every potential group. 'And, as set out today, there is no reason why we should be lagging with female voters – we still are, we've got to work harder on addressing those issues and we are doing.' The event was delayed after the Ukip-branded backdrop collapsed minutes before the press conference was due to begin, sparking frantic work to rebuild the set. Ukip leader Nigel Farage is often photographed smoking cigarettes and drinking pints of beer . The party used the event confirm a raft of policies, including removing VAT from sanitary products, which they have dubbed a 'tampon tax'. It also said it would give 'absolute, full and unconditional' support for current maternity and paternity leave laws, as well as making sure maternity wards are 'properly resourced'. Ms James said the party would tackle the problem of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she warned is 'accepted cultural practice' for some of 'our ethnic compatriots'. Mrs Evans, who is writing the party's election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on 'lies' and 'myths' spread about the party. She said: 'I think it is because of the lies the other parties have put out about us. 'There is this myth we will scrap maternity leave, that we hate women, that we don't do anything for women - I think Diane and I are living proof. 'Unfortunately the propaganda the other parties put about has hit very hard and very deep.' Suzanne Evans, who is writing the party's election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on 'lies' and 'myths' spread about the party . Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom was forced out of the party in September 2013 after branding women who do not clean behind the fridge as 'sluts'. Mr Farage, who was absent from the women's event, has previously been criticised for controversial remarks about breast-feeding and whether women are less valuable to employers after they have been on maternity leave.

"Brendan Rodgers has criticised Raheem Sterling’s advisor, suggesting that the player is being manipulated by outside forces and that he would be inclined to stay at Liverpool if left to make a decision alone. With Liverpool losing 4-1 at Arsenal on Saturday and seeing their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League next season effectively ending, Rodgers made veiled criticisms of the player’s agent, Aidy Ward, after the televised interview Sterling gave last week, in which he admitted he was flattered by Arsenal’s interest in him. Rodgers also revealed that he has sat down with Sterling since that TV interview and to tell him that his best interest would be served by staying at the club for now, even though there may come a time when he does leave. Raheem Sterling  goes past Mathieu Flamini during the Barclays Premier League match at the Emirates . Sterling has reject a contract extension worth £100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal at the end of this season, but Rodgers said: ‘I’ve had a good chat with him. I have given him my opinion on it. This is a young kid who has been advised to do something else. A 20-year-old boy does not pick up the phone to ask to speak to the BBC. ‘You don’t do that; him in particular. He just wants to play his football. But of course if he’s asked to do that by other parties then that’s what he’ll do. ‘In the modern game it is obviously something that frustrates us all but it is the market and where football is at. In fairness to Raheem, I brought him in from the youth team and the reserves and I know that a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him.’ Sterling has rejected a contract extension worth £100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal . ‘In my time in coaching there are a lot of very, very good agents. The only thing I would say on Raheem’s situation is that anyone can see that for his football development and financially, Liverpool Football Club is the best place for him. There is absolutely no question of that. ‘I think he enjoys being at Liverpool and loves playing for Liverpool and knows he is privileged to play in front of Liverpool supporters. As a kid he knows the opportunity is there for him to improve as a footballer. What that will be in five, six, seven years time is different. But for this moment of his career and life, he really enjoys it. He has said that himself. He has talked very openly about loving his football and playing for a great club like Liverpool.’ Sterling said he was flattered by Arsenal's interest in signing him should he leave Liverpool this summer . Sterling grapples with Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin during Liverpool's defeat to the Gunners . Rodgers admits that the task may have become more difficult now that Liverpool’s hunt for a top four spot seems to have come to an end but remains confident that he can persuade the player to extend his deal . ‘As long as the player can see the ambition of the club. We all know the reality of where the game is at in this country. There are bigger spenders than ourselves and more experienced squads – the model at Liverpool is different. ‘Of course players will want to look at possibilities when that time comes. But when you talk specifically about Raheem – because he’s got huge potential but there’s still a bit to go - then I think Liverpool is the best place for him. Sterling competes with Laurent Koscielny during a defeat which all-but ends Liverpool's top four chances . ‘He has had the opportunity to play, which is key for a young player. It is the model of Liverpool, which the owners have put in, where they want to create the world class talent. He has just turned 20. There is still a long way for him to go and he has a lot of potential. I believe that will be developed over the next coming years at Liverpool. ‘It is the job of his advisors to look at the possibilities might be beyond that. But he has two and a half years left and won’t be going anywhere in the summer – that’s for sure. And we’ll sit down again with the club and his representatives to hopefully find the solution in the summer.’ Sterling is taken to ground by Arsenal's German defender Per Mertesacker during the game in north London . Rodgers went out of his way to play the player, who missed an easy first half opportunity to put Liverpool ahead but who was their most consistent threat and won them the penalty they scored. Rodgers said: ‘There was no change in him. I thought he was excellent today, our best player. He was aggressive in his running, pressed the ball well, he won the penalty. He was very direct and strong. ‘This is a kid that is really focused on his football. There’s no change and he works hard every single day. And you see from today, he just wants to play his football. The kid for me gives me everything the way he trains and plays.’","Brendan Rodgers has hit out at those advising Raheem Sterling .

"Chelsea were made to work hard for their three points against Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday but Eden Hazard starred for Jose Mourinho's team. He slotted Chelsea ahead in typically composed fashion from the penalty spot before Charlie Adam equalised with an astonishing strike from inside his own half shortly before half time. Stoke continued to make things difficult for Chelsea until an Asmir Begovic error led to Loic Remy tapping in the winner. Here, Sportsmail's Kieran Gill gives his player ratings. CHELSEA (4-2-3-1) Thibaut Courtois – 5.5 . Never called into action in the opening 43 minutes but beaten by Adam with an incredible strike from inside Stoke’s half. Too far off his line and one of the world’s best goalkeepers was left embarrassed. Thibaut Courtois was on the winning team but will want to forget  Charlie Adam beating him from his own half . Gary Cahill (left) and John Terry leap up to block an attempt at goal from Stoke's Philipp Wollscheid . Branislav Ivanovic – 6.5 . Tidied up well on the rare occasion Stoke threatened. Played with more freedom once Chelsea had the lead and tried to help in attack down the wing. Gary Cahill – 6 .5 . Looked cool when called into action and was able to clear the danger as Stoke tried to cross their way into the lead in the second half. John Terry – 7 . Manned the back well and it took a goal-of-the-season contender for his team to concede against a Stoke side that ran out of ideas at times. Always the man that remained at the back to kill off any threat. Cesar Azpilicueta – 6.5 . Tried to get forward and help Hazard down the left. Closed down well and put in a tireless performance. Nemanja Matic – 6 . A few too many misplaced passes and a hurried clearance almost spelled danger for Chelsea. Cleaned up well when needed to win back possession, however. Cesc Fabregas – 7 . Won the penalty with a clever cut back that fooled Wollscheid. Kept the midfield ticking over well. Brazil international Willian (left) also produced an impressive display for Chelsea in the win over Stoke . Eden Hazard put Chelsea into the lead with from the penalty spot in the first half . Diego Costa's (right) game was curtailed 10 minutes after coming on with what looked like a hamstring injury . Willian – 7.5 . A handful for Stoke as he, Oscar and Hazard linked up well to create chances in the first half, though they were never taken. Never short of a run. Oscar – 6.5 . Scuppered one of Chelsea’s best chances to take the lead by placing his shot wide of the far post, and was ultimately – and unfortunately – sacrificed for Costa at half time. Eden Hazard – 8.5 . A live wire. Master of the one-two and creating chances. Ultimately kept his cool from the spot to give Chelsea a much-needed lead before Adam’s equaliser. Didn’t look tired, despite his weariness during international break. Assisted the winning goal. Loic Remy - 7.5 . Looked a worthy replacement for Costa as he twice went close to giving Chelsea the lead in the opening seven minutes. Scored in the second half when Mourinho really needed it, and it was deserved. Loic Remy (left) slots in Chelsea's winner against Stoke in the second half at Stamford Bridge . SUBS: . Diego Costa – 6 . Came on but could do no damage as he was forced off with what looked like another hamstring injury. Immediately called to the bench for him to come off after 10 minutes on the field. Didier Drogba – 6 . Replaced Costa after the striker went off with an injury. Had little to do but hold up the ball. Juan Cuadrado – 6 . Little to do but helped Chelsea get over the line. MANAGER: Jose Mourinho – 6.5 . A frustrating afternoon for Mourinho, who was active on the touchline throughout, looking unhappy and muttering to himself. Either way, it worked, and his team added three points to their title charge. Jose Mourinho was active throughout the game on the touchline as Chelsea beat Stoke 2-1 . STOKE CITY (4-4-2) Asmir Begovic – 6.5 . Outstanding one-handed save at full stretch to deny Remy’s deflected shot after less than three minutes. Ultimately took a penalty for Begovic to concede the first. He’d done his homework, going the same way Hazard normally does, but beaten at the other side. His throw was intercepted by Willian which led to Chelsea's winner, though. Geoff Cameron – 5.5 . Given the unwanted task of stopping Hazard on his runs down the left wing on occasion. Ryan Shawcross – 6 . Stayed physical throughout, as per. Captained his team well on a ground that has been unkind to them previously, but ultimately could not help them steal a point. Philipp Wollscheid – 5.5 . Took the bait from Fabregas by sweeping the Spaniard’s feet to give Chelsea a penalty and ultimately the lead. Ryan Shawcross (right) led Stoke well but could not help his side take a point at Stamford Bridge . Wollscheid (right) slides in on Cesc Fabregas to concede a penalty in the first half, from which Hazard scored . Marc Wilson – 5.5 . A little unsure at times, largely down to a lack of communication between him and his team-mates. Stephen Ireland – 6 . Strong in midfield but found it difficult to get involved as that area was dominated by the men in blue. Glenn Whelan – 5.5 . Rightly booked for a late challenge on Fabregas but did not see much of the ball as Chelsea dominated midfield. Steven Nzonzi – 6 . Close with a controlled shot after a poor clearance by Matic and again in the second half as he grazed the far post with a bouncing effort across goal. Could not take the few chances that fell his way. Steven Nzonzi (centre) went close to scoring for Stoke but ultimately did not impose himself on the game . Charlie Adam (second left) is mobbed by his team-mates after his astonishing strike levelled the scores . Charlie Adam – 6.5 . Take a bow, Charlie Adam. Incredible goal as he channelled his inner David Beckham and, noticing Courtois off his line, scored from in his own half. A little anonymous until that moment, but his faults were obliterated with that 66-yard strike. Jonathan Walters – 5.5 . Little joy as Stoke rarely threatened up top but tried to keep them in with a shot and held the ball well on occasion. Closely marked by Terry throughout. Mame Biram Diouf – 5.5 . Failed to make an impact and was substituted after 62 minutes for Arnautovic. Jonathan Walters (left) had little joy for Stoke against Chelsea on Saturday, despite his hard work . Mame Biram Diouf (left) floundered against Chelsea's stern defence at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . SUBS: . Arnautovic – 6 . Too little too late to have an influence. MANAGER: Mark Hughes 5.5 . His team were constantly on the backfoot. REFEREE: Jonathan Moss 6 . Correct decision with the penalty. Not many controversial decisions to make aside from that, but had to be strict with bookings .","Eden Hazard and Loic Remy hit the net as Chelsea beat Stoke 2-1 .

"A young English fan who wrote a letter to Richie Benaud asking for tips on spin bowling almost 20 years ago has shared the Australian cricket great's response in the wake of his death. Jonathon Stevenson was just 16 years old when he asked for Benaud's advice on left-handed leg spin and he shared the lengthy response on Twitter on Friday as a tribute to the 'great man'. 'Wrote to Richie Benaud when I was 16 about bowling leggies. His detailed reply says everything about the great man,' Mr Stevenson, who  is now a director at LiveWire Sport, tweeted. Scroll down for video . A letter from Richie Benaud to an English fan, Jonathon Stevenson, almost 20 years ago emerged on Friday in the wake of the cricket legend's death . Accompanying the letter from Benaud, dated September 27, 1996, was a full sheet of notes about spin bowling for left-hand bowlers. 'Your letter was timely because it was the first from a left-hander and it reminded me that there is a difference in coaching and not just in the fact that one youngster might bowl with the right hand and another with the left,' Benaud wrote. 'The ball, although coming out of the hand in the same manner and going in the same direction towards the batsmen, in fact spins differently for the two types of bowlers.' Jonathon Stevenson, who now works at LiveWire Sport, was just 16 years old when he asked for Benaud's advice on left-handed leg spin and he shared the lengthy response on Twitter  as a tribute to the 'great man' Accompanying the letter from Benaud, dated September 27, 1996, was a full sheet of notes about spin bowling for left-hand bowlers . Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. He was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets. 'I hope you enjoy your cricket and your bowling,' Benaud said. 'Yes, the left-arm over-the-wrist bowler who spins the ball into the right-hander from outside the off-stump is said to have bowled a Chinaman. The same bowler who spins one away from the right-hander has bowled a wrong'un.' After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia . The typed letter, dated September 27, 1996, was personally signed by Benaud . It included tips on different deliveries  and gave pointers as to how they should be delivered . In his letter to a young Mr Stevenson, he listed a full page of various different deliveries the teenager should try and gave pointers as to how they should be delivered. 'Don't even think about learning the 'flipper' before you have mastered the leg-break, topspinner and wrong'un,' he finished with. The typed letter was personally signed by Benaud. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia.

"Such has been the volatility at the top of the Championship this season that predicting future outcomes has proved a futile exercise, but what is certain is that Middlesbrough hold the aces. With just four weeks remaining, Aitor Karanka's team are top of a division that has witnessed the leadership change hands 15 times. Seven points separate eight teams with six matches to play but Boro know if they keep winning, they cannot be caught. Their buffer over second-placed Bournemouth is a point with Watford, their opponents on Monday, and Norwich a point further back. Patrick Bamford (left) of Middlesbrough celebrates his goal against Wigan with his team mates . Another advantage for the Teesside club is that their contest at Vicarage Road is a lunchtime kick-off. As they discovered on Good Friday, when they triumphed over relegation-threatened Wigan, stealing a march can have a psychological effect. Previous leaders Bournemouth and 10-man Watford could only draw, at Ipswich and Derby respectively, in the evening matches. 'It definitely puts pressure on other teams, like Watford and Bournemouth found on Friday night,' said Boro defender Ben Gibson. 'It gives us a few more hours to recover when the turnaround for games is short and sharp, as well. Monday will be the same, big style.' Watford's 18-goal striker Odion Ighalo intends to have a say in what happens next. Ighalo helped Granada reach La Liga in 2011 and admits he only signed for Watford to play in the English top flight. Odion Ighalo rescued a point for Watford with this equaliser against fellow promotion hopefuls Derby . Bournemouth have been this season's surprise package and led the Championship for 101 days . 'I came to Watford not because I want to play in the Championship but because I have the opportunity to be in the Premier League,' he said. 'Our fans have to scream from the start to the end. I know by God's grace we are going to win that game at home.' Such is the precarious nature of the promotion race, however, that the division could have a completely different top two on Monday evening if Watford and Norwich, who host mid-table Sheffield Wednesday, win and Bournemouth fail to secure three points against Birmingham. With the stakes so high it is perhaps understandable that Karanka is hoping Jonathan Woodgate, his experienced captain, can continue to play through the pain. He missed the recent defeat at Bournemouth due to his broken toe but returned against Wigan. Crucially, each of the defender's five appearances this season, and eight of his last nine, have resulted in wins. Alex Neil (left) has impressed since taking over at Norwich and the Canaries remain in contention at the top . Derby led the way earlier in the season but have now not won in seven games under Steve McClaren . Derby, meanwhile, have seemingly forgotten how to win. Seven games without victory has seen them slump to sixth but Steve McClaren insists he will not sacrifice his principles. McClaren, who takes his team to Wigan, said: 'I don't want to put 10 defenders on and kick the ball long and not play our football. We have a certain way of playing, a certain style, which has got us where we are.' The eighth side in the division are Wolves, who have the most potent striker in 28-goal Benik Afobe, signed from Arsenal for £2million in January. Afobe has made himself instantly at home and has Leeds in his sights today. Final word to the English forward: 'Every time we go into the changing room we see everyone else has won.'

Heartwarming: The two-legged pig has become an internet sensation because of a cute video showing it learning to walk . There are several occasions it looked close to tipping over but remarkably the piglet always manages to regain its balance. It happily mixes with the rest of the litter, which have all been born with a full complement of legs. The piglet belongs to farmer, Ms Duan, from Qionglai City in Sichuan Province, south western China. Since its birth, villagers have flocked to take a peek at the curious animal.

"Wigan Athletic have acted swiftly in finding a replacement for Malky Mackay, making former club captain Gary Caldwell their new manager as the Championship strugglers look to fight off relegation. The 32-year-old, who has been at the DW Stadium since 2010, will take charge for the first time against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Friday. The move to appoint Caldwell comes as a surprise, with the Scot admitting himself that he did not expect to get the job. Wigan Athletic have made club captain Gary Caldwell their new manager on a long-term basis . Caldwell (right) lifted the FA Cup with Wigan in 2013 but now he must lead them out of a relegation scrap . The former Scotland international has made no secret of his intentions to take up coaching in the past . Gary Caldwell, who joined Wigan in 2010 from Celtic and was appointed captain in his first full season at the club. The Scotland international signed a new one-year contract with the club in July last year and was given some coaching responsibilities as part of his new role. On retiring in February after being unable to recover from a hip injury, Caldwell formally joined the academy as a member of coaching staff. Chairman David Sharpe said Caldwell was 'the only candidate we considered'. Mackay was relieved of his duties following Wigan's 2-0 defeat to Derby on Easter Monday, which left them eight points adrift of safety in the Sky Bet Championship table. And the club has moved quickly to replace him, naming Caldwell, who will be assisted by Graham Barrow, as his successor on a permanent contract . 'I've made no secret of the fact that I wanted to move into management when the time was right,' Caldwell said. 'I didn't expect that to come along as quickly as this but, in football, you need to take opportunities when they arise and I am honoured and excited in equal measures to take charge at the Latics, where I have shared such incredible memories over the past five years. Malky Mackay was relieved of his duties after defeat by Derby on Easter Monday, with Wigan struggling . 'We are in a really tough place at the moment, but we will approach the next five games with only one thing in mind, to win. After that, we will assess where we are and move on.' Wigan chairman David Sharpe, who only recently took over from his grandfather Dave Whelan, said the move was made to get an immediate reaction but that the club see Caldwell as their long-term leader. 'After a meeting with him on Monday and discussions all day Tuesday, Gary was the only candidate we considered because we are so convinced of his qualities. Chairman David Sharpe (centre) made it clear that the appointment was part of a long-term strategy . 'People will talk about his lack of experience, but every young coach is in the same place, there are many examples of young coaches being given opportunities and being successful,' he said. 'For me the timing was important; we will look to get a reaction in the next five games and this period crucially gives Gary a chance to look at the players in his way until the end of the season. Plus it enables us to start working now with a manager we know will be in place next season. 'But this is an appointment for the long-term.' Caldwell, who turns 33 on Sunday, will be formally presented at a press conference on Wednesday morning, .","Club captain Gary Caldwell has been appointed as the manager of Wigan .

"This adorable dancer's incredible balancing skills have made her on overnight internet sensation. The talented toddler, believed to be from China and female, carefully balances three small bowls on her head as she performs a series of dance moves to music. Happily bobbing along to the music, the youngster who is thought to be aged between two and three years old, slowly spins around being careful not to drop the dinnerware, as seen in a video on the People's Daily Online. Tiny dancer: This talented toddler has become an internet sensation in China after the video of her dancing went viral . With a look of pure concentration she continues to spin, lifting her arms to the traditional folk music. Gaining confidence the tiny dancer drops to floor in a crouch and - for the first time - her carefully balanced crockery gives a wobble. But with the most minor of adjustments, the bowls are made safe and the dance continues. The video has been reposted by numerous Chinese video sites after it was first featured on Jiangsu Satellite TV station in China this week. The youngster has a look of pure concentration as she balances the three bowls which appear to be ceramic on her head . She carefully spins around to the music, in  an adorable attempt at what appears to be a traditional female dance performed by the Uyghur people in northwestern China . The toddler may have been performing the traditional dance of the Uyghur - a Turkic people originally from Central Asia which have a large population in the Xinjiang  Autonomous Region in northwestern China. The dance is also very similar to the Mongolian Bowl Dance, a folk dance which is performed by female dancers across Asia. Linked to hospitality, the feminine Zhongwan is performed by women who balance several bowls on their head and then dance with incredible skill and grace. Mongolian dances are closely connected with song or story. Men's dances feature masculine activities including the horse and sword dance, the hawk dance, and the roughrider dance. Other female folk dances such as the Chopsticks Dance (Kuaizi) or Milking Dance (Jinai).","This cute toddler's talented balancing skills have made her an internet hit .

"The chant was loud and it was pronounced. ‘Bees up, Fulham down’ rang out of the not-so neutral end at Craven Cottage on a day for Brentford’s 6,000 travelling fans to savour. A day they again stamped their serious play-off credentials down on the Championship, humiliating their once superior neighbours. As Stuart Dallas thundered in his second of the afternoon, boos descended down on Kit Symons, who slunk back into his dugout. But this wasn’t about Fulham and their mounting deficiencies. There were hairy moments for Mark Warburton’s side - particularly after Ross McCormack’s 67th minute penalty halved the deficit - but they continue to chip away at those above them with a fearless way of playing the game, excitement in abundance. Brentford celebrate taking the lead against Fulham at Craven Cottage thanks to Stuart Dallas (second left) Dallas runs away to celebrate his second goal of the game just before the hour mark at Craven Cottage . Fulham (4-4-2): Bettinelli 6; Grimmer 5 (Hoogland 46, 5), Bodurov 5, Turner 5, Husband 6; Fofana 5, Guthrie 5, Tunnicliffe 5; Kacaniklic 6 (Kavanagh 78), Woodrow 5 (Smith 62, 6.5), McCormack 5.5 . Subs not used: Kiraly, Stafylidis, Rodallega, Burn. Goals: McCormack (pen) 67. Brentford (4-2-3-1): Button 6; Odubajo 6.5, Dean 6.5, Tarkowski 6, Bidwell 7; Diagouraga 6.5, Douglas; Jota 7, Pritchard 8 (Judge 60, 7), Dallas 8.5 (Smith 82); Gray 6 (Long 73, 6) Subs not used: Craig, McCormack, Bonham, Toral. Goals: Dallas 24, 58, Judge 90, Jota 90. Booked: Odubajo, Judge. Referee: Simon Hooper (Wiltshire). Attendance 23,271. Here was a first league double over Fulham in 23 years and still the potential for a play-off campaign, although the manager might be looking for more. ‘If a team puts a run together they’ll go clear with 90-odd points,’ he reasoned. ‘If they do that, with the nature of the fixtures, teams will drop points. ‘The average for the play-offs has been 72 for the last five years. I think you’ll need 75 minimum. If that’s the case we need two more wins.’ Every single resident of the tiny area of west London would have snatched and bitten fingers off for that if offered in August. The celebrations after Alan Judge’s stunning late free-kick were almost muted, such was the shock at what they’d just seen, and delirium as Jota smashed in a fourth. The guard has been changed around these parts and, when Symons looks back on the video today, he’ll have serious misgivings as to how the little upstarts five miles down the road were allowed to humble Fulham in their own back yard. ‘People will look at the scoreline and think it’s a hammering but it isn’t,’ he said. Sadly, Symons was wrong. What he could not legislate for was the oceans gifted to Alex Pritchard in the build-up to Dallas’ opener. The excellent Pritchard, on loan from Tottenham, is a midfielder with the brightest of futures, someone adept at orchestrating the Bees. So when he picked up possession inside his own half, looked up and just saw vacant grass ahead of him, the alarm bells should have been ringing in the hosts’ defence. But they did not. Pritchard went on for 30 yards, recycled possession just outside the home box and - later in the move - Dallas manouvered enough space for himself to put his laces through a daisy-cutter across Marcus Bettinelli into the goalkeeper’s bottom left-hand post. The first phase of that attack gives an indication why the Cottagers have struggled so badly this term and still aren’t safe from relegation. That, and a failure to take their chances when on top. Cauley Woodrow saw two presentable opportunities go begging before Seko Fofana - all alone at the back post - could only skew an effort wide with goal gaping. Alexander Kacaniklic earlier jinked away from two defenders but saw a shot smartly saved by David Button. McCormack, the multi-million pound signing from Leeds last summer, became increasingly on the periphery; starting as one of two strikers, the Scot felt the need to constantly drop off into midfield, such was Fulham’s lack of creativity. All that meant was Woodrow had to fend for himself against the two aggressive central defenders Harlee Dean and James Tarkowski. Ross McCormack scored from the penalty spot with 23 minutes remaining to drag Fulham back into the game . In short, Fulham need a plan for next season - and quickly. Even though it looks as if they will remain in the division, their supporters will not accept another campaign of stagnation. Compare that to buoyant Brentford, who are on a crest of a wave and unsure where the next six weeks will take them for all the right reasons. They grew into this, comfortable in retaining the ball after half-time and looked every bit the play-off side. Dallas’ second of the afternoon was something to behold, a wondrous strike in the same direction as his first but into the roof of Bettinelli’s net from 30 yards out. Up went the inflatables, over went the arms in hugging celebration. Brentford’s supporters can’t quite believe what they are witnessing. To say their brand of football does not deserve these accolades would be to decry Warburton’s hard work over the course of 18 months. It is just a shame he will not see that through beyond May. Fulham's Ryan Tunnicliffe is tackled by Brentford's James Tarkowski and Jake Bidwell . Brentford goalkeeper David Button  saves shot from Alexander Kacaniklic of Fulham . It ought to have been three when Andre Gray blazed over from six yards but, just as the visitors looked to be cruising to the points, referee Simon Hooper gifted Fulham a way back into the game. Toumani Diagouraga was harshly adjudged to have hauled down debutant James Husband, with McCormack doing the rest from 12 yards. Lanky Matt Smith was a menace when introduced, almost catching Button out with a cheeky lob as Fulham pressed hard for an equaliser. Tarkowski needed to stretch every inch of his giant frame to keep out Kacaniklic too. They’ll need a bit more of that if this adventure is to finish at Wembley, although the quality of Judge’s late free-kick might just be even more important. Was this Warburton’s best individual result as a manager? ‘No, and I don’t mean that in a derogatory way,’ he said. ‘It’s a big local derby and the atmosphere was electric. Brentford's Moses Odubajo challenges Fulham midfielder Danny Guthrie for the ball . ‘We’ve had momentum from day one, not in an arrogant way but we have. It’s self belief. The players deserve to be where they are.’ They weren’t finished there, Jota hammering home in stoppage-time to cap off a stunning move. The key for Warburton is Brentford possess both class and guts in spades. Nottingham Forest better watch out on Monday.","Stuart Dallas scored either side of half-time for Brentford .

"Peter Moores insisted he could work with Michael Vaughan if he becomes England’s new director of cricket despite the pair’s chequered past. ‘Of course I could,’ said Moores  in St Kitts on Thursday. ‘It’s not a personal thing. People have views. We’re still going through a transitional spell so to me this is about getting England as strong as we can as quickly as we can. Whoever comes into that job I just want to share views to make sure we have the best way forward.

It was just something that he himself didn’t feel comfortable enough to travel.’ Arsenal ran out 4-1 winners against Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday . Mesut Ozil scored Arsenal's second as Hector Bellerin, Alexis Sanchez and Olivier Giroud also netted . Though Rodgers did not question Balotelli’s commitment to the club’s cause, the player has been a constant source of frustration at the club this season, with the manager having previously made it clear that he would have to work much harder to adapt to Liverpool’s style. With just four goals in 25 appearances, his future at the club is already in question – though he has another three years on his contract.","Liverpool were beaten 4-1 by Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday .

"Tom Wood jokingly thanked Clermont for inviting Northampton to an open training session after the English champions were thrashed 37-5 in the Champions Cup. The Saints, who sit 10 points clear at the summit of the Aviva Premiership, exited Europe at the quarter-final stage after being routed four tries to one at the Stade Marcel-Michelin. The result had been decided by half-time as Clermont, employing a mixture of forward supremacy and three-quarter devilry, amassed an unassailable 27-0 lead. Calum Clark and Tom Wood walk off the pitch after their 37-5 defeat against Clermont . Northampton captain Dylan Hartley leads his team off the pitch after crushing defeat . Clermont winger Napolioni Nalaga runs with the ball during the match against Northampton . And Wood tweeted: 'Thanks to Clermont for inviting us to their open training session today. We've left our non-contact bibs in the changing rooms #humbled.' Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder, meanwhile, admitted defeat was among the most distressing nights of his career. 'It's one of the worst defeats I've experienced. We've had a few shockers and that's definitely one of them,' he said.

'On this performance it would be hard to argue against it (there being a gulf in class), but we have competed against their top sides in the past.'

"Robert Lewandowski returned to haunt his former club as Bayern Munich earned a narrow victory against Borussia Dortmund at the Signal Iduna Park on Saturday. Poland international Lewandowski scored the winner on his first visit back to the club he left on a free transfer last summer as Pep Guardiola's side restored their 10-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Lewandowski spent four years at Dortmund, leading them to back-to-back league titles during that period, and offered only a muted celebration when he pounced to give the visitors the lead 10 minutes before half time. Click here to read Nicholas Godden's full match report . Host commentator . League leaders Bayern Munich stretch their lead at the top of the table to 10 points. Former Dortmund man Lewandowski scored the only goal of the match to give his side the win. The home team deserved a point, however Guardiola's side dug deep to hold on and claim yet another vital victory. It seems like Dortmund are going to run out of time to claim an equaliser. They are missing a Lewandowski or Gotze to provide that extra bit of quality in the final third. Dortmund were awarded a free-kick in a fantastic position. Reus tests his international team-mate but Neuer shows his class by stretching down to his right. He has to be the best goalkeeper in the world despite the form of De Gea and Courtois. Klopp has done all he can in terms of substitutions and tactical tweaks. It now rests with the likes of Kagawa and Reus to inspire the home side to at least claim a point. And they would be fully worthy of a point as they have impressed since the interval. Former Dortmund playmaker Gotze replaces Muller in the hole behind Lewandowski while Mkhitaryan comes on for Gundogan as Klopp's side chase an equaliser. Alonso is booked for pulling back Kagawa's shirt. 15 minutes left to play. Talking of players back from injury, Thiago is playing his first match of the season after being ruled out of action with a knee injury since March 2014. Lahm's first start of the season lasts 69 minutes as he is replaced by Thiago. Guardiola will be delighted to have his captain back after his lengthy spell on the sidelines. Kagawa gets his chance to impress as he comes on along with Ramos. Dortmund are starting to apply more pressure on Bayern's defence. The next goal, if there is one, will be crucial. Reus should have finally tested Neuer, who is yet to make a save, however he manages to hit his shot wide of the goal. He literally had a free run at goal and had time to aim his strike. Here's a stat for you - Manuel Neuer is yet to make a save during the first 60 minutes of the match. Schweinsteiger, who was on a yellow card, has been replaced with Rode with just over half an hour to go. Klopp will surely look to freshen up his side during the next 10 minutes. Dortmund have an early penalty shout as Reus is appended by Boateng however the referee waves play on. Reus went down in dramatic fashion which didn't work in his favour. Staff at the Signal Iduna Park had to remove a number of objects off of the field of play before the second half kicked off. The Yellow Wall appeared to chuck bananas at Manuel Neuer. Former Manchester United midfielder Kagawa or Mkhitaryan will surely feature in the second half if Dortmund's current attacking players fail to cancel out Lewandowski's opener. Lewandowski chose not to celebrate on his return to the Signal Iduna Park. What do you think about players who choose to respect their former sides? Have your say below! Owen Hargreaves: 'I thought Dortmund were terrific in the first 20 minutes but then they allowed Alonso to dictate play. It was a bit of a mistake by Hummels as he failed to make a tackle.' Dortmund have come into the game since Lewandowski's goal but they are yet to really trouble Neuer and Bayern's three-man backline. Just one minute left to play of the first half. Lewandowski scores the opener against his former side by nodding home from close range after Muller's shot was saved. The Polish striker chooses not to celebrate after spending four years at Dortmund. Muller and Lewandowski are linking up well but they are missing the pace and creativity of Robben and Ribery. Guardiola will be desperate to have the pair back for their upcoming Champions League ties against Porto. They play in yellow and now another one of their players has earned himself a yellow. Schmelzer becomes the second Dortmund star to be cautioned for a late challenge. Just under 30 minutes gone at the Signal Iduna Park. Aubameyang becomes the second player to go into the book. Both sets of players look fired up while the Signal Iduna Park crowd are jeering Bayern's every touch. Referee Knut Kircher has dipped into his pocket to dish out the first yellow card of the match. The experienced Schweinsteiger will have to be careful in order to avoid seeing red. Reus looks like he is going to cause Bayern Munich problems today. Alonso could have been cautioned for a reckless foul on the Dortmund playmaker as he ran through the middle of the pitch. Klopp certainly thought he deserved a yellow. The Polish striker put the balls into the net against his former side but he is rightly flagged offside by the German officials. Subotic moved up to ensure Lewandowski was unable to put his side in the lead. Remains 0-0. Bayern goalkeeper Neuer loves to have the ball at his feet and you can see his defenders are confident of his ability as they constantly play it back to the German international. Muller, who is playing just behind Lewandowski, tries to lift the ball over Weidenfeller and into Dortmund's goal however his effort goes just wide of the post. Bayern have set up with a three-man defence with Bernat and Rafinha providing the width in the absence of Ribery and Robben. The two sides are currently paying their respect to those who died after the German Wings plane crash. Owen Hargreaves: 'A lot of clubs will be after Hummels in the summer. However I do not think he is the kind of player Manchester United need. They need a powerful defender rather than a ball player.' If the German Clasico doesn't tickle your fancy then you can follow the live action from Chelsea's match against Stoke by joining Dan Ripley HERE. Both Klopp and Guardiola have quality to call on from their respective benches with the likes of Kagawa, Mkhitaryan, Gotze and Thiago among the substitutes. Dortmund subs: Kehl, Kagawa, Mkhitaryan, Ramos, Langerak, Ginter, Dudziak . Bayern Munich subs: Thiago, Pizarro, Guadino, Gotze, Rode, Reina, Weiser . Second-placed Wolfsburg defeated Stuttgart 3-1 earlier today to close the gap on Bayern, however Pep Guardiola's side are still seven points clear at the top. Dortmund, on the other hand, have struggled to replicate the form they had previously shown in the last few seasons. Jurgen Klopp's side are currently languishing in 10th spot. Manchester United fans will be keen to get a closer look at summer target Mats Hummels. The German defender reportedly told former Red Devils boss Sir Alex Ferguson that he would move to Old Trafford if he was to leave Dortmund. Read the full story HERE. Bayern Munich captain Philipp Lahm makes his first Bundesliga start since returning from an ankle injury to strengthen Pep Guardiola's side. The Spaniard are without the injured Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery for today's match. The teams are in at the Signal Iduna Park where Bayern will be hoping to stretch their seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga table by defeating Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund XI vs Bayern Munich: Weidenfeller; Sokratis, Subotic, Hummels, Schmelzer; Gundogan, Bender; Błaszczykowski, Reus, Kampl; Aubameyang . Bayern Munich XI vs Dortmund: Neuer; Dante, Boateng, Benatia; Rafinha, Alonso, Bernat, Lahm, Schweinsteiger, Muller; Lewandowski . Borussia Dortmund may have had a Bundesliga season to forget, but there is nothing they would like more than to beat the runaway leaders and their rivals Bayern Munich. Pep Guardiola takes his German champions and Bundesliga leaders to Signal Iduna Park for 'Der Klassiker' on Saturday evening hoping to avoid any slip-ups in their quest for another title. Bayern hold a 10-point lead over second-placed Wolfsburg with just eight games to play and will be eager to wrap up their third straight title as soon as possible.

"Sarazen, Hogan, Player, Nicklaus, Woods, McIlroy. Perhaps the biggest compliment to the man who would join the golfing gods this week is that his name does not look out of place among the pantheon. Rory McIlroy could become just the sixth man to win the Grand Slam at Augusta National on Sunday, and while that represents the pinnacle of on-course achievement, he has designs on not just filling his trophy cabinet but becoming the true figurehead of his sport. That is the view of Paul McGinley, Europe’s Ryder Cup captain extraordinaire, who sums up the attitude in this neat way: McIlroy is no Jose Mourinho. Winning at all costs and to hell with the consequences is just not his style, unlike Chelsea's ruthless manager. ‘Is it all about winning titles, is it all about the Mourinho way of “I’m going to get as many medals and titles as I can”?’ ponders McGinley. ‘Or is it, I’m the No 1 player in the world, I represent the game of golf, am I going to become somebody like Tiger Woods did, an iconic figure in world sport, and try to introduce and propel the game forward? Rory McIlroy has designs on becoming the true figurehead of his sport, says Paul McGinley. McIlroy goes into this week's Masters at Augusta National as favourite but he's aiming for more than trophies . McGinley says McIlroy's ambitions are unlike Chelsea's relentless win-at-all-costs manager Jose Mourinho . McGinley, McIlroy's Ryder Cup-winning coach, says the world No 1 aims to be an iconic figure in world sport . ‘My hunch knowing Rory is that it’s more about representing that No 1 position, and bringing as many titles along with it as he can.’ McGinley, by the way, is a die-hard West Ham fan. And he knows McIlroy well. Fellow sons of the Emerald Isle, McGinley helped coax arguably the greatest round of McIlroy’s life, the utter demolition of America’s own golden boy, Rickie Fowler, 5&4 at Gleneagles last year. McGinley speaks glowingly of McIlroy from their time together on the winning Ryder Cup team . There were signs before the Ryder Cup that McIlroy was not just in single-minded pursuit of greatness, but had his eyes on the greater good. McGinley wanted to give short and sharp tips to his young charge on how to prepare for Gleneagles; but McIlroy simply wouldn’t shut up about it. ‘I swear, I honestly could not have asked for one per cent more out of Rory, in the whole two years of Ryder Cup,’ enthuses McGinley. ‘Every time I had a chat with him, he was so engaged with it. Often I’d be walking away and he’d be pulling me back to talk more. He wanted more and more, and he was sharing ideas, he was terrific.’ While it’s easy to get carried away in the face of such extraordinary talent, McIlroy still has one giant leap to overcome. He must stand firm on the slippery slopes of Augusta’s rolling fairways and conquer the course that has beaten him up on two excruciating occasions, and where his best finish was eighth last year. Woods, meanwhile, has mastered the place four times. ‘Rory is evolving as a player, and he’s evolving as a person too. He’s not the finished article, even now at 25. It’s not right to compare him to Tiger Woods. What Woods has done in his career is a yardstick, Rory is still evolving towards that and every year he is getting better and better, but he still has a long way to go to meet the standards that Tiger set.’ McGinley, who will be at the Masters in Augusta commentating for Sky Sports, the only place to watch all four days live, cites Woods’s supreme patience as the hallmark of a true great – McIlroy glaringly lacked the latter during his final-round horror show in 2011. McGinley walks with Graeme McDowell and McIlroy as they prepared for the 2014 Ryder Cup . McGinley will be watching his former charges at the Masters closely as a pundit for Sky Sports . Four years on, however, McIlroy’s rivals know they are battling to contain a different beast. ‘The one thing that Rory has proved is that he’s able to learn from his mistakes and move on,’ says McGinley, who talks now of an ‘aura’ surrounding the man who will be going for his third major in a row after his Open and US PGA Championship victories last summer. Does McIlroy intimidate his opponents before a ball has even been struck? ‘Yeah, I think a bit. Not as much as Tiger, but again he’s evolving towards that. When Rory’s driving the ball like he can, he’s very intimidating. He knows he has the ability, when he finds that extra gear, that nobody else can match him.’ There is a word of warning, however. ‘It will be a matter of time before someone catches up with him and somebody will challenge him. Tiger had that and then guys caught up with him.’ The men most likely to challenge McIlroy’s bid for immortality are most likely to be a number of old Ryder Cup foes – although Woods will surely not be among them. Bubba Watson, the defending champion, a reformed and refocused Dustin Johnson, the extraordinary 21-year-old Texan Jordan Spieth and Fowler, if he has got over his humbling at Gleneagles, all look most likely to push McIlroy hardest. McIlroy is intimidating for his opponents when he's hitting the ball as he can, says McGinley . Tiger Woods returns to the fold for the Masters but isn't expected to be challenging McIlroy for the green jacket . Masters defending champion Bubba Watson (left) and a reformed and refocused Dustin Johnson . Jordan Spieth, the extraordinary Texan 21-year-old, is also considered among the 2015 title contenders . ‘A rival will be good for Rory,’ insists McGinley. ‘If Dustin steps up to the plate like some people are expecting him to, or Spieth, or Rickie, if some of those guys win a major, that’ll only be good for him. Rory has reacted well to adversity and guys challenging him in the past.’ But the toughest opponent McIlroy could face in future might not come on the course, but from the voice within. ‘The biggest challenge that Rory has got is keeping the fire lit in his heart. That’s the biggest challenge anybody would have. That’s what made Tiger phenomenal at the top for as long as he was. ‘At the moment Rory has it, he’s had it for a number of years, he’s got that incredible passion. Keeping that lit for another 20 years is another question. We won’t know the answer, but that’s his biggest challenge.’ That’s why it’s always handy to have a man like captain McGinley around, to help fan those flames. This week, however, McIlroy is on his own. Thankfully the fire is raging more than ever.","Ryder Cup-winning captain Paul McGinley speaks highly of Rory McIlroy .

"The lightning-fast greens at Augusta National can be a daunting prospect for many first-timers at the Masters. Not so for Sheffield’s Danny Willett. The 27-year-old finished one-under but it was his monster putt for eagle at the par-five 13th that he was tweeting about afterwards. England's Danny Willett carded an opening round of 71 at Augusta on Thursday . His brother P J Willett, at home doing some DIY on light switches, also tweeted: ‘Bro @willett1987 shot under par in 1st round of #Masters2015 debut. I swapped some switches. Who’s living the dream?’ Willett admitted it was a dream come true to mark his Masters debut with an eagle and an opening round of 71 at Augusta National. Willett holed a curling 60-foot putt on the par-five 13th, an achievement which is traditionally rewarded with a pair of crystal glasses. 'It's the kind of thing you dream of when you're a kid, boxing a long one across the green,' said Willett, who had been unhappy with his approach to the green. 'Anywhere on that green you know it's going to be a stupidly breaking putt, but the ball is up somewhere near your kneecaps when you are hitting the second shot so it's always hard to hit a fade into a back right flag. 'It had 18 feet of break, it comes almost backwards.' Willett, who qualified by being in the world's top 50 at the end of last season following his victory in the Nedbank Challenge, was in the second group out at 7.56am. Willett felt he benefited from ideal conditions as the 27-year-old was in the second group out at 7.56am . And the 27-year-old felt he benefited from ideal conditions and the experience of playing with 1987 Masters champion Larry Mize, as well as amateur Byron Meth. 'It really helped playing with Larry,' Willett added. 'He won it in 1987 which is the year I was born so we were having a bit of a joke down the first. He was brilliant all day and kept trying to egg me and Byron on. He helped settle the nerves quite quickly. 'The first tee was awesome and second off there were already 20 or 30,000 people round the golf course. Every shot you hit and every tee you walked on you're getting clapped on to. It was really special. 'I feel like I should be here but you're not trying to put too much pressure on yourself. To be here for all four days first time out would be nice, it's one of those courses where the more you play it the better your chances are of getting it round. For a first time out we did pretty good.'","Danny Willett carded a one-under-par 71 in the first round at the Masters .

"Alan Stubbs says he feared there would have been crowd trouble if he'd agreed to have his Hibs team form a guard of honour for Hearts in the Edinburgh derby. Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson and Jambos defender Alim Ozturk have both rounded on their city rivals for refusing a public display of acknowledgement for the Championship title winners at Easter Road. Rangers lined up to applaud Hearts on to the Ibrox pitch when the teams played just over a week ago, and Queen of the South and Alloa did the same. But Stubbs, who admitted that the police hadn't been consulted, insisted that the threat of unrest – not a lack of respect – was responsible for the decision. Hibs boss Alan Stubbs feared unrest among fans if his side formed a guard of honour for city rivals Hearts . 'It's been turned into a lack of respect,' said the Hibs boss. 'Well, I rang Robbie the day after they won the league and congratulated them and said they had been the best team over the season and that it had been fully deserved. 'My players have come out in the press and said Hearts have been the best team. I think that's respect. 'The reason why we decided against it is because there are two sets of rivals fans, it's a derby, there's going to be a lot of animosity. You are going to have one set of fans that will be jovial because they've won the league, you'll have one that are not going to be happy about that. 'The most important thing is the safety of the fans and that's the main reason we've done it. We don't want to start the game on a bad foot, that's the reason we've done it. Not a lack of respect. It's a respect for fans. It's a decision we spoke about and we feel as if it's the right decision for both sets of fans. 'We can't let this get out of control for the reasons we've done it. We've seen silly things happen over the years and we don't want to get into that state because of a guard of honour. 'If I won the league and we were at Tynecastle, I wouldn't expect a guard of honour there. We don't turn around and say because one team has done it every other team has to. I wouldn't expect it. 'Because you know it only takes on person. Before you know it, you've got a situation on your hands that could have been prevented. We want the derby to be spoken about for the right reasons, not the wrong reasons – and it only takes one idiot.' Agreeing that it would be unthinkable for either Old Firm team to offer their oldest rivals a guard of honour in a similar situation, Stubbs said: 'So why's it any different here? 'It's a derby and it means a lot to both sets of fans.' Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson feels that it is disrespectful not to acknowledge his team's achievements . Hearts fans favourite Ozturk inferred that the decision not to have a guard of honour showed a lack of respect by Hibs, while boss Neilson claimed it could backfire on them on the pitch. 'It is up to them if they want to do it,' said Ozturk. 'But other teams have shown respect to us - and if Hibs don't want to do it, that says a lot about them. 'Teams like Rangers showed us a little bit of respect for a fantastic season and it's a good feeling because you have worked really hard all season to win the league like this. 'That kind of respect you get is really nice but they [Hibs] are not going to do it, so that is it. Is that going to motivate me? Yes. I have a lot of respect for the other teams. This gives us extra motivation to show them why we' re champions. If you're asking me, I would have no problem with doing that for Hibs.' Neilson added: 'That's Hibs' prerogative. I think it will actually take some of the focus off our players, instead of coming out to a guard of honour and not concentrating on the game. 'It can also give the opposition team a bit of spirit and a bit of fight to say: 'We've given you a guard of honour, now we are going to turn you over!' That can happen. 'I've been in that situation where you are standing there clapping, and your first thought is to go out there and show them. Hopefully it will work in our favour that they don't do it on Sunday.'

Palmer, the seven-time major champion and now 85 years old, has been struggling in his recovery from a dislocated shoulder, which kept him out of the Par 3 Contest on Wednesday. But he ignored the pain to take his place alongside Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player as the honorary starters on Thursday morning.

"Natasha Jonas, the first female boxer to represent Great Britain in an Olympic Games, has announced her retirement from the sport. The Liverpool-born 30-year-old made history when she took on eventual gold medallist Katie Taylor of Ireland in the first round of the women's lightweight competition at London 2012. Jonas, a former world and European bronze medallist, said: 'It just felt like the right time to retire. 'Being away from camp to recover from my recent injury has given me time to think and I just came to the conclusion that I did not want to go back to the demands of full-time training. Natasha Jonas has announced that she will retire from boxing after a successful career in the ring . 'When I started boxing 10 years ago I was an overweight, unemployed scally from Toxteth and if you'd have told me then that I would win a world championship medal and compete in front of 10,000 people at the Olympic Games I would never have believed it, so I am very proud to have achieved those things and done so well in the sport. 'I have been to some great places, had some amazing experiences and being able to share them with such a fantastic group of people is something I will treasure forever.' Although Jonas lost her bout with Taylor, she was widely praised for her performance in front of a crowd which registered the loudest noise of any event at the 2012 Games at 113.7 decibels. The 30-year-old made history when she became the first female boxer to represent GB in the Olympics . Great Britain team-mate and Olympic champion Nicola Adams said: 'I have trained, competed and travelled all over the world with Natasha for the last five years so will be really sad to see her leave. 'Over the years she has been a brilliant campaigner for the sport and has done so much to progress women's boxing in this country. She was the first woman to ever box for Great Britain, the first to qualify for the Olympics and the first to box at the Games, so she has achieved a lot and been a great ambassador for the sport. She will be missed by all of the team.'","Natasha Jonas has announced her retirement from the world of boxing .

"Two hours before the Miami Open semifinal, Novak Djokovic practiced his returns in an empty stadium, the ball coming at him quickly because his hitting partner stood three feet inside the baseline to emulate big-serving John Isner. The drill helped. Djokovic achieved a breakthrough service break against Isner and won Friday night, 7-6 (3), 6-2. 'He's probably the best server we have in the game,' Djokovic said. 'But I managed to get a lot of serves back. That was one of the keys in the match, making him play and getting into the rally and making him work extra.' Novak Djokovic beat John Isner in straight sets to reach the finalof the Miami Open on Friday night . The No 1-seeded Djokovic closed to within one win of his fifth Key Biscayne title and will face Andy Murray . The No 1-seeded Djokovic closed to within one win of his fifth Key Biscayne title. His opponent Sunday will be two-time champion Andy Murray, who defeated Tomas Berdych 6-4, 6-4. Djokovic became the first player in the tournament to break Isner, and managed another break two games later. He actually outserved the 6-foot-10 American, totaling 10 aces to nine for Isner, and never faced a break point. A taut, one-hour opening set created plenty of drama for the capacity crowd. Isner held despite several long service games and erased the only break point he faced late in the set, but he won only two of five points on his serve in the pivotal tiebreaker. Djokovic's biggest hole while serving was a love-30 deficit late in the first set. He responded with consecutive aces and escaped. Djokovic is aiming to win his fifth title in Miami and will take on Scotsman Murray in Sunday's final . Djokovic's first break gave him a 2-1 edge in the second set, and that margin grew to 5-1. He finished with just eight unforced to 31 by Isner, who lost 70 percent of his second-serve points. 'I needed to step in and use those opportunities,' Djokovic said. 'When I have his second serve, I'd better use it properly and try to be aggressive.' Djokovic won the Key Biscayne title in 2007, 2011, 2012 and 2014. Serena Williams bids for her eighth Key Biscayne title Saturday against Carla Suarez Navarro. Djokovic's biggest holin serving was a love-30 deficit late in the first, he responded with consecutive aces . Murray lost his first service game in each set but recovered and moved closer to his third Key Biscayne title by beating Berdych. Murray won the championship in 2009 and 2013, and was the runner-up in 2012. The Scotsman has a home in nearby Miami and practices on the Key Biscayne courts. 'I've obviously played some good tennis here over the years,' Murray said. 'The reason for that is because I'm extremely familiar with the conditions, with the surface, the way the court plays.' Aside from his two shaky service games, the No. 3-seeded Murray played almost flawless tennis against No. 8 Berdych, extending points with scrambling defense until the Czech would finally make a mistake. Djokovic won the Key Biscayne title in 2007, 2011, 2012 and 2014 and is now going for his sixth Miami crown . Murray, by contrast, totaled only eight unforced errors from the baseline. He improvised, too, winning points with unorthodox strokes requiring compound adjectives, such as a running shoetop-scoop lob and an underhand-swipe backhand drop shot. Murray fell behind love-30 serving in the final game but rallied and smacked winners on the final four points, including a nifty forehand volley and cross-court backhand. When a final forehand gave him the win, he screamed in jubilation and repeatedly pumped his arm like a piston. 'I just played a bit better than him. That was the difference,' Murray said. 'When I was behind in games, like the last game, for example, I came up with some big serves and was able to dictate a lot of the rallies from the baseline.' The final is Murray's first since he was runner-up to Djokovic at the Australian Open on February 1 . The final is Murray's first since he was runner-up to Djokovic at the Australian Open on February 1, and his first in two years at an ATP Masters 1000 tournament. He's 9-3 in Masters 1000 finals. Murray improved to 6-6 against Berdych and has won their past two matches. 'Andy changed the game plan a bit,' Berdych said. 'He started to play much more aggressive in the last two matches that he played me. Now I know what to expect and I'll just be more ready for it.'","Novak Djokovic beat John Isner 7-6. 6-2 in their Miami semi-final .

"The saviour of English football turns out to be a long-haired Argentinian who tripped Michael Owen to give away the penalty that David Beckham converted in the 2002 World Cup finals. Mauricio Pochettino, 43, who has long since lost the flowing locks in favour of something a little more in keeping with his managerial status, has gathered a considerable reputation since arriving in England just over two years ago. It is not just his coaching which is admired. He is also becoming the manager for whom young Englishmen wish to play, as exclusive research by The Mail on Sunday proves. Mauricio Pochettino could be the saviour of English football thanks to his faith in homegrown talent . The Argentine has gathered a considerable reputation since arriving in England just over two years ago . Andros Townsend (second left) celebrates his goal for England alongside his young Tottenham team-mates . In the week in which four of his young Tottenham players — Harry Kane, Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Kyle Walker — all played for England, Mason has paid tribute to the impact the Argentine has had on the English game. A year ago an England debut was the last thing on Mason’s mind. After spending the previous season on loan at Swindon and unused by Tottenham, he feared he would have to leave the club. ‘I was in the last two years of my contract and getting to that age when if it didn’t happen this season, I probably would look to leave,’ said Mason. But, when Tim Sherwood was replaced by Pochettino, 23-year-old Mason had reasons to be cheerful. ‘At the start of the season I was looking forward to it because of what the gaffer did at Southampton and his record of bringing young players through,’ he said. (Left-right) Ryan Mason, Kyle Walker, Townsend and Harry Kane celebrate in the game against Italy . Mason made his debut for England against Italy in midweek after breaking into the Spurs team this season . Which managers have the most faith in young, English talent? The Mail on Sunday looked at Premier League clubs in the past three years (since the start of the 2012-13 season) to see where homegrown talent was getting the most opportunities to play. After counting the amount of League starts handed out by each manager to English players aged under 23, the percentage of each manager’s total starting selections shows that Mauricio Pochettino (below), of active bosses, backs young talent most. This table shows the top 10 and bottom six managers (out of 42), showing their total player selections and games, and the percentage of all starters who fit our ‘young and English’ criteria. And three Chelsea managers make up the bottom three. Pochettino’s record of sticking by English players such as Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez, and backing youngsters such as Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers and James Ward-Prowse in the Southampton first team, struck a chord with Mason and his peers. The Argentine is a godsend for FA chairman Greg Dyke, whose commission is attempting to find ways to nudge more managers into playing their young English players rather than rely on often mediocre, imported talent. ‘He is honest and picks the team on how you’re training,’ said Mason of his manager. ‘And if you are in the team and doing well then you’re staying there. It’s brilliant for young players as he gives you that opportunity.’ Mason, Kane and Walker were quick to congratulate their team-mate Townsend on scoring England’s spectacular equaliser in the 1-1 draw with Italy. Only Walker is not from the Spurs academy, having joined from Sheffield United at 19. Mason’s girlfriend, Rachel, has had a copy of the Turin celebration photo framed for his living room. Another man who enjoyed Pochettino’s support may soon be joining those four in the England squad. Ward-Prowse, 20, who scored the winner for England Under 21s against Germany on Monday and who should be a key player at the European Championship this summer, is likely to be promoted to the senior squad when that tournament in the Czech Republic is over. James Ward-Prowse (right) of Southampton could be another to soon join them in the England squad . England boss Roy Hodgson admitted 20-year-old Ward-Prowse is another player currently in their thoughts . Ryan Mason’s parents missed his England debut as high winds caused their flight to Italy to be cancelled. They made a failed last-minute dash to get to the match via Germany but didn’t make it to Turin in time. Spurs’ Mason, who plays at Burnley today, said: ‘They were devastated.’ ‘We like him,’ said England manager Roy Hodgson. ‘We’ve kept our hands off him simply because of the Under 21s but we know he’s a big prospect and the moment he comes back from the Czech Republic he’ll be very much in our thoughts.’ Mason believes more youngsters would come through if managers were willing to take a chance on the likes of him. ‘The Germans and Spanish are not better than us technically,’ he said. ‘But they get given the opportunity younger in their league, so they get the chance to come and play in the Premier League. I understand there is a lot of pressure on managers to get instant results. But English players know the league. And there is plenty of talent out there. If English players can start coming through it will benefit our national team.’ It should also benefit the clubs, especially the elite. With the majority of the world’s best players emerging from South America, Spain and Germany, those players are likely to aspire to play for Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Premier League clubs cannot expect to match those European giants unless the English game produces a foundation of top talent. But The Mail on Sunday research demonstrates just which clubs and, more importantly, which managers are prepared to take a risk on young English talent. The acid test is whether a manager will start a player in a Premier League game. Using that criterion and then listing which managers have started with English players under the age of 23 in the past three seasons, Pochettino emerges as the champion of the English among current Premier League bosses. Norwegian Ole Gunnar Solskjaer did his bit during his admittedly unsuccessful time at Cardiff. But two Scottish managers, Alan Irvine and Malky Mackay, also feature high in our league table, as does Northern Irishman Brendan Rodgers and, perhaps surprisingly, Portuguese Andre Villas-Boas. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer did his bit for homegrown development during his unsuccessful time at Cardiff . Former West Brom boss Alan Irvine also did before his dismissal at The Hawthorns . When the figures are broken down club by club, Southampton, Liverpool and Arsenal are top of the league, with Chelsea bottom. In fact, Chelsea have not started an under 23 player qualified to play for England since Ryan Bertrand and Sam Hutchinson played on the last day of the 2011-12 season against Blackburn, a few months before they turned 23. Because of the lack of English youngsters available to them, Chelsea managers Jose Mourinho, Rafael Benitez and Roberto di Matteo are bottom of the managerial table. Perhaps the emergence of Patrick Bamford, on loan at Middlesbrough, or highly rated Dominic Solanke will change that next term. Patrick Bamford is currently on loan from Chelsea at Championship side Middlesbrough . Dominic Solanke is another player impressing at England youth level in Chelsea's setup . The irony is that Chelsea have the best youth set-up in the country, having won the FA Youth Cup three times in the past five years — and they are in the final again this year. Manuel Pellegrini is also near the bottom of the managerial table. Jack Rodwell, now at Sunderland, is the only Englishman under 23 Pellegrini has ever fielded during his time at Manchester City. But the issue is clearly more complex than simply pointing the finger at foreign-owned, big-spending clubs. Stoke City, owned by one of England’s most passionate supporters in Peter Coates, are near the bottom of the table, as is Hull City manager Steve Bruce. So quite where Mason and his like would be without Argentinian support is open to question. Pochettino, it appears, is already doing more to change the culture of English football than any commission or directive.","Mauricio Pochettino has gathered a considerable reputation in England .

"Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton haven't always seen eye-to-eye in the past 12 months but the pair appeared to be singing from the same hymn sheet on Thursday. Fresh from being beaten by Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel at the Malaysian Grand Prix on March 29, the Mercedes team-mates have been collaborating with their team to ensure the prancing horse doesn't gallop to victory at the next race in China.

Speaking after the race in Malaysia, Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff conceded that he was a worried man following the manner of Vettel's victory. Suggestions of another season of Mercedes domination in the wake of a comfortable one-two in the season-opening race in Australia were blown apart by Ferrari and Vettel. The four-time world champion beat Hamilton by 8.5 seconds, with team-mate Nico Rosberg a further four seconds adrift in third. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff (right) was surprised by Sebastian Vettel's Malaysian Grand Prix victory . Wolff admitted that the German driver deserved to win and Ferrari got their tactics spot-on in the soaring heat . Despite searing heat of more than 30 degrees, Vettel's Ferrari was kinder on its tyres, stopping just twice compared to three for both Hamilton and Rosberg. And afterwards Wolff admitted: 'We were pretty sure the three-stop strategy would work for us. 'We probably went a bit too aggressive on set-up, which pushed us into a direction of a three-stop. 'But in the circumstances, with the high temperatures, they were able to go at a faster pace over long runs than us. 'We need to analyse why that was the case, and it clearly shows it's not going to be an easy one. 'It is clear they won the race, which is worrying. It wouldn't be right to say we lost it.'

"Formula One great Jackie Stewart has bemoaned the downfall of the German Grand Prix and is urging the sport's bosses not to forsake tradition for money as the number of European races on the calendar dwindles. The German GP was erased from the 2015 schedule because of financial problems and F1 commercial head Bernie Ecclestone could not guarantee the future of the iconic Italian Grand Prix. The race had been in doubt due to questions over which circuit would host the race, which has been shared between Hockenheim and Nurburgring in recent seasons. F1 races have started to move away from Europe towards lucrative venues in the Middle East . Nico Rosberg celebrates winning last year's German GP, which has been scrapped from the schedule . Officials from both circuits had voiced concern that time was running out to organise the race, which was scheduled to take place over the weekend of July 17-19. A short FIA statement said no agreement could be reached with Ecclestone, the commercial rights holder (CRH). 'The German Grand Prix has been withdrawn as the CRH and promoter did not reach agreement,' the statement said.

"England World Cup winner Jason Robinson has revealed he once contemplated suicide during a troubled period of his career in which he was arrested for violent offences. Speaking in the documentary Jason Robinson: Sports Life Stories, which will be broadcast on ITV4 at 10pm on Tuesday, the 40-year-old former dual-code international admitted he had been a heavy drinker during his early days at rugby league club Wigan, which almost led to his downfall. Robinson, who scored for England in the 2003 World Cup final victory against Australia, said: 'I got into a situation where I was drinking sometimes six nights a week.

'Monday it was Wakefield, 10 pence a pint night. Tuesday I would be over to Liverpool, Wednesday it would be Oldham. Thursday it would be Wigan. And after the game we would go out wherever.' However, it was his arrest for affray, assault and criminal damage which left him considering an attempt on his own life and he credits then team-mate and Samoa star Va'aiga Tuigamala with turning things around. 'I can remember I just sat in my bedroom with an old knife, an old meat cleaver,' he recalled. 'I didn't want life to go on in this way. That night when I contemplated doing it, I wept like a baby.

Levy sacked Sherwood as Spurs head coach at the end of last season and brought in Mauricio Pochettino, ending the 46-year-old's five-month stay in charge and six-year relationship with the club at development level. But rather than express bitterness at the split, Sherwood, who takes Villa to north London on Saturday, had nothing but praise for Levy, who joined in 2001, and his former employers. Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood watches his players in training at Bodymoor Heath on Thursday . Midfielder Tom Cleverley and his team-mates warm up as they prepare to face Tottenham on Saturday . 'I wouldn't be sitting here as Aston Villa manager if wasn't for Tottenham Hotspur,' Sherwood said. 'They've been very good to me over the years. I have a lot of respect for that football club but it's all about what I can give to Aston Villa at the weekend. 'I've been in communication with Daniel Levy since I've left, I haven't got a problem. He's the chairman of the club and he makes those decisions based on what he thinks is in their best interest. 'I was there the day he walked in to the club and he made some changes about three days after that. He got rid of George Graham and brought in Glenn Hoddle, that was in the weeks building up to the FA Cup semi final. 'He is not frightened of making decisions at crucial times. He has continued with that. You have to say Tottenham Hotspur is a far better club now than when he found it. Striker Christian Benteke was back in training after scoring a hat-trick against QPR on Tuesday night . Fabian Delph takes a touch as Villa's players get put through their paces at Villa's training ground . 'I look at their results because it is a club I spent good times at. Whatever has gone on, has gone on. I was relieved of my duties and walked out with my head held very high, I was pleased with what I did, but I respect the decision made by Daniel Levy and his board, they've been good for me. 'They only made that decision based on what they believe is best for the football club. I haven't got to agree with it. I just move on. 'I thank them because not being there now is the reason I am at this fantastic football club.' Sherwood also praised Pochettino for continuing to blood young players such as Harry Kane, Ryan Mason, and Nabil Bentaleb. Sherwood believes Mauricio Pochettino deserves credit for playing young players at Tottenham . Defender Ciaran Clark (centre) stretches as Sherwood prepares his side to visit White Hart Lane on Saturday . 'I do look back with pride,' added Sherwood. 'Especially if you're talking about the young players who have emerged to be regulars in the first team, there are probably three or four who are first names on that team sheet. That gives me immense pride. 'You have to give a lot of credit to Pochettino for sticking with them boys also. A lot of managers would have gone 'no thank you, give me some of those players who end in an I or an O from foreign countries, who might not be as good as these young players'. But he hasn't, he's stuck to plan, and I've got to give him a lot of credit for that. 'I think I was right because they've emerged as top talents. Harry Kane was exceptional. These are players who cost the club nothing, probably a hundred grand between them on what they've eaten through the years in that canteen! That's all.'","Aston Villa take on Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Saturday, KO at 3pm .

"A new county cricket season is almost upon us with the first round of Championship fixtures this summer beginning on Sunday up and down the country. Yorkshire will be looking to defend their Division One title while Kevin Pietersen will hope his runs help Surrey to promotion from the second tier. Here is former Surrey and England batsman Mark Butcher's guide to the County Championship. DIVISION ONE . Durham . Verdict: I don’t think they have the strength to carry the title off. The best they can hope for is to consolidate their status as a regular Division One side. But they always have a flotilla of pace bowlers to look out for. Key man: Mark Wood – a highly promising quick, as England have realised. Overseas: John Hastings (Aus) Durham's side pose for their team photo ahead of the 2015 county cricket season . Hampshire . Verdict: It’s always difficult for any team that’s just been promoted: Worcestershire go up and down every year. But if West Indies paceman Fidel Edwards, signed as a Kolpak, can stay fit they have a chance. And Michael Carberry will have a point to prove as well. Key man: It would be fantastic if Sean Ervine can make the most of his undoubted talent. Overseas: Jackson Bird (Aus), Yasir Arafat (Pak, limited-overs) Hampshire players join in with a selfie with their sponsors at their Ageas Bowl home in Southampton . Middlesex . Verdict: I tipped them for the title last season, but they barely ended up escaping relegation. The loss of Adam Voges to Australia’s Ashes squad is a big blow, and they’ll need to replace the runs of his fellow Ashes tourist Chris Rogers at the top of the order. Key man: The return of a revitalised Nick Compton from Somerset is huge. Overseas: TBC . Nick Compton has joined Middlesex from Somerset with a point to prove to England selectors . Nottinghamshire . Verdict: They promised much in 2014, but delivered little. Yorkshire overhauled them easily in the end. But I expect them to be strong, especially in seam bowling: Vernon Philander’s a big signing, and they’ll have the experienced Ben Hilfenhaus too. Key man: This is Alex Hales’s chance to prove he can be more than just a one-day hitter. Overseas: Vernon Philander (SA), Ben Hilfenhaus (Aus), Darren Sammy (WI, T20) Big things will be expected of Nottinghamshire in the 2015 season given their strength and depth . Somerset . Verdict: With the likes of Marcus Trescothick, they have a wealth of experience at Taunton now, which they’ll need – they’ve often struggled to get over the line because of a lack of cricketing nous. But they’re brimming with talent, and the Overton twins – Craig and Jamie – will be worth watching. Key man: The new coach Matthew Maynard – his edge is just what they need. Overseas: Abdur Rehman (Pak), Sohail Tanvir (Pak, T20), Corey Anderson (NZ, T20). Somerset's new director of cricket Matthew Maynard will be hoping to leave his mark at Taunton . Sussex . Verdict: My tip for the title. Ed Joyce is back from another successful World Cup with Ireland, and they’ll have Tymal Mills to steam in down the hill: lefties are all the rage right now. Throw in Chris Jordan, Luke Wright, Steve Magoffin and Mahela Jayawardene, and there’s a heap of talent. Key man: Magoffin’s accurate seam bowling is one of the game’s most unsung phenomena. Overseas: Steve Magoffin (Aus), Mahela Jayawardene (SL, T20) Chris Nash (left) and Ed Joyce (right) at Sussex's media day ahead of the new season at Hove . Warwickshire . Verdict: They had a cracking summer last year, and they have a nice blend of experienced players and others approaching their peak, in the 27-31 category. They’ll need to keep the squad fit so they can rotate – and it’ll be interesting to see how much of Jonathan Trott they’ll get, because he’ll have an eye on the Ashes. Key man: Jeetan Patel – 59 Championship wickets last year with his off-breaks. Overseas: Jeetan Patel (NZ), Brendon McCullum (NZ, T20) England fast bowler Chris Woakes dressed in Warwickshire's yellow limited-overs strip . Worcestershire . Verdict: It often confounds me how a team that looks so workmanlike on paper can keep appearing in Division One ahead of more fancied sides, but coach Steve Rhodes gets them playing disciplined cricket, and Daryl Mitchell’s a terrific leader. Key man: If the pitches are dry in the second half of the season, Saeed Ajmal could keep them up by himself. Overseas: Sachithra Senanayake (SL), Saeed Ajmal (Pak), Colin Munro (NZ, T20) Pakistani spinner Saeed Ajmal could prove to be a big weapon during the 2015 county season . Yorkshire . Verdict: Their biggest challenge in defending their title will be how to cope with losing so many players to England. But well done to them for fulfilling a major part of a county’s brief, which is to produce Test cricketers. And it’s a predominantly Yorkshire-born team too. Key man: Andrew Gale – the captain will be ever-present while others are on England duty. Overseas: Cheteshwar Pujara (Ind), Aaron Finch (Aus), Kane Williamson (NZ), Glenn Maxwell (Aus, T20) Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale celebrates winning Division One at the end of the 2014 season . DIVISION TWO . Derbyshire . Verdict: Martin Guptill will arrive fresh from his World Cup heroics, and last season Mark Footitt was far and away the quickest bowler on the county circuit. They’ll be a tough nut to crack. Key man: Mark Footitt was the Championships’ leading wicket-taker in 2014 with 82 at 19 each. Overseas: Martin Guptill (NZ), Tillekeratne Dilshan (SL, T20), Nathan Rimmington (Aus, T20) New Zealand's World Cup star Martin Guptill will play for Derbyshire this summer . Essex . Verdict: Somehow, they always manage to mess up their promotion bid. Jesse Ryder will give them a bit of X-factor, but they’ve lost two talented young players in Tymal Mills and wicketkeeper Ben Foakes. Key man: Graham Napier – potentially destructive with both bat and ball. Overseas: Jesse Ryder (NZ), Shaun Tait (Aus, T20) Essex star Mark Pettini holds an eagle during the team's media day at Chelmsford . Glamorgan . Verdict: They’ve been finding life very difficult of late, and they’ve had a bit of an overhaul during the winter. Having Jacques Rudolph available for the whole season is a boost, and South African batsman Colin Ingram has arrived as a Kolpak. Key man: Graham Wagg is a feisty all-rounder. Overseas: Jacques Rudolph (SA) Glamorgan have endured a tough time of late and will be hoping for better fortunes in 2015 . Gloucestershire . Verdict: The loss of the Gidman brothers – Alex and Will – leaves a big hole in the side, both on and off the field. It’s interesting that Geraint Jones will captain them in four-day cricket, but it’s hard to see them improving on their seventh-place finish from last year. Key player: Will Tavare's runs could be crucial. Overseas: Peter Handscomb (Aus), Michael Klinger (Aus) Former Kent and England wicketkeeper Geraint Jones will captain Gloucestershire in four-day cricket . Kent . Verdict: As ever, their problem will be how to take 20 wickets, but at least seamer Matt Coles is back from Hampshire. The batting looks stronger, with Joe Denly rejoining from Middlesex, and young talent in Daniel Bell-Drummond and Sam Northeast. Key player: Sam Billings – an England star in the making. Overseas: TBC . Kent star Sam Billings in training with the England Lions in Cape Town in January . Lancashire . Verdict: They had a massively disappointing 2014, going straight back down after winning Division Two. But, along with Surrey, they’ll fancy their chances of promotion. And their new coach, Ashley Giles, will be keen as mustard after being discarded by England. Key player: Tom Smith – showed his all-round class last summer. Overseas: Peter Siddle (Aus) Lancashire endured a disappointing 2014 campaign which ended in relegation back to Division Two . Leicestershire . Verdict: They were rock bottom last year, and without a Championship win in two seasons, but there’s a feeling of renewal at Grace Road: a new chief executive in Wasim Khan, and three Australians in Andrew McDonald (coach), Mark Cosgrove (captain) and Clint McKay (seamer). Key player: Cosgrove can give Leicestershire some rollicking starts. Overseas: Clint McKay (Aus) Former Australia all-rounder Andrew McDonald (right) will coach Leicestershire this summer . Northamptonshire . Verdict: They’ll be wiser for the experience after a dismal 2014, when a pre-season injury to captain Alex Wakely proved a disaster. Time to prove that they can rediscover the form that made them such a hit in 2013. Key player: Local lad David Willey bowls brisk left-arm and gives it a whack. Overseas: Rory Kleinveldt (SA), Shahid Afridi (Pak, T20) Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi will play T20 cricket for Northamptonshire this summer . Surrey . Verdict: The KP circus is coming to town. There’ll be plenty of attention on the club, and therefore also on the talented younger players – the likes of Jason Roy, Rory Burns, Zafar Ansari and Matt Dunn. They’ve simply got to get out of Division Two. Key player: Jason Roy – a big chance to nudge the England selectors. Overseas: Kumar Sangakkara (SL), Moises Henriques (Aus) Kevin Pietersen has returned to Surrey in a bit to resurrect his international career with England .

"Burnley defender Michael Duff was satisfied with a point against Tottenham and the way his side subdued prolific goalscorer Harry Kane at Turf Moor. Kane's first outing as captain of Tottenham failed to inspire Spurs in an insipid 0-0 draw against Burnley in a result which helped neither side. Sean Dyche's Clarets would have escaped the bottom three had they won, while Spurs' hopes of a top-four spot look to have evaporated. Burnley defender Michael Duff was satisfied with the way his side subdued prolific goalscorer Harry Kane . Kane could not find a way to break the deadlock at Turf Moor in the 0-0 draw on Sunday afternoon . 'I think as a team we handled him (Kane) well,' Duff told Sky Sports 1. 'We pressed them high up the pitch and you could see that many many times. It's something we pride ourselves on. 'We haven't got the multi-multi-million pound superstars that maybe some teams have in this league or the budget to go with it but we work hard and you can see the fans appreciate that.' Danny Ings missed an early chance to put Burnley ahead and Clarets defender Jason Shackell thinks his side need to be more clinical from now until the end of the season. 'I thought we played well today and we had a few chances,' the 31-year-old said. Burnley tried to press high up the pitch as a way of neutralising the threat posed by top scorer Kane . Duff clears the ball ahead of the challenge of Kane in a game that lacked clear-cut chances for both teams . 'We need to be a bit more clinical between now and the end of the season but it's another point and that's a point in the right direction. 'If he (Ings) had put the ball in the back of the net of course it would have been different but he's been phenomenal and will get a few more goals for us before the end of the season for sure.' Duff added: 'We just keep taking it a game at a time. It's another marker and another point in the right direction. It's a tough league and at times it's hard to get points so we'll take anything we can get.' Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson had a pop at Spurs substitute Andros Townsend after the match .

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League's Easter weekend fixtures and the race for promotion across the Football League. 1. Playing Jordan Henderson as a wing back instead of in his normal central midfield position was an idea that went spectacularly wrong for Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. The England star, who has taken over the captain’s armband in the absence of Steven Gerrard, gave the ball away 23 times in 90 minutes as he struggled to handle the role at Arsenal. Jordan Henderson (left) toiled as a wing back in Liverpool's defeat against Arsenal and lost the ball 23 times . Henderson, usually a central midfielder, has not given the ball away as much all season for Liverpool . There hasn’t been a single one of his previous 29 Premier League appearances this season in which he’s lost possession more. 2. John O’Shea has clearly learned the canny defender’s art of letting his brain do all the running. The theory is if you get in the right position in the first place, you don’t have to chase to recover. In 90 minutes of helping Sunderland keep a clean sheet against Newcastle, the Ireland international logged just 11.9 metres at sprint speed on the EA Sports performance data. It clearly works for him – he’ll be 34 at the end of this month but remains the sole Premier League outfield player to have appeared in every minute of every game in all competitions for his club this season. John O'Shea only sprinted 11.9 metres during his impressive display in Sunderland's 1-0 win over Newcastle . O'Shea (third left) celebrated Sunderland's win with Costel Pantilimon when the final whistle was blown . For good measure he’s also completed the full 90 minutes of all five European Championship qualifiers for the Republic. 3. Steven Caulker’s form has suffered from playing with too many different partners at QPR but there are signs the former Spurs and Cardiff centre half is returning to his best. The 23-year-old was a towering figure as a West Brom side led by the powerful figure of substitute Victor Anichebe fought to recover from being three goals down at half-time. Steven Caulker (right) wins a header against West Bromwich Albion striker Brown Ideye . Caulker made 20 clearances – as many as the rest of the Rangers back four put together – and more than any other Premier League defender all weekend. 4. Chelsea need have few fears if Diego Costa’s hamstring problems mean they have to rely on Loic Remy for goals in the last eight games of the season. The France international’s tap-in from Eden Hazard’s pass for the winner against Stoke was his fifth Premier League goal of the season from just 456 minutes on the pitch. Loic Remy (centre) scored Chelsea's winner in their 2-1 victory over Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . Remy could be vital to Chelsea as they look to win the Premier League title after Diego Costa went off injured . That’s a goal every 91 minutes – actually a better ratio than Costa whose 19 Premier League goals have come at the rate of one every 103 minutes. 5. Burnley boss Sean Dyche has talked about stability all season and continues to practise what he preaches. He picked an unchanged side for the 16th time this season for the home clash with Tottenham and was rewarded with a valuable point. Sean Dyche selected an unchanged side for the 16th time as Burnley drew 0-0 with Tottenham on Sunday . That’s more than double the number of times any other club has kept the same starting XI – next highest is Leicester with seven. 6. Kasper Schmeichel looked to have lost his first-team place at Leicester a few weeks ago following the arrival from Chelsea of veteran Mark Schwarzer. But the 28-year-old son of Manchester United legend Peter returned for the 4-3 defeat at Tottenham just before the international break, and justified Nigel Pearson’s decision to keep him in the side with a brilliant display in the 2-1 win over West Ham. Kasper Schmeichel made a string of outstanding stops as Leicester beat West Ham 2-1 . Schmeichel made six saves as well as several vital catches – the only time he has made more saves in a game this season was the eight at Chelsea back in August that stopped a 2-0 defeat becoming a rout. 7. Swansea boss Garry Monk shared the club’s rise from football’s basement to the Premier League as a player, and isn’t afraid to back his belief there are more in League Two with the potential to play at the top. He put his club’s money where his mouth is by signing Matt Grimes from Exeter for £1.75million in January, and has now given the 19-year-old his debut in the top flight. Matt Grimes (right) impressed in his substitute appearance for Swansea in the 3-1 win against Hull . It wasn’t a bad little cameo, either. Swansea scored their third in the 3-1 win over Hull barely a minute after Grimes came on. 8. Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer left striker Jordan Rhodes out of his starting side for the 0-0 FA Cup quarter-final at Liverpool – but surely can’t drop him again for Wednesday’s replay. The 25-year-old Scotland international is in the best scoring form of even his prolific career after netting the second of the 3-0 win at Leeds. It was his eighth goal in the last 12 games for Blackburn and took his total for the season to 17 from 35 Championship starts. Jordan Rhodes (right) scores Blackburn's second goal against Leeds in the Championship on Saturday . 9. Boyhood Hearts fan Jason Holt admitted he was upset at missing out on the celebrations when his old club clinched top spot in the Scottish Championship a few weeks ago. But the midfielder who moved to Sheffield United in January might yet be able to open some bubbly with his new club after scoring in the 2-0 derby win at Barnsley. It was the 22-year-old's third in as many games and gave Nigel Clough’s side a seven-point cushion for a place in the League One play-off zone. Midfielder Jason Holt (left) is proving important to Sheffield United's hopes of going up a division . John Akinde celebrates scoring for Barnet, where he has found the net 30 times in the league this season . 10. John Akinde has a peculiar place in the football history books for being the first player sold by an internet vote of fans – he was a promising teenager at Ebbsfleet in 2008 when the online poll decided to let him move to Bristol City. The striker’s move never worked out – but seven years and nine clubs later he’s setting records again and this time for much better reasons. His finish against Nuneaton that took Barnet back to the top of the Vanarama Conference was his 30th League goal of the season, equalling Gary Bull’s club record set in 1991.","Jordan Henderson struggled being played as a wing back for Liverpool .

"Nedum Onuoha is wanted by Hull City. The QPR centre-back is one of several players poised to leave should the Loftus Road club go down as they consider streamlining their squad. The 28-year-old has 15 months left on contract and has played regularly under Chris Ramsey. Onuoha was in the starting eleven for the Saturday's crucial 4-1 win over relegation rivals West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns. Nedum Onuoha is being targeted by Hull City but is also interesting Everton and West Ham United . Stoke manager Mark Hughes who signed him for QPR is also interested as are Everton and West Ham.

"Harry Kane hailed an unforgettable week after taking his England bow and becoming the youngest captain in the Premier League this season - but he will want to erase the memory of Tottenham's goalless draw at Burnley. Kane, 21, was chosen as Spurs captain after a week which has also seen him score on his England debut and make his first start for the national team. It was a frustrating end to the week for Kane however as Spurs struggled to make an impact against a hard-working Burnley side who earned a precious point in their battle to avoid relegation. Harry Kane has hailed his trailblazing few days as the ‘best week of my life’ after captaining Tottenham . That came after he scored within seconds of his England debut against Lithuania on March 27 at Wembley . Kane said: 'You could say it has been the best week of my life - to score, to make my first start and score for England, and to be captain today. It has been an unbelievable couple of weeks and one I won't forget for the rest of my career.' Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino admitted a top-four place may be beyond his side as they are seven points off fourth-placed Manchester City - who play Crystal Palace on Monday night - with a vastly inferior goal difference. Pochettino said: 'It is difficult but we have seven games, we will try. It is true that it is not easy. This game was a very tough game and we need to try to win the most points possible in the next seven games. 'The way Burnley play it is difficult, because always there is long balls into the box. They are a very aggressive team and run a lot. It is difficult to find space to play. 'We played better in the second half and we made some chances but it was not enough to score. Three weeks ago Manchester City lost here. It is not an excuse but it is a very, very difficult team.' Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino still believes they can catch Manchester City and finish fourth . The goalless draw at Burnley left Tottenham down in sixth, some seven points adrift of Man City . At just 21 years and 251 days, the Tottenham striker led out his side for the first time in draw with Burnley . Kane could not find a way to break the deadlock for Tottenham in their 0-0 draw at Turf Moor on Sunday . Pochettino confirmed Kyle Walker, who limped off, has a sprain but said it was 'not a big issue'. Burnley manager Sean Dyche claimed the Clarets had the better of the match and rued a gilt-edged chance missed by Danny Ings, who shot straight at Michel Vorm when it seemed easier to score. He said: 'I think we edged the game, but there was not a lot in it. 'We kept the tempo high and kept pressing high. Danny has had a great chance and it was unlike him not to put it away, he almost hit it too cleanly. 'Having said that we are pleased to get another clean sheet against a top side.' Dyche picked out Ashley Barnes for special praise but said the whole of his team had performed well against a Spurs side boasting four England players. The Burnley boss also said he was not too concerned by their struggles to find the net - they have only scored once in five games. He added: 'I prefer to look at it as two clean sheets in the last three games against some fantastic sides.'

"By the time Bobby Zamora caressed the ball with sublime precision on the gallop to lob Boaz Myhill from the edge of his area, the impression was firm that even the highly improbable can happen. This was quite likely the finest goal of Zamora’s long career, a strike of rare quality that never looked on seconds before the ball was in the back of the net. Chris Ramsey will hope Queens Park Rangers’ season can follow a similarly implausible trajectory. Written off by many, this victory, only a second on the road all season, claws QPR closer to safety.

Sportsmail's Match Zone shows where Bobby Zamora struck QPR's third goal . Joey Barton’s name was sung loud by travelling fans at the final whistle, in recognition of a fine display capped by a goal in added time to give this win an emphatic scoreline. He drove onto a lose ball in the West Bromwich Albion box and lashed home with the ferocity of someone determined not to go down with a whimper. Earlier, in the 84th minute, he received a forearm in the face from substitute Youssouf Mulumbu that saw referee Lee Probert produce a red card. Was Mulumbu’s act in retribution for Barton’s claims Albion players had ‘s***’ themselves when leading 2-0 at Loftus Road in December to lose 3-2? Only he will know. What is without question is that Ramsey’s team are fighting for their lives. Five successive defeats preceded this game, but three points paints fresh gloss on their survival hopes. For Tony Pulis, this was a bad day. His talks with chairman Jeremy Peace once safety is assured will have to wait.

Barton (left) lies on the ground holding his head after the foul that saw Mulumbu dismissed from the pitch . Albion had the first clear opening in the 14th minute. Darren Fletcher swung over a deep cross to find Brown Ideye, but the Nigeria striker directed his header above the bar. Moments later, the visitors were ahead in stunning fashion. A long ball by Robert Green was helped on by Zamora and nodded into the path of Vargas by Austin. The Chilean cut across two West Brom defenders and let fly a cracking shot the other direction, utterly defeating Myhill from 25 yards. ‘How s*** must you be, we’re winning away,’ sang the travelling hoard. The hosts responded, with a cross by Chris Baird sent trickling wide by Ideye four yards out. Soon after Vargas went down clutching his knee with nobody near him. Baird continued play to the fury of Sandro, who rushed over once the ball had gone dead to remonstrate in rather close proximity to the Albion defender. Vargas tried to continue but hobbled off minutes later, bringing the introduction of Niko Kranjcar. The Croatian delivered a telling contribution in the 37th minute, flicking on a corner by Matt Phillips to find Austin unmarked at the far post. The QPR striker applied the finishing touch as expected to take his Premier League tally to 16, his fourth against West Brom following a hat-trick in the fixture at Loftus Road. Two minutes before the interval, Zamora provided that moment to take the breath. Phillips played the ball to the forward but danger seemed distant by the corner of the area. Instead Zamora glanced a shot with the outside of his left boot to send the ball soaring high before dropping into the corner of the net. It was joyous. QPR had done enough.

Pulis, no doubt furious with his team’s defending, introduced Victor Anichebe at half-time and his big frame had a sizeable effect. In the 55th minute presented a very appealing chance for Craig Gardner but only a tame shot followed. Three minutes later Anichebe had a goal for himself. Saido Berahino latched onto Chris Brunt’s long pass and dug out a cross that Anichebe reached ahead of Steven Caulker to steer into the far corner. Pulis replaced Chris Baird with Jonas Olsson and changed to a 3-4-3 formation, instigating an Albion surge. Robert Green punched clear a deflected shot by Ideye.

"Andy King thinks his 50th goal for Leicester City could prove to be his most important yet. Coming in the 86th minute of Saturday's match it was by no means his most spectacular, a mere flick from six yards out enough to take the ball past Adrian after a scuffed Jamie Vardy shot. But it was enough to defeat West Ham in a frenetic match and breathe life back into the side he has spent his whole career playing for. Andy King was the hero as Premier League strugglers Leicester City struck late to earn a vital three points . King is joined by David Nugent to celebrate his goal, the 50th he has scored for his club . Leicester remain at the foot of the Barclay’s Premier League table, a spot they have occupied since November, and four points from safety. But King, 26, thinks the momentum they are taking into the final eight matches of the season could be enough to propel them above the drop zone. ‘I’ve scored some pretty crucial goals before, but we might look back at the end of the season and that might turn out to be the most important one yet,’ said King, . ‘It’s always nice to score for the only club you’ve ever played for. I’ve had a brilliant journey with this club. 'I’ve been on 49 for a long time, and I’ve been in the Premier League for a good few months now - I was hoping it would’ve come earlier but I’ve ticked that milestone off now and I’m delighted about that. Nigel Pearson admits Leicester survival is still a 'big ask' despite win over West Ham . Pearson congratulates goalscorer Cambiasso after the final whistle of his side's win against the Hammers . ‘But most importantly it was about getting the three points and we have a lot of work to do between now and the end of the season to make sure we’re a Premier League team next season. ‘We’ve played well enough to prove we can survive and we’ve not turned it into results - this is a results business. That proves to everyone - not just ourselves - that we mean business.’ Leicester manager Nigel Pearson praised King, who he brought off the bench with 12 minutes to play and said his team were finally getting the results they deserved after several games this season where they have drawn or lost despite dominating. ‘I would love to be a lucky manager who plays crap and wins but we have not been that,’ he said. King says his goal against West Ham may turn out to be his most important for the club if they stay up . ‘It would be a pretty grumpy man who wouldn't let them enjoy winning but we have to keep our destiny in our own hands.’ His opposite number Sam Allardyce denied West Ham were ‘drifting’ towards the end of the season having won just twice in the last 14 games. ‘We’re not drifting but where we’re failing is we’re not as clinical as we used to be. Lads in their first season have found out what physical and mental attributes are needed for a long premier league season.’","Andy King scored his 50th goal to earn Leicester three points .

"West Bromwich Albion will make a £3million move for Wales international left-back Neil Taylor this summer. Swansea are willing to listen to offers for the 26-year-old who has impressed several Premier League managers over the past few years including Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool and Alan Pardew at Crystal Palace. However, Tony Pulis is keen to jump in and show his desire to sign the stylish defender ahead of what could be a busy summer at the Hawthorns.

"Leicester boss Nigel Pearson would have had the 'outstanding' Esteban Cambiasso down as his man of the match in Saturday's 2-1 win over West Ham even if the veteran Foxes midfielder had not scored his fine goal. Cambiasso netted with a sweet strike in the 12th minute to put his side 1-0 up at the King Power Stadium, hitting the ball first time from just outside the box after it had sat up for him from a ricochet. And Pearson said of the 34-year-old former Real Madrid, Inter Milan and Argentina player: 'Even if he hadn't scored the goal, I would still have said he was man of the match. Leicester midfielder Esteban Cambiasso has received high praise from his manager Nigel Pearson . The former Real Madrid and Inter Milan star celebrates after putting his side in the lead against West Ham . Leicester remain rooted to the bottom of the table . 'And with the goal, I think it is pretty obvious he was. I think he was outstanding.' The victory to which Cambiasso contributed - sealed by substitute Andy King's late tap-in, following Cheikhou Kouyate's equaliser around the half-hour - gave Barclays Premier League basement boys Leicester a much-needed boost in their bid for survival. It was their first win in nine league matches and cut the gap between them and safety to four points with eight games left to play. Cambiasso, who has won the Spanish and Italian league titles as well as the Champions League, had said in the build-up to the fixture that helping the club beat the drop would be like claiming another trophy. And Pearson added: 'Success is relative and success in the past for him, with the clubs he has played for, was winning titles and cups, and success for him at Leicester this year will be to be a player who has been instrumental in us avoiding relegation. 'Hopefully he will be a success at that as well. 'I was really pleased with his contribution against West Ham and the other players have a very healthy respect for him.' Pearson congratulates goalscorer Cambiasso after the final whistle of his side's win against the Hammers . Cambiasso, Jamie Vardy (left) and David Nugent (right) look relieved after their narrow home win . Mid-table West Ham, now with only one win in nine league games, almost found themselves 2-0 down early on on Saturday, with goalkeeper Adrian coming to their rescue by saving David Nugent's 15th-minute penalty. But they went on to show plenty of attacking intent from there and nearly took the lead themselves in the second half when Kouyate hit the post. Hammers boss Sam Allardyce was pleased to see his side play in a dynamic style but stressed that, ultimately, a lack of clinical finishing meant they had failed to do their job properly. 'We had enough opportunities, so did they (Leicester) and it was a really open game, really end-to-end stuff,' Allardyce said. 'From an entertainment point of view, for a neutral it was fantastic. 'From our point of view, it is great to play open, attractive football and create chances, but the bottom line is we haven't got anything out of it - and we are here as professionals to come away with what should at least have been a draw.'","Esteban Cambiasso helped his side claim a vital victory against West Ham .

"Haris Vuckic stands as the one bonus from a now infamous deal. While the other members of the Newcastle Five have managed a paltry 44 minutes of football between them, the Slovenian has positively thrived at Rangers. So much so, in fact, that he admits any possibility of staying at Ibrox beyond the end of this season would be an immensely attractive option. Whether or not that can happen will depend on a number of factors. Vuckic has denied a report on Tyneside stating he had already declared his intention to quit St James Park, where he has one year left on his contract. Summer discussions with his parent club will have to take place. Haris Vuckic has thrived at Rangers under new manager Stuart McCall . By then, he will also know whether Rangers have fulfilled their aim of promotion via the play-offs. Certainly, he has done much so far to try to make Premier League football a reality at Ibrox once again. Vuckic has scored six times since signing for Rangers, including three in his last two appearances as the revival under Stuart McCall has gathered momentum. The 22-year-old is clearly relishing the exposure he has been granted. Having begun to stagnate on the fringes of the Newcastle squad, he feels revived by life in Glasgow. ‘I’m really enjoying playing my football and I’m training hard,’ said Vuckic. ‘At Newcastle, I didn’t have that chance. ‘But it’s nonsense that I have said I am going to quit Newcastle. I never said that. I still respect Newcastle because I have a year left there. And I also respect Rangers because I have a loan deal here. ‘We will see what is going to happen in the transfer window and what Newcastle have to say. I will get options and I have to take the option that is best for me.’ And if Rangers were to make an offer for his services come the end of the season? Vuckic has won over Rangers fans with six goals from 10 games, including this strike against Hearts . ‘That would be a good option because I’m really enjoying my football here,’ replied Vuckic. ‘I’m scoring goals, playing well and the fans like me. It would be a great option for me. ‘This is the happiest I have been for a while with my football because I am playing every week. As a player, that is all you want. To show people that you are good.’ Clearly, there is little appeal in returning to Tyneside simply to spend another 12 months stuck in the reserves or filling space on the bench. ‘That wouldn’t be the best option for me,’ he admitted. ‘Playing first-team football is very different from the Under-21s, where you basically play with the kids. You want to play at a bigger, stronger level. ‘In football you have to take a step back to go forward. I feel from Newcastle to Rangers on loan I took that step back but now I want to go forward. ‘If I go back to play Under-21 games with Newcastle I would go even more back. I just have to see what happens in the summer but I want to play first-team football. ‘When I was 18 or 19 years old I was getting a chance in the first team at Newcastle but I broke my hand on my debut against Fulham. ‘I had a couple of set-backs and after spending a couple of months out you have to fight again for your place. I feel I could have done more in Newcastle if I hadn’t had the injuries.’ The 22-year-old celebrates scoring a goal for Newcastle, but could find himself leaving St James' Park . Vuckic was deemed sufficiently surplus to requirements to be shipped out in a mass deal arranged when the previous board were still in place. Current interim chairman Paul Murray cited the signing of the quintet without undergoing medicals as an example of the ‘recklessness’ that preceded regime change. Gael Bigirimana will not play this season because of an unspecified ‘medical condition’ he admits was there before he joined Rangers. McCall is also sceptical about Shane Ferguson’s ability to feature, although he will finally arrive at Murray Park next week as recovers from a long-term knee injury. Kevin Mbabu has been training but has yet to make a first-team debut, while Remie Streete didn’t quite make it to half-time against Raith Rovers in February before succumbing to a hamstring injury. It was recently revealed that Rangers will have to pay Newcastle £500,000 for the privilege of the loans if they gain promotion. ‘They are all fighting for their place,’ said Vuckic of his colleagues. ‘Kevin is training, Remi is injured and we all know the problem Biggi has got. ‘I spoke to Fergie and he is coming soon, but he will have to prove himself. The plan is for him to feature before the end of the season. ‘I didn’t feel any pressure personally when I came here. I just wanted to do my maximum for the club and to gain experience. ‘Since the manager came in, I have really enjoyed it. He knows what he is talking about. We all follow his gameplan and we are winning. He came here with a target to put us in the Scottish Premiership. ‘When I first came the changing room was a little bit down because of what was going on here. ‘Now when you start winning games the players are more motivated, enthusiastic and everybody fighting. The quality of the training goes up straight away and you can develop even more.’","Haris Vuckic has spent second half of season on loan at Rangers .

"With a ball at his feet and a goal in sight Harry Kane has rarely failed to give Tottenham fans what they want this season. But when it came to a crossbar challenge against some of Spurs finest he was left in the unfamiliar position. At the conclusion of an open training session for fans at White Hart Lane on Thursday morning Kane lined up against Etienne Capoue, Nabil Bentaleb, Eric Dier, Roberto Soldado, Danny Rose and the apparent king of the crossbar, Christian Eriksen. Harry Kane awaits his chance to impress in a crossbar challenge during open training at White Hart Lane . The adage 'Close but no cigar' best represents the opening round of attempts from 40 yards. Capoue, Bentaleb, Soldado, Dier, Kane and Eriksen, ignoring attempts from his team-mates to distact him, all went narrowly over the top, while Rose dared to be different by hitting the back of the net. Capoue did the same again but Algerian Bentaleb gave the crowd of mostly children enjoying their half term break something to cheer about as his floating shot landed on the crossbar. Christian Eriksen takes his attempt in spite of his team-mates efforts to distract the skillful Swede . Kane take his time with each of his three shots from 40 yards but is narrowly over the crossbar each time . It was the same story as round one for the rest before a third go was approved by the fans - Capoue took his chance as his shot dipped at the end. Kane's third go was no good but a fourth out of shot hit the mark and won a big cheer, though couldn't count. The game ended a sucessful day for the club whose form has been mixed of late with a disappointing 0-0 draw with Burnley on Sunday a major disappointment. Etienne Capoue is  on the money with his third attempt at the crossbar challenge and celebrates accordingly . Spurs' UEFA Cup-winning captain Graham Roberts was on hand to provide inspiration though, as were Spurs Ladies represetnatives Wendy Martin and captain Jenna Schillaci, who were interviewed ahead of their Ryman Cup final against Charlton on April 16. Mauricio Pochettino's side are now preparing to host Aston Villa on Saturday at home as they look to launch an ambitious, if unlikely, bid for a Champions League place, with away fixtures at Newcastle and Southampton to follow.

"Peter Lawwell recently admitted to telling Ronny Deila that it was a matter of getting over the ‘Le Guen hump’ but Celtic’s chief executive might well have cited a couple of names that had met their grim fates closer to home. One thing is for sure: Deila did not need to be an ardent student of the history of Scottish football to appreciate the gravitas of the situation he had become immersed in earlier this season. By late autumn, his side had twice exited Europe while Hamilton Accies had left Celtic Park triumphant. A search party was hardly required to identify his doubters. Celtic manager Ronny Deila admitted that the first six months in charge were mentally tough . Publicly, Deila plastered on the brave face and talked of looking behind the results for progress. Privately, the misgivings about his long-term suitability for the post were beginning to gnaw at him. ‘We played Dundee away (1-1) and we couldn’t play worse than we did,’ Deila recalled. ‘It was unbelievably bad. You know what the players want but you just haven’t got the message across. ‘People are insecure and that’s a hard time for the coach and the players.’ Even for a manager who had been steeped in the nuances of Scottish football, such a period would have been troubling enough. Deila, a Norwegian who had cut his teeth at tiny Stromsgodset, began to look like a man caught in entirely the wrong movie. ‘I have to admit the first six months were tough mentally because you have to really learn a lot of new things and get settled,’ he went on. ‘One thing is the language, the culture is another and then you have to know new opponents, your own team, understand what Celtic is all about and Scottish football. ‘There are so many things to take in and it’s so easy to push too hard and then you don’t get any time for reflection and you just get tired and then you can meet hard games and hard periods. You have nothing to push against.’ The Norwegian was unsure whether he was cut out to be the boss of the Bhoys . Upon his unveiling last summer, Deila was asked if he felt ready to manage a club like Celtic. He could hardly have answered in anything other than the affirmative. However, faced with a dressing room full of strangers, a league and a country he knew little about and the small matter of Champions League qualifiers hurtling towards him, he quickly appreciated the scale of the task he faced. ‘I spoke English at once,’ he recalled. ‘I’d a one-hour speech to them (the players) about how I wanted things. I think that went quite well. ‘But I didn’t know anything about Scottish football. I didn’t know anything about the players. I’d had a full season with my old club and five days later I was ready for Celtic. ‘I didn’t know more than four names in the squad so it takes time to get to know them then bang, you’re in the Champions League and playing games all over Europe, so I was in a situation I had to manage. ‘The players really wanted it. No problem at all. But my way of playing is quite difficult, it’s a lot of things. It’s not straightforward, a lot of relations and rules that we have to get into the players. ‘That takes time to get into. It’s so important to understand if you go back to the big managers they had before, Neil (Lennon) and (Gordon) Strachan and Martin (O’Neill), they also struggled in the beginning. It wasn’t only me. Peter was saying that the whole time - relax, you’re not the first, we’ve been through this before. But it’s harder for a Norwegian guy coming in, who’s unknown, as opposed to someone coming in with a big name.’ He was not alone in those difficult days, however. Realising the need to have individuals familiar with the club’s DNA standing beside him, John Collins was suggested as an assistant. Stevie Woods, the goalkeeping coach under Lennon, was retained while John Kennedy, the former youth coach, was promoted. Collectively, they acted as Deila’s support network. ‘I had unbelievably good back up from Peter, John Collins, John Kennedy and Stevie Woods as well,’ Deila explained. But results have picked up and they lead the Premiership (Kris Commons pictured scoring at St Mirren) ‘I’m a very open person, I say it as it is and I do that with them as well. My staff has been very good and helped me a lot. We’re growing more together, I’ve learned from them, they’ve learned from me and hopefully we know where we want to go. That’s fun and that gives you energy. That’s why I love to be here.’ It’s the small things that are making his life a little easier. In the 10 months he has been in Scotland, language has become less of an issue. ‘The first three weeks, trying to listen to what people were saying for five hours... when I got home, I was totally gone,’ he admitted. ‘I was so tired because I was sitting there all the time thinking “what is he really saying?”. There were so many new things. ‘Broony is one of the hardest. He is so quick. Half the time I just try to laugh at the right moments! But I am getting to understand more. A blip against St Johnstone aside, Celtic have been imperious since the turn of the year . ‘Now I feel more comfortable with the vocabulary, I feel I can express myself better. Before it was always the same words I was using. But I’m looking forward to speaking like every Scot!’ Ahead of Wednesday's game with Partick Thistle, Deila, his players and the supporters are very much now on the same page. A blip against St Johnstone aside, Celtic have been imperious since the turn of the year. From privately wondering if he’d bitten off more than he could chew by coming to Celtic, Deila is now ravenous for more success. ‘It’s fun,’ he said. ‘I want to win more trophies. I feel good. I’ve managed now to enjoy the week better in the past when everything in management was new and stressful. ‘Mentally, I’m in a very good place which is why I’m saying I’m enjoying the moments right now and looking forward to the games. ‘We have built the foundation and now the fun part is starting - to build relationships into the team and get the systems even better and quicker.’","Celtic boss Ronny Deila was unsure he was cut out for the job .

"Rio Ferdinand believes Louis van Gaal's decision to return Wayne Rooney to his favoured attacking role has led to the Manchester United's upturn in performance levels. Writing in his column in The Sun ahead of the Manchester derby on Sunday, Ferdinand, now at Queens Park Rangers, revealed his belief that Rooney playing as a striker is fundamental to United hitting fifth gear. He praised Van Gaal for moving his captain further up the field after a spell in the centre of the pitch at the start of the year but admitted the return to form and fitness of Ander Herrera, Marouane Fellaini and Michael Carrick has also been important. Rio Ferdiand (right) believes that Manchester United are at their strongest with Wayne Rooney in attack . Rooney (right) has helped inspire United to their best displays of the season by leading their attack . Ferdinand praised Van Gaal for moving Rooney further up the pitch, after playing him in midfield . 'Carrick returning has obviously helped but the biggest of the lot is playing Wayne Rooney up front,' Ferdinand wrote. 'Wayne's a goalscorer. He has United's goals record in his sights and the side functions better when he is there. 'The fact is that United need a fit Rooney up front.' United have only lost twice in the Premier League in 2015 but the majority of their eight victories since January were not executed with the conviction in display that Ferdinand regularly produced in the team under Sir Alex Ferguson. That was until they overturned Tottenham 3-0 at Old Trafford in March, following up the emphatic result with a commanding performance at Anfield, where they beat top-four rivals Liverpool 2-1. Ferdinand said that victory reminded him of the team he used to be a part of. 'It's about more than just results,' Ferdinand wrote. 'The performance against Liverpool was the Manchester United of old. Rooney (left) receives tactical instructions from Ryan Giggs (centre) in the United game against Liverpool .

"Manchester City are coming up against statistically the deadliest striker in the Premier League when they face Crystal Palace on Easter Monday. Glenn Murray has scored a goal on average every 91 minutes this season - giving him a better minutes-per-goal ratio than anyone else in the top flight. Harry Kane and Diego Costa are locked on 19 goals in the race to finish as this season's top scorer but rank fourth and fifth respectively, behind Papiss Cisse and Olivier Giroud. Glenn Murray celebrates scoring from the penalty spot against Stoke City last time out . Harry Kane has scored 19 goals for Tottenham in what has been a breakthrough season for him . Chelsea striker Diego Costa has enjoyed a prolific first season in England after signing from Atletico Madrid . Olivier Giroud has had a fine season despite missing a large chunk of it through injury . In-form Arsenal striker Giroud and Newcastle hitman Cisse have had their seasons interrupted by injury and suspension, while Murray was out on loan at Reading until January. Taking into account only players who have played more than 300 minutes of football, Chelsea have four players in the top 10, including Andre Schurrle, who left for Wolfsburg in January. Costa is expected to miss two weeks of action with a hamstring injury but the minutes-per-goal ratios of Loic Remy and Didier Drogba suggest he won't be too sorely missed - they rank eighth and ninth respectively. Intriguingly, ex-Chelsea veteran Frank Lampard has a marginally better ratio than his Manchester City team-mate Sergio Aguero and ranks sixth on the list. But Murray, who has scored four goals for Palace in 364 minutes this season, betters them all. Murray slides in to score for Crystal Palace against Arsenal at Selhurst Park back in February .

"In a sport so often dominated by egos, the idiom ‘if he was chocolate, he’d eat himself’ could be used on a weekly basis in boxing. And going by the sobriquet ‘Kid Chocolate’, you might expect Peter Quillin to have an appetite to match his ring alias. Instead, the man who will stand in the opposite corner to Limerick’s Andy Lee next weekend comes across as anything but the egotist. Peter Quillin (left) may be nicknamed 'Kid Chocolate' but he shows none of the expected arrogance . At times, the 31-year-old’s verbal patter buzzes with a modesty and philosophical slant which often betrays the expectations of a hard-hitting middleweight, carrying a 71 per-cent knockout rate in his undefeated record. Only once during the course of an exclusive interview with Sporstmail does Quillin speak with a hint of bite to match the aggression that saw him put Hassan N’Dam N’Jikam on the canvas six times en route to his 2012 world-title win. This comes when he is questioned about the criticism he received after opting to vacate his WBO world championship last year. While Lee is the defending champion next weekend, Quillin, the challenger, is also the former title holder having never lost the belt in the ring. The 31-year-old had been due to defend against undefeated Russian Matt Korobov but turned down a career-best $1.4million pay day when deciding not to fight the mandatory challenger. Lee later stepped in to defeat the Russian (for a much lower purse), leaving Quillin to face accusations of ‘ducking’ his obligations as champion. Only recently did Quillin reveal that he took a sabbatical to deal with the conflicting emotions of welcoming his first child into the world, while seeing his uncle unsuccessfully battle cancer. ‘I learned a lot of patience through that, so I couldn’t care less what people’ s opinions are or what they’re about. Nobody gets paid to care!,’ blasted Quillin about the flak he faced for giving up his belt. ‘It’s about being challenged, you’ll be challenged for all different decisions that you make – [decisions] that I made in my life and I think that applies to anybody else. The American has a 71 per cent knockout ratio, but he is keeping his feet on the ground ahead of the fight . ‘I just worry about myself, keep good thoughts and a positive mind and keep a great mindset for myself and that I’m just focused.’ Quillin’s first son, Joaquin, was born last August, at the same time his close uncle, Eric Munson, battled pancreatic cancer, losing his fight just two months ago. He has been out of the ring for 12 months since his last title defence. Has he been able to shake the ring rust and the emotional baggage? ‘Everything is a challenge in life. I was always in the gym, but I was dealing with mental stuff and I’m glad I overcame those things. ‘Now I’m back to where I need to be at,’ answered Quillin. ‘Testament to that is when I step into the ring with Andy Lee on April 11. I challenge myself to overcome these things. ‘My uncle’s in his casket and gone now so I got a closing period, a one on one with my uncle before he passed. ‘I left him in Grand Rapids (Michigan) on February 2 and he passed three days after. It was like a rough thing, but I had my closing period where I accepted that the fate of God is going to be what it is and I didn’t have no control over that. I just learned some powerful things – that I need to accomplish as much as I can while I’m living so that I don’t have regrets when it’s my time. ‘Now I’m just looking forward and Andy Lee is who’s in front of me right now.’ Moving on seems to be a regular feature of Quillin’s life. Next week’s fight with Lee will take place in the challenger’s adopted home town, but to call Quillin one of ‘Brooklyn’s Own’ is to ignore his path. Born in Chicago, but raised in Grand Rapids, only his ‘Kid Chocolate’ nickname hints at his pedigree. Quillin, who will fight Andy Lee next week, says it will be a big test against the Irish fighter . He was christened with the alias owing to his physical resemblance to the legendary Cuban featherweight champion of the same ring name, but Quillin also has a blood connection to the Caribbean island as his father was born there before defecting to the US. ‘I went there in 2009 and spent two-and-a-half weeks there and it was one of the best times. I got to learn about life and experience, something different other than what I’m used to,’ says Quillin on his pilgrimage to Cuba. ‘Living in the United States all your life, you go out to another country and you assume you know everything until you see other people living a certain way. ‘I had to recheck myself and say I’m not somebody that knows everything … I found out that it’s not really about the money, it’s about your family. ‘My father left Cuba and met my mom in Chicago – my mom’s an African black lady. My mom spoke nothing but English and my dad spoke nothing but Spanish, but my dad learned English from my mom and my mom learned Spanish from my father. ‘My father knew the original Kid Chocolate in Cuba, but he’s no relation. It’s part of my destiny that I was named Kid Chocolate by other people. Quillin has been away from the ring for a while, but is now ready to recapture his title against Lee . ‘I knew I had a big responsibility when it came to taking on the name. It’s a great part of my story to inherit a name like that and fight for the legacy of a fellow Cuban.’ Undefeated in 31 fights with 22 knockouts, Quillin is doing his best to uphold that honour but critics have suggested that he has not always taken on the best opponent available. He has defeated some big names, including an old Ronald ‘Winky’ Wright, while his stoppage wins over tough contenders were impressive and his title win over N’Dam (Lee’s opponent at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games) proved his world-class ability. But Lee is arguably his most testing opponent to date. Quillin is reluctant to compare their respective levels of opposition, however. ‘Andy Lee is just going to be one of those tests for me to go out and challenge [myself]. ‘For me to criticise other people’s performances, that’s not what I came in the game for, I came in the game to be a fighter and worry about fighting. ‘I gave Andy nothing but respect for accomplishing what a lot of people didn’t get to do, which is become a champion so I look at him like a champion and a guy that has never took a loss. ‘You got to realise that Andy is who he is now and Andy today might be different from the Andy that was [around] yesterday or in the future, you never know. ‘We just prepare and train hard to make sure we’re able to learn [about] people right there in that ring and focus on that. ‘You just have to accept sometimes that people try to be great like other people and never become great, but if you’re able to take what you already have and work with those things you become great.’ His words read as a tasty recipe to become a champion.","American boxer out to take back his title from Limerick fighter .

"Atletico Madrid turned up the heat on Valencia in the battle for La Liga's third automatic Champions League berth with club top scorer Antoine Griezmann setting them on the way to a 2-0 stroll at bottom side Cordoba on Saturday. The victory for the champions at Cordoba's El Arcangel stadium in balmy Andalucia lifted Atletico above Valencia and onto 62 points from 29 matches. Valencia have 60 points in fourth and can reclaim third spot with a win at home to sixth-placed Villarreal on Sunday. France forward Griezmann struck his 15th league goal of the campaign in the fifth minute after stealing the ball, surging forward from midfield and cracking a precise low shot into the bottom corner. Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann scored his 15th goal of the season by netting opener . Saul Niguez doubled Atletico's lead in the 39th minute to ensure his side leapfrogged Valencia . Valencia are currently two points behind Atletico Madrid but do have a game in hand over their top four rivals . Midfielder Saul Niguez, returning from injury, nodded a second in the 39th before Cordoba had a couple of decent efforts in the second half but could not avoid slipping to a 10th successive defeat. One more loss at Deportivo La Coruna on Wednesday and they will equal the worst run in Spain's top flight of 11 defeats suffered by Las Palmas in 1960. 'It was not an easy game at all and the rhythm was slow because of the heat,' Saul said in an interview with Spanish television. Griezmann is congratulated by his Atletico Madrid team-mates after scoring against basement side Cordoba . 'But it was a good win for us which we needed,' added the 20-year-old, who has not played since sustaining a painful blow to the kidneys in the Champions League game at Bayer Leverkusen at the end of February. 'The team is in good shape, you can see in training that we have the same excitement and desire to win as always and that is the most important thing.' Atletico also stayed hard on the heels of second-placed Real Madrid, who have 64 points, four behind leaders Barcelona. Real, who have lost three of their last four games in all competitions, host Granada and Barca play at Celta Vigo on Sunday. Europa League champions Sevilla, the only side unbeaten at home in La Liga this season, have 58 points in fifth after they beat visiting King's Cup finalists Athletic Bilbao 2-0 at the Sanchez Pizjuan.","Atletico Madrid leapfrogged Valencia in race for third position .

"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew insists he is better than many of the Premier League's big-name managers but has no immediate plans to leave Selhurst Park for a table-topping side. Palace have won six out of 10 league games since Pardew succeeded Neil Warnock at the start of the year to all but guarantee their place in the Premier League next season. The Eagles were in the bottom three when Pardew took over and their climb up the table has succeeded in easing relegation fears and subsequently boosting the profile of a manager who has yet to take charge of a club constantly vying for honours. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew believes he has the ability to manage one of England's top sides . Pardew, pictured with Arsene Wenger, feels he could do a better job than some of his rival managers . Pardew harbours no thoughts of leaving Palace in the near future, but maintains he would acquit himself better than some of the managers currently employed by the Premier League's trophy-chasing sides. 'I look at the top teams and feel I could do that job better than I'm seeing it being done,' Pardew told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme. 'But I'm quite happy where I am and if I work in this part of the league for the rest of my career I will be extremely happy. 'I'm really happy here - I don't really want another job,' he added. 'In a way the (Palace) board have been lucky because even if I have great success here I won't be looking to jump away.' The Crystal Palace manager, pictured with Yannick Bolasie, has said he is not looking to jump ship . Manchester City will provide a stern test of Pardew's managerial ability when they visit Selhurst Park on Monday and Pardew hopes his side's teamwork can overcome the considerable technical ability of Manuel Pellegrini's star-studded line-up. 'Mr Pellegrini's options on the bench will be significantly stronger than my own to try and get a result in the game with 15 minutes to go. 'But it doesn't always work out like that, (as) Burnley proved to Man City it is about sometimes the team being stronger than the individual and on Monday night we hope that's the case for Crystal Palace.'","Alan Pardew claims he has the ability to manage the league's top sides .

"Billy Joe Saunders and Chris Eubank Jnr could rematch in under six weeks after the pair reignited their war of words at a London press conference on Thursday. The pair clashed in a memorable 12-round grudge match on November 29 with British, Commonwealth and European middleweight champions Saunders handing his rival his first career defeat. Now the duo are both set to fight at Wembley Arena on May 9 but not against each other. As it stands, Eubank will be making the first defence of his WBA interim belt while Saunders will have a warm-up 'international contest' ahead of his challenge for the WBO middleweight title mooted for July. Billy Joe Saunders and Chris Eubank Jnr were involved in a war of words during the press conference . Saunders shows his unbeaten record to Chris Eubank Jnr during a press conference . Eubank challenged Saunders to take a re-match with him on May 9 . Hall of Fame promoter Frank Warren initially played down the chances of the pair fighting in May, but later said he would work on trying to get the fight on . But this show has been scheduled in a bid to build up a rematch between them, with promoter Frank Warren suggesting an autumn rematch. However they kicked off their verbal sparring in a fiery press conference and Eubank challenged Saunders to go straight ahead and fight him on May 9. And, despite having a guaranteed world title shot lined up against the winner of next week's New York clash between Andy Lee v Peter Quillin, Saunders took the bait. Saunders said: 'You want to fight on May 9? I'll tell you what we'll do, Frank can double my purse for the world title and I will fight Chris no problem. It will be on my terms because I've got the win. I'm the champion.' Eubank and Saunders have had a long standing rivalry and Saunders won when the pair met in November . Warren, who was sat between them, was startled by the agreement and initially laughed it off. But afterwards the Hall of Fame promoter revealed he will now attempt to drive through a shock deal for an early rematch. However he does have concerns about staging the fight at Wembley Arena and may seek to make the fight at a bigger venue – possibly even a football stadium if they are able to push the date back into the closed season. Warren said: 'Listen, if I could get that on for May 9, that would be on, I can assure you but we are limited by the fact it is Wembley Arena. Saunders is due to fight at Wembley arena on May 9 on the same card as Eubank Jnr . Saunders is keen to get back in the ring with Saunders and get revenge for his professional defeat . 'But when I leave this press conference you know what I will be working on and we will see how we go with it. 'I want to see it again. It was an exciting fight and there is a genuine rivalry with them, it's not done for show. 'I think the next one will be electric.' The current plan for the 25-year-old pair to meet in the autumn is a risky one as six months is a very long time in boxing. Although unlikely, either man could lose on May 9 before Saunders will face undoubtedly the biggest challenge of his career against the winner of Lee-Quillin. Saunders got the better of Eubank over 12 rounds when the pair met back in November . Eubank and Saunders are both keen on a re-match and while May 9 is a possibility an autumn fight is more realistic . Defeat for Saunders or Eubank before the rematch could damage the credibility of the fight and Warren knows it could be in everybody's best interest to get the fight on as quickly as possible. He added: 'It is a long road to the rematch and that is why when I leave here I will be sharpening my pencil and having a look at [doing the deal]. Billy has said what he wants and now we will see where we get to.' Eubank won the WBA interim world title by out-pointing Dmitry Chudinov at the 02 Arena in February and the Brighton man has urged Saunders to forget about his current route to the WBO title and instead concentrate on dethroning him. But Saunders taunted his rival by saying the belt does not mean anything. Saunders said: 'That's not a world title. Do you call that a world title yeah? Well you're mad then. You're deluded man, you must be on drugs. 'Take your little belt home and hold your trousers up with it because that is all it's good for. You haven't got any good belts, I've got the best belts. 'Would you even bother putting that on your mantelpiece? You can show it to your grandkids when you're older and lie to them. Keep it, it's rubbish.'","Billy Joe Saunders and Chris Eubank Jnr are set to fight on the same bill at Wembley Arena on May 9 .

"Rarely can a headline in a matchday magazine have been so prophetic: on pages 16 and 17 of the United Review, next to a picture of Ander Herrera, screamed the words ‘Right place, right time’. That hasn’t always been the case during the Spaniard’s debut season at Old Trafford. Between October 20 and February 17, Herrera was barely sighted and started just three of the 21 games Manchester United played in that period, prompting much chatter about his place in the squad. It is no secret David Moyes wanted to bring Herrera to Old Trafford on deadline day in August 2013 but red tape scuppered his ambitions; United pressed ahead with transfer after Moyes was jettisoned but his inactivity prompted questions: Did Louis van Gaal want him or rate him? Ander Herrera, pictured with Juan Mata, netted a brace to ensure his side claimed the win against Aston Villa . Herrera has established himself in Louis van Gaal's first team plans after missing out in previous months . Antonio Valencia (right) congratulates two-goal hero Herrera (centre) after the final whistle . The settling in process was not easy but the 25-year-old’s head has never dropped and in the interview with the club publication, Herrera made it clear that a lack of action was never going to leave him at loggerheads with Van Gaal. ‘I am very happy, he said. ‘Even when I wasn’t playing, I was also happy. I am at Manchester United. I feel really lucky to be here. We have to respect his decision. He wants the best for us, the team and we have to follow him always.’ Herrera’s commitment was amply rewarded against Aston Villa. The brightest spark in a Red jersey, he was certainly in the right place at the right time in the 43rd minute, when sweeping a terrific effort past Brad Guzan to set United on their way. His passing was slick, his movement was clever and it was appropriate he bookended this victory with United’s third in injury time; it was fifth shot on target in the Barclays Premier League and, amazingly, his fifth goal. No wonder he left with acclaim from his manager ringing in his ears. ‘I knew Ander has a touch of class,’ said Van Gaal. ‘Sometimes he was not composed at the right moment but now he has composure. Scoring seven goals in a season when he hasn’t played so much? I think that’s fantastic.’","Ander Herrera fired Man United to victory with double against Aston Villa .

"Joey Barton has urged QPR to use their win over West Brom as a springboard for survival. Rangers won 4-1 at the 10-man Baggies on Saturday to end a losing run of five matches and clinch just their second away victory of the season.

'We took our chances and hopefully it's a springboard for us to put a run together and make it difficult for the teams in and around the relegation zone,' he told the club's official website. 'There's a great amount of spirit in the group, a lot of people have written us off and we have an awful lot of work to do but performances like that give us a hell of a chance.

Albion are eight points clear of Rangers but suffered their heaviest defeat under Tony Pulis, despite Victor Anichebe's second-half header, and also had Youssouf Mulumbu sent off. Pulis added: 'We should have dealt better with their first goal. The second goal was from a set play.

"Anthony Joshua stopped experienced American Jason Gavern in the third round on Saturday night, but still wasn't happy with his performance. Gavern, in his 50th fight, was dropped twice in the second round and twice more in the third before the contest was waved off in Newcastle. But Joshua, who was returning from a five-month lay-off after suffering a stress fracture in his back, admitted he was not at his best. Anthony Joshua lands a left hand on Jason Gavern on his way to another convincing victory . Joshua dropped Gavern twice in the second round and twice in the third on his way to victory . 'I had a bit of ring rust so couldn’t display everything I have been doing in the gym,' he said after his 11th professional victory. 'But once the momentum gets going I will be able to display some more shots, some more sharp shooting. 'I have boxed in Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, London and I have to say Newcastle is right up there with the crowd, so a big thank you to the fans tonight. 'There are a lot of expectations and Jason is a very awkward opponent. He’s a slippery customer and he is there to make me look back and he did a good job of that. 'I have a job to do and that is get a win. If I can start pushing to British titles, European titles step by step these fights won’t really mean anything when I am experienced and a champion.' Joshua jolted his opponent with a left hook in the opening round although Gavern showed all his experience in frustrating his younger foe. Joshua experienced few problems on his way to another routine victory in Newcastle . Joshua stands over the fallen Gavern as he boxed in front of the Newcastle crowd for the first time . Gavern did hit the canvas midway through the second after a short straight left although the 37-year-old complained he had taken a blow to the back of his head. He was on the canvas again after a brutal right hand followed by another left found its mark, but Gavern got up and defiantly raised his right hand. He was merely delaying the inevitable, though, and a flurry early in the third had him down once more before Joshua finished the job with yet another punishing left, as Gavern was this time unable to beat the count. Joshua will now face the toughest test of his career when he takes on Kevin Johnson next month.

"Rangers boss Stuart McCall has delivered a sharp rebuke to David Templeton after the winger criticised the training-ground methods deployed by the manager's predecessors, Ally McCoist and Kenny McDowall. Former Hearts star Templeton claimed last week that McCall had introduced a brand of coaching and tactical preparation which had been lacking under the previous management. But McCall, who is busy transforming the club on the pitch after three successive wins in the Championship, was less than impressed by the player's comments and hinted that they may have been motivated by the player's lack of game time under McCoist and McDowall. Rangers winger David Templeton spoke out about his former managers Ally McCoist and Kenny McDowall . 'David made an error,' said the ex-Rangers midfielder. 'He was out of the frame a wee bit under Kenny and Ally. 'But he knows we are not here to criticise what went on before, because the players were part of that. All we are concentrating on is the here and now.' McCall also had words of warning for skipper Lee McCulloch, claiming his red card against Hearts could cost him his place in the Ibrox line-up. The defender has been given a two-match ban - starting with Queen of the South at Palmerston on Thursday - after being sent off on Sunday. The Light Blues captain put his elbow into the face of Jambos striker Osman Sow as the pair jumped for a high ball. McCall, whose team clung on for a vital 2-1 win after playing 50 minutes a man down, had been happy with McCulloch's displays until that point. But the interim Rangers manager has now warned the former Scotland cap he is not 'undroppable'. He said: 'Lee made a poor decision. I understand why he did it but it was a blatant red card. He led with his elbow and it was wrong - but he knows he was wrong. 'He has got to take his punishment and move on now. He has got a two-game ban - whether he gets back in the team thereafter we will see. Lee McCulloch has been warned he could lose his place in the starting XI after being sent off against Hearts . 'Since I've been at the club he has done fine. He's been good in the dressing room and his performances have been good. 'If whoever comes in over the next two games does really well, then he might not get back in. 'He's not undroppable, no, but at this moment in time with the games we have played he has done nothing to merit being dropped.' Off the field, Dave King now hopes to get the SFA's blessing to take over as chairman after judges at the Court of Session approved his boardroom bid. But with 12 first-team players out of contract at the end of this season, McCall has warned his squad they may have to wait for new deals. He said: 'I don't think it will be too long before Dave becomes chairman of the club, so that is another positive move. 'I'm just concentrating on the football. I've spoken to a couple of directors about things but we have five games in 14 days so I'm just focusing on that. 'As for contracts, that can only be sorted when the club knows what league it's going to be playing in next season, so that is the key.' The weekend victory over Hearts moved Rangers back into the box seat for the promotion play-offs. Rangers boss Stuart McCall has led his team to three consecutive victories in the Scottish Championship . But that now leaves ex-Motherwell boss McCall facing the 'nightmare' scenario that he could come up against his former Fir Park troops. Motherwell's 5-0 victory over basement boys St Mirren has all but spared them from the automatic relegation spot but Ian Baraclough's team could yet be made to scrap for their Premiership place against Rangers in the play-off final. 'It's not looking likely at all because Motherwell are not going to finish in the bottom two - I hope,' said McCall. 'First and foremost we have to do our job and get in the play-offs. 'But I said when Motherwell signed Scott McDonald that I believed - and I still do - that they would have enough to get out of trouble.' Before that, though, McCall must continue to rack up the wins, starting with Thursday's trip to Dumfries. Rangers lost 2-0 on their last visit in December - just hours after it was revealed McCoist was stepping down as boss. 'I'm still aghast because I've just watched a video of the second half,' said McCall. 'I haven't showed the players because I think they know they were not in a good place at that time. 'The news about Ally broke on the afternoon of the game and it was just a down day. As much as Rangers underperformed, all credit goes to Queens. They are a good side, especially down there. We know how difficult it will be.'","David Templeton spoke out about his former managers last week .

"Dereck Chisora is being lined up for a summer comeback and British heavyweight rival David Price is firmly in his sights. 'Del Boy' has not boxed since he was stopped by switch-hitting Tyson Fury at London's ExCeL Arena in November. The fight was a final eliminator for a shot at Wladimir Klitschko's WBO title and Fury is now the mandatory challenger for that strap. Chisora, meanwhile, has been regrouping and recovering from an eye injury sustained during the 10-round beating. Dereck Chisora is being lined up for a summer comeback against British heavyweight rival David Price . 'Del Boy' has not boxed since he was stopped by switch-hitting Tyson Fury at London's ExCeL Arena . Chisora has been regrouping and recovering from an eye injury sustained during the 10-round beating . But his promoter Frank Warren has confirmed that Chisora has been back in the gym for the past month and is hoping to make his return to the ring during the summer. However he will be without his long-term trainer, friend and mentor Don Charles after the pair parted company. It was Charles who nurtured the young fighter through a short amateur career and all of his 25 pro fights to date. Warren said: 'Dereck's back in the gym and we will be announcing something for him very soon. Hopefully he will make his comeback in the summer. 'In that last fight, Tyson Fury did brilliantly and Dereck had a lot of problems with his eye and he has had to have something done to his eye. His promoter Frank Warren has confirmed that Chisora has been back in the gym for the past month . 'He has had to recuperate, it has had to heal but now that is out of the way. Now we can move on and get himself back in the game. 'He really fancies it, he wants to fight and the one thing about Dereck Chisora is that he is what he is: a fighter. He just loves it.' Warren has arranged a show at Wembley Arena on May 9 which rivals Billy Joe Saunders and Chris Eubank Jnr will both feature on. It had been suggested that Chisora may make a low-key comeback as part of the undercard but Warren dismissed the idea. Instead the promoter is plotting a route towards an all-English showdown with David Price. Like Chisora, the 2008 Olympic bronze medalist is rebuilding following back-to-back knock-out defeats to Tony Thompson in 2013. Price teamed up with Sauerland Promotions and boxed three times last year and once in February, winning all four, and Warren thinks he would be a good match for Chisora.

He added: 'Well we want the David Price fight. That would be a big one, I think it is a great fight and it is one we will explore once we get Dereck firing again. 'Everybody loves a domestic clash and between two big guys it would be something special.' Olympic golden boy Anthony Joshua has also been linked with Chisora, who, like him, came through the Finchley Amateur Boxing Club. After winning his first 10 fights by knock-out, all inside three rounds, Joshua has emerged as one of the biggest prospects in world boxing.

'We also have to see what they're going to do with Anthony Joshua but that's another big domestic fight between two guys from the same area.

"Dave King has moved closer to becoming Rangers chairman after the Court of Session cleared him to return as a director of the club. And the South African-based businessman hopes yesterday’s decision will now convince the SFA to pass him as ‘fit and proper’ in the final stage of approval. King won around 85-per-cent shareholder backing to return to the Rangers boardroom at the club’s pivotal extraordinary general meeting last month, but has been holding off from taking up a post until he has cleared all regulatory barriers. Dave king is back on the Rangers board after being cleared by the Court of Session . Rangers players applaud as they leave the pitch following their 2-1 defeat of Hearts at the weekend . He required the consent of the court due to previously being a director in the Ibrox oldco which entered liquidation in 2012. ‘I am delighted that at a Court of Session hearing this morning before Lord Woolman my application to become a director of Rangers International Football Club PLC was granted,’ said King in a statement. ‘Today’s decision has removed the final legal hurdle for me to take up my role on the board following the overwhelming mandate at the EGM. ‘The previous board had raised a little known legal provision stating that because I was a director of Rangers oldco within 12 months of its liquidation that I must obtain court sanction before becoming a director of RIFC because the word “Rangers” is in both company names. ‘A court would not grant leave to an applicant unless it is satisfied that the circumstances warrant such approval. King (centre) celebrates success at the club's EGM alongside John Gilligan (left) and Paul Murray (right) ‘Any affected party, eg the liquidator or an aggrieved creditor of the previous company, has the right to be heard at such a hearing. ‘The liquidation of Rangers oldco and the formation of Rangers Newco were not conducted clandestinely but in the full glare of publicity. ‘However, being aware of the provision, I sought leave of the Court to accept my board appointment. ‘Hopefully, this endorsement will also provide the SFA with additional comfort to complete its consideration of my fit and proper status. ‘All Rangers supporters have suffered from the failure of full and proper corporate governance over the last four years. ‘I am anxious to play my part in ensuring that this is comprehensively remedied for present and future generations of Rangers supporters. ‘I have fully cooperated with the SFA over the last few weeks and thank them for the care and attention with which they have undertaken this task. ‘I must be the most scrutinised candidate in Scottish football history but accept this as being preferable to the lack of scrutiny that has been the case in Rangers recent past — and possibly other clubs. ‘I hope matters can be swiftly concluded now that, with the permission of the court, I can take up my role as a director of RIFC.’","Businessman has been cleared by Court of Session to become director .

"Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has warned his players that Champions League qualification is still not assured despite holding an eight-point gap over Liverpool after Saturday's results. Following a comprehensive 3-1 victory against Aston Villa, Van Gaal sees next Sunday's derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford as important in the battle to finish runners-up. But having been given the task of qualifying for the top-four when he replaced David Moyes last summer, he is not letting complacency risk success, though Liverpool's 4-1 defeat against Arsenal on Satuday lunchtime puts United firmly in pole position. Ander Herrera celebrates with team-mates after scoring his team's third goal at Old Trafford . 'It is not done yet,' he said. 'We still have to play everyone else in the top four and the table shows they are the best teams. 'Of course we have a big gap and can afford to suffer a defeat but everything is possible.'

"Former Italy forward Antonio Di Natale has described Alexis Sanchez as the best strike partner he's ever had and insisted the Arsenal forward is better than Neymar.

"Roma have been ordered to close part of their stadium for their next home game after supporters were sanctioned for showing an offensive banner over the weekend.

"Hibs boss Alan Stubbs is among the front-runners for the manager's job at Wigan Athletic after Malky Mackay was sensationally sacked on Monday. Stubbs is currently embroiled in a tough promotion battle with the Easter Road side, but is believed to be among Wigan's top targets as they battle to avoid relegation from the Championship — they are currently second bottom. Stubbs' No2, John Doolan, formed part of Uwe Rosler's backroom staff at the DW Stadium before the German was sacked in November. Hibs boss Alan Stubbs has emerged as a candidate to succeed Malky Mackay after he was sacked by Wigan . Malky Mackay was sensationally sacked by Wigan Athletic following a dismal run of results since November . Doolan joined Stubbs in Edinburgh in July last year and both men — who also worked together at Everton's youth academy — are highly regarded by new Wigan chairman David Sharpe. Former Celtic defender Stubbs who is on a two-year contract in Leith, has steered Hibs into the play-off positions in Scotland's second tier, albeit they have stumbled of late after three successive defeats. However, he would face an altogether different challenge with Wigan. They are eight points from safety after the 2-0 home defeat by Derby spelled the end for Mackay, and must win their next two games against Fulham and Millwall to stand any chance of survival. Former Scotland defender Gary Caldwell is expected to be handed the job on a temporary basis, while ex-Wigan player Danny Wilson is also under consideration. Former Wigan defender Gary Caldwell looks set to be handed the manager's role on a temporary basis . Meanwhile, Mackay's bid to rescue his managerial career was left in tatters after his dismissal. The 43-year-old was told of the decision during a brief meeting with Sharpe after losing to Derby. Mackay was handed the job by former owner Dave Whelan back in November against a backdrop of an FA investigation into a shocking series of text messages, exposed by Sportsmail. Cardiff City manager at the time, Mackay is accused of sending racist, sexist and homophobic messages in an exchange with former head of recruitment Iain Moody. The Scot remains under investigation by the FA and Monday's developments will not alter the speed with which his case is dealt. Sharpe, just a month into his new role as chairman, looked forlorn after Monday's game and made a snap decision to axe the Scot. Mackay won only five of his 25 fixtures in charge and picked up just three home points — damning statistics referenced in the club's official statement. Sharpe said: 'This is a very difficult decision to make but I feel that, for the long-term future of the club, there must be a change now.' Sportsmail understands Mackay was close to suffering the sack in February but victory at Reading granted him a stay of execution. Wigan were content with keeping him until at least the end of the season and kept faith with the divisive figure. Sources at the DW Stadium also indicated that Mackay was ready to build a similar recruitment structure to that at Cardiff and had been sanctioned to do so. He remained defiant they could stay in the division immediately after losing against Derby. 'It's still mathematically possible,' he said. 'It's fine lines between winning and losing in this league.'

Massimiliano Allegri's side came into the game knowing they had to go on the attack if they were to progress to the Coppa Italia final  after falling to a shock 2-1 defeat at the Juventus Stadium. And the visitors did just that as Matri opened the scoring in the 21st minute by poking home from close range after he benefitted from a ricochet. Juventus doubled the scoring shortly before the interval when Pereyra placed the ball into an empty net after Fiorentina goalkeeper Neto parried into his path following a thunderous shot by Alvaro Morata. The Italian league leaders did not hold back during the second half and managed to kill the encounter shortly before the hour mark when unlikely goalscorer Bonucci latched onto a Claudio Marchisio corner before striking a beautifully-timed volley into the net. Marchisio's booking and Morata's bizarre red card were the only negatives of the night. Inexperienced referee Davide Massa brandished a red card in the direction of Morata after a clumsy challenge, which warranted nothing more than a yellow, on Alessandro Diamanti with just two minutes left to play. Marchisio will definitely miss the final against either Napoli and Lazio due to an accumulation of bookings, while Morata should be confident of winning an appeal. Juventus, who currently lie 14 points clear at the top of the Serie A table,  can now focus on their upcoming Champions League quarter-final clash against Monaco.

"Ronny Deila lauded his players for stretching their lead at the top of the Premiership with victory at St Mirren – then hit out at the state of pitches in Scotland. A James Forrest strike and Stefan Johansen’s penalty were enough to see off a spirited challenge by the bottom side as Celtic moved eight points clear of Aberdeen. But although pleased with the way his side stayed patient to win, Deila felt their cause wasn’t helped by the state of the Paisley surface. And he believes Scottish football will struggle to develop top players if there isn’t a drastic improvement in our pitches. Celtic manager Ronny Deila was impressed with his side's performance against St Mirren on Friday night . ‘It was a tough game, St Mirren were well organised and played very deep,’ he said. ‘They fought really hard and it was difficult to break them down. We had to be patient. The pitch was better than some others we’ve played on. But the pitches in Scotland are terrible. ‘If you want to develop players and get passing football, it’s difficult when the ball is bouncing all the time. It’s much easier for the other teams to just sit behind the ball and try to break down our play. ‘It’s better to play on an artificial surface than this. If they are watering artificial pitches and they are of the best quality, it’s totally different and much closer to European standards. James Forrest slides on his knees to celebrate scoring Celtic's opening goal against St Mirren . ‘If we are going to develop good young players, you need a good surface to play and train on. If not, you get fighters. If you want skills and technique, play on better surfaces. ‘They are much better in Norway. Sixty per cent are artificial and the grass pitches are better as well because they don’t train there and there aren’t other teams playing on them. And we play in the summer. That’s the biggest thing. The pitch here might not look so bad but try to play on it.’ TV pictures showed Leigh Griffiths eating a chocolate biscuit while sitting on the bench. But Deila, a strong advocate of fitness and conditioning, laughed it off. ‘I think it was a carbo biscuit which is totally different! I’ll have to check his weight tomorrow.’ Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen slots home from the penalty spot to secure his side's 2-0 victory . Goalscorer Johansen believes there’s no stopping Celtic as they close in on a treble. ‘It looks great for us now,’ he said. ‘I don’t think we’re unbeatable but there is a huge confidence in the team. ‘We are starting to look fitter and have much more of the ball because we’re playing with a higher tempo. That’s the way the manager wants us to play. I said in the beginning when people were asking questions I was confident he would be a great and it’s starting to look that way.’ Saints boss Gary Teale felt there were positives in defeat but wasn’t happy about the handball awarded against Viktor Genev for Celtic’s penalty. ‘Was it ball to hand or hand to ball? If they’re going to give penalties for things like that they need to give all of them in every single game.’ Deila berated the state of pitches in Scotland and claimed it would be better to play on artificial surfaces .","Celtic beat St Mirren 2-0 to move eight points clear at the top of the league .

"Celtic's title prospects 'look great' following their 2-0 win over bottom side St Mirren in Paisley on Friday night, according to Stefan Johansen. The Norway midfielder clinched the points with a 79th minute penalty after wide-man James Forrest had finished off a well-worked Hoops move from close range to open the scoring. It took the Parkhead men eight points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the Scottish Premiership with both clubs having played 29 games albeit the Dons can reduce the deficit against Partick Thistle on Saturday. Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen believes his side's title aspirations 'look great' after their 2-0 win at St Mirren . Ronny Deila's side have only lost one league game this year and take four successive victories into the home match against Partick Thistle on Wednesday night which encouraged Johansen, 24, to say: 'It looks great for us now. It's nine games left in the league and it's going to be difficult to take us now. 'This was another important win and we just need to keep focusing now on every game over the next couple of weeks. 'I don't think we're unbeatable but you can say there is a huge confidence in the team now. 'I think we are starting to look fitter and we have much more of the ball because we are playing with a higher tempo and that's the way the manager wants us to play.' Johansen scored Celtic's second goal at St Mirren from the penalty spot on 79 minutes . Deila criticised the 'terrible' pitches in Scottish football after the game, claiming the surface at St Mirren was another that was difficult to master. The visitors were certainly not at their best but Johansen was glad the international break had not upset the Hoops' rhythm too much. The former Stromsgodset player said: 'Some of the guys have had a few days off and some of the guys were away with the international teams so it was good to be back together and be prepared for the rest of the season. 'St Mirren frustrated us for a while. They played well, especially in the first half and credit to them for that. The victory for Celtic manager Ronny Deila's side now means they have won four successive league matches . 'But we know that we had the ball so much that they would need to run. It was going to be difficult for them over 90 minutes so we knew it would open up.' Gary Teale is hoping his St Mirren side, who ended the game still four points behind Motherwell, are not cut adrift before the split, which comes after they play the Steelmen on Tuesday night and third-bottom Ross County the following Monday. He said: 'We need to make sure we're within three points of Ross County or Motherwell after the next two games. 'If we can do that then that will give us a fighting chance.'","Celtic won 2-0 away  St Mirren on Good Friday in the Scottish Premiership .

"Gary Player will attend his 58th Masters this week fully expecting to welcome a new member to the game’s most exclusive club and salute what he considers would be one of the sport’s finest accomplishments. The great man considers Tiger Woods completing the career Grand Slam at the age of just 24 as the best golfing feat he has seen. So you can imagine how excited he is at the prospect of Rory McIlroy becoming just the sixth player to win all four majors at only 25. ‘I’m not sure people fully realise what a magnificent effort it would be,’ said the South African legend. ‘When I completed my Slam at 29 I said to my wife that you will never see that done again. Then Jack Nicklaus came along and did it at 26 and then Tiger at 24. Jack Nicklaus watches his shot go for a birdie on the 17th at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta in 1986 . Rory McIlroy meets up with South African Golf Legend Gary Player during the pro-am in 2009 . Rory McIlroy, pictured in action at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and is favourite to win the Masters . ‘Now we have Rory, and I tell you this: I honestly believe he is going to do it. I just believe everything is going to fall into place for him, that he will learn from the mistakes he made when he messed up in 2011 and put everything right.’ It is not hard to see why Player would have such a special affinity for McIlroy. Two men of similar stature who came from a foreign land to take on the Americans in the majors in their own backyard; two men with a commitment to fitness with minds strong enough to ward off all the criticism. Forget Tiger. It was Player, of course, who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness. Heavens, he is still doing 1,300 sit-ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now, at the age of 79. He is withering in his contempt of those who say McIlroy is ‘bulking up’ too much in the gym. ‘I’m going to guess most of the critics are fat and don’t watch what they eat,’ he says. ‘Just because they’re lazy, they can’t grasp that fitness is so vital. Tom Watson presents Player with a Green Jacket after the 1978 Masters Tournament at Augusta National . ‘I was told that because I was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and I wouldn’t win any tournaments after the age of 34. I was told I had no chance of winning the US Open if I was squatting 325lb the previous evening. What rubbish. ‘I’m just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier. I used to go down to the local YMCA wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment. But it you want to be a superstar, and by a superstar I mean a player who has won at least six majors, there are no short cuts. Woods could pose a threat to McIlroy at the Masters after confirming that he will play at Augusta . ‘Rory will be an absolute superstar when he wins the Masters. And yes, I can see a lot of similarities with myself. I love the fact he is a people person, for example, and engages with the fans. That’s what I used to love, and still do. So many pros can’t be bothered to talk to the fans and it’s so wrong.’ Player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career Grand Slam is a modern media invention. ‘I tell you it was electrifying when I completed it in 1965,’ he said. ‘I so wanted to follow Gene Sarazen and particularly Ben Hogan and become the third player to achieve it, because Hogan was the best player I’d seen. Jack and I were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice Jack gave me that helped me over the line. ‘I was due to play a tournament at Greensboro in 1965 when Jack said if I wanted to win the US Open and complete the set I should go with him to the US Open site and practise. I said I needed the money, that I had loads of children to look after, but I went with him. So he played a key role. McIlroy manages a smile after throwing away a four-shot lead on the final day of the Masters in 2011 . Jack Nicklaus  waves before hitting his drive at the ceremonial start of the 2014 Masters golf tournament . ‘It was amazing afterwards. Everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing. How on earth could it happen?’ Player and Nicklaus have remained lifelong friends. They will be partners in a team competition in the autumn before Player heads to Greece for his 80th birthday celebrations. ‘There will be 35 people there and Jack and I will need to win that event for me to be able to pay for it,’ said Player, laughing. As for Augusta, he is looking forward as ever to hitting the ceremonial first shot on Thursday alongside Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. And then, 50 years on from his own date with history, he will join every other fascinated observer to see if another non-American can complete the set of majors and join him on what former US Open champion Curtis Strange evocatively refers to as golf’s Mount Rushmore.","Gary Player considers Tiger Woods Grand Slam at 24 as best golfing feat .

"Gene Sarazen did it with the shot heard round the world. Ben Hogan did it with his one and only appearance at the Open Championship. Tiger Woods achieved it at the Home of Golf. When it comes to the career Grand Slam the stars align it seems, and it is completed with wondrous deeds on fitting stages. And now Rory McIlroy has the chance to join the exalted company of just five men at Augusta National, of all places. As Woods put it: 'Where better could you ask for than to complete it here?' Rory McIlroy tees off on the first during his practice round ahead of the 2015 Masters on Thursday . McIlroy is targeting his third major title and the completion of his career Grand Slam at Augusta . McIlroy (left) chats with Tiger Woods, who is ranked 111th in the world at present, at the course on Wednesday . And so, 155 years after the first major championship, another season opens with a potentially epochal event. A campaign that will take us to uncharted territory near Seattle for the United States Open and St Andrews for The Open; to the whispering wilds of Wisconsin for the PGA. But it is here, where more majors have been held than any other venue, where we begin with the most exciting storylines of all. This 79th Masters was set up beautifully as it was, with McIlroy's bid to win a third straight major, but Tiger's return has elevated it to another plane. Love him or not, there's no denying the frisson of added excitement he brings. Noticeably thinner and brimming with health, how good to see him walking around with a smile on his face as well and signing autographs, clearly thrilled to be showing his kids the place where he has left an indelible mark. Is this Scrooge-like conversion a sign he doesn't think he can win any more, or is he just a man whose heart has grown fonder through absence? Whatever the answer, it will make for compelling viewing over the next few days as the man who won 11 of his 14 majors ranked No 1 in the world tries to win one ranked 111th. And here's a nice little omen to send him on his way: Darren Clarke was ranked 111th when he won The Open Championship at Royal St George's in 2011. World No 1 McIlroy signs autographs for a host of young fans following his practice round on Wednesday . In the press room on Tuesday it was as if Rory and Tiger had switched personalities, with the former the subdued, somewhat reluctant one. To be fair to McIlroy, he's been answering the same questions for eight long months. He's talked out about the Grand Slam. Now he gets the chance to enter the blessed sanctuary that inside the ropes provides and finally seize his opportunity to set a new benchmark for European golf rather than talk about it. For two of his four major championship victories, McIlroy got a huge helping hand from Mother Nature, as great dollops of rain rendered Congressional for the 2011 US Open and Valhalla for last year's USPGA soft and defenceless — the sort of dart-throwing contest which is right up McIlroy's alley. This Masters might get interrupted as well by an afternoon thunderstorm or two but it is also expected to get under way on Thursday with near record temperatures for this time of year. Add that to Augusta National's sub-air system under the greens and there will be no darts thrown here. As it should be. If you're going to join legends, you should be doing it the hard way. A flock of fans capture a Woods shot on their smartphones as the American star went through his paces . McIlroy might be the bookies' favourite for good reason but his Augusta record offers up a litany of damning statistics he must rectify before he can be considered for a green jacket. Can you believe that as good a driver as the Northern Irishman is, he has hit the par five 13th fairway just four times in 22 attempts in competition? Or that he has had no birdies in 44 tries on the holes that start the front and back nines. This week we will truly get the chance to gauge his development as a golfer. Alongside him for the first two days will be Phil Mickelson, another player who had all the attributes to win Augusta at 25 but had to wait until the age of 33 to win his first Masters. It might be that McIlroy has to wait a while longer, too. There are not only questions about his own record at Augusta that the world No 1 must answer. There's the formidable form of his peers. The next six players in the rankings — Henrik Stenson, Bubba Watson, Jordan Spieth, Jason Day, Adam Scott and Dustin Johnson — have all either won a tournament in the past two months or have a green jacket already. It is inconceivable at least one won't hit form. Phil Mickelson will play alongside McIlroy for the first two days of the tournament in Augusta . The list of potential winners stretches longer. Indeed, there's not a great golf-playing territory in the world that won't be watching with legitimate hopes of seeing one of its own triumph. Nowhere will that anticipation be greater than here. A win for McIlroy and papers will be filled with where it ranks in the annals of the great feats achieved by UK sportsmen. There's no point discussing what might be the ending when the drama has not even begun. But it's perfectly acceptable to keep fingers crossed and dare to wonder whether, over the next four days, we're going to be witnesses to a singular piece of UK sporting history.","The 79th Masters kicks off in Augusta on Thursday .

"They will come up against each other in the year's first major on Thursday, but it wasn't that long ago that Rory McIlroy was looking up to Tiger Woods. The world No 1 - now 103 places above Woods in the world rankings - is the favourite to win the Masters next week and claim his first green jacket, thus completing a career Grand Slam. Woods, who has confirmed he is ready to play at Augusta after spell working on his game, is one of only five players to win the Masters, The Open, the US PGA Championship and the US Open - and it's that success which led to a young McIlroy aiming to emulate him. Scroll down for video . A young Rory McIlroy is portrayed by an actor in the film as it charts his progress in the sport . McIlroy played golf from a young age and always admired Woods as he grew up in Northern Ireland . McIlroy grew up watching Woods and is now on his way to emulating his hero . McIlroy revealed recently that he sent Tiger a letter saying he was 'coming to get' him . Rory's rise from child prodigy to the world's best - along with his fascination with Woods' stellar career - has now been beautifully told in a new two-minute video created by their sponsors Nike. Entitled 'Ripple', the clip features a number of young actors portraying McIlroy as a kid and into his teenage years - from hitting plastic balls around his parents' living room, to practising relentlessly in his hometown of Holywood, Northern Ireland. A common theme runs through the video as McIlroy and his father keep a close eye on Tiger's progress on both the PGA Tour and at the major championships. Speaking about 'Ripple', McIlroy said: 'As a kid, I looked up to Tiger. When I first saw him on TV, I remember being completely enamored by the energy he brought to the sport. His will to win. His determination. His fight.' McIlroy and Woods will line up at Augusta for the Masters this week but in contrasting form . Woods with McIlroy at the tee of the 12th hole final round of the Memorial Tournament in 2013 . 'I've been in that same situation,' said Woods. 'Growing up, Jack (Nicklaus) was my idol.

Fourteen years later at the 2000 PGA Championship, I got to play with and against him – someone I looked up to.' It remains to be seen whether Woods will be at the business end of the Masters come Sunday but McIlroy relishes playing with his idol. 'It's been an incredible journey for me, going from massive fan to competitor,' he added. 'To think that not too long ago I was that little boy watching him on TV to where I am now. 'It's been a cool journey and I'm very lucky I get to compete with and against him, because he inspired me as a kid and he inspires me now.

"Barcelona coach Luis Enrique is not concerned by Neymar's recent goal drought and is confident the Brazil forward will soon return to top form as the Catalans continue their bid to repeat 2009's historic treble. After an impressive first half of the season, Neymar has gone off the boil since the turn of the year and has not scored for the leaders in La Liga since hitting the opener in a 5-0 win at home to Levante on February 15. The 23-year-old looked particularly out of sorts in Sunday's 1-0 win at Celta Vigo and spent much of the game locked in an unseemly battle with Celta fullback Hugo Mallo.

'We are talking about an outstanding player, a top player,' added the former Barcelona and Spain midfielder, who is enjoying a successful first term in charge at the Nou Camp. 'And from what I see in training I am sure his scoring streak will soon return and he will be back on top form. 'Now he is helping us in a less spectacular way, less visible for you, but he gives the team a lot of things that I consider important.' Barcelona manager Enrique insists he is not concerned by Neymar's recent drought in front of goal . Neymar looked out of sorts in the 1-0 win over Celta Vigo and has not scored for Barcelona since February 15 . Barca can stretch their lead over second-placed Real Madrid to seven points with a win against Almeria, applying more pressure on Real whose game at Madrid neighbours Rayo Vallecano kicks off two hours later.

"A week in the Bahamas, lapping up the sun and the odd glass of champagne, gazing across the yachts bobbing in the marina. It sounds idyllic, but perhaps is not the way you might imagine Ian Poulter prepares to win the Masters. But Poulter promises this break, just weeks before the first major of the year, means he will be fit and fresh for his latest assault on Augusta National. The downtime ensured plenty of opportunity to dream about feeling that green jacket draped over his shoulders, and what meal he would choose for the champion’s dinner the following year. Not that he needs to think too hard about that last bit. ‘I hate tempting fate,’ he says while reclining on a lounger in his luxury holiday apartment in New Providence. ‘But I know exactly what my jacket measurements are and I know exactly what [dinner] I would choose. But I’m not telling you!’ Ian Poulter  lines up his putt for birdie on the 18th hole during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . These are certainly not the words of a man who feels he is taking things too easy in the build-up to the most eagerly-anticipated week of the golfing year. ‘I’ve tried every type of formula,’ he says. ‘I’ve had two weeks off before; I’ve played [tournaments] during the run-in; I’ve tried going to Augusta several days before Masters week to get some extra prep in. I’ve tried everything but nothing’s worked.’ So this year Poulter, who has two top 10 finish at the Masters in his 10 attempts, has simply said to hell with it, let’s have some fun. Family comes first, practice comes second. Sharing his holiday with the world on Twitter comes third, of course. Poulter celebrates  during the fourball match on the second day of the Ryder Cup golf tournament . By now, however, the serious work has begun. Some of his time in the Bahamas was spent on the range, before the workload was ramped up last week. The Ryder Cup defines Poulter, gets his juices flowing, his eyes and veins popping like nothing else. But he lives for the annual trip down Magnolia Lane. ‘The electricity, the tension, the buzz’ of Masters week give him goosebumps. He admits to a ‘love affair’ with the place and its storied history. Only the Open Championship can compete with the Masters for his affections and ambitions. But at the age of 39, and with Rory McIlroy leading a new breed of power hitters ready to clean up the majors, Poulter knows he will not get too many more chances of claiming either prize. Poulter plays into the 13th green during the final round of the 2014 Turkish Airlines Open . So, if push came to shove, would he take a green jacket over a claret jug? ‘That’s a very unfair question,’ he says. ‘I wouldn’t take it. Because I think I’ll win a claret jug, and I think I’ll win a green jacket. And I’m quite happy to put my neck on the line.’ In a flash, there is the mentality that has vanquished many an American dream. Despite Poulter’s Ryder Cup heroics, he has still never won a strokeplay event on US soil. He came close to victory in the Honda Classic last month but a final-round collapse featuring five balls in the water extended that duck. Yet the lion-hearted Englishman believes he will still claim the game’s two biggest prizes. Poulter admits the prospect of retiring without a major victory would leave him unfulfilled. But he has already written his rags-to-riches story, from assistant club professional in Hertfordshire to super-rich superstar in Florida. He knows he will be able to reflect one day on an extraordinary career. English golfer Poulter admits retiring without a major victory would leave him unfulfilled . ‘Yeah I’d feel incomplete [without a major] but I’d feel very content living the rest of my life knowing that I gave it a good go. It wouldn’t stop me sleeping at night, I can certainly say that much. I want to win, I’m passionate about winning, that’s what keeps me going. But if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen. I’m working very hard and if guys beat me fair and square then that’s fine.’ Two top-10 finishes at Augusta in the last five years suggests there will not be too many who can be confident of beating Poulter next week. He admits, however, that the ‘truly remarkable’ McIlroy could be one of them. Going for the career grand slam at the age of 25 is simply ‘incredible’, but even if this is not the week that feat is achieved, Poulter insists the Northern Irishman is already the equal of Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tiger Woods. Poulter smiles during practice ahead of the 2014 Ryder Cup on the PGA Centenary course at  Gleneagles . ‘We knew years ago when he burst on to the scene this kid was going to be good,’ he says. ‘We didn’t know how good. It happens every decade or couple of decades that someone comes along, gets inspired, works incredibly hard, is very dedicated, and proves that anything is possible. ‘Rory is one of those kids who has the natural talent, work ethic and is impressive to watch. When he’s on form he’s as good as anybody has ever been.’ But for all the effusive praise, Poulter rates Bubba Watson as the man to beat this year, not McIlroy. Rory McIlroy  hits his tee shot on the third hole during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . The defending champion will be chasing his third Masters win in four years and Poulter reckons the huge-hitting left-hander’s game is so well suited to Augusta, even the world No 1 might not be able to match him. Six left-handed winners in the last 12 years — Mike Weir, Phil Mickelson (three times) and Watson (twice) — is clearly playing on Poulter’s mind. He would not be alone among the players in wondering how they can compete on what Poulter admits is a ‘bomber’s course’. Still, is Bubba really the man to beat, rather than Rory? ‘For sure. Absolutely. He hits it long, he hits a nice cut off every tee. When you hit it 340 yards with a slight cut, I’d like to play that golf course. Yeah, I think he’s the favourite.’ So how can Poulter compete with Watson, McIlroy and the other monster hitters? ‘That course lends itself to a cut, or if you’re a right-hander a draw. We all know that before we get there. It’s a case of practising certain shots. There are some key holes round there which a draw will favour, or a cut of you’re a left-hander. We all know it, we just have to work on it. ‘I have to stick to my game plan. I can’t hit it 340, I’ll try to get it out there at 300 and provided my short game and wedge game is very, very good and my putting is good then I’ll definitely have a chance come Sunday.’ If that plan comes to fruition, there’s a fair chance Poulter might spend more than just one week living it up in the Bahamas. He’d richly deserve it, too. And he wouldn’t even have to spend time worrying about what he’d choose for the champions dinner in 2016.

"Manuel Pellegrini claimed he does not fear the sack after Manchester City’s title hopes suffered a big blow at Crystal Palace. Palace piled the pressure on the Chilean with an outstanding win that was secured by goals from Glenn Murray and Jason Puncheon. It leaves City in fourth place, nine points behind Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea, and sweating on qualification for next season’s Champions League. City, who hit back with a late Sergio Aguero goal, were furious that Murray’s opener was allowed to stand, feeling it should have been disallowed for offside, and they surrounded referee Michael Oliver to protest. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini witnessed his side limp to a 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace . Pellegrini believes that Palace's first goal, scored by stirker Glenn Murray, was clearly offside . Murray celebrates giving Palace the lead in the first half with a close range finish . The result places further uncertainty on Pellegrini’s future but he insisted he does not fear the axe. ‘Am I concerned for my job? No. I’m never concerned about my job,’ said Pellegrini, who next up face rivals United at Old Trafford on Sunday. ‘I do my work and am very happy. You maybe have a difficult season, but you never worry about things like this.’ When asked about his players crowding referee Oliver after the first goal from Murray, Pellegrini, who felt his side should have been awarded a second-half penalty when Palace striker Murray handled in the box, replied: ‘Because it was a clear offside. In the first minute, there was another clear offside. Jason Puncheon gave Palace a 2-0 lead against City when the midfielder scored with a superb free-kick . Puncheon's goal proved decisive for Palace, who are now up to 11th in the Premier League table . Yaya Toure scored a consolation goal for City as they lost more ground on league leaders Chelsea . ‘The mistake the referee can do, but there was also after that a clear penalty, and a lot of things happened in the game.’ Pellegrini added: ‘You ask me the same question every time (about the title race) and I give the same answer: we are not thinking about Chelsea and titles. We go each game and try to win. At the end of the season, we will see.’ Palace manager Alan Pardew heaped praise on his side, who virtually guaranteed their top-flight status with victory. ‘It’s a great night for us, fabulous for the club. We have 39 points on the board, so we’d like to think we’ll be back here next year. Crystal Palace has worked wonders since joining the club from Newcastle United back in January this year . ‘My job gets more difficult now after beating the champions here. Expectations will be higher. We have to keep on improving on it. ‘There wasn’t too much of a secret tonight. It was about resilience and good organisation. Great character in the team. ‘It was an important first goal tonight to set the mood for the game. We managed to get it. ‘We got a bit of luck, there were some scary moments — about 23 of them, I counted. ‘But we managed to see it through. You have to pay credit to these players. There were some real sustained attacks from City, showing tremendous character to keep their heads up at 2-0 down, got a great goal and I feared it was going to be a draw, but it was our night tonight. ‘Sometimes it is. We had a break with the first goal, which looks offside. But sometimes you deserve them.

"Former Manchester United midfielder Quinton Fortune claims Neymar looked a shadow of his former self during Barcelona's slender 1-0 La Liga win over Celta Vigo. Barcelona ensured they remained four points clear of title rivals Real Madrid by scrapping to a hard-fought victory over mid-table outfit Celta Vigo. However despite the win, Fortune insists Barcelona boss Luis Enrique should be concerned by Neymar's body language during the La Liga encounter.

Fortune, speaking on Sky Sports, said during the interval of Barcelona's match at Balaidos: 'Neymar has not been himself for the last couple of weeks. 'You expect Neymar to at least hit the target [when he shoots at goal]. His body language does not look right.' Neymar's last league goal came against Levante on February 15 and he has failed to hit the back of the net in his last four games in a Barcelona shirt. Fortune, who himself played in Spain during his time at Mallorca and Atletico Madrid in the 1990s, went on to praise Barcelona for having a plan B when it came to breaking down Celta Vigo's resilient defence.

'Barcelona have been playing nice football for years but it seems like they are now capable of scoring from set pieces. ‘Barcelona are not playing well and still getting results. They did the same thing against Real Madrid because I thought Madrid were the better side but they have the know-how.’ Enrique's side claimed all three points thanks to a close-range bullet header by Jeremy Mathieu in the 73rd minute.

"Chelsea captain John Terry hailed Eden Hazard as one of the world's best players after the Belgian inspired the Blues to a 2-1 win over Stoke.

"Raheem Sterling first came to the attention of the wider world in a TV documentary charting Brendan Rodgers’ early days in charge of Liverpool in the summer of 2012. In footage from a pre-season training session, the Liverpool manager is seen rebuking Sterling — then a talented but largely untried teenager — for answering him back. A little more than two-and-a-half years on and much has changed. Now Sterling is a 20-year-old England international and a cornerstone of Liverpool’s first team. On Wednesday he was back on TV again but this time he was attempting to call the shots. Raheem Sterling has turned down a new deal with Liverpool and put off contract talks until the summer . Sterling has come a long way since being lectured by Brendan Rodgers during Being Liverpool . The winger was just 17 years old in 2012 when he was told off by Rodgers for answering him back at training . Sterling, pictured celebrating a goal for England, says he does not want to be seen as a money-grabber . Sterling has attracted interest from clubs including Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Arsenal . Sterling arrives for training at Liverpool's Melwood training ground . Sterling arrives at training ahead of Liverpool's game with Arsenal . Sterling’s message to Liverpool, and indeed Rodgers, would appear to be clear. He does not want to stay at Anfield unless he can win trophies. He wants to play in his favourite midfield position. The interest from other clubs at home and abroad has made him feel good. As such, regardless of a £100,000-a-week contract offer, he may choose to leave. As a piece of PR, Wednesday's BBC interview was of questionable value. An apparent attempt to clarify his stance regarding an unsigned Liverpool contract has only served to muddle things. In trying to bring an end to media and terrace chatter about his future, it has only given it fresh legs. At one point during his chat, Sterling admitted supposed interest from Arsenal is ‘quite flattering’. Just one problem. ‘My next game is against Arsenal,’ he said, suggesting he can at least understand a fixture list, if not the delicacy of his situation or the impact of his words. ‘I want to do my best. I won’t be hiding.’ It’s just as well because the chances are that he won’t be able to. Liverpool’s fans, who value loyalty more than most, may have the young Londoner in their sights now. ‘I don’t want to be perceived as a money-grabbing 20-year-old,’ said Sterling, but the denizens of the Kop may perceive precisely that. Sterling's current £35,000-a-week deal at Liverpool has two years to run at the end of this season . Sterling has confirmed that he rejected an offer of £100,000-a-week to stay at Liverpool . Sterling says that he would have signed a less lucrative deal if he had been offered one at this stage last year . Sterling takes on Lithuania's Georgas Freidgeimas during England's Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley . Neil Ashton broke the Sterling contract story on Monday - CLICK HERE TO READ FULL ARTICLE . At Liverpool on Wednesday the club’s hierarchy were aghast. Not only did they know nothing of Sterling’s chat with the BBC until other journalists rang to ask them about it, they are understandably suspicious about the timing and motives. Rodgers and his players are coming off a sobering home loss to Manchester United, in which Sterling played poorly, and now face Arsenal in the League and Blackburn in the FA Cup — games that will go a long way to determining whether this current season is marked success or failure. Now, rather than draw a line under talk about his contract, the subject of Sterling and his future will dominate the next few days. Liverpool and Rodgers, who tends to be unemotional about these things, view this as unhelpful and unsettling. Was this the whole point of the arrangement made by Sterling’s management with the BBC? Liverpool are asking themselves this question, and, regardless of the answer, Sterling’s standing at the club has inevitably changed. At training at Melwood on Thursday, Sterling will be treated no differently by Rodgers, just as Luis Suarez was dealt with evenly in the wake of interviews in the summer of 2013 in which he criticised his manager. There are other similarities with Suarez, though, that are less palatable for the latest Liverpool player to wonder if he would be better off elsewhere. Luis Suarez said in summer 2013 that he wanted to leave Liverpool but was eventually convinced to stay . Rodgers will deal with Sterling in training at Melwood on Thursday in the same way he did with Suarez . There will be no shortage of suitors for Sterling should he leave Liverpool - in the Premier League and Europe . Sterling insists that he is focused on winning trophies and becoming the best player he can be . Liverpool’s owners will view this episode dimly. They would not sell Suarez to Arsenal in 2013. Selling good players to domestic rivals is not in John Henry’s playbook. Equally, the Americans will not sell Sterling this summer just because it would appear he may wish to leave. Suarez had to wait a year and so may Sterling. He remains under contract for another two years, after all. And so a rather unpleasant game begins and it is tempting to wonder whether Sterling will emerge from it as he would wish. Suarez was a worldly-wise, well-travelled football gun for hire when he decided to take Liverpool on. He left home at 14. He could cope. Sterling, on the other hand, still looks like the boy on that video and in some ways he still is. He spoke on Wednesday of his closeness to his mum and three-year old daughter. Will they move to Spain with him? Luis Suarez was a well-travelled football gun for hire when he took Liverpool on - but can Sterling cope? Liverpool boss Rodgers must convince Sterling to sign a new deal and remain at Anfield . Sterling should not be blamed for his ambition. Equally, he should not be criticised for putting a number on his own value. He lives in an age when football salaries are soaring and in a couple of years the Premier League will be £5billion richer. He has come a long way very quickly, however. Since that rollicking on the green grass of America in 2012, his trajectory has followed a steady upward course. This would be a bad time indeed to make his first really bad decision.","Raheem Sterling wants to be known as 'a kid that loves to play football'

"This felt a heavy blow for Derby County. Looking on course for a first victory in seven Championship games against the 10 men of Watford, they conceded an equaliser to Odion Ighalo that further undermines their promotion ambitions. Adlene Guedioura seized on hesitant defending by Craig Forsyth with 15 minutes to go to slip a weighted pass to his Watford team-mate, who poked the ball past Lee Grant to snatch an unlikely point. There was a seismic rally from the hosts, who ended the game camped in Watford’s box, never mind half. The final act was Heurelho Gomes producing a fingertip save from Richard Keogh’s header. Odion Ighalo celebrates after scoring Watford's equaliser to secure them a point at the iPro Stadium . Ighalo is joined by team-mate and captain Troy Deeney (right) after making the score 2-2 on Friday night .

Booked: Watson 7 . Sent off: Motta 44 . Goal: Vydra 23 . Manager - Slavisa Jokanovic: 7 . Referee - Kevin Friend 6.5 . Man of the Match: Tom Ince . Attendance: 31,748 . Gomes had earlier saved with his legs from Darren Bent. There was a goalline clearance. Chris Martin arrived for his first minutes in nearly two months. But it is only a point for Steve McClaren’s side. Enough to lift them back into the play-off places having fallen out earlier on Good Friday following positive results for those around them. Only on goal difference however. Having played a man up for the entire second half, this was a big opportunity missed. It had seemed Tom Ince, fresh from pulling out of England’s Under-21 side to concentrate on reigniting his stuttering career, had produced a goal of splendour that would do much the same for Derby’s season. Ince picked up the ball in the 57th minute, danced round two Watford defenders and bent a finish into the far corner. At that stage Derby were set for a first victory since February 24. But Slavisa Jokanovic adjusted his team cleverly and Watford found a way through. Derby had begun the match as if the international break had been spent on a leash now removed. A fortnight to stew on poor form and a loosening grip on promotion ambition, here was an chance to illustrate there is life in the old dog yet. Tom Ince watches on as his strike flies into the bottom corner to put Derby 2-1 up against Watford . Ince (left), alongside team-mate Bent, celebrates putting Derby in the lead against their promotion rivals . Steve McClaren screams from the touchline as his Derby side look to strengthen their promotion charge . Just two points collected in six games and the for those around them earlier in the day meant Derby entered the contest outside the top six for the first time since September 27. Watford came into this game with a defeat ringing in their ears too, a 1-0 home reverse to Ipswich, but in pretty decent nick in general: five wins from the six before that. The atmosphere carried the appropriate edge for a match of this magnitude, both sets of fans vocal. It was the hosts who started with greater energy. Watford's Marco Motta saw red just before half-time when he brought down Johnny Russell in the  area . Bent slotted the penalty past Heurelho Gomes in the Watford goal to level the scores at 1-1 . The former England striker's penalty levelled the score at 1-1 just before the half-time break . In the 15th minute Bent had a close-range shot deflected wide and from the resulting corner a smart routine, involving Craig Bryson and George Thorne, saw Tom Ince released to the byline. His cutback found Bent but the striker’s former Tottenham colleague Heurelho Gomes saved the finish superbly. Watford, starting with three forwards in Troy Deeney, Matej Vydra and Ighalo who have 48 Championship goals between them this season, carried a sizeable offensive threat. In the 23rd minute they went ahead. It was more sloppy defending from Derby, who have suffered from slackness at the back during their downturn. Cyrus Christie was twice at fault, first losing possession to Vydra when trying to dribble clear then driving his attempted clearance in the box straight into Ighalo. The ball popped to Vydra who lashed home a first-time finish for his fifth goal in seven games. Matej Vydra celebrates his goal - the first of the match - to put Watford in the lead away from home . Vydra (left) smiles to the crowd after putting Watford 1-0 up with his fifth goal in seven matches . Late in the game, there was a brutal clash of heads between Adlene Guedioura (left) and Ryan Shotton . Both players were sent flying and needed extensive treatment from their respective physios . Guedioura was impressive for Watford, and was named man of the match by Sky shortly after his injury . McClaren came down from his position in the stands unusually early to bark instructions and rearrange his side with George Thorne needing to come off injured on his return from a spell out. Jeff Hendrick was sent on and contributed to the equaliser, delivering a smart backheel that gave Ince space to thread a pass to Johnny Russell in the area. He took a touch and was brought down by Marco Motta. Referee Kevin Friend pointed to the spot and, after consideration, produced the red card for denial of a goalscoring opportunity. This was welcome change for Derby fans who had seen their side suffer defeat Wolves last time out after a horrible officiating error. Bent stepped up and dispatched the penalty with clinical power, his eighth goal since arriving on loan from Aston Villa. McClaren replaced Christie with Jesse Lingard in a bold attacking move at the interval, in search of a crucial victory. But it was not to be. Bent swivels to shoot at Gomes in the Watford goal, but he puts it wide and misses the chance to score . Bent reacts to his missed chance, while Watford's Ben Watson (right) watches on with relief .

"It is just 12 weeks since bold claims were emanating from an ultra-confident Dundee United dressing room that this season could yield an unprecedented domestic Treble. ‘I believe we can win all three trophies,’ trumpeted goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak. ‘People might laugh at me but maybe in May we will have won the league and cups and I will be laughing.’ On Wednesday night against Dundee at Dens Park, however, those carefree early January days seemed so long ago as Cierzniak’s grip of the ball for Greg Stewart’s opening goal proved as tight as his grasp on footballing reality. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara is under pressure following his side's recent slump . Dundee United failed to get their hands on the Scottish League Cup  as they fell to a 2-0 defeat by Celtic . Scottish Premiership outfit Dundee United have failed to win any of their last 10 games . As United slumped to a first derby defeat in 11 years, the loss at Dens Park saw Jackie McNamara’s team make it 10 matches without a win. It’s not yet May but nobody is laughing at Tannadice as the club gets to grips with an implosion of cataclysmic proportions both on and off the park. It does seem a touch bizarre that all is not well at a club that has reached back-to-back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years; qualified for European competition in three of the last four years; finished in the Premiership top six in every one of the last seven years and won the Scottish Cup in 2010. Yet as United have dropped like a stone from early-season table-toppers to potentially even missing out on Europe, the fallout has come amid an increasingly acrid war of words surrounding revelations about McNamara’s entitlement to a cut from outgoing player sales. Those close to Tannadice speak of a series of damaging schisms developing on all sides between fans, board and manager; cumulatively casting increased uncertainty over McNamara’s future. Ahead of the annual general meeting of influential supporters’ group ArabTRUST, one leading fan told Sportsmail of ‘overwhelming unhappiness’ with McNamara’s bonus, while his recruitment and tactical nous are also being questioned. There is, he added, a growing belief among fans that the manager’s position is ‘untenable’. But this has been a slow-burning civil war. The seeds of the crisis that appear to have taken place at almost every level of the club were first sown at the end of the winter transfer window when chairman Stephen Thompson took the unpopular decision to sell star players Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven to Celtic. As furious fans pointed out, hadn’t Thomson used the eve of last May’s Scottish Cup Final defeat by St Johnstone to declare Tannadice finances to be their finest since 1986 and vow there would be no player exodus, as occurred after the Scottish Cup win in 2010 under Peter Houston? Dundee United sold Stuart Armstrong (left) to Celtic during the January transfer window . Gary Mackay-Steven also sealed a winter move to Celtic on transfer deadline day . The Tannadice supremo even went as far as name-checking Armstrong along with Ryan Gauld and Andrew Robertson as players he would like to keep for ‘at least another year’ to help ‘compete’ with Celtic. Gauld and Robertson were quickly sold for £3million each last summer, although the fees for both made the sales palatable. Yet parting with Armstrong and Mackay-Steven just 48 hours after reaching a League Cup Final against a Celtic side Thompson had vowed to ‘compete’ with proved particularly painful for the rank and file. ‘I thought it was a strange decision, I must admit,’ said former United defender and BBC analyst Mark Wilson recently. ‘I can understand letting Mackay-Steven go because he had signed a pre-contract with Celtic but Armstrong is a different case. ‘United were in touching distance of Celtic and if you are serious about challenging, then you can sell him in June. ‘I read McNamara saying he wanted to keep both players but that they needed to balance the books. But they sold Gauld and Robertson for substantial fees in the summer and I read the chairman talking about how great the club’s finances are. ‘It was just a bit odd. Especially selling to Celtic, a rival, rather than an English team.’ At first, United closed ranks to slap down their detractors, reacting with an almost weary derision to anyone questioning the wisdom of selling key players at such a crucial part of the season. Dundee United striker Ryan Dow has scored just two league goals during the course of the current season . Dundee United striker Nadir Ciftci celebrated a goal by blowing a kiss at opposition goalkeeper Scott Bain . After starting life post-Armstrong and Mackay-Steven with a comprehensive 3-0 Scottish Cup victory at Stranraer, the line spun was that the two players, while talented, did not constitute a two-man team. They were at pains to point out that as United stormed to the top of the Premiership at the start of the season, Armstrong was often injured while an off-form Mackay-Steven was regularly left on the bench. Indeed, it was argued that, together, the duo started just three of United’s first nine games of the campaign, of which McNamara’s side won seven, drew one and lost one. After that Stair Park victory, two-goal Ryan Dow was hailed as the man to step into Armstrong and Mackay-Steven’s goalscoring boots. Dow has not hit the net since. Worryingly, United then slumped to their first back-to-back defeats of the season and went on to lose the League Cup Final to Celtic. Bain refuses to react as the Turkish striker does his best to rile his rival goalkeeper at Den Park . Turkish forward Ciftci celebrates with a kiss but ends up blushing as his side lose derby match . Jake McPake wheels away in celebration as helps Dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . Over the course of four March meetings with Ronny Deila’s men, United were dispatched from the Scottish Cup and defeated in the league, too, as McNamara’s season started to disintegrate. As the heat rose on Thompson, the United chairman first admitted the sales were a wrong footballing decision but correct from a financial standpoint. Curiously, though, the spotlight would then eventually turn on McNamara as ArabTRUST and the Federation of Dundee United Supporters’ Clubs released a statement saying they were shocked 25 per cent of £6.3m worth of transfer fees for Gauld, Robertson, Armstrong and Mackay-Steven were paid in commission to unnamed parties. United continue to deny the figures in question but eventually made the bombshell confirmation that McNamara was indeed entitled to a cut of player transfers. Even if it was done with the best of intentions — to reduce the manager’s salary in straitened times while bumping his earnings up if successful in developing young talent to sell — the revelation was toxic in the eyes of many fans. Their new-found ire towards a manager who led them to two consecutive finals has been further roused by United losing five-in-a-row for the first time since May 2006. Amid this poor run, St Johnstone defender Frazer Wright recently claimed that if McNamara’s men fall behind, ‘it gets in their heads’ and they ‘argue amongst themselves’. Dundee Utd goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak looks back at his goal after Mark Stewart opened the scoring . Stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at Den Park . Defeat at Tannadice against hapless Hamilton — without a win in 12 games — is now rendered unthinkable, even if victory would clinch a top-six finish for city rivals Dundee. There are those within Dens Park who sense a real opportunity to become the first Dark Blues side to finish above United in the league since 2002-03. A loss, coupled with a win for on-form Dundee at St Johnstone, would see Paul Hartley’s men go above United in the table on Saturday. Few could have guessed that scenario when, in the first hours of 2015, United took Dundee apart in a record 6-2 derby win at Tannadice. Not least Paul Heffernan, who, as a Hibs player, was impressed by United in a thrilling 3-3 draw at Easter Road in the League Cup in October before McNamara’s side sneaked through on penalties. ‘I’m sure the fans would love us to finish above United — and it’s all to play for,’ said the Irish striker, who scored the third in Dundee’s 3-1 win at Dens on Wednesday night. ‘We’re only two points behind United now, so we’ve just got to keep going when the split comes. Dundee United's Chris Erskine goes down under a challenge from Stephen McGinn during the Dundee derby . Dundee's Paul Heffernan taps home his side's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . ‘I’m surprised that they have gone 10 games without a win. When I was still at Hibs earlier this season, we played them in the League Cup and they were a very good side. ‘It’s a long time not to win but they’ve still got very good players in the team. I’m sure they will come good again. ‘I’d actually like it if they came good against Hamilton on Saturday, though. That would be perfect because it would cement our place in the top-six. ‘So here’s hoping they can turn it around on Saturday because it would help us. It would be ironic, I know, if United clinched us a top-six place. ‘But we go to St Johnstone knowing we are definitely in the top six if we win there.’ While the tangerine half of Dundee mourns its fall from grace, the Dark Blues are in raptures after breaking a sequence of derbies without victory stretching back to November 2004. ‘Ending that run against United was a big motivating factor — and I felt that was the best I’ve seen us play,’ said Heffernan. ‘A lot of the players haven’t been here that long. But, for the sake of the fans who haven’t witnessed a win over United for such a long time, it was really important. We did it for them. I’m sure they will enjoy this one for a long time to come.’ After a long era in the shadow of their neighbours, Dundee are daring to dream. Amid a tangerine nightmare, however, for a United side in crisis, the Treble that once lay ahead has been replaced by trouble.","Jackie McNamara's Dundee United have lost their last five games .

"Paris Saint-Germain forward Edinson Cavani has rejected rumours that he does not get on with team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic insisting the only issue he has is being played out of position. Reports had suggested a breakdown in the pair's relationship and earlier in the season coach Laurent Blanc even said they must improve their partnership on the pitch. Former Napoli forward Cavani admits that he and Ibrahimovic are not necessarily friends but dismissed speculation of a rift with the Sweden international. Edinson Cavani argues with the referee during PSG's 3-2 win against Marseilles at New Stade Velodrome . PSG forward Cavani challenges with Marseilles midfielder Mario Lemina during Sunday's clash . Cavani insists he has a respectful relationship with Zlatan Ibrahimovic amid reports the pair do not get on . 'I do not know where this rumour of a bad relationship with Ibrahimovic comes from,' Cavani told Canal Plus. 'We are footballers who play for the same club and we respect one another. One cannot be friends with everyone.' But Cavani has reiterated his frustration at being shoehorned into a front three and not playing in his favoured position alongside Ibrahimovic. 'The only concern that I have ever spoken about is that I was recruited to play as a striker with Ibrahimovic and it has not always been the case.

'But aside from that, everything else is perfect here.' Cavani has been linked with a summer exit and, despite revealing his intentions to honour his contract that runs for another three seasons, he refused to rule out a possible move. 'Currently, I am just thinking about finishing the season in Paris and also respecting my contract,' he added. 'My attention is only focused on training with the club that pays me.

"Nick Abendanon was perhaps the only happy Englishman at Stade Marcel Michelin on Saturday night and, after leading Northampton a merry dance, he revealed faint but lingering World Cup hopes. Clermont Auvergne’s former Bath full back ran amok as the Premiership champions were thrashed 37-5 — scoring one try from long range and having a crucial hand in two others, to claim the man-of-the-match award. Abendanon won the last of his two caps for England back in 2007, but he was still on the coaches’ radar until his move across the Channel last summer and, after a supreme display of elusive running, he admitted he has not given up on the slim possibility of a Test recall. Nick Abendanon breaks clear to score for Clermont in their thrashing of Northampton on Saturday . The English full back was man of the match for the third time against Premiership opposition this year . The 28-year-old is theoretically out of contention as an exile abroad, but he invoked the ‘exceptional circumstances’ clause in the RFU selection policy as he said: ‘I’d love to get a call from Stuart (Lancaster) over the summer, but I’m not counting on it because they’ve got that rule in place. ‘I understood the reasons for the rule, and in my heart I knew that when I came to France my England career was probably over. But the World Cup . . . special dispensation . . . if Clermont continue the way they are, I stay injury-free and I keep playing some good rugby, then maybe it’s a possibility in the same way that people have been talking about Steffon (Armitage).’ Abendanon crosses in his starring performance for the French side in the European Champions Cup . A World Cup dispensation has been discussed for Toulon's English flanker Steffon Armitage . They have the squad to do anything, based on their efforts on Saturday night, when the Saints were brutally swept aside. Visiting captain Dylan Hartley said: ‘They steamrollered us and just kept going.’ His fellow England forward, Tom Wood, vented his frustration on Twitter, saying: ‘Thanks to Clermont for inviting us to their open training-session today. We’ve left our non-contact bibs in the changing-rooms. Humbled.’ Northampton captain Dylan Hartley (second right) leads the Saints off the field after their convincing defeat . Meanwhile Anthony Watson believes it is only a matter of time before Bath’s attacking intent delivers silverware after their 18-15 European Champions Cup quarter-final loss to Leinster in Dublin. Mike Ford’s men produced an impressive second-half comeback to leave the three-time champions hanging on by a thread at the end with full back Watson and fly-half George Ford especially impressive. ‘If anything, the way we played against Leinster adds more confidence because I thought there were times when we showed all we can do,’ Watson said. ‘I think the way we have been playing this year has been a revelation to be a part of and I have really enjoyed playing for this club.’","Nick Abendanon was man of the match in Clermont win over Northampton .

"Paul Casey insists he is desperate to play in the Ryder Cup again, even though he looks unlikely to rejoin the European Tour in time to earn qualifying points this season. Only Tour members can play on the team and Phoenix-based Casey gave up his membership after deciding in January to concentrate on the PGA Tour in order to get back into the world's top 50. The move has paid off with the former world No 3 losing a play-off in the Northern Trust Open and finishing joint third in the Honda Classic to climb to 44th at the start of this week. Paul Casey, practicing ahead of the Masters in Augusta, 'desperately' wants to return to the Ryder Cup . The Englishman has returned to the world's top 50 after leaving the European Tour to concentrate on his game . However, even if he rejoins the European Tour before the May 1 deadline to be eligible to accrue Ryder Cup points when the race starts in August, he will struggle to play the 13 events required for membership. 'It was very straightforward when I was top 10 in the world playing both tours,' Casey told Sportsmail ahead of his first Masters appearance since 2012. 'I know I am back in the top 50 but I have only just got back into the top 50. It was a very difficult decision but it was also the correct decision. 'I still have to play 13 events and right now I am not in the US Open or Open or HBSC Champions at the end of the year. Playing 13 becomes difficult when you haven't played at the start of the year in Middle East.' Casey celebrates while watching a replay of his hole-in-one, which helped Europe to victory in 2006 . Casey last played in the Ryder Cup competition in the 2008 defeat by USA at Valhalla . Casey played in the record Ryder Cup wins in 2004 and 2006 and the 2008 defeat at Valhalla, but was in tears after being overlooked for a wild card by captain Colin Montgomerie in 2010, when he was ranked seventh in the world. 'I desperately want to be part of a Ryder Cup again. There is definitely passion and a fire there burning,' he added. 'Certainly one of them I felt like I was maybe denied, the others I haven't been in a position to make the team and watching Medinah and Gleneagles has been brilliant. 'What they have done has been absolutely phenomenal and I want to be part of that again and not just part of it, but a real solid team player and leader in the team room, which I know I can be. When I play my best golf I think I can certainly play that kind of role.' European captain Darren Clarke said earlier this week he wanted Casey on his team for Hazeltine next year, and the 37-year-old added: 'Paul (McGinley) said the same thing (even though I was a member of the Tour at the time). 'He was desperate for me to be part of that because I had won twice around Gleneagles and unfortunately wasn't playing the golf I needed to.' Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke (right), speaking with Tiger Woods in Augusta, wants Casey on his team . Casey finished sixth on his Masters debut in 2004 and is relishing being back at Augusta National after failing to qualify in 2013 and 2014. 'When you have been here and gone away for a year or two you certainly appreciate it when you come back,' he added. 'I'm very focused this week but I am enjoying being here and lapping up everything about it. 'I was on the same flight as Padraig Harrington (who was also ineligible last year) on Sunday and when we landed the girls who run the courtesy car service here had all made little signs saying 'Welcome back Padraig'. We touched on that subject and said that we were both going to give it a good go, but enjoy it.'","Paul Casey left the European Tour to get back into world's top 50 .

"Raheem Sterling may hold all the cards in his contract dispute with Liverpool, but he needs to focus on his football rather than his pay-packet, according to former QPR boss Harry Redknapp. Redknapp insisted that Sterling is not ready to move to the likes of Real Madrid at this stage of his career, so should stay at the club who have helped him develop so far. However, the 68-year-old also conceded that, if he wants to force a move, there is very little Liverpool can do to stop him. Raheem Sterling should focus on his football rather than his contract according to Harry Redknapp . Sterling has turned down a new deal with Liverpool and put off contract talks until the summer . 'Sterling is not going to go to Real Madrid at the moment I wouldn't think, so where could he go better in England?'  said Redknapp while working as a pundit for BT Sport. 'I think he's at a great club, he's working under a manger who obviously works hard with him on the training ground, eh's improved him. I think he needs to sign his contract and get on with his football. 'It's very hard to keep players who really make up their mind they want to leave.' 'When they want to go, they've got all the power. If he decides to down tools, they've got a problem.' The 20-year-old gave an interview to the BBC on Wednesday giving his reasons for his decision . Brendan Rodgers insists that his relationship with Sterling is as strong as ever despite the disputes . Harry Redknapp made the comments while working as a pundit for BT Sport on Saturday . The last Liverpool player to run down his contract and leave for Real Madrid, Steve McManaman, branded Sterling's behaviour 'ridiculous' and 'baffling' and suggested the player has been poorly advised. 'I think it's ridiculous and you have to remember he's only a 20-year-old boy, starting off his career,' said McManaman. The people who are trying to guide him through his life have been ill-informed really. He's now put himself under a huge amount of pressure, and he shouldn't have. Sterling (right) has confirmed that he rejected an offer of £100,000-a-week to stay at Liverpool . 'You don't want to discuss your contract and leave it to the end of the season. Don't go and do an interview talking about your contract. It's baffling, absolutely baffling.' 'I think he wants to stay at Liverpool it's just about getting the best deal off the club.

"Mauricio Pochettino might have given up hope of qualifying for the Champions League, but Harry Kane won’t hear any of it. The 21-year-old, who became the youngest Premier League captain this season during the drab goalless draw against Burnley on Easter Sunday, still retains belief they can gatecrash the top-four party. Spurs are now seven points behind Manchester City, who play Crystal Palace on Monday night, with just seven games remaining. Harry Kane believes Tottenham still have a chance of qualifying for the Champions League this season . It looks a tall order, but Kane - who hailed his last few days as the ‘best week of my life’ - thinks they can make it. 'It's going to be tricky, we're quite a few points behind now,’ Kane said. 'But in this league you never know. We've got winnable games coming up and we focus on them. ‘We take each game as it comes and see where that takes us. We start on Saturday [at home against Aston Villa].’ Kane has 29 club goals under Pochettino this season and is the main reason Tottenham have lasted the pace until now. Kane could not find a way to break the deadlock for Tottenham in their 0-0 draw at Turf Moor on Sunday . Throwing him the armband was a move bourne out of necessity by the manager, and it was something he relished. 'It's a real honour, a very proud moment for myself to lead the side out,’ Kane added. ‘It's very special for me. Hopefully there is more to come in the years to come. 'We've got a lot of leaders in the team. It's a very young team and everyone has their say. To be given the armband by the gaffer is a proud moment. But there are a lot of captains out there and we all try and work to the same aim.’ At just 21 years and 251 days, the Tottenham striker led out his side for the first time in draw with Burnley . He and Burnley’s Danny Ings are also working to the same aim - bidding to work their way into the thoughts of England manager Roy Hodgson ahead of next summer’s European Championships in France. Both will be handed spots in Gareth Southgate’s squad for the Under 21 Euros at the end of this season. Kane hopes their partnership can be one replicated for the seniors in years to come. Kane and Burnley striker Danny Ings will both be handed spots in Gareth Southgate's Under 21 Euros squad . ‘Turin was a great experience,’ he said. ‘To get my first start for England is another proud moment for me. It was tough and I can only learn from those sort of games. ‘Danny’s a great player. I know him well from the Under 21s. He scores goals and his movement's great. He's a prospect for English football. There are a lot of great English strikers here at the moment, which is good for the country. 'There's competition. We've all got to work hard to retain our place. ‘We've both got to keep working hard, as do the other strikers who are trying to get a place.

"Most afternoons, after the players had drifted away from Tottenham's training centre, Tim Sherwood would sit for hours with his coaches Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand in the staff canteen. They were always together, forming an alliance after Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy made Sherwood responsible for the club's youth and Under 21 programmes in 2008. On Tuesday evening they will be in opposing dug-outs at Villa Park, trying to lead their teams away from relegation danger in these final, fraught weeks of the Barclays Premier League season. Tim Sherwood (from left to right), Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey during their time at White Hart Lane . Sherwood (right) sits on the bench with Tottenham Hotspur staff Ferdinand (centre) and Ramsey (left) Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor celebrates his goal by saluting Sherwood (right) and Ramsey (centre) Whatever happens between Sherwood's Aston Villa and Ramsey's Queens Park Rangers, where Ferdinand is now head of football operations, the three men will remain firm friends. The bond is strong even if Sherwood is blocking Ramsey's mobile phone calls temporarily. 'What would we talk about?' said Sherwood on Monday. 'You can't share team notes. I keep red- buttoning him! All we could say is, ""How's the family, are you all right? OK, see you Tuesday"".' Sherwood and Ramsey forged their friendship at Tottenham. Someone, somewhere is always working an angle with Levy, but they looked out for each other at a club regarded as the most political in the English top flight. Intriguingly, Sherwood hinted on Monday that if Ramsey's tenure at Loftus Road proves short-lived, he would ask to bring him to Villa. 'I would have to speak to the club about whether we could find a role for him here,' confirmed Sherwood. 'I know I'm biased but he is up there with the very best coaches I have ever seen. 'He is a street kid. He knows how to talk to them. You could ask him two minutes before to put on a session for 40 players and he could do it.' Sherwood and Ramsey are credited with guiding some of the brightest young talents at Spurs and helping them break into the first team. Sherwood and Ramsey forged their friendship at Tottenham and remain close ahead of their showdown . The bond between the two remains strong even if Sherwood is blocking Ramsey's mobile phone calls for now . Sherwood hinted that if Ramsey's tenure at Loftus Road ends, then he would ask to bring him to Villa Park . Harry Kane, Andros Townsend and Ryan Mason, who all played in England's 1-1 draw in Italy last week, were brought through Tottenham's youth system by this coaching collective. Some at Spurs bridle at the idea that the trio are wholly responsible for their development, but you can't deny their influence. Next season, for example, England Under 21 midfielder Alex Pritchard will return from his loan at Brentford and is expected to be named in Tottenham's 25-man first-team squad. Joshua Onomah, who made his debut for Tottenham in January and also captains the youth team, is another discovery. Sherwood took to Ramsey when he was gaining knowledge of youth football after he accepted a new role at Tottenham in 2012. Ramsey, who played right back for Brighton in the 2-2 draw with Manchester United in the 1983 FA Cup final, was brought into Tottenham in 2005 by academy director John McDermott and initially assigned to the Under 14 team. The pair had met at the FA, where Ramsey had worked after an ill-fated coaching spell alongside former Luton player Ricky Hill at Kenilworth Road. Ramsey still lives in Bedfordshire, a short drive from Sherwood's imposing house in Dagnall, Buckinghamshire, which he bought when he was a Blackburn player.

Ramsey must put his friendship with Sherwood on ice for the time being as he tries to see off his pal's team . Ramsey still lives in Bedfordshire - a short drive from Sherwood's imposing house in Buckinghamshire . When Sherwood accepted his role as development co-ordinator, shipping players out on loan to gain experience (often to Swindon, where Lee Power, a friend from his playing days at Norwich, is chairman), Tottenham's players flourished. On matchdays he often scouted players with Ferdinand. As they became more involved with youth development, preferring to educate their own players rather than recruit expensive youngsters, they gained Levy's trust. When Andre Villas-Boas pushed the self-destruct button in December 2013, all three moved into the dug-out following Sherwood's appointment. It was short-lived. Sherwood and his staff left at the end of the season after Levy opted for Mauricio Pochettino. Sherwood was expected to follow Ferdinand and Ramsey to QPR when Harry Redknapp quit. But he had also struck up a relationship with Villa director of recruitment Paddy Riley and that is the reason Sherwood and Ramsey face each other on Tuesday night.","Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood faces Chris Ramsey's QPR on Tuesday .

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has fanned the flames of Raheem Sterling's contract stand-off with Liverpool by insisting he would sell any player who wanted to leave his club. Sterling's commitment to Liverpool is in doubt after he gave a televised interview on Wednesday explaining why he has chosen to put talks over a new deal on hold. As Sportsmail revealed on Thursday, Chelsea are interested in the 20-year-old and have been asked to be kept updated on his future. Arsenal are also keen on the England international. Raheem Sterling, pictured in training on Thursday, has rejected a new £100,000-a-week deal with Liverpool .

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is adamant that Sterling will not be sold in the summer transfer window . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers will play Sterling at Arsenal in Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash despite the player admitting that he is 'flattered' by interest from the north London club. Rodgers insists Sterling is not for sale this summer at any price, despite his reluctance to sign an extension. But Mourinho said: 'I don't like players that don't want to play for me and my club. My opinion is every player has a price. 'It doesn't matter which player. If you ask me, for example, do I want Eden Hazard to leave Chelsea? No. If he wants to leave and doesn't want to work with me, doesn't want to play for Chelsea, does he have a price? I think he has. But I also understand the philosophy of managers and clubs who want to keep the players at any price. My philosophy is not better than that, it's just mine.'

Rodgers has resisted the temptation to leave out Sterling on Saturday after a turbulent three days following his revelation of the reasons for stalling over a new £100,000-a-week contract. Sterling's remarks about being flattered by Arsenal's interest have only added to suspicions that his representatives are trying to engineer a move to London. But Rodgers believes that Sterling will react 'very strongly' to the situation and has the right temperament to handle a game that Liverpool need to win to close a six-point gap on Arsenal in the race for a top-four finish. 'He will play,' said the Liverpool boss. 'If it was a different player I would maybe have something to think about. But with this kid, since he has come in, trained and worked with me, he has been phenomenal and I expect him to go there and perform at a high level. 'I think he is a strong character. He's a young boy, still learning, on and off the field, but I don't think there was anything derogatory to Liverpool. I know he loves the club and I expect him to perform at a high level.'

The English pair, who used to play with Toure at City, played just nine Premier League games between them after moving to the Etihad. Toure told the Liverpool Echo: 'Both Rodwell and Sinclair went to a club where there is big competition and didn't play. 'If Raheem left Liverpool he would not be sure to start games.

'But that shouldn't mean he should be indebted to the extent of feeling he owes everything to the club. If the club created top players from nothing then everyone would make it.

"Some tour guides will do anything for a good tip. In the Australian outback, if you want to get up-close and personal with a mob of local Emus, you need a guide who will get down and dirty ... apparently. In a video posted online by YouTube user Ratbag Nomad, one man, referred to as Australianwidefishingguide, shows tourists how it's done. Emus are notoriously curious flightless birds of Australia . As the tour guide started peddling his legs slowly in the air, the mob of emus started coming closer . And closer . The video, filmed from a vehicle on an empty dirt road in the bush, shows the guide lying down on his back and kicking his legs in the air to lure a mob of emus in the distance. Peddling his legs to the sky, he looks like something between  an up-side down bicycle rider and a dead cockroach. Sure enough, the Emus - known to be especially curious birds - come close to see what's going on, then scatter as the guide leaps to his feat. A good leg in the air does the trick . As the guide leapt to his feet, the inquisitive birds scattered . It's thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu - whose meat was highly valued for its oils. Emus belong to the same family of flightless birds as the ostrich and the cassowary. Capable of reaching running speeds of up to 70 km/hour, they're said to be able to 'run the pants off a Kangaroo.' The manoeuvre is thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu - a bird whose meat was highly valued for its oils but who are too fast to catch on foot .","Tour guide gets down in the dirt to attract a mob of emus in the outback .

"Arsenal's Olivier Giroud and Arsene Wenger have been named as the Barclays Premier League Player and Manager of the Month for March - with the France striker thwarting Harry Kane's bid for a third award in a row.

'I'm really pleased with it,' Giroud told Arsenal's official website. 'I would like to thank my team-mates and of course the fans, because it's a collective sport and I couldn't do it on my own. 'It's a great honour to have been selected as Player of the Month, especially because we wanted to bounce back from the Champions League disappointment. 'That's what we've done and we've come back really strongly. We all want to finish strongly and this award will give me more confidence for the following games.' Kane also fired five goals in four appearances for Mauricio Pochettino's side in March, including his first ever Premier League hat-trick when Spurs beat Leicester City 4-3 at White Hart Lane.

"No footballer has ever been late for kick-off because he was tied up negotiating a new contract. So, from the start, Raheem Sterling’s explanation for the end of his conversations with Liverpool did not stand up. It isn’t the talks that are the distraction. It is the thinking. No player is sat in an office haggling over image rights, only to check his watch at 3.30pm and bolt out of the door. A player may feel uncertainty about his future. His brain may whirl over where he will play next season. Liverpool? Arsenal? Abroad? Yet postponing the process to the end of the season doesn’t solve that issue. If anything, it makes it worse. If Sterling wanted to stop thinking right now, he could sign his new deal or tell Liverpool to come back in a year. He has, after all, got more than two seasons left on his existing arrangement. Raheem Sterling has turned down a new deal with Liverpool and put off contract talks until the summer . Sterling (right) has confirmed that he rejected an offer of £100,000-a-week to stay at Liverpool . The 20-year-old gave an interview to the BBC on Wednesday giving his reasons for his decision . So all Sterling did, the day his advisers ended negotiations until May at the earliest, was complicate his affairs. It is not as if he will be able to forget about the decision in the coming weeks, particularly as his stance appears to have damaged his relationship with Liverpool’s supporters. Without doubt, they were dissatisfied with his attitude even before this week’s ill-conceived BBC interview. As Liverpool’s hopes of a Champions League place next season became increasingly remote with the home defeat against Manchester United, Sterling bore the brunt of the dissent. In truth, his performance was little worse than any of his team-mates that day - but he is the one who is seen as disloyal, as rejecting at the first opportunity the club and manager that have best developed his game. Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers have done well by Sterling. They made him a key player in last season’s title near miss, got him to the World Cup. He owes them a little more respect than has been displayed in recent weeks. He owes them enough to know it is downright rude to talk of being flattered by Arsenal just days before the teams meet. Liverpool are entitled to think it is equally flattering for a club of its stature to offer a salary worth more than £5million annually. Apparently not. Sterling (left) shakes hands with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers during training on Thursday . Sterling has played in various positions this season under Rodgers - including as a striker and at wing back . Among the reasons advanced for Sterling’s coldness towards a long-term commitment at Liverpool has been Rodgers’s recent decision to play him at right wing back. This has been a result of injuries and suspensions, rather than a long-term strategy - but it does raise wider questions regarding the mindset of English players, and why many might find their pathway blocked. Would a young player brought up through Ajax’s system, for instance, be so affronted by this temporary change? Why is it the English in particular that see football in straight lines? Sterling has played as a centre forward, a No 10, a wide midfielder and now a wing back. Isn’t this the versatility that we envy in the best foreign teams? Isn’t this an education? Why is it that England produces pigeon-holed full backs or midfielders, and not footballers? Shouldn’t a player - certainly one who wishes to command in excess of £100,000 a week - be able to fill in anywhere? Indeed, shouldn’t he welcome that endorsement from his manager? Arsenal progressed to the 2006 Champions League final at a time when Ashley Cole was injured. In his place through the knockout stages, home and away against Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal, was the 22-year-old French midfielder Mathieu Flamini. He hadn’t played full back in his entire professional career, he said. But he never complained, and Arsenal didn’t concede in any of his six matches. Midfielder Mathieu Flamini (right) was used a full back in Arsenal's run to the 2006 Champions League final . Flamini isn’t a creative in Sterling’s mould - but then right wing back isn’t the same as left back, either. Sterling is still operating as a winger when Liverpool attack. Flamini, a central midfielder, was used strictly as a defender. It wasn’t as if Arsene Wenger was gung-ho in those games: three ended goalless, two in 1-0 victories. Flamini performed with exceptional discipline. One imagines that midfielder Emre Can didn’t sign for Liverpool expecting to be part of a back three. Rodgers first used him as a defender this season against Burnley in December, and he has remained there ever since. Can is German, though, the product of a more intellectually vibrant football culture. World Cup-winning captain Philipp Lahm eagerly switched between holding midfield and full back. Midfield lynchpin Bastian Schweinsteiger began his career as a right winger, while Thomas Muller can play centre forward, support striker, attacking midfielder and winger. Every player will have a favourite position but in England these desires become entrenched. Even the most gifted, such as Steven Gerrard, never seemed entirely at ease with his versatility. Maybe Sterling should spend his time thinking less about his contract and more about the type of footballer he wishes to be; maybe about the type of footballer who can demand more than £100,000 a week. Because that player goes wherever his team needs him — and that makes him worth the coin. Sterling's Liverpool team-mate Emre Can (centre) has been used mainly in defence, despite being a midfielder .","Raheem Sterling has turned down a Liverpool deal worth £100,000-a-week .

"Jaap Stam had just ordered a new kitchen for his Cheshire home when he was informed by Sir Alex Ferguson that he was being sold to Lazio. The then Manchester United manager didn’t mention in the same conversation that his son, Jason, stood to make a seven-figure sum in his role as an agent in the deal. No, Stam’s representatives would discover that later. Raheem Sterling shakes hands with Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers during training on Thursday . The two were at Melwood alongside the rest of the Liverpool squad in preparation for clash with Arsenal . Rodgers remains confident that Sterling will stay and the situation will be resolved in the summer . Sterling is quite within his rights to get the best possible deal he can for himself, according to Roy Keane . But even so, it prompted Roy Keane to explain to me – for a column I was ghosting at the time - why a footballer should ‘always look after No 1’. United’s captain scoffed at the idea that loyalty really existed in football. ‘Jaap has discovered that, to football clubs, players are just expensive pieces of meat,’ said Keane, without a hint of concern as to how his views might impact on his own relationship with his employers. Keane would probably feel Raheem Sterling is quite within his rights to get the best possible deal he can for himself. Sterling might be 20 and he might want what seems a ludicrous amount of money for a player, while hugely promising, remains relatively unproven. But he already has a young family to support and he has ambitions not just to win trophies but to make as much money as he possibly can. In truth, the only issue right now is how he is choosing to go about getting what he wants. He has an agent, in Aidy Ward, who is developing something of a reputation for an aggressive strategy for his clients – we saw as much when he turned up at Old Trafford last month with Saido Berahino – and the approach he is employing here is not exactly endearing Sterling to anyone. Sterling's agent Aidy Ward next to Saido Berahino (centre) at Old Trafford for Man United against Arsenal . Jaap Stam was a fixture of Manchester United's central defence from 1998-2001 before being sold to Lazio . Former Manchester United midfielder Keane insists that a footballer should 'always look after No 1' My guess is Liverpool wouldn’t have been as upset by his appearance on the BBC as some might think. Sterling and Ward should probably realise that, right now, £100,000 a week is a generous offer. Just as they should realise that switching to a club like Manchester City might not be the smartest move at this stage of his development. Better to remain at Anfield where he will play regularly under Brendan Rodgers; a manager who hasn’t exactly done a bad job of developing Sterling so far. On Friday, Rodgers said he remained confident that Sterling would stay; that the situation would resolve itself in the summer. But I wonder if it will when Ward and Sterling are employing such aggressive tactics and Liverpool have made clear their own approach to future contract negotiations with their players. For the top players Liverpool pay handsomely. Daniel Sturridge is believed to be earning around £150,000 a week and Steven Gerrard always felt well-enough rewarded for a player Ferguson once regarded as the ‘most influential’ in the Barclays Premier League. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge (right) is believed to be earning around £150,000 a week . Steven Gerrard trains at Melwood as he keeps fit during his period of suspension for Liverpool . But Liverpool do not have the financial muscle of a City or a Chelsea and that could yet result in them losing Sterling. Only recently Ian Ayre, the Liverpool chief executive, explained the club’s strategy and a move towards more performance-related contracts. ‘In any business you can make lots of money but if you let it go out of the door in other ways, then you are in trouble,’ he said. ‘The obvious biggest outgoing is players’ wages and transfer fees. That’s taken a pretty dramatic change in terms of how we look at it, analyse it and pay for it - and how we structure contracts. ‘We pay good pay for our players; we pay fair pay. But we also like to give them the appetite to earn more which we know footballers like to do. As we all do. ‘That’s a far cry from deals where it is sort of nailed on and then it doesn’t matter whether they perform or do not perform. ‘So we are just trying to find a balance. I think other teams are doing that as well - or at least trying to do that. ‘And it’s certainly working for us - we have a happy bunch of players.’ Sterling scored his first goal for England during their 4-0 win over Lithuania last Friday . The 20-year-old Liverpool forward uploaded this picture to Instagram from inside his home . Clearly, not everyone is happy. But that is not necessarily Liverpool’s fault. They have a business to run and they have a duty to run it well. At the same time, Sterling will rightly feel he has a duty to his family to make as much money as he can during his relatively short career as a professional footballer. But he is not thinking it through carefully enough and nor, you suspect, is his agent. A footballer’s image can have a huge financial value in modern football and right now Sterling’s is taking a battering. And if he does move to another club and he fails to progress at the rate he currently is at Liverpool, he could find that has an impact on future earnings. Not that anyone he seems to be listening to will be telling him that.","Raheem Sterling is quite within his rights to get the best possible deal .

"What if someone took your greatest insecurities and body image fears, and voiced them out loud? Known for its empowering campaigns and championing of real women, Dove has taken a more brutal approach in its latest advertisement. Showing the harsh criticism that women regularly heap upon themselves, Dove decided to see what would happen when somebody else said those things, to their faces. Scroll down for video . For the new One Beautiful Thought ad campaign, Dove asked a group of women to write down every thought they had about themselves. The women filled in a notebook each, and handed it back to Dove . Unbeknownst to the women, those negative remarks and self-body shaming were turned into a script . Created in France, Dove asked a group of women - all beautiful and impeccably chic - to write down every thought they had about themselves in a notebook. The beauty brand then took the notes away with them. Unbeknownst to the women, those criticisms, negative remarks and tirades of self body-shaming were turned into a script. What happened next, shocked them all. Dove recruited two undercover actresses to read the script, created using the notes each of the women made about themselves, while they were all within earshot. Their reactions were priceless . The comments featured in the actresses' scripted dialogue were harsh, cutting and bordering on bullying . Played out by two actresses, the script was read aloud as dialogue in a cafe, where the women themselves had been invited for coffee. In the experiment set up by Dove, the women heard the actresses repeat their own thoughts to each other, out loud. Making for a shocking scene, the script, which contained nothing but the original notes, was cutting to say the least. One woman felt insecure about her teeth, noting that she thought they made her look like a mouse . When the actresses repeated the insecurity out loud, while sitting on the next table, her shock was obvious . In one scenario, a customer sitting on a nearby table, not involved in the experiment, even intervenes. 'Your arms are too big, your silhouette is all squashed,' reads one remark written by a woman who looks no bigger than a size eight. 'Sit up straight otherwise your belly looks big,' the same woman continues. Several of the women's messages to themselves echo the kind of schoolyard bullying we'd all frown upon .

While another, 'your face looks like a bulldog,' when said out loud underlines the way many women effectively bully themselves every single day.

Visibly shocked by the comments, the women recognise the dialogue as their own notes. 'I hope my daughter never speaks to herself like that,' says one. While another concedes, 'yes that's what I say to myself all day long. Now, I get how violent it is!' Many of the comments written in the notebooks, when said out loud, underline the way lots of women are effectively bullying themselves every single day, by focusing on their insecurities and never their beauty . If you wouldn't speak so harshly to a friend, why do it to yourself? The One Beautiful Thought campaign is yet another in Dove's line of powerful videos, which all aim to encourage women to be kinder to themselves and each other . The One Beautiful Thought campaign is yet another in Dove's line of powerful videos.

"Twin 18-month-old boys were pronounced dead at a hospital after being pulled from a canal in Arizona. The toddlers are believed to have fallen in the water accidentally at 9.45am on Friday in Yuma, Arizona. After a police search that lasted more than an hour, the brothers were pulled from the water. They were flown by a U.S. Marine Corps helicopter to a Yuma hospital, where they were pronounced dead, Franklin said. Tragic: Twin 18-month-old boys died after accidentally falling in a canal in Arizona on Friday morning . Detectives investigating the case believe the boys ended up in the canal by accident and don't suspect foul play, Franklin said. The area along the canal is used by families for walks and by joggers and a family member was nearby when the boys ended up in the water. Franklin would not provide details of the events that led up to the toddlers ending up in the canal. Yuma Fire Department spokesman Mike Erfert said their crews were called out on a possible drowning. Helicopters from the U.S. Border Patrol and the Marine Corps also flew over the canal searching for the boys. The Border Patrol helicopter crew spotted the brothers in the water, Erfert said, and they were pulled out at about 11.20am. Paramedics began immediate life-saving efforts and the boys were quickly loaded onto the Marine Corps helicopter for the trip to the hospital.","The brothers are believed to have fallen in the water by accident .
