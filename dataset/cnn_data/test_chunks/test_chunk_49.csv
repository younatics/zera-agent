"Court battle: Lord Janner's alleged victims could sue him for £2.5million after the CPS dropped a prosecution against him for the fourth time . Lord Janner's alleged victims could sue him for £2.5million after being denied justice for the fourth time in 25 years when the CPS refused to prosecute him. Police have identified 25 people who claim the Labour peer attacked them and each could claim for up to £100,000. One man, allegedly attacked by Janner when he was living in a  children's homes between 1981 and 1988, has already instructed lawyers to sue him and Leicestershire County Council for damages. His solicitor Peter Garsden, president of the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers, has said that after a string of bungled investigations suing 'may be the only way the alleged victims are going to get some sort of justice'. Several of those who claim to have been sexually abused say Janner got to them through paedophile Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children's homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. The CPS last week said the 'core allegation' was that Lord Janner befriended Beck to access children 'to allow him to perpetrate serious sexual offences' on them. Beck died in jail in 1994. Mr Garsden said: 'We are preparing a claim for this man against Lord Janner and Leicestershire County Council. 'The allegations involved the most extreme abuse. Our case is that Frank Beck was running the home where this man was introduced to Greville Janner. 'Perhaps this is the only way the alleged victims in this case are going to get some sort of justice.' A compensation scheme for Jimmy Savile's dozens of victims was agreed at the High Court last year where those abused were paid out of his £3.3million estate. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014, when he was last seen in public . Test cases: Victims abused by Jimmy Savile and Liberal MP Cyril Smith also sued after they were denied justice . Liz Dux, whose law firm Slater & Gordon respresents 168 of Jimmy Savile's victims and 10 of former Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith, says that Janner's alleged victims could be handed £100,000 each. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs have accused Alison Saunders, the director of the CPS (above), of ignoring the rights of victims . Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who made the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner, claimed £13,400 in expenses last year including almost £7,000 on business-class flights. Her most recently published expenses show she flew business class to Washington, Dubai and New York in the year that the CPS was forced to cut its budget by 27 per cent. Mrs Saunders, pictured, has been heavily criticised in recent weeks over corruption charges against journalists and deciding not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged sex offences. The publicly funded trips included one to the Caribbean for an ‘official meeting’ last September which cost the taxpayer £3,105 for hotels and flights. A CPS spokesman said: ‘The DPP’s travel overseas helps the CPS to join forces with other countries so we can reduce serious crime both in the UK and around the world.’ The CPS said the DPP travels standard fares unless there is a long-haul trip and a requirement to work immediately at the other end. Mrs Saunders, who earns £200,000 a year, charged the taxpayer £102 for one taxi journey. The CPS said they have strict rules on when taxis should be used, including when heavy baggage has to be carried or when there are no other suitable methods of transportation. She said: 'If the victims of Lord Janner are successful, damages could be sizeable. 'Civil redress is the next logical step after the CPS decision.' Lord Janner's family has said he is 'entirely innocent of any wrongdoing' and 'is a man of great integrity'. A Leicestershire County Council spokesman said: 'We have been co-operating with the police on aspects of their investigation that relate to historic abuse involving the former county council children's homes in the 1970s and 1980s. 'Since then, the council has introduced a series of safeguards and procedures to minimise the chances of this kind of abuse from happening again. All relevant documents have been provided to the police. 'We have not been approached so far regarding compensation claims and so cannot comment further at this time.' The CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. However, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. She spoke of her 'deep regret' as she announced that Lord Janner will not face trial and admitted he should have been charged three times before in 1991, 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook. Last night it emerged that Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. Leicestershire Police, who disagree with the decision not to charge Janner having investigated him for the past two years, have admitted they may contact the House of Lords about the letter. MailOnline revealed yesterday that at least 19 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including ten in the past year.

"A father who was arrested for using medical cannabis on his critically ill two-year-old daughter has pleaded for the government to legalise the drug as her health continues to decline. After hearing positive stories about the benefits of using the controversial treatment, the 32-year-old Cairns man decided to give cannabis oil to his daughter who is battling a rare form of cancer called neuroblastoma. Despite his claims that it improved her condition, the father, who cannot be named for legal reasons but has been nicknamed 'Fearless Father', was charged with administering a dangerous drug to a minor and was refused access to his sick daughter. Now he has spoken out in the hope that he can persuade the government to rethink their cannabis laws and drop the charges against him. Scroll down for video . The father has been charged for treating his 2-year-old daughter with medical cannabis oil . ‘My daughter’s got a 50 per cent survival rate, it’s pretty confronting', he told Channel 10. ‘Each day that ticks over is essentially children suffering as well as my daughter,' he said while talking about legalising medical cannabis. The little girl, who was diagnosed with the deadly disease shortly before Christmas, has an 11cm cancerous growth which is putting pressure on her internal organs. Just last week the toddlers condition took a turn for the worse. The young child has a high temperature, an infection and has fluid in her lungs. ‘She couldn't really move, I would just show her videos from home. I was crying the whole time because I don’t see her enough,' the desperate father said. 'That’s been the hardest thing not being there to support her and for her to see me and give her my love and care.' He appeared in court in January, where he was granted the right to visit his daughter, having previously been refused access after he was charged. When asked by Ten News if he thought he was a criminal, the father said 'absolutely not' and made it clear that all he wanted was for his daughter to get better. The young girl’s mother, who is estranged from the father, does not agree with his actions and the method of treatment he chose to use on their daughter. The father is reportedly estranged from the two-year-old's mother and she has made it very clear that she does not support his actions. She doesn't believe there's been an improvement in her daughter's condition. The adorable little girl was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer shortly before Christmas . He has relocated to Brisbane to be with his daughter during her treatment and is living out of a suitcase. For several weeks now, the father has been unable to see his daughter as she wasn't in the hospital. On his team's Facebook page it was revealed that it took police nearly three months to approve a supervisor for times that the little girl is not in hospital. 'The hospital have defaulted to previous orders from 2013 because they were given no choice in the absence of an agreement between [the child's] parents, which means that [the father] gets to spend 10 hours a week with his child IF she is in hospital,' the Facebook page called 'Fearless Father said. '[The father's] family, who love [the child] very much are also excluded from her life unless they are able to visit during [the father's] visits.' Two-year-old has an 11cm cancerous growth which is putting pressure on her internal organs . In January the dad was desperate to find a solution to his daughter's pain and administered the medical cannabis oil mixed  with coconut, to increase her rate of survival. 'My aim was to create an alkaline climate in her body, provide a nutrient dense diet, alkaline water, essential oil therapy and a healing environment of fun and positivity,' he said. 'Her cancer ridden little body was alive again. [My daughter] had almost instant quality of life,' he said. 'She would say “Daddy, tummy's not sore"". She would be able to eat like a champion and began to gain weight,' 'Her energy was up and she wanted to go outside with me instead of lay on her back with legs curled up. Her skin colour came back, her eyes were sparkling again,' the father has said. The girl's mother  is at odds with the father over his treatment options for their daughter . However, according to him, his daughter is now struggling to breath on her own and is having seizures following her withdrawal from the cannabis oil. 'She has spiralled downhill since she lost her daddy and oil treatment. I pray that I will see her again one way,' he said. He appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates court in January charged with possession of a dangerous drug and administering a dangerous drug to a minor under the age of 16. As part of his bail he has now been allowed access to his daughter in hospital, however there needs to be a supervisor in the room with him. A group of people holding placards  turned out at the court in support of the father and to protest against his arrest. After hearing positive stories about the benefits of cannabis oil, the father decided to give it to his daughter . The father, who worked as an IT professional with the Catholic Education Department, was left devastated when he was unable to log on to the work system after having his Blue Card revoked. Having sent numerous emails to the Education Department asking for permission to take 12 months carer leave with no response, he was shocked at their decision. He received a letter in the post to say his Blue Card had been revoked, claiming the change in his police information meant his employer must not continue to employ him. However the Catholic Education Department  has made it clear that they support him and this was merely a legality. '[The father] is still employed by Catholic Education and is currently on paid leave,' they said. She was diagnosed with the deadly disease shortly before Christmas 2014 and her parents have been told she has a fifty per cent chance of survival . They said he is free to speak to them regarding his employment and can access their employee assistance program. Since the excruciating decision was made to ban the father from seeing his dying daughter, he has set up a campaign to raise awareness of his situation. The dad received good news as a result of the campaign, when he was granted permission to contact the hospital on a daily basis to be updated on his daughter's condition. The petition has attracted worldwide attention and over 200,000 supporters have now joined his campaign in an effort to legalise cannabis. The two-year-old tot's parents are in dispute over the administering of medical cannabis to cure her cancer . He argued that he 'deserves to have his parental rights to see his child reinstated, the charges against him dropped by a court and the right to decide the treatment options for his own child.' 'There is ample evidence to show that medical cannabis has many beneficial effects for cancer patients without the harmful side effects and other associated risks of current drug treatments,' he said. A fund has been set up in the two-year-old's name and is in the hands of his mother. He said all money raised from the account will be used for his daughter's ongoing journey and recovery. The NSW government recently announced there will be a range of clinical trials administered to test the benefits of medical marijuana. 'Medical Cannabis oil is an amazing healer and needs to be made available for anyone in need.' the father said. 'My goal is the have these charges thrown out. [The girl] needs her Daddy by her side.' The Medical Cannabis Users Association is holding a vigil this week out the front of the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in support of the father. The dad argues that he 'deserves to have his parental rights to see his child reinstated, the charges against him dropped by a court and the right to decide the treatment options for his own child' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","A Cairns man faces court after giving his daughter medical cannabis oil .

"A couple of months ago they were a struggling comedy sketch group trying to make ends meet. And now the three Australian models whose video of themselves miming along to Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody went viral have travelled to the US to make appearances on chat shows. Their original video, 'Bohemian Carsody' and the follow-up, 'Mime Through Time,' have now garnered a staggering 260 million views across several social media platforms including YouTube and Facebook. Scroll down for video . Hitting the big time: Shae-Lee Shackleford, 28, Lana Kington, 25, Madison Lloyd, 27 were interview on The Ellen Show . Lifelong dream: Shackleford revealed that 'Be on Ellen' was on her diary list of '100 things I want to do before I die' Shae-Lee Shackleford, 28, Lana Kington, 25, Madison Lloyd, 27, are quickly capitalising on their success, booking appearances on The Ellen show and Good Morning America this week. The trio were interviewed by Ellen De Generes on Tuesday, and revealed that the moment fulfilled a lifelong dream. Shackleford told the daytime host that she wrote a list of '100 things to do before I die' in her diary in 2011. Number five on the list was to 'Be on Ellen'. Live miming: The trio performed a live version of their latest video Mime Through Time . Quick change! The girls had to quickly don wigs and costumes to pull off the sketch in real life . TV stars: The girls were pictured filming a segment for Good Morning America in Times Square on Wednesday . Hi mum! Shae, Lana and Madison have hit the big time, appearing to audiences of millions in the US . The comedy group to Ellen that they had been struggling to make ends meet a year ago when they came up with the idea of filming themselves in their car miming to music. In March, their parody of Bohemian Rhapsody went viral, quickly racking up millions of hits on YouTube  and attracting the attention of Queen guitarist Brian May, who contacted the girls to say he was a fan. SketchShe were even credited by Billboard magazine for causing a 261 per cent surge in streaming of the original track. Their next video weeks later has surpassed the views of Bohemian Carsody. Mime Through Time, which sees the girls change costumes in quick succession as they mime to hit songs from the 1940s through to today, currently has 21.66 million hits on YouTube and 27.9 million on Facebook alone. During their appearance on Elle, Shackleford, Kington, and Lloyd performed a shortened version of Mime Through Time live. Next up was in interview on Good Morning America - both shows attract international audiences in the millions, and are sure to raise SketchShe's profile significantly. Viral: The girls rose to fame for their YouTube videos which see them miming to songs in their car . Nude road trip: In their latest video, Mime Through Time, they appear naked in one scene to parody Mile Cyrus' Wrecking Ball . Sensations: SketchShe's videos have so far been viewed 260 million times across social media . Earlier this month the comedy trio spoke to Daily Mail Australia about their sudden rise to fame. 'We had no idea it would have such an incredible response,' Shackleford said. 'The fact that we've had people writing to us from around the world... I don't think there's been a country or continent that hasn't reached out and written to us to say they loved it.' She told DMA that the reason she thinks they've struck a chord with such a global fan base is that their song choice was so relatable, people love the song, it transcends the age and at some point in time everyone has had a 'rock out' to it. Mime Through Time: Their second hit video also features them dresses in Sixties clothing to mime to 'Help' by The Beatles . Britney baby: A 'Baby one more time' scene pokes fun at Spears' 2007 meltdown . Elvis in the house: Elvis's 'Hound Dog' sees them mimicking the King . The women met through a shared model agency, but say their aim is to break convention and go against how good-looking women are seen by being a bit 'crazy' and - gasp - funny. 'Unlike what might be synonymous with an attractive girl, we want to be crazy, let our hair down, and break the rules a bit,' she said. 'But we still like to wear make-up and dress up - we just want be able to make fun of what we do while empowering women to be comfortable in their own skin.' Getting thrifty: Fur coats and bling showcased in the mime of Macklemore's 'Thrift Shop' Painting the town: Face paint featured as  key costume in Gotye's 'Somebody that I used to know' Going ghetto: Gangster moves and flipped up hoods for Dr.Dre and Snoop Dogg's 'The Next Episode' Shackleford admits that one scene in Mime Through Time (which was filmed in the car of her dad's back drive way) was a risky one. The girls appear naked to parody Miley Cyrus' Wrecking Ball. 'When I first told mum she said ""oooh, I don't know"" but then when they saw it they cracked up and  think it's a great joke... My mum was more shocked by the fact I looked so much like my brother in the slim shady scene... which I'm not sure is a good thing.' The girls only use the bare essentials to produce the clip. 'The first time we had a bra in the car so we taped the iPhone to it and propped it up that way, but this time we upgraded to a block of wood, but it's still very dodgy,' said Shackleford.","Australian comedy trio SketchShe went viral with their car videos .

"A life coach and author with a curvy figure and dyed black locks has been dubbed the Romanian Kim Kardashian. Alexandra Harra, 28, who now lives in Miami, has a BA degree in creative writing and classics. She now works as a professional life coach, a writer for the Huffington Post and an author of The Karma Queens' Guide to Relationships. But when she was persuaded to pose on the cover of the Romanian Playboy, she suddenly found it wasn't her university education that people were interested in. Scroll down for video . Selfie queen: Alexandra Harra has been dubbed 'The Romanian Kim Kardashian' and even shares the same love of selfies . All about the booty: The life coach turned model enjoys showing off her curves in tight fitting clothes . Since appearing on the infamous cover she has graced the pages of countless glossies in her homeland. The model, who formerly had long peroxide locks, recently took to the bottle to make her similarity with the reality star, married to Kanye West, even more striking. With her dyed black hair, she now lays claim to the title of the Romanian Kim Kardashian. Harra is already a bigger success than the celebrity in one way, as her derriere apparently measures 43 inches, while Kardashian's is just 40 inches. She said: ‘Someone in Romania noticed that my bottom size, at 109cm, is larger than Kim Kardashian's at 101 cm. 'Now I'm in the paper all the time as the Romanian Kim Kardashian.’ Curves galore: Alexandra Harra recently dyed her hair from blonde to black to look more like Kim . Meow: Harra states on Instagram that she loves cats, evident in these selfies . The decision to dye her hair black has been well received by fans, boosting her online popularity. Whilst she now lives in Miami, she said that when she returns to her native Romania she is treated like a celebrity. ‘We are the Kardashians of Romania. We're just as controversial as them. 'When I arrive anywhere in Romania, all the cameras are after me, the paparazzi are after me too, they don't expect to see a body like this and a booty like that.’ Alexandra also uses her suggestive shots as a vehicle for her life coaching advice. On one Instagram snap, she wrote: 'Change doesn't come by accident. Change comes by will.' Next to one picture, in which she posed side-on, she posted a Bible quote from Romans, 5: 3-5: 'But we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame.' And maybe Kim should look out, as according to one picture, Alexandra believes in the power of positive thinking. She wrote: 'What you wish, you can manifest. Always.' High flyer: As well as being a business woman and author, Alexandra claims that she is treated like an A-list celebrity in her native Romania . Cover girl: Alexandra has appeared on the cover of Playboy Romania, as well as in many more magazines in her native country . Alexandra dyed her hair black to cement her claim of being ‘The Romanian Kim Kardashian’ ‘In Romania women are supposed to be very thin, they're supposed to not have curves. That's what they think is beautiful. That to me is outrageous.’ And it seems that Harra’s move to become Romania’s answer to Kim Kardashian is already paying off. She owns a Mercedes S 550 2015 model worth £95,000 and a Mercedes CLS 550 worth £63,00. Yet Alexandra's mum, Carmen, who she runs her business with, thinks her daughter is unique. ‘My daughter is being labelled as the blonde version of Kim Kardashian. 'But we don't try to imitate anyone, we're just ourselves.’ Alexandra runs a psychology company with mum, Carmen, who is also supportive of her modelling career .

"Sarcasm is often described as the lowest form of wit, but it seems you need the right kind of wits in the first place to be able to recognise it. Neuroscientists have identified the area of the brain that is the key to picking up on when someone is being sarcastic. They found that people with damage to the right sagittal stratum - a bundle of white matter that lies between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures in the brain - are unable to detect sarcasm. Stroke patients with damage in the sagittal stratum in the right hemisphere of the brain (shown in the image above) were far poorer at detecting sarcasm when listening to sentences, according to the new research . Stroke survivors often suffer damage to this area of their brain and struggle to recognise when family and friends are being sarcastic. According to researchers at John Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore, the level of damage to this area of the brain seems to directly affect a persons ability to detect sarcasm. Used effectively, sarcasm can provide a devastating put down. But it turns out that it can also be a great motivator. Employees who have to put up with a sarcastic colleague or boss are more creative than those who don’t, a study has found. Researchers claim that being exposed to sarcasm required more ‘cognitive complexity’, or the ability to see things from more than one angle. The inherent humour in the comments also defused the tension that comes with anger. The study will surprise anybody whose boss relies on mocking his employees to get the best out of them. Professor Argye Hillis, a neurologist at John Hopkins Medical School who oversaw the study, said: 'Failure to recognize sarcasm can lead to important miscommunications. 'Few previous studies have identified brain lesions associated with impaired recognition of sarcasm. ' Percent damage to the sagittal stratum had the greatest weight and was the only independent predictor of sarcasm recognition.' Even for healthy people sarcasm can be hard to detect and some cultures use it far more than others. British comedy, for example, has a reputation for being notoriously sarcastic. Some characters like Blackadder, Chandler Bing in Friends and the cartoon teenager Daria, use it regularly. Sarcasm is well known as a complex form of communication as it requires the listener to understand the literal meaning of what someone is saying. They then also have to be able to detect the variation in pitch, stress on certain words, changes in pauses and lengthened syllables that make it differ from sincere speech. The popular Blackadder comedy series (above) tapped into the British love of sarcasm as a form of humour . During their study, which is published in the journal Neurocase, the researchers took fMRI scans of the brains of 24 stroke patients while they listened to 40 sentences of sincere or sarcastic speech. The patients were asked to identify whether a sentence was sarcastic. The researchers found that thsoe who performed least well in the tests tended to have damage to the right sagittal stratum. Five of the participants were found to have significant damage here were only able to correctly identify 22 per cent of the sarcastic comments. Chandler Bing, played by Matthew Perry (centre) was often annoyingly sarcastic in the hit US sitcom Friends, but his witticisms were often lost on his notoriously literal flatmate Joey, played by Matt LeBlanc (far left) Those that did not have damage to that structure were able to identify 50 per cent. According to LiveScience, Professor Hillis said that in the general population, most people should be able to identify 90 per cent of sarcastic comments. She said the findings could be used to help patients who have suffered brain damage regain the ability to recognise sarcastic cues and help families communicate to their loved ones more effectively. She told LiveScience:'Family and friends can be counseled to avoid sarcasm to prevent misunderstandings.'","Right sagittal stratum of brain is key to recognising sarcastic comments .

"A  father is desperately searching for his 13-year-old daughter, who hasn't been seen since last Thursday. Melissa Borg left her Baulkham Hills home in north-west Sydney at 7:30am on Thursday in her school uniform and made her way to The Hills Sports High School in Seven Hills. However, the Year 9 student never made it to class and after her father found no sign of her when he searched their house following work, he reported his daughter missing to police. 13-year-old Melissa Borg (pictured) has been missing from her Baulkham Hills home since last Thursday . Castle Hill Police have been assisting Melissa's family with the investigation into her disappearance ever since. Melissa is described by police as being 150cm with a slim build, long brown hair and brown eyes and was last seen wearing her school uniform - a dark blue skirt and a pale blue blouse. Police have questioned her school friends about her mysterious disappearance, however they have so far been unable to find the child. Melissa's parents are extremely concerned at her out of character actions and are worried about her young age. The teenager left home at 7:30AM and made her way to The Hills Sports High School in Seven Hills . Speaking to news.com.au Inspector David Hogg said  police were holding out hope that Melissa was with friends. 'With any 13-year-old that goes missing for this time frame it's serious but our hope is she's with some friends and just doesn't want to contact her family,' Inspector Hogg said. 'If that is the case, whatever issue she has, we'd hope that she'd at least get in contact with police so we can get in contact with her family and let them know she is okay.' Inspector Hogg told the publication that there were unconfirmed sightings of the 13-year-old in the Merrylands area. However Melissa never made it to class and her father alerted police to her disappearance when he arrived home from work and she was nowhere to be found . Melissa's family and friends have taken to their Facebook pages to share a photo of the teenager in her school uniform. A picture posted online by Melissa's aunt Tricia Carlow has already been shared over 2,000 times around the Sydney area. 'My niece Melissa Borg is missing from the Baulkham Hills area since Thursday afternoon 02nd April 2015,' the caption said. 'Can you please share this around and keep an eye out for her. We at least need to know that she is safe and well.'","A 13-year-old girl has gone missing from her Sydney home .

June after a quip about a French Jewish singer that included an . implied reference to concentration camp ovens. But last week Mr Le Pen said he had 'never regretted' his comments about the Second World War gas chambers, which is likely to revive accusations that the far-Right party remains anti-Semitic. Mr Le Pen, who is still an MEP, said: 'The gas chambers were a detail of the war, unless we admit that the war was a detail of the gas chambers!' During an interview on BFM TV in Paris, Mr Le Pen said 'the truth' should 'not shock anyone', and that historical reality should not be used to portray him as anti-Jewish. 'This case was manipulated against me by introducing a hint of anti-Semitism,' said Mr Le Pen. 'I challenge anyone to name an anti-Semitic phrase in my political life. Yesterday, Jean-Marie Le Pen was quoted as calling France's Spanish-born Prime Minister Manuel Valls (right)  'the immigrant' and defending Philippe Petain, leader of the war-time government that cooperated with Nazi Germany (left) 'Repeatedly questioned about the Holocaust, Mr Le Pen said: 'War is horrible, you know, a piece of shrapnel that tears your stomach, a bomb that decapitates you, a room in which you are asphyxiated, it's all pretty disgusting, it's true.' Following the comments, Ms Le Pens said she 'deeply disagreed' with her 'deliberately provocative' father. Speaking to the website of Le Figaro daily, she said: 'I deeply disagree with him. 'I take note of what he said but I believe that those coming over to vote for us understand what is going on. He is being deliberately provocative.' Ms Le Pen's party regularly wins up to 25 per cent of the popular vote at local and regional elections, and Ms Le Pen intends to stand for the job of president in 2017. Under her leadership, the party has deepened its roots across France, winning outright control of some town halls and getting its officials elected onto the councils of 'departements', broadly the equivalent of counties. Polls suggest she could make it into the second-round run-off of a presidential election but is unlikely to win. Marine accused her father of committing 'political suicide' after he defended his past comment that Nazi gas chambers were a 'detail of history' last week . While other FN officials have been stripped of their party membership for racism, there has been no move to bar Jean-Marie Le Pen from a party of which he still holds the title of honorary president. He is popular with many FN members and will stand as a candidate in December's regional elections, despite having been convicted on numerous occasions of being anti-Jewish and for 'inciting racial hatred'. He has regularly made the comment about the Holocaust, telling the European Parliament in 2009: 'I just said that the gas chambers were a detail of Second World War history, which is clear.' Mr Le Pen was first convicted by a Munich court in 1999 for 'minimising the Holocaust' after telling a German far-right meeting that Nazi concentration camps and the gas chambers are 'what one calls a detail'. He has had a string of other convictions, including ones for violence and was briefly banned from being an MEP in 2003 following a physical attack on a French Socialist MEP. Jews have complained of increasing anti-Semitism in France, much of it stirred up by far-right activists. The Nazi Holocaust extended to France between 1940 and 1944, when thousands of Jews were entrained from cities like Paris to the German gas chambers.","Marine Le Pen accused  father Jean-Marie of committing 'political suicide'

Co-founder Nina Leykind said: 'It's like the Baskin Robbins of mascara. Getting it right is about the combination. One doesn’t work without the other. 'Even if you have an amazing brush for you, if it’s put together with the wrong formula then it doesn’t work.' Foundation, too, is set to see a surge in personalisation.

"British Airways suffered three plane diversions in just over 24 hours. A medical emergency and two technical issues meant delays for hundreds of passengers on aircraft that were all bound for Heathrow over the weekend. An Airbus A321 from Baku, Azerbaijan to London was forced to return back to where it had set out from only 11 minutes after a 9.20pm local time departure on Friday evening. There were three diversions in just over 24 hours of BA planes over the weekend (file photo) Despite BA denying an engine fire forced one of it's London-bound planes to return to Baku, Azerbaijan, customers believed different on board . The #BA144 was carrying 92 passengers and crew. There were reports at the time that the pilot had alerted ground staff of an engine fire. However a BA spokesperson denied there was a fire, telling MailOnline Travel: 'The pilots decided to return to the airport after reports of a technical issue. 'Our flight crew are highly trained and the aircraft landed as normal. Our customers on this flight were rebooked on alternative services.' Flight BA198 had set out from Mumbai, India for London at around 1.30pm local time on Saturday when it took a holding pattern above Turkey, and landed at Istanbul. One passenger on the flight told airlive.net that 'the engine was leaking and there was not enough fuel to get back to London.' A passenger on board the Mumbai to London flight reported of a problem with the engine . Of the incident, a spokesperson for BA said: 'The pilot diverted as a precaution after a report of a minor technical issue. 'We despatched another aircraft at the earliest opportunity and provided accommodation for our customers who then continued their journey to London.' However writing on the Aviation Herald, Dr David Crome said: 'BA flew out the replacement plane, but then they delayed boarding for two hours due to a blocked toilet. Three planes into Heathrow were diverted meaning long delays for passengers at the weekend . 'Numerous passengers missed connecting flights and no email or text communications sent out to us, or any mention of how to make any compensation claims.' Passengers were put up in hotels and flew out the following morning, an overall delay of 21 hours. Finally, a medical emergency saw the third flight in 24 hours - flight #BA76 from Luanda to London - diverted to Paris Charles de Gaulle after leaving the Angolan City just before midnight local time on Saturday evening. 'The flight to Luanda landed in Paris to ensure that an unwell customer received medical treatment, said BA.' The unscheduled landing in Istanbul of the flight out of Mumbai worried some Twitter users . The spokesperson continued: 'We operate up to 800 flights per day and there are occasions when minor incidents result in a delay to our customers’ journey. 'We apologise for any inconvenience caused when this happens but the safety and well-being of our customers and crew is always our first priority. 'None of our flights were forced to make emergency landings. In the unrelated incidents, our flight crews took the appropriate action to divert due to minor technical issues or as a result of a customer being unwell on board.'","All incidents concerned flights coming into London Heathrow .

"Ventura County prosecutors dropped their case against a woman accused of killing her Olympic medalist husband then turned around and filed new charges on Friday. The move is an apparent attempt to delay the trial of 57-year-old Jane Laut in the 2009 killing of Dave Laut, the Ventura County Star reports. It came after a judge denied for the third time a request to delay trial. Jane Laut had been free on bail but was rearrested in the court hallway after the hearing. Double jeopardy: Jane Laut was arrested and charged in 2009 (left) for the murder of her husband David Laut. The charges were dropped and then refiled immediately on Friday in a Ventura County courtroom . Murder? The couple were high school sweethearts married 29 years. Prosecutors say laut shot dead her husband outside their California home the night of August 28, 2009 . Self-defense? Laut claims she wrestled a gun from her abusive husband after he became intoxicated and said he was going to kill her after he killed their 10-year-old son and their dogs . Her attorney Ron Bamieh called the prosecution's move 'unprofessional' and 'pretty much unprecedented' in a murder case. 'Complete chicken s***. It's just complete chicken s*** practice of law,' Bamieh said outside the courtroom. Her husband, who won a bronze medal in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, was shot several times in the head on the night of August 28, 2009 in their yard in Oxnard, a coastal city 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles. He was declared dead at the scene. Jane Laut's attorney called it a 'self-defense case,' apparently contradicting police reports of her statements at the time of the killing. They were high school sweethearts and married for 29 years. Jane Laut had told investigators immediately after the shooting that he went to the backyard to check out suspicious sounds, and she heard shots fired, police said. Police initially said Laut may have been killed by prowlers, but a few days later said the killing was not random. Bamieh, who was hired by Jane Laut shortly after the killing, told the Ventura County Star after the arrest that she wrestled the gun from an abusive husband after he became intoxicated and said he was going to kill her after he killed their 10-year-old son and their dogs. 'She was left with no choice but to defend herself and her child with that gun,' Bamieh told the newspaper. 'It's not a question of who the shooter was, it's a question of the intent of the shooter.' Laut's trial had already been postponed multiple times. When the judge denied a motion from the prosecution that the trial be continued until June, prosecutors chose to drop the charges and refile. Deputy District Attorney Rameen Minoui said his witnesses would not be available for trial in the current window, People reported, and he accused the defense of withholding discovery. David Laut, who won a bronze medal in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, was shot several times in the head on the night of August 28, 2009 .","Jane Laut, 57, stands accused of shooting dead her bronze medalist shot-putter husband Dave Laut in August 2009 .

"A student has become an online sensation after powering his Cambridge college to glory in the final of University Challenge. Ted Loveday managed to answer 10 starter questions in the last round of the BBC quiz show, helping Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge defeat Magdalen College, Oxford. Viewers were astounded by his general knowledge prowess - but the law student has now admitted that he had help from some unlikely sources. Scroll down for video . Star: Ted Loveday has powered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge to victory in University Challenge . Mr Loveday revealed after his team's triumph that they had revised for the programme by watching YouTube videos and researching possible questions on Wikipedia. Gonville and Caius won the University Challenge title by amassing 225 points against Magdalen in the final, broadcast on BBC Two on Monday night. The team's victory was largely thanks to Mr Loveday, who provided the correct response to 10 'starter for 10' questions posed by presenter Jeremy Paxman. His range of expert topics ranged from foreign languages to economics and politics, via science and classical music. In the wake of the team's win, University Challenge viewers took to the internet to express their admiration for Mr Loveday - and the cable-knit jumpers he sported on screen. Team: The Cambridge students thrashed their opponents from Magdalen College, Cambridge . Quizmaster: The BBC Two show is hosted by Jeremy Paxman, notorious for his aggressive putdowns . 1) 'This long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we're all dead.' These are the words of which economist? 2) 'They illustrate the temper of a pre-revolutionary age, when there is widespread desire for moderate reform.' These words of Bertrand Russell refer to which two figures of the northern Renaissance born respectively in London and Rotterdam? 3) What five-letter word means a stupid or silly woman in Mexican Spanish, a university canteen in German and in the English-speaking world an organisation founded in 1946 for people with high IQs? 4) During the 20th century, which Conservative Prime Minister's cabinet included that party's previous and subsequent Prime Ministers, both of whom served for the whole of its period in office, the former as Foreign Secretary and the latter as Secretary of State for Education? 5) 'The first known instance of the application of algorithmic thinking to a field outside logic and mathematics.' These words refer to a grammar of which language by the Gandharian scholar Panini? 6) Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter is an autobiographical work by which French author? It recounts her stifling and respectable upbringing and how she revolted against it at the Sorbonne with Jean-Paul Sartre. 7) Inspired by the artworks of Viktor Hartmann, 'The Gnome', 'The Hut on Fowl's Legs' and 'The Great Gate of Kiev' are among the 10 movements that comprise which suite by Mussorgsky? 8) John F Kennedy's statement that 'mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind' is an example of what figure of speech named after the 22nd letter of the Greek alphabet? 9) From the Greek for 'unguent', what five-letter term denotes a complex of molten silicates with water and gases formed within the upper mantle of the earth? 10) Meaning 'said only once', what two-word Greek term denotes a word or word-form that is recorded only once in a text, in the work of a particular author, or in a body of literature? Scroll down to see the answers . Matt Stephens wrote on Twitter, 'Cable-knit jumper in excelsis,' while Jack Clayton added: 'After that performance, Loveday is going to be fighting off the groupies with a trident.' Paul Coxon, a Cambridge physicist, made a reference to the contestant's constant sips of water, joking: 'Loveday needs to drink so much water because he IS ON FIRE.' Mr Loveday even made an appearance on a blog called 'University Challenge Cuties', which said he was 'the definition of a UC cutie'. Speaking after his team's victory, Mr Loveday revealed that he had used the internet to finesse his quizzing skills ahead of filming - and suggested that University Challenge is not as intellectual as it might seem. 'We'd put aside regular times to sit down together in the college bar, watch past episodes on YouTube and try to shout the answers at the telly before any of the contestants buzzed,' he told the Gonville and Caius website. That was really helpful for improving our reaction speeds. 'Sometimes question-setters really like a particular area and they'll keep coming back to it. For instance, they're a bit obsessed with Pre-Raphaelite paintings, so we binged on some Wikipedia articles to make sure we were familiar with them. It paid off because we had a whole picture round on the Pre-Raphaelites! 'University Challenge isn't about deep understanding - it's about very wide, superficial knowledge combined with quick recall.' He also revealed that Jeremy Paxman treats the show's contestants generously despite his fierce reputation - Mr Loveday said: 'He knows you're just students and doesn't expect you to be as tough as the politicians he interviews. 'Having said that, he can be needlessly harsh in his put-downs to losing teams.' The quiz champion offered some advice for other students hoping to follow in his footsteps, saying that the key to success is simply watching the show and looking up the answers when necessary. 'I know some of the questions on the show can seem fairly intimidating and high-brow,' he said. 'But there's no magic secret to it - all the answers will be out there on Wikipedia somewhere. 'If you find a question daunting, look it up online and read about the answer. Next time it comes up, it won't be daunting any more.' Mr Loveday grew up in west London and went to Latymer Upper School, a leading private school in Hammersmith. This year was not the first time he tried to appear on University Challenge - last year he applied for the Gonville and Caius team, but did not make the cut. He follows in the footsteps of other notable champions such as Gail Trimble, who impressed even Mr Paxman when she captained Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 2009. Almost: Stephen Fry came second in the 1980 edition of University Challenge with Queens' College, Cambridge . For many University Challenge contestants, winning the show is a prelude to a successful career. But an unlucky few never reach the same heights again, and end up unable to make the most of their talents - or worse. Tony Gillham, who won the show in 2003 as a member of the Birkbeck College team, struggled with alcoholism after his victory. He said that he was even drunk while competing in the quiz - and suggested that winning was a poisoned chalice, because it convinced him that he could function properly despite his drinking. John Burke, a champion in 1999, ended up working as a postman despite his intellectual firepower. Six years ago he told a documentary: 'I'm certainly capable of a lot more than just delivering bits of paper. I've got a lot of other capabilities and I'm not really fulfilling my potential.' Champions to have found success after their University Challenge days include Kwasi Kwarteng and David Lidington, both Conservative MPs, who each won the contest while studying at Cambridge. Comedian Stephen Fry came close to joining their ranks in the quiz elite when he was part of the Queens' College, Cambridge team which came second in 1980. THE ANSWERS: 1) John Maynard Keynes; 2) Erasmus and Thomas More; 3) Mensa; 4) Ted Heath; 5) Sanskrit; 6) Simone de Beauvoir; 7) Pictures of an Exhibition; 8) Chiasmus; 9) Magma; 10) Hapax legomenon .","Ted Loveday led Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge to the University Challenge title this week .

"An inventor has solved the problem of the millions of coffee capsules that are thrown away each year after use - with sugar-coated pods that dissolve in water. The soaring popularity of home coffee machines has led to a increasing amount of waste generated by caffeine lovers. Now, designer Eason Chow believes his innovative new product could be the solution - and found inspiration from the sugar-coated sweets dispensed from gumball machines. It involves covering coffee granules in milk powder then dipping the whole lot in sugar to create a revolutionary capsule with no waste created whatsoever. Taking inspiration from sugar-coated sweets in gumball machines, Eason Chow believes his dissolvable pods solve the problem of the rising waste generated from coffee capsules . Mr Chow, 25, from Singapore, has also made a stackable coffee maker to use the capsules with . Mr Chow says the sugar coating will come in varying thickness and flavourings to suit all tastes - and he has also made a stackable coffee maker to use the capsules with. He came up with the idea after realising how much waste packaging is generated from coffee capsules each year. The product, called Droops, is still in the early stages, but Mr Chow says the coffee pods will cost around £4 for a pack of 20 and the machine will cost around £80. The 25-year-old, from Singapore, said: 'Droops Coffee Maker redefines the experience of processing coffee in conventional coffee makers. 'The inspiration for the project came from the observation of how much unnecessary waste of packaging is made from coffee machines which use capsules. The product, called Droops, is still in the early stages. The pods will cost around £4 for a pack of 20 and the machine will cost around £80 . Mr Chows says he wanted to incorporate an element of surprise and fun in the design. Pictured: Sketches of the Droop in process . 'This led to me thinking of how can the process be redefined and be fun.' He explained he drew 'memories to my childhood' and 'the surprising and fun element of dispensing sweets from a gumball machine'. 'Therefore, I decided to adapt this element of surprise and fun into the design and even personalising the coffee pods with different possibilities to heighten the desire of tasting different coffee types.' He added that most coffee machines on the market are very industrialised and made to process coffee out of convenience. 'They neglect the importance of the visualising and the social responsibility through its usage,' he said. 'Droops coffee maker aims to be a benchmark that identifies and exemplifies the importance of these elements to fun coffee drinking.' The rise of coffee machines for home-use has led to a new waste problem that was virtually non-existent a few years ago thanks to the single-use pods to make beverages. Normally, these pods are made from recyclable materials - such as aluminium or plastic - but they are rarely disposed of in an environmentally-friendly manner. According to Zero Waste Europe, an estimated 10 billion coffee capsules were sold worldwide in 2010, a tenth of which was in Italy alone. But in the coffee-loving country, around 12,000 tonnes of pods that could have been recycled were disposed in landfills. As a result of the rising waste problem, Nespresso launched an initiative to encourage customers to recycle their capsules. And Tassimo is aiming to save their TDISCs and outer flow wrap packaging from going to landfill by partnering with TerraCycle. There are 323 public drop-off points in the Tassimo Brigade across the UK - and more than seven million pieces of Tassimo waste have been saved from going to a UK landfill. As an eco-friendly innovator, TerraCycle recycles the collected used Tassimo TDISCs and packaging into useful products.

"We spent £400 on a 1940s loo - it took us four months to find one! Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B. She says: . When Nigel and I met as students in 1993 we soon discovered we both absolutely loved the 1940s. I had a beautiful mirror from the period that still hangs over our fireplace. We love the style because there’s such an attention to detail in everything from the handles through to the surfaces. When we moved in together after university, we’d scour the local North London markets for 1940s pieces while checking out bric-a-brac shops and antique dealers on holiday. I’ve always found other people are more interested in earlier items from Victorian, Edwardian or Georgian times, so we’re usually left to take our pick. Scroll down for video . Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B . In 2011, our dreams came true when we bought a World War II airfield control tower near Wells-next-the-Sea for £295,000. It had been used as accommodation or a grain store since the war so needed a lot of work — we spent nearly £200,000 getting it back to how it used to be. We stripped out the laminated flooring and scraped off the modern wallpaper, replacing it with original parquet flooring from a Sheffield school, and painting the walls. The bathrooms were the biggest source of stress. We once bought a cast-iron bath on eBay only to discover it was still installed. We had to pay someone £250 to drive up with pipe cutters and spanners to dig it out of the bathroom. But it was worth it. Another time we bought a pink bathroom suite then discovered the toilet wasn’t of the period. It took us four months of calling reclamation yards and googling to find the one we wanted. It cost £400 from a reclamation yard in the West Country — the most we’ve paid for something. While life has been made easier by the arrival of eBay, it does have added stresses. We spent New Year’s Eve two years ago desperately driving around trying to find a signal so I could bid on some concertina dividing doors. Eventually we managed it with 15 seconds to spare and got them for £200. They said: 'We’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It’s been great to bring this great tower back to life' Our biggest expense was the windows, as control towers have so many. We spent around £45,000 having custom-made replicas, but ours are thankfully double glazed. It’s taken us three years to do up the tower, and while the B&B part is finished, we’re still working on our private living areas. I invited my ten-year-old nephew to stay and showed him photos of how it had been when we moved in. Seeing all the modern flooring and wallpaper, he asked: ‘Auntie Claire, why have you wrecked your house?’ We’re so pleased with the results though. My favourite piece is an original Anglepoise workbench lamp in our kitchen, which came from one of the metal huts in the grounds. And the enamel fireplaces cost £200 each, but they add to the historical feel of the building. We’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It’s been great to bring this great tower back to life. My biggest weakness is 50s cocktail bars - at one stage I had six . Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk. She says: . I’ve always loved the flamboyance of the 1950s — they were so kitsch and glamorous. Interiors of the era are full of texture, colours and shapes, so there’s always something exciting, quirky or beautiful to look at in our home. Nigel and I have been together for 11 years, but we’ve shared a house only for the past three. We originally had our own homes, and mine was full of 1950s memorabilia, but his wasn’t. So, luckily, Nigel gave me the go-ahead to renovate his place, where we now live, two years ago. On the outside it’s a regular 1930s semi, but inside it’s like stepping back into the 1950s. In total, the work cost about £10,000. Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk and, at one stage, had six 1950s cocktail bars (left) The most extravagant item I’ve bought is Hawaiian vintage tropical wallpaper that has a pink tropical flower and island print. I got four rolls from a specialist website for £100 each. But it’s worth it. I have found a few bargains, too, such as a 1950s pearlised pale green bedroom set for £40 from a flea market in Manchester in the early 1990s. I love it. Once I found two pink melamine chests of drawers on eBay that I just had to have. We had to head to Glasgow to collect them, but as we were going on holiday the next day, our car was being serviced. I made Nigel take the train with me and we had to lug them back ourselves — they were so heavy and awkward that we had to stand in the space between the carriages the whole way home. She said: 'I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave'. Her radio is also a blast from the past . My biggest 1950s weakness is bamboo cocktail bars because I love the Tiki, or Polynesian-style cocktail culture, which was a big part of the era. If I see a rare bamboo cocktail bar cabinet I can’t help but buy it — at one point I owned six. I’ve sold two and have one in storage, but I still have two in my lounge and one in my conservatory. They cost between £100 and £200. I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave. The TV is the only modern-looking item, I hate its appearance, but it’s great to watch a vintage movie on and keeps Nigel happy. Maybe at some point we will make a cool mid-century surround or cabinet to disguise it. I wouldn’t want my house to look like everyone else’s — that would just be boring. Yes, I know it's kitch but that's why I love the 1960s . Ursula Forbush, 48, is single, a manager for a charity and lives near Bristol. She says: . From the red glass vases and psychedelic wallpaper, to the Formica tables and G-plan dining suite, everything about my two-bedroom terrace home is a tribute to the late Sixties. I fell in love with the era as a twentysomething in the Eighties while feeling uninspired by the New Romantic music and the fashions at the time. After digging around in my mum’s record collection I realised I loved Sixties music, particularly The Beatles and Rolling Stones, and devoured books about the decade. Ursula Forbush, 48, is single. She is a manager for a charity, lives near Bristol and adores anything kitsch, spending hours running round flea markets . Covetous of the style of Pattie Boyd, Marianne Faithfull and Edie Sedgwick — Andy Warhol’s muse — I scoured the second-hand market in Leicester, where I grew up, for Sixties fashions. I have a like-minded friend who completely decorated her home in Sixties style, and I vowed to one day have my own Sixties abode. The first thing I did when I bought my home 12 years ago was to have genuine Sixties wallpaper put up. I imported a funky pink and brown swirled paper for about £20 a roll from Holland which adorns one wall of my dining room, while in the hallway there is orange flowery wallpaper from Italy, and a calming blue pattern in my bedroom. At the windows hang original Sixties curtains bought from second-hand shops. I adore anything kitsch and spend hours rummaging at auctions, car-boot sales, flea markets and in charity shops, never paying more than a few pounds. A Sixties lamp with large swirls all over the tall shade was one of the more expensive items, at £100 from eBay. She said: 'Every night I come home to my Sixties bubble, switch on my old record player, listen to some vinyl, and all the stresses of 2015 melt away' I have a record player reminiscent of a white space helmet, and there are original white fluffy flokati rugs on my lounge floor. Formica tables are scattered around the house and the walls are hung with prints of iconic paintings like the Chinese Girl by Vladimir Tretchikoff. In the kitchen is an old Kenwood mixer and Sixties crockery and glassware. I also have an orange slow cooker, plus Boots heated curlers, and hood-style hairdryer which cost £5 from a charity shop — I don’t use the hair gadgets in case they blow up. Although I don’t like modern decor and furnishings and have very little of either, I’ve had to be practical with certain items. An old twin tub wouldn’t fit in my kitchen so I’ve got a modern washing machine. And while my TV is also new, I paid more for one that’s smaller, white and in keeping with the white fibreglass Sixties table on which it sits. Every night I come home to my Sixties bubble, switch on my old record player, listen to some vinyl, and all the stresses of 2015 melt away.","Claire Nugent and Nigel Morter restored a 1940s airfield control tower and now run it as a B&B .

"The White House, sensing a legislative defeat was nigh, today said President Barack Obama would be willing to meet Congress half way and sign legislation codifying its role in processing a nuclear deal with Iran if a Senate committee axed key portions of the bill during a formal review this afternoon. Senators later voted 19-0 to give the White House some of, but not all of its asks, and left in a signature feature of the bill giving Congress the authority to approve a final deal with Iran that the White House earlier implied may have been on the chopping block. It now goes to the full Senate, where it is could pass with a veto-proof majority of more than 66 lawmakers. The House's top vote counter on Monday said lawmakers in the lower chamber would also take up the bill after their colleagues in the Senate finished the voting process. Senators voted 19-0 to give the White House some of, but not all of its asks, and left in a signature feature of the bill giving Congress the authority to approve a final deal with Iran that the White House earlier implied may have been on the chopping block . The Obama administration was in panic-mode this week, trying to strike a last-minute deal with legislators on both sides of the aisle that would satisfy its concerns with bill, which the White House had said as recently as yesterday that the president would 'absolutely' veto as written. While the legislative branch was in recess administration officials called 130 Members of Congress to try to persuade them not to act until the political framework that Iran agreed a week before firmed up. Officials ramped up their efforts in classified briefings with lawmakers today and yesterday. Among the White House's demands were that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee drop from the bill a requirement to for Iran to certify that it has not backed terrorism against Americans, cut down a 60-day 'window for Congress to look over a deal and 'clarify' that it is the president's 'decision to make' whether or not to enter into an agreement with Iran. It also said it wants legislators to promise that the bill currently under discussion 'would be the one and only mechanism for codifying precisely what the appropriate congressional oversight is into this matter.' 'If we arrived at a place where the bill that is passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with bipartisan support is essentially is a vote to vote later on congressional sanctions - not the decision about whether or not to enter into the agreement - that would certainly resolve some of the concerns we've expressed about the authority that is exercised by the President of the United States to conduct foreign policy,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. It is 'critical' Earnest said that the legislation that comes out of the Senate is bipartisan so that 'there isn't an untoward effort to insert a different provision into some sort of must-pass piece of legislation that could really gum up the works here.' 'And if presented with a compromise along the lines that I just laid out here, that would be the kind of compromise the president would be willing to sign,' he said. Earnest later indicated that the president's signature would be predicated on senators watering the bill down to just a vote to later vote on congressional sanctions and the inclusion of language that would make clear the proper role of congressional oversight. 'If the president were writing this piece of legislation it would look substantially different,' he said, noting that he didn't want to leave reporters with the impression that even in senators were 'willing to agree to this substantial number of changes that I've laid out here, that we're gonna be particularly thrilled about the legislation that emerges. 'I rather think what we would find ourselves with is the kind of compromise that the president would be willing to sign,' Earnest explained. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Bob Corker,  the author of the bill, center, shakes hands with the committee's ranking member Sen. Ben Cardin after the committee unanimously passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 . He later expressed concern that Republican members, if given a vote on the final deal, would be 'willing to flush down the toilet the best bet that we have' in favor of carrying out air raids  on Iran, as former U.S. Ambassador John Bolton has suggested. 'Only' that kind of military action 'can accomplish what is required,' Bolton said in a March 25 New York Times op-ed. 'Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.' The bill's lead sponsor, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker, during the hearing noted that as a result of 1600 Pennsylvania's last-ditch lobbying efforts, misinformation was circulating about the current language of the bill. 'This legislation is exactly the congressional review that we've been working on since day one,' he said, and had '100 percent of the integrity' senators on the committee hoped it would. Lawmakers did agree to take out the terrorism provision and to reduce the review period from 60 days to 30 days but refused to cut it out entirely. And sanctions that have been put in place, Corker explained 'cannot be lifted without the administration bringing to us every detail of the deal.' Then, he said, 'the clock will start' on the period of time Congress has to debate and decide if it wants to move ahead with a resolution of approval or disapproval - and in the meantime no sanctions can be lifted. And that's not the end of it, he explained, 'Congress stays involved.' Every 90 days, the administration would have to certify that Iran is in compliance with the accord, and if there are violations, the executive branch would have 10 days to notify Congress so it can reapply sanctions if necessary. 'So I think this puts Congress in its rightful role,' he said. The White House, sensing a legislative defeat was nigh, today said President Barack Obama would be willing to meet Congress half way and sign legislation codifying its role in processing a nuclear deal with Iran if a Senate committee axed key portions of the bill during a formal review this afternoon. In the end, the committee decided to buck the White House . Pushing back on the administration's suggestions that supporters of the Senate legislation are warmongers, Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, a key force in the bipartisan negotiations around the deal, characterized the claims as 'ridiculous' and 'offensive' during the committee meeting, . 'I’m pro-diplomacy...but I have also been strongly pro the need for congressional approval,' he posited. 'I actually think that congressional approval, in this instance under the framework that is now before us, is necessary, helpful and what the American public demands and deserves.'' Democratic Chuck Schumer, next in line for his party's top leadership role in the supper chamber, applauded Corker and ranking Democratic Senator Ben Cardin for coming to a bipartisan agreement on how to move forward. '‎I'm certainly in favor of what they've put together,' he said, throwing his support behind the bill. New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker also lent his name to the legislation this afternoon, signing on as a cosponsor. 'The United States must do everything in its power to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,' he said in a statement. 'The framework deal with Iran is an important step forward in accomplishing this goal by diplomatic means. 'But as the body that imposed sanctions on Iran, Congress has a vitally important role in any process that seeks to modify them,' he added. 'The Corker-Menendez bill sets up a reasonable mechanism for Congress to have a voice in the process that will help make any agreement with Iran as strong as possible.' Fellow New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, a namesake of the bill who temporarily stepped aside as ranking member of the committee as he deals with legal troubles, said he wanted to make clear with the committee's vote it never 'envisioned a wholesale waver' of nuclear sanctions 'without congressional input.' He was responding to Iranian leaders' affirmations last week that they would not accept a deal that does not immediately terminate sanctions. The Obama administration has repeatedly said that it only ever agreed to the phased lifting of restrictions on Iran and made that clear during the last round of talks. Menendez, speaking during today's hearing before the vote, said, 'Let's send a message to Tehran that sanctions relief is not a given' and it is 'not a prize for signing on the dotted line.' South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, an original co-author of the legislation, said in a statement that 'Congress should have a say in lifting the economic sanctions which Congress created.' 'Every Member of Congress needs to listen, speak, and be accountable for what I believe will be one of the most significant foreign policy decisions our nation has faced in decades,' he said. 'Either with President Obama’s signature – or over his objections – this legislation should immediately be pushed into law.'","Sensing a legislative defeat White House said the president would be willing to sign the bill if senators axed key portions of their Iran bill .

"A Perth woman who claimed she cured her cancer using a dietary program where she ate vast amounts of pineapple has pledged to release her medical records after critics questioned claims about her 'magic diet'. In the wake of recent controversy surrounding 'wellness warriors' such as Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson and the death of Gerson Therapy advocate Jessica Ainscough, bloggers have demanded 'irrefutable proof' that modelling agent Candice-Marie Fox cured her cancer 'with juice'. Ms Fox said she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2011. She initially had surgery to remove tumours from her neck that September and she then underwent a course of radiation treatment to 'mop up' the cancer in December. But when a return visit to the doctors revealed cancer cells had spread to other parts of her body, Ms Fox rejected further conventional medical treatment in favour of a diet and lifestyle plan she discovered online. Scroll down for video . As a model, Candice Marie-Fox (right) rubbed shoulders with the likes of last year's Bachelor Blake Garvey . Juice in hand: Candice-Marie Fox (pictured) claims to have cured her cancer with a nutritional program involving the heavy consumption of pineapples . Ms Fox underwent surgery and radiation treatment. She is planning to release relevant medical records without her personal details . 'I was feeling a bit lost, just winging it on the internet myself,' she said, until she discovered a U.S. organisation called the Nutritional Oncology Research Institute. She would sometimes spend weeks on a fruit-only diet, taking up yoga and leaving her stressful job behind to join a positive-thinking dance group called The Liberators International. Her diet program involved her drinking 'morning juice', dipping into boxes of pineapples each hour and taking vitamins. Ms Fox said when she returned to the doctors months after embracing her new lifestyle, medical staff found her cancer had been radically reduced in size and is now gone. 'I have got rid of it all (the cancer) 100 per cent myself through just hardcore nutrition, loving myself and meditating, adopting all stuff I thought never would have worked,' she said. Bloggers have questioned that assertion, demanding medical evidence for her claims and questioning her understanding of her radiation treatment. 'I am merely requesting that you are transparent about something as serious as being able to cure cancer using nutritional means,' one wrote. 'The truth is not negative or mean or bullying in any way whatsoever.' In response, Ms Fox said she was applying to obtain all her relevant medical records, which will take 45 to 60 days to obtain. She is planning release them in a PDF file, without personal details such as her Medicare number and contact details. Ms Fox also said she is seeking a trusted independent investigator to examine her claims and insisted she is not promoting her cause for fame or money. 'I didn't even know about this Belle Gibson lady,' she said. 'I don't know whether she did have cancer or what.' Ms Fox (pictured) has been questioned by bloggers over claims she cured her cancer through a diet as well as meditation . As part of the modelling world, Ms Fox is friends with The Bachelor Blake Garvey . 'I didn't even know about this Belle Gibson lady,' she said. 'I don't know whether she did have cancer or what.' 'All I know is, she's not me, I'm not her. 'My story is so far removed from anybody else's story because it's mine. 'It's unique, and it's exactly how it happened. 'So why am I not allowed to share that? 'Why am I not allowed to help people heal? I'm not making money out of this, I'm not trying to hurt anyone.' 'I'm not a fraud and I'm not a fake'. Ms Fox said she 'totally understood' that people were sceptical and that people were concerned her message could discourage people from seeking conventional treatments - but that wasn't her agenda. 'It just seems they've got this massive agenda to break down my story. 'I know I can sleep at night and in my heart I am doing what I know to be right.' 'I haven't changed anything, I haven't deleted anything. 'It really did change the way I f***ing lived'. Cancer Council nutritionist Kathy Chapman said maintaining a healthy diet is 'one of the things you can do to support your treatment', but dismissed 'magic diets' as unproven. 'I think it's really important for anybody who is facing cancer that they put their faith in medical doctors who are going to be backed up by sound research,' Ms Chapman said. 'A lot of the people claiming these cures with special magic diets you need to ask - where's the scientific studies there to back them up, and they are missing in this case.' Oncologist Dr Ian Olver, the director of the Samsom Institute, said there was evidence a diet of fresh fruit and vegetables with less red meat could prevent cancer. But Dr Olver, from the University of South Australia, said there was little evidence to suggest food could cure cancer and that he was concerned about the popularity of so-called 'wellness warriors'. 'People may be lured into abandoning or not taking up potentially curative treatments because something's become popular for which there is no evidence. 'Even if someone claimed they were cured by a certain diet, you'd like to know if that happened one in two (cases) or one in 20000 - but these anecdotes get blown up into suggestions for lifestyle.' Candice (pictured left) would sometimes spend weeks on a fruit-only diet, taking up yoga and leaving her stressful job behind to join a positive-thinking dance group called The Liberators International.","Perth woman claimed she cured cancer through her pineapple-centric diet .

"There's something about a city on a beach. Not a city on a river, but on a proper sandy holiday beach. Just knowing that for half the year you can take a dip in the Med after work, or sip rosé on the terrace of a seafront restaurant as the sun sets must be like living in a perpetual Mr Benn adventure, where you enter the fancy dress shop, trade your suit for a sundress, and walk through the magic door to a beach party. I've been to a handful of 'beach at the end of the street' cities in Australia and the US, but the only one I know where you walk through cobbled lanes and past Gothic palaces to get there is Barcelona. If you can't wangle living there full-time, then Barcelona must surely be a top contender for the best city break destination. An overview of Barcelona, the city of contrasting art and architecture with a handy beach alongside it . One moment visitors are marvelling at such landmarks as Gaudi's unfinished Sagrada Familia Church... ... The next locals and tourists alike are strolling to the beach for an after swim or game of volleyball . First of all, there's the jaw dropping architecture. No other city in the world has as many buildings on the Unesco world heritage list as Barcelona, from Roman walls to the fantastical creations of Gaudi. Finally, after a number of false starts, Andrea Catherwood got to stay at the iconic Hotel Arts . There's enough art and culture to keep you busy for a decade of weekend breaks, plus cracking food, colourful markets and plenty of places to party all night long. We stayed at the Hotel Arts, a modern masterpiece of the city. It's a glittering 44-storey skyscraper of glass and steel, towering over the beaches and Port Olimpic as well as the nearby old fishermen's quarter of Barceloneta, where a warren of narrow streets are festooned with laundry from apartments above the tiny tapas bars. The contrast could jar, but in this eclectic city it works. At the foot of the hotel is Frank Gehry's huge futuristic sculpture of a golden fish, El Peix d'Or, installed to mark the 1992 Olympics. I've wanted to stay at the Hotel Arts since I read about it in Tatler in 1997, when it won its Best Hotel in the World award, but I've had a few false starts along the way. I first brushed shoulders with it on a hen weekend a year later, when there was still a sombrero-full of pesetas to the pound. I persuaded the girls to pack away the L-plates and head there for cocktails (it probably doubled the budget of the whole weekend) before we rushed back to the nightclubs of Las Ramblas. In 2012, I tried to book a stay there during Chelsea's clash with Barcelona in the semi-final of the Champions League, but there must have been an 'oligarchs-only' policy because it was fully booked. Just last year, I was chairing a conference in the city, where we had a reception on the hotel's terraces. During the evening, Barcelona's charismatic mayor, Artur Mas, made an impassioned case for Catalan independence, before taking questions in English, French and Italian. Catherwood calls Hotel Arts as a modern masterpiece, a glittering 44-storey skyscraper of glass and steel . The footpath for walkers and joggers along Barceloneta Beach with Hotel Arts and Mapfre tower behind . Now, finally, I was here, unencumbered by work, football fans or hen weekends, with no more baggage than a weekend case. Although it's only a two hour hop from London, unfortunately that's not where I started from. I arrived after midnight, somewhat jaded after a long-haul flight from Asia, but was quickly revived by the warm reception from staff and the cool lobby, where the flower arrangements look like art installations. Things were just livening up in Frank's bar (named after the creator of the fish sculpture) where the signature cocktails were delicious and the staff were so friendly that it would have been churlish not to have another one. One building our writer is always drawn to, among  the stunning buildings of Barcelona, is Gaudi's Casa Batllo . So it was not until the following morning that we could appreciate the views from our room - from one window we could see Port Olimpic and the shining Mediterranean, from another we could make out Gaudi's unfinished church, the Sagrada Familia. The old city was a 15-minute stroll along the beachfront which was buzzing even on a winter weekend, with volleyball matches, sailing and paddle-boarding taking place. The narrow streets and medieval alleyways of the Gothic quarter opened unexpectedly on to grand squares, so we suddenly found ourselves in front of a cathedral or a gem of a Renaissance palace. Of all the stunning buildings, the one I'm drawn to every time is Gaudi's Casa Batllo, a building of curves and flowing lines covered in tiny mosaic and wrought iron balconies. It's like nothing else. By sunset we'd made it up to the National Museum of Art. The building is breathtaking - it's modelled on the Basilica in Rome - and inside has some of the most astounding ancient frescos removed from churches in the Pyrenees. Tourists pose in front of the National Museum of Art, a breathtaking building modelled on Rome's Basilica . Of course, in Barcelona you're never far from a bar and the hallmark of every good city break is large amount of eating and drinking to had among all that marching and culture. In fact, we seemed to dine in an obscenely large number of places given that we were only in the city for a weekend. Bella Rosa is a beachfront favourite - the food is excellent and there's a South Beach Miami feel, even though it's on the fringes of Barceloneta. Near the Sagrada Familia, the Café Sel is worth a visit just for the pastries. The two Michelin-starred Enoteca is the flagship restaurant of Hotel Arts - it's stunning but not stuffy . My out and out favourite was Mont Bar. It's not much to look at from the outside, but the atmosphere is laidback and bohemian, the chef works creative magic with whatever has arrived from the market that day, and the results are truly amazing. The food at the Hotel Arts is considered among the finest in Barcelona. The two Michelin-starred Enoteca is the flagship restaurant - it's stunning but not stuffy, and you fully expect Penelope Cruz to be dining with Pedro Almodovar at the next table (Hotel Arts is where she and many Hollywood A-listers stay). Perhaps fittingly, given Enoteca's superstar status, we were served Miraval Rosé from Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's estate in Provence. Hotel Arts Barcelona offers rooms from €245 (£180) per night, including breakfast. British Airways (0844 493 0787) offers flights to Barcelona from Heathrow and Gatwick. Return fares start from £74. In Barcelona, the art isn't just in museums. As we wandered down a side street past a small, open-fronted car park, one of the prime spots was taken up by a huge avant garde sculpture of a bull. It's a great city to get lost in and some of the best sights aren't in the tourist guides. There are not so many 'must sees' that you need to have a precise agenda. Anyway, I'd rather miss out on another art exhibition and linger over lunch, all the time hoping that, unlike in Mr Benn, the shopkeeper doesn't suddenly appear and invite me to go home.","Andrea Catherwood stayed at the modern masterpiece Hotel Arts .

"A tree dedicated to the memory of Michael Brown has been destroyed by vandals just hours after being planted. The sapling was planted in January-Wabash Park in Ferguson, Missouri on Saturday as a dedication to the teenager, who was gunned down in the street by a police officer last August. It was called 'a symbol of peace, comfort and hope for all who gather around its branches' at a small ceremony led by the Black Caucus of the American Library Association, which donated the tree. But by Sunday morning, the branches had been stripped, leaving behind just a shard of the trunk. Scroll down for video . Before: The Black Caucus of the American Library Association donated the tree and memorial plaque and it was planted in January-Wabash Park in Ferguson, Missouri on Saturday (pictured) Destroyed: But by Sunday morning, the tree had been ripped down, leaving just a shard of the trunk . The metal dedication plaque at the base of the tree had also been removed. It had read: 'In Memory of Michael Brown Jr Dedicated Tree 04/15.' 'I can't understand why someone would want to cut down the tree,' one man in the park told  KMOV. 'What, they want to start something back up again?' 'It's real sad day when a tree is dedicated and the next day someone comes along and destroys it just for the heck of it,' Gerald Brooks of the Black Caucus of the American Library Association added to Fox2. A second tree that was close to the Brown memorial and had been dedicated by a Ferguson resident to their dead pet was also vandalized. The plaque on that tree was also stolen. On Monday, both of the saplings were replanted and the memorial plaques will be replaced later this week, KSDK reported. New: By Monday, the tree - and another tree that was destroyed nearby - had been replaced at the site . Taken: The memorial plaque, pictured, was also removed but should be replaced later this week . The Ferguson Police Department is investigating the incident as an act of vandalism but they do not have any suspects. 'Officers canvassed the area talking to anyone who might have seen or heard anything related to the incident,' the city said in a statement. 'No witnesses were located, and at this time police have no leads. An investigation into the incident is ongoing, and the City of Ferguson is replacing the trees today [Monday].' The incident is the third time that a Brown memorial has been destroyed. In September, a memorial that included stuffed toys, images and notes close to where Brown died was destroyed by a fire. Killed: Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson, right, in the street last August . And in December, a car hit and destroyed a memorial. There was speculation that the driver purposefully hit the memorial, but the police department said it was not being considered a crime. It was later rebuilt. Brown, 18, was shot dead by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson as he responded to reports of a theft on August 9, sparking massive protests against police brutality across the country. More demonstrations erupted in December, when a St Louis County grand jury ruled that Wilson would not be indicted in the killing. In March, the U.S. Department of Justice cleared him of civil rights violations.","Sapling was planted in January-Wabash Park in Ferguson, Missouri on Saturday but by Sunday, its trunk had been snapped in half .

"Sometimes strong-willed children can prove a challenge to parents, especially when it comes to doing what they're told. And that's certainly the case in one household, as a new video shows. Little Catalina from America was filmed emptying out the contents of the kitchen cabinets at home. But when her father tells her to clean up her mess, she vehemently refuses with a heated - and rather cute - argument ensuing. Standing in a frilly skirt with her arms crossed, Catalina answers back at her father in a bid to get him to do the cleaning. 'I already cleaned the kitchen, no it's your turn, I'm not picking up your mess,' her elder firmly responds. As the argument goes on, the volume gets higher and higher. At one point Catalina hits her father's leg in frustration. Caught red-handed: Little Catalina from America was filmed emptying out the contents of the kitchen cupboards at home . Pointing the finger: But when her father tells her to clean up her mess, she vehemently refuses with a heated - and rather cute - argument ensuing . The two then point back and forth at each other as the debate continues. Showing her cheeky side, Catalina  proceeds to pick up a couple of pans and march forwards with them before dumping them down and standing again with her arms crossed. 'No I'm not doing it... you put them away,' her father says, quickly latching on to her antics. At the end of the video Catalina's father walks off, leaving her alone to figure out what to do with the kitchen implements. A woman filming the scene can be heard letting out a soft giggle after watching the boisterous toddler in action.","Little Catalina from America was filmed emptying out the contents of the kitchen cupboards at home .

"Ricky Gervais has led an online charge against 'trophy hunters' after posting a picture of an Extreme Huntress winner lying next to a dead giraffe and smiling. The comedian was outraged when he came across the picture of American grandmother-of-nine Rebecca Francis, who won the reality TV show Extreme Huntress in 2010. 'What must've happened to you in your life to make you want to kill a beautiful animal & then lie next to it smiling?' a furious Gervais tweeted. Trophy: Ricky Gervais posted this picture of Extreme Huntress winner Rebecca Francis on his Twitter feed . Disgust: The animal-lover sent it out with this message - which got retweeted thousands of times . Proud: Francis, a grandmother-of-nine, is passionate about hunting - and regularly posts pictures of her kills . Francis then found herself at the centre of a social media storm, as 14,543 people retweeted it - with some even tweeting they hoped she dies 'a lonely, painful death'. Jason Arnopp (‏@JasonArnopp) tweeted: 'It's a special kind of psychopathy, it really is.' The Doom ‏(@JamesVonDoom) added: 'Why the **** are they shooting Giraffes? A standing giraffe is probably easier to hit than a ""sitting duck"".' Despite the outcry, Francis, a mother of eight in her mid-40s, is far from alone in her passion for hunting down animals for sport. Tens of thousands of tourists travel to Africa every year to collect 'trophies', from warthogs to elephants. Those wanting to hunt down giraffes to add to their collections can do so quite easily, with entire tour companies dedicated to the 'sport'. Killing a giraffe will cost somewhere in the region of $3,000, or £2,037, with the cost of the day's hunting on top - about $440 (£298). Extreme: Francis' biography reveals she hopes to inspire more women to get involved with hunting . Global: She has travelled all over the world to hunt - shooting dead zebra, lion and giraffes . Record: Francis has recently achieved the 'Grand Slam of North America' - hunting down all the species of sheep native to the continent with her bow. She is only the second woman to achieve the feat . But while those like Gervais are horrified by the idea, Francis is a proud advocate for the sport - which has seen her travel the world in search of the latest 'trophy'. Indeed, a biography for Francis on Sheepshape - a 'documentary/reality' programme which follows four hunters trying to overcome a set of personal problems by hunting North American sheep - says: 'Rebecca loves to share her passion for hunting with her kids and other women. 'She hopes to help more women get out there and pursue their interest.' Her own website boasts of becoming the second American woman to get the 'Grand Slam of North America' with her bow - which means she has killed all four species native to North America. 'Achieving the full curl with a bow is like reaching the top of that mountain and crossing that finish line, which was my dream that began 18 years ago when I came home from my first rifle sheep hunt,' she told the Unita County Herald. The MailOnline has contacted Francis for a comment.","Comedian Ricky Gervais led an online charge against Rebecca Francis .

"A couple who lost their homes and were almost killed in Hurricane Sandy are celebrating a whirlwind of good fortune after winning more than $250,000 in the lottery. Mary Ann Diano was left homeless when the storms hit Staten Island, New York, in October 2012 - but now says because of Hurricane Sandy she has met the love of her life and they are buying their dream home together. The 62-year-old's home has lived in a trailer park in Connecticut every since the disaster where she met her partner Dennis Krauss, whose home in Brooklyn, New York, was also destroyed. Dennis Krauss and Mary Ann Diano said they plan to spend their winning on a new house. Both of them were left homeless when Hurricane Sandy wrecked havoc on the east coast of the US in October 2012 . The loving couple met after they separately moved from New York to a trailer park in Connecticut, after they lost their homes. During the storms Ms Diano had been swept away by the waves and clung to a tree for safety . The 62-year-old didn't evacuate during Hurricane Sandy because there was nowhere where she could bring her cats. She lost everything in the storm - but in its aftermath she met the love of her life and won the lottery . ‘Sandy left me homeless and alone and now because of Sandy I met the love of my life, I hit the lottery and we’re shopping for the house of our dreams’, the thrilled woman told the New York Daily News after she won $255,555 (£174,000). Ms Diano’s troubles first began when she stayed at home with her five cats during the storm brought on by Hurricane Sandy, which caused chaos when it hit 24 states in the US. As the water began to fill her house she stepped outside and was swept away by a huge wave before landing in the high branches of a tree – saying she feared she was going to die. She was hauled to safety by a kind stranger, who saw she was about to touch a live wire and risk being electrocuted. The loving couple said they don't consider the winnings as money - but as the chance for a new start and home . Sandy left Ms Diano homeless and alone, she said - but it also brought her the love of her life and a lottery wn . Ms Diano was reunited with her cats but lost her home, and went to live in a Connecticut trailer park after winning a year’s rent-free accommodation in a church raffle. There she met Mr Krauss, who had also lost his home in Brooklyn, New York, in the storms, and the homeless pair began a relationship. She won the lottery last October after buying it from a gas station, but decided not to cash it in until April 6 – the day after Easter – as a symbolic sign of a new beginning. Reliving the moment she knew her life had changed, she told the Daily News: ‘I ran outside to Dennis waiting in the car and told him we won. The hurricane destroyed homes as it swept through New Jersey (pictured), including Ms Diano's home . He said, ‘If you’re busting my chops, I’ll kill ya.’ I showed him the ticket. ‘We hugged. We kissed. I wept.’ Mr Krauss said they didn't consider the winnings as money but the chance for the start of a new life together in their own home, . 'We don’t consider it money. We consider it a home. It’s a home', Mr Klaus told the News 8 channel. 'It’s not to be spent. It’s where we’re going to live together and start a new life.'","Pair were left homeless after storms and met in Connecticut trailer park .

"A Coast Guard cutter arrived in San Diego on Thursday with more than 14 tons of cocaine, part of what authorities has described as a surge of seizures near Central and South America. The cocaine, valued by the Coast Guard at $424 million, was seized by U.S. and Canadian forces in 19 separate incidents in the eastern Pacific Ocean near Central and South America. It included a 10½-ton bust from a coastal freighter, the largest maritime drug interdiction in that area since 2009.

"It seems most people can't wait to shower babies with affection - pets included! Gemma the pit bull was filmed at home in California enthusiastically greeting a baby boy named Elliot with kisses. Footage shows her lovingly licking the infant as he attempts to fend her away with his hands. Despite Elliot's best efforts, Gemma keeps licking away. But the baby boy doesn't seem to mind the affectionate slobbering and he's heard merrily gurgling away. 'Is that a doggy?' his mother says as she films the scene unfold. After more than ten seconds, Gemma shows no signs of moving on. Other videos show the animal is clearly used to being around children. She also appears to be a fan of Elliot's older sister, Adeline. While some viewers have deemed her licking session with Elliot 'cute', others have been less impressed by the scene. Lovely to meet you!

"Tired after a long journey from Scotland, Nikki Kelly decided to have a quiet night in. She started to feel cramps in her stomach, and believed she might be getting her period. But when she made a dash for the bathroom, the 24-year-old was shocked to find she was in fact going into the early stages of labour, and gave birth to her son on the bathroom floor. Miss Kelly, from Bridport, Dorset, had no idea she was expecting, and had even kept her size eight figure throughout the pregnancy. Nikki Kelly believed she was suffering from period cramps - before giving birth to son James, now three months, in 'three pushes' on the bathroom floor . Miss Kelly kept her size 8 figure throughout her pregnancy, and had no cravings. She is pictured on holiday with partner Andrew Swallow, 27, when she was unknowingly four months pregnant . She had been taking the contraceptive pill and continued to have periods for the whole nine months – and experienced no morning sickness or cravings whatsoever. She says baby James was born in 'three pushes' and she and her partner, Aaron Swallow, 27, have now made an offer on a house so they can all live together as a family. Miss Kelly, who worked as a cleaner before her pregnancy, said: 'I was feeling a bit rubbish with what I thought was cramps so decided to have a quiet night in after travelling back from Scotland and seeing my family. 'I started needing the toilet more and more often, until I couldn't even get off the bathroom floor. 'My partner Aaron was at work and I called him 76 times in half an hour to get him to come home. 'By the time he got to mine I was able to introduce him to his son.' Miss Kelly, originally from Scotland, had been to a New Year's party at her brother's house in Stirling and was due to stay in Scotland for a few days afterwards. James was born on January 5 at 11:22am, weighing a healthy 6lbs. Miss Swallow said she knew to wrap him in a blanket and check his feet, having watched medical TV shows . Miss Kelly and her partner have put an offer in on a house so the three of them can start living together as a family. Mr Swallow is pictured with his son (left) and with Miss Kelly, two days before she gave birth (right) But she began feeling ill and so she and her partner travelled home a day early. Looking back, not wanting to drink alcohol was the only way her body changed during her pregnancy. She said: 'I had one Blue WKD on New Year's Eve. I started drinking it but just didn't want it. 'Being off alcohol was the only change in me. I stayed a size six to eight and didn't have any morning sickness or put on any weight. 'I was on the bathroom floor with cramps and I suddenly felt the urge to push. Three pushes later and my baby was born. 'Luckily he was crying and I've seen TV shows so knew what to do. 'I wrapped him in a towel and checked his hands and feet.' James was born on January 5 at 11:22am, weighing a healthy 6lbs. Mr Swallow came over to Miss Kelly's house, ordered an ambulance straight away, and the new family travelled to hospital. Aaron's sister had given birth five months earlier and was able to bring a car seat to the hospital so they could take the baby home safely. But otherwise, the couple didn't have any baby clothes, let alone a cot. Miss Kelly said: 'I gave birth on the Sunday night and was in hospital until Wednesday. James is 'the best thing that ever happened' to her and her partner, Miss Swallow said. She added: 'James is our little miracle' 'My mum and dad were able to get me some essentials, including a cot bed, and Aaron's parents us nappies and a steriliser, but when I came out of hospital I went straight to the baby shop to get the rest. 'It closed in ten minutes and I just told the staff that I needed literally everything.' Now, Miss Kelly and Aaron, who both live with their parents, are splitting their time with the baby between their homes. They are waiting to see if their offer on a home of their own has been accepted. Miss Kelly said: 'It's all happened very quickly and been very expensive. 'I've adapted to being a mum straight away and Aaron is a very proud dad. 'It's the best thing to happen to us. James is our little miracle.' Ms Janet Fyle, of the Royal College of Midwives said although Miss Kelly’s situation is uncommon, it is not unusual. She said: ‘Some women just don’t know they are pregnant . ‘One lady was serving in Afghanistan and didn’t realise she was pregnant, and we had to send services out there. ‘It might happen for a variety of reasons. It’s different for any women. ‘There are some women with good abdominal muscles and fat and the baby lies flat against the back so they don’t have a bump. ‘Some women won’t have the normal pregnancy symptoms. ‘Some women feel the baby moving inside them, but some don’t. Some women have good abdominal muscles and fat and the baby lies flat against the back so they don't have a bump, says Ms Janet Fyle, of the Royal College of Midwives . ‘A lot of the symptoms of pregnancy are ‘everyday’ symptoms. So they might not know that having wind is a sign of pregnancy. Especially if they’ve never had a baby.’ ‘Not all women are body-conscious. It depends on what’s going on in their life.’ In these cases, the midwife has an important role in supporting the new family, as adjusting to being a parents can be a shock. She said: ‘The women themselves are totally shocked when it happens to them. ‘A lot of talking and reassurance by the midwife is needed. ‘They need to say the occurrence is unusual but the woman herself is not abnormal. ‘That woman is going to need a lot of help and support adjusting to being a parent. ‘Women with unplanned pregnancies get very upset, so imagine one day you have a normal life and the next you are a parent. ‘The midwife would give that woman a lot more care, watching for signs of post-natal depression or even post-natal unhappiness.’","Nikki Kelly, 24, kept needing the toilet and believed she had period cramps .

"It seems that 2014 was a very, very good year to be Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from Friday, it was revealed that Zaslav was compensated an unbelievable $156.1million last year. This amount, thanks to the success of television events like Shark Week, shows like the once popular Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and his running of networks like OWN, makes him one of the highest paid television executives. Scroll down for video . David Zaslav (above) was compensated $156.1million for his role as CEO of Discovery Communications it was revealed on Friday . This thanks to shows like the once popular Here Comes Honey Boo Boo (left) and his running of networks like Oprah Winfrey's OWN (right) Discovery has also done well thanks to the success of television events like Shark Week . Variety reports that a large portion of that money comes from stocks, with Zaslav receiving $144million in awards for his six-year contract. 1.Sumner Redstone (CBS, Viacom) - $93.4m . 2.Les Moonves (CBS) - $66.9m . 3.Philippe Dauman (Viacom) - $37.2m . 4.Bob Iger (Disney) - $34.3m . 5.David Zaslav (Discovery) - $33.3m . 6.Jeffrey Bewkes (Time Warner) - $32.5m . 7.Brian Roberts (Comcast) - $31.4m . 8.Stephen Burke (NBC) - $31.1m . 9.Chris Albrecht (Starz) - $30.5m . 10.Thomas Dooley (Viacom) - $29.1m . It is a remarkable boost from the $33million he received in 2013, with $22.5million of that also coming from stock awards. The amount seems to be deserved as well, as under Zaslav's guidance, the company's market cap has grown from $5billion in 2007 to $20billion today. As for his base salary, that was $3million, where it will stay for the length of his contract, and he can no receive a cash bonus greater than $6.6million until the last two years of his new contract, when that amount goes to $9million. This amount is far, far greater than the two television executives who made the most last year, Sumer Redstone and Les Moonves. Redstone, who heads up CBS and Viacomn, took home $93.4million, while Moonves, the CEO of CBS, took home $66.9million. 'This contract rewards Mr. Zaslav for the value he has created and the continued strategic direction he provides and requires sustained performance over time for that award to have value,' the filing states. 'At the end of his contract, Mr. Zaslav will own a substantial amount of equity of Discovery, which reinforces his alignment with our shareholders and encourages long-term ownership of our stock.' This amount is far, far greater than the $93million CBS chairman Sumner Redstone (left) made in 2013 and the $67m Les Moonves (right) made . Zaslav is also likely to become the biggest shareholder at Discovery under this new contract is he buys the shares of television mogul John Malone who also holds a sizable stake in the company. He will have right of first refusal to purchase Malone's stocks should he sell. The contract will expire in 2019.","David Zaslav was compensated $156.1million for his role as CEO of Discovery Communications in 2014 it was revealed on Friday .

"An industrial meat grinder has been found at the home of a man arrested in connection with the disappearance of his female lodger, as police investigate the disappearance of four other people. Adriana Giogiosa, 55, was reported missing after her brother could not contact her at the house in Majadahonda, a suburb of Madrid, where she had been staying for the last two or three months. The landlord of the house, a 32-year-old Spanish man with a history of psychological problems, has been arrested. Adriana Giogiosa was reported missing by her brother after he was unable to contact her, and Ms Giogiosa's landlord in Madrid has been arrested in connection with her disappearance and a meat grinder found there . Spanish Police are said to have found blood and an industrial meat grinder at the property in a quiet street, as well as a list of three other tenants who are also thought to be missing. At least two of the other missing tenants are thought to be women from Argentina and the man's aunt has also not been found - prompting fears they could all have been murdered. When they searched the house in Sacedilla Street in Majadahonda officers found half of it had been repainted and the other half covered in plastic, ready for redecorating, El Pais reported. At first the man had refused officers access to the house and demanded they get a warrant. Spanish Police found a couple of spots of blood in the house, a meat grinder and what appeared to be a tooth in the machine. A blood stained knife was also found. These have all been sent off for analysis. Police launched an investigation after Miss Giogiosa's brother reported her missing on April 6. She had visited home in Argentina in February and caught a flight back to Madrid at the end of March, when she is believed to have been killed. Her brother said after he arrived back in Madrid he had received text messages from her saying she would be unable to speak because she was moving country and he had not been able to contact her - despite usually talking on a daily basis. The house in a quiet Majadahonda street has been searched by police, who reportedly found a meat grinder . A letter was also sent to Miss Giogiosa's work, a restaurant, saying she would not be returning for personal reasons after she returned to Madrid, Periodista Digital reported. Officers are also searching nearby rubbish dumps in Pinto. Neighbours reported hearing loud noises and the landlord taking out bags of rubbish from the house in Sacedilla Street in Mjadahonda in the days before the landlord was arrested, according to La Nueva Espana. There were also reports that the garage had been soundproofed. The man, who has previously been in a psychiatric hospital with schizophrenia, took over the house from his aunt when she reportedly went into a care home. Authorities are also trying to trace her. The brother of Miss Giogiosa has flown to Madrid to help with the investigation.","Adriana Giogiosa, 55, was reported missing after flying back to Madrid .

"Two of the teenagers who masterminded the Anzac Day terror plot in Melbourne had recently scouted police stations ahead of a possible attack. It comes as a friend of the teenagers who are believed to the planned attack in Melbourne revealed the moment the two young men 'became radicalised'. The man, who has not been identified, claims the death of Numan Haider was the moment 'we all became more radical', according to News Corp Australia. Scroll down for video . Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday afternoon . Multiple photos of Mr Besim on his social media pages show him posing with one raised index finger, a symbol that other ISIS supporters have also frequently used . He is one of two 18-year-old men police arrested for allegedly planning an 'ISIS inspired' attack on an Anzac Day ceremony. The duo were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (pictured) Haider was killed by police last year after he attacked officers with a knife, and is believed to have planned an ISIS-like attack. The two alleged ringleaders of the Anzac Day plot reportedly attended Haider's funeral. The information comes after police held one of the alleged ringleaders in jail under tough new terror laws, despite not being charged. The man, who cannot be identified due to suppression orders, could be held 14 days after police applied for a Preventive Detention Order. Another man, Sevdet Ramadan Besim, 18,  was charged with planning to carry out an  attack. Both men often visited frequented the controversial Al-Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale. It was also revealed the young men arrested on Saturday had personal links with a senior Australian jihadist and Islamic State recruiter in Syria. Police are exploring the role played in the plot by Neil Prakash, 23, who is considered to be the top Australian recruiter for ISIS, according to Fairfax Media. Prakash, who is know by the jihadist name Abu Khalid al-Kambodi, may have been in direct communication with the teenagers until recently. Prakash is thought of in the same way as Mohammad Ali Baryalei, a former Sydney bouncer who was believed killed fighting around the Northern Syrian city of Kobane in late 2014. Mr Haider, whose body is pictured (left) being taken to the coroner for examination, died when he was shot by officers after stabbing two policemen outside a Melbourne police station on September 23. It is believed the two men who masterminded the Anzac Day plot attended his funeral (pictured: right) The father of one of the teens arrested in the raids, said his son had benefited from his time at the controversial Al Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale . The teen was interviewed by police all morning before travelling to the Magistrates Court where he was charged . Police are exploring the role played in the plot by Neil Prakash (left), 23, who is considered to be the top Australian recruiter for ISIS . Earlier, the social media page of  Besim was discovered, which provided insight into the mind of the alleged terrorist. The 18-year-old's Instagram account features posts with anti-Western sentiments and Islamic State propaganda. Just two days before the teenager was arrested during pre-dawn raids at his Melbourne home, he was perusing the Facebook page of well-known radical Perth-based Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne. Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, appeared in Melbourne Magistrates Court charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts'. Days before he arrested, Besim was browsing the Facebook page of Mohammed Junaid Thorne . Hizb Ut-Ta-Khir is an Islamic fundamentalist group who have a branch in Australia . He was arrested, along with four other teenagers, suspected of planning a terror attack using swords and knives. A number of 'edged weapons'  were seized at some of the properties searched. The father of one of the men arrested, said he believed the controversial Al Furqan Islamic study centre had changed his son's life for the better. Mr Besim did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody for a filing hearing on April 24 . 'Before he started to pray, (he) was in the house aggressive, he broke (things), like a child. But after when he started to pray he really changed behaviour, 100 per cent,' the father told the ABC. 'Now he was very good, always. Never, never yells, never, never do bad in house. 'He's always nice talking when I see him, but I (do) not see him very much.' Controversial posts uncovered on Besim's Instagram page contained strong anti-government sentiments, including one calling U.S. President Barack Obama 'Israel's b**ch'. Another picture expresses his thoughts on the democratic system of politics. He calls U.S. president Barack Obama 'Israel's b**ch' in one of Instagram post on his page . Another picture on Besim's Instagram account expresses his thoughts on the democratic system of politics . One of his posts said 'War on Terror, where the invader is considered a hero and the resistor called a terrorist' 'Democracy is a system whereby man violates the right of Allah,' it said. The hashtag on the post reads: 'Don't Vote 4 Man Made Law.' His Instagram account also revealed Besim had his Facebook account disabled. The father of the boy also said his family had been traumatised by the dramatic raids. The father said he had a gun held to his head for 30 minutes, and police told him: 'One more word I kill you. Doesn't matter for your kids.' Three other men, also aged 18 and 19, were arrested separately in Narre Warren. Pictured is one of the homes in the suburb where police made one of several arrest during terror raids . Residents living next door to the homes that were raided in the early hours of the morning have described waking to glass smashing, screams and 'fire-cracker like' noises before seeing lights . 'My wife she starts screaming. Police call ambulance to come and help her,' the father told the ABC. 'I notice everything in the house is broken, the door, everything.' A total of five teenagers were arrested as part of the Melbourne Joint Counter Terrorism Team operation named Operation Rising, which saw 200 officers' raid seven properties on Saturday morning. Australian Federal Police Acting Commissioner Michael Phelan said the investigation ramped up in recent days after it had become 'very obvious' the men had 'specific plans' in place. Security at Anzac Day events across the country has been increased after the incident, with a strong police presence expected.

"Police are hunting a thief who stole an 86-year old woman's handbag while she prayed at church on Good Friday. The man posed as a member of the congregation of St James' church in the Gorton area of Manchester to carry out the crime. As well as taking one bag, he tried to steal the contents of two other elderly women's bags before fleeing. Police have released an e-fit and CCTV footage after a thief stole a pensioner's handbag from a church . The thief sat down in a pew next to the 86-year-old for the Good Friday service earlier this month. After grabbing the bag, he targeted an 82-year-old woman but she was alerted when she heard him rustling in her purse. As he fled the church, the thief tried to snatch the handbag from a third woman, also aged 86. But instinctively the woman pushed the thief away as he tried to pull the bag from her shoulder and he ran off. Police have described the incident on April 3 as 'appalling' and have released an e-fit image of the suspected offender. They are appealing to anyone who recognises him to come forward. The thief is described as being a white man, in his 40s of a medium build and wearing a grey hooded top. The incident happened at St James' church in the Gorton area of Manchester on April 3 . Det Con Dave Bennett of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The actions of this underhand and sneaky thief are so shocking that I have no doubt people who live in this area, particularly those who worship at this church, will be very angry. 'He used an important date in the religious calendar and within the sanctity of the church grounds to target elderly women who had simply gone to the church to mark Good Friday.' He added: 'Not only did he pinch one woman's bag, but he also tried to steal two other handbags and was only stopped in his tracks thanks to the vigilance of two of the women. 'It is a sinister, cowardly and disrespectful crime and we need to find the man responsible before he can target anyone else, whether they will elderly people or those attending at the church. 'We have released an accurate likeness of this offender and I would urge people to look very carefully at the image. If you recognise who this man is then please do the right thing and call us. 'Alternatively, I would urge people to be vigilant and if you think you see this man, then please call us straight away.'","Man sat next to the 86-year-old woman in church pew in Manchester .

"A man tore a tendon in his thumb after playing Candy Crush on his phone for weeks – and didn’t even realise he was injured. The 29-year-old, who lived in California, had been playing the game all day for six to eight weeks as he had just left the military and was in between jobs. He tore the tendon, an injury which is normally quite painful, but reported he felt nothing at all. Doctors who treated him said his case shows video games can numb people’s pain and this might be why some people play them excessively, and why some people become addicted or become injured while playing. A man tore a tendon in his thumb after playing the game Candy Crush Saga on his phone for weeks - but reported he felt no pain at all (file photo) Candy Crush Saga is a popular game that involves swiping rows of brightly coloured sweets in order to line up three matching ones and earn points. It has been downloaded by more than 500 million people since its launch in 2012. Writing in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, doctors describe how man came to hospital in California complaining his left thumb hurt and he couldn’t move it properly, and said he had been playing the game for weeks. They examined him and carried out MRI scans on his hand, and discovered he had ruptured a tendon in his thumb, and would need surgery to repair it, LiveScience reports. Dr Andrew Doan, a co-author of the case report said typically, when people rupture this tendon, they tear it at the point where it is thinnest, or where it attaches to the bone. Candy Crush Saga has been downloaded by more than 500 million people since its launch in 2012 . Violent video games in which players have to shoot enemies can actually be good for people, a university has claimed - after discovering the games give people a higher pain threshold. A study at Keele University found that 40 volunteers were able to stomach pain for 65 per cent longer after playing violent 'first person shooter' games, than those who had played a non-violent golf game. Participants played both the violent and non-violent game on separate occasions for 10 minutes and then placed one of their hands in ice-cold water to test their reaction to pain. On average, participants kept their hands in the icy water for 65 per cent longer after playing the violent game, indicating that playing the game increased the participants’ pain tolerance . But in this man’s, he tore the tendon at its thickest point, which would usually cause pain before it ruptured, he told LiveScience journalists. This could be because when people play games, they feel pleasure and excitement, and this can cause natural painkillers to be released in the body – similar to when a person experiences a ‘runner’s high’, he explained. This might numb the pain of an injury, but it could also explain why video games can be addictive, he added. In this case, the man was not actually addicted to Candy crush, but Dr Doan warns people who do become hooked, and their relationships, finances and work can suffer. He advised limit gaming to half an hour a day, as studies have shown that at this level, games can have social and emotional benefits. Those who have problems in their lives as a result of too much gaming should go to their doctor, and can seek help from the support group On Line Gamers Anonymous. Writing in the report, researchers said the ‘painkiller effect’ of video games might have benefits in the right circumstances. Research could consider whether video games have a role in pain management, as a non-drug alternative during painful medical procedures, they said. It might be interesting to study which video games are able to reduce the perception of pain the most, they added.","Man came to hospital complaining his thumb hurt and he couldn't move it .

"A tenant who claims she lost her 'sexual adventurism' and 'libido' after she was injured when an elevator in her building suddenly dropped three floors is suing the luxury apartment complex. Marie D'Argent claims she suffered vertebral disc trauma, whiplash and nightmares when the elevator at The Princeton complex on St Kilda Road in Melbourne dropped suddenly on October 9, the Herald Sun reports. The 55-year-old publicist says the fall also left her with a 'loss of libido', 'sexual discomfort and impairment' and 'curtailment of ­sexual adventurism'. Marie D'Argent claims she suffered vertebral disc trauma, whiplash and nightmares when the elevator at The Princeton complex on St Kilda Road in Melbourne dropped suddenly on October 9 . Ms D'Argent recently filed a statement of claim at the County Court of Victoria to seek compensation for her injuries from the building owners' corporation and elevator service, Thyssenkrupp Elevator Australia. She claims she entered the lift on the 11th floor on October 9 before it dropped and stopped sharply on the eighth floor. Ms D'Argent says the lift then jolted at each level until reaching the ground floor, which left her with spinal injuries that had impacted her professional, family and personal life. Ms D'Argent recently filed a statement of claim at the County Court of Victoria to seek compensation for her injuries from the building owners' corporation and elevator service, Thyssenkrupp Elevator Australia . 'It's a matter of losing your mojo,' she told the newspaper. 'Everybody would know your back plays a big part in your sexual life.' She claims the incident has left her unable to work full-time.

"A mysterious sinkhole spewing fire and incredible heat has appeared in a Chinese hillside. Geologists and media have flocked to the desolate mountain on the outskirts of Urumqi, in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in north-western China, since it appeared a few weeks ago. Scroll down for video . The hole appeared recently after locals noticed the ground nearby getting warmer . The heat blasting from the 'ring of fire' has been measured at 792C (1457F) from two metres away, reports People's Daily Online, and is so intense that experts can't get close enough to determine how deep the hole is. Video footage of the 3ft-wide hole shows locals igniting branches and grass by pushing it to the rim. Some Chinese internet users have branded it a 'gateway to hell' after viewing the pictures. Experts can't get close enough to determine how deep the mysterious hole is . The temperature has been measured at 792C - but that was from two metres away . Locals told Chinese media that they had noticed the ground in the area had been warm underfoot for some time. The hill is not in a volcanic area, and experts from Xinjiang Meitian Geological Bureau think the hole is caused by the layer of spontaneously combusted coal underneath the ground, which leads the surface layer to collapse. ‘The phenomenon has existed in the area for a few decades,’ Huang Wei, an engineer from the bureau told China Central TV Station. He added that smoke often comes from under the ground on this hill in the spring and autumn. Branches and grass that are held near the hole immediately catch fire from the intense heat . Experts think a coal seam may have spontaneously combusted below ground . Chen Long, a supervisor from Xinjiang Meitian Fire Engineering Bureau, said there used to be more than a dozen of small coal mines in the area in the 1970s. ‘Primitive mining and extinguishing techniques caused coal to burn deep under the ground,’ said Mr Chen in the same interview. ‘Operators didn’t seal the mines properly after business discontinued and this leads the underground fire to burn towards the surface of the earth.’ The local authorities have started drawing plans to put out the underground fire.","Locals had noticed the ground in the area was warmer than usual .

"Scottish drinkers are so cautious of the country's new drink-driving limits bar sales have plummeted by 60 per cent - a reduction in spending so severe it's damaging the country's financial growth. Under the new Scottish drink-drive law, enacted on December 5, the limit was cut from 80mg per 100ml of blood to just 50mg. And the effect of the drop in sales is so severe, it is being blamed for a poor result in the country's latest Bank of Scotland PMI report. Scotland's tough new drink driving law is being blamed for stalling the country's financial growth . Donald MacRae, chief economist at Bank of Scotland, said: 'Manufacturing exporters have been affected by the falling euro while services businesses in hospitality are seeing a changing pattern of spending resulting from the lowered alcohol limit while driving.' The report follows a February study which revealed the country's bar sales had dropped by 60 per cent when the new limit was introduced. Publicans are now concerned the new laws will have a greater effect on bars and drinking establishments than the 2006  smoking ban. Paul Waterson, chief executive of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, told The Independent the new law - which matches limits across much of Continental Europe - was a 'form of prohibition'. He said: 'It’s stopped people having a drink at lunchtime, or having a drink on the way home from work. People aren’t coming in for food with their families on a Sunday afternoon. Hospitality industry leaders claim the new law is stopping moderate drinkers from having a tipple at lunch or on their way home from work . 'We feel it’s had an effect far worse than the smoking ban had in 2006. There’s questions being asked about the future of the trade – it’s probably the last nail in the coffin for independent operators.' The February study, carried out by purchasing firm Beacon, revealed there was a surge in interest in non-alcoholic drinks and smaller glass sizes. Tennant Hilditch, director of sales, said the first two months of the new drink driving laws had shown a 'real impact' on the country's hospitality industry. He said: 'Traditional lunchtime drinkers, or post-golf drinkers in the clubhouse have been particularly affected by the new rules. 'So much so, that we are seeing demand for smaller glasses, weaker beers, a trend towards introducing earlier lunch sittings so guests or golfers can stay longer and do not return to the roads as quickly, as well as an increased interest in ""mocktails"".' In the wake of the law change, Police Scotland assistant chief constable Bernard Higgins encouraged drinkers to 'leave the car at home' if they were planning to go for a drink. He said: 'There is no safe amount of alcohol in the body if you drive. It is clear when it comes to drinking and driving, that the simple ""the best advice is none"" message is the right one.' While the limit brings Scotland in line with the rest of Europe, it is significantly lower than that of England and Wales - which remains at 80mg per 100ml of blood.","Scotland's strict new drink-driving law sees bar sales drop by 60 per cent .

"America celebrated the coming of age of a new sporting hero on Sunday when Jordan Spieth, 21, showed true grace under pressure to win The Masters. As people clamor to find out about this humble champ from Texas, a letter penned six years ago when he was still in high school has surfaced which only reinforces his nice guy image. As a junior at Jesuit High School in Dallas, the grateful golfer wrote the letter to the Murphy family who had funded the scholarship that helped pay for his tuition. Scroll down for video . A letter of thanks penned by Masters champion Jordan Spieth six years ago when he was on a scholarship at Jesuit High School in Dallas, left, has surfaced which only reinforces his nice guy image . As a junior at Jesuit High School in Dallas, the PGA golfer was humble enough to write the letter to the Murphy family who funded the scholarship that helped pay for his tuition . In the thank you note, Spieth wrote that he earned the scholarship from a work grant program, reports The Dallas Morning News. Spieth, already dreaming about winning the Masters, was already an extremely talented golfer in 2009 and he casually informs the family that he's the No. 1 junior golfer in the country. The 21-year-old impressed many following Sunday's big victory with his manners and affable manor as well as his golfing skills. As he stepped off the final green he embraced, in turn, his father Shawn, his mother Chris, his college sweetheart Annie, his brother Steven, who plays college basketball, his grandfather and various friends. He then went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space. 'He's just a class guy in every way and it's difficult not to root for him,' said golf legend Phil Mickelson. Spieth hugs members of his family after securing his first ever major title at Augusta National . Spieth walks back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the large crowd watching on . Spieth (right) pictured with his college sweetheart girlfriend Annie . Another legend impressed by Spieth was Jack Nicklaus, who posted this tribute: 'Congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man. That was an incredible performance. 'Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about him. He's polite, he's humble, he handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he's obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion.' The one family member who wasn't present to enjoy the celebrations was Jordan's 14-year-old sister Ellie, who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. The siblings regularly Facetime each other and every time they talk Ellie asks he brother if he has won yet. 'I'll finally be able to tell her yes,' he said, smiling. 'I know she was watching on television and I think she's going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green,' he said. 'She's going to want a present.' Spieth spends time with his family as he poses for a photo with sister Ellie (centre) and brother Steven (right) Spieth pictured in his younger days playing basketball left-handed . Golf should not have been Spieth's game at all. Nobody in the family plays — they are all big basketball fans. But Spieth was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there. When he set out he was ranked 809th in the world. Now he is No 2 behind Rory McIlroy. In 18 months, he has banked more than $13 million on the PGA Tour alone. In his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says: 'I don't see this as a great run of form, I see this as normal,' it does not come across as at all boastful. Jesuit High School was recently in the news for all the wrong reasons when the Daily Mail Online exposed former pupil, Parker Rice, as one of the Oklahoma University students filmed conducting his Sigma Alpha Epsilon brothers along in a racist chant on a bus last month.","A letter of thanks penned by Masters champion Jordan Spieth when he was 16-years-old has surfaced which reinforces his nice guy image .

"A restaurant in Chicago has been voted the best restaurant in the world for a fourth year running. Alinea, run by the talented Grant Achatz has retained its crown as the best restaurant in the world, the annual poll by luxury magazine Elite Traveler revealed. The eatery, which is Chicago’s only three-Michelin-starred restaurant,  is the brainchild of culinary prodigy Grant Achatz and features taffy balloons, edible tablecloths and cinnamon bark chopsticks. Scroll down for video . Alinea, a restaurant in Chicago has been voted the best restaurant in the world for a fourth year running. Alinea, run by the talented Grant Achatz has retained its crown as the best restaurant in the world, the annual poll by luxury magazine Elite Traveler revealed . The top 10 featured four American restaurants which are all in New York. Eleven Madison Park came in at fourth position, while Per Se came seventh and Le Bernardin came ninth. Achatz and his business partner Nick Kokonas opened Alinea in 2005, and it quickly became one of America's must-visit restaurants. Having a three-star Michelin star qualifies a restaurant as a place worth traveling to, just to eat at. Achatz's culinary origins, however, are surprisingly humble. He first started cooking when he was a kid, helping his mom and dad at their diner in Michigan. In July 2007, once he achieved culinary fame, Achatz had a scare when he was diagnosed with stage IV tongue cancer, which threatened to take away his sense of taste. El Celler de Can Roca, Spain, came in second place.  Spain has eight in the list while Italy has seven and Australia had five . However, five months later he was able to beat the disease into remission. The US has 19 of the best restaurants in the world, followed by France which boasts 14 and the UK, which has a mere eight. Spain has eight in the list while Italy has seven and Australia had five. Germany, Japan and China have six restaurants respectively which made it into the top hundred. These include Mizai in Kyoto, Japan which placed at number 15, Aqua in Wolsberg, Germany, which came in at number 21 and Hong Kong's Amber. Switzerland, Mexico, Belgium, Singapore and Brazil all had two restaurants each in the list. Three restaurants in South Africa -  The Test Kitchen, Cape Town (44); Tasting Room at Le Quartier Francais, Franschhoek (85), and Rust en Vrede, Stellenbosch (87) - were considered the best in the country. Denmark, Austria, Norway, Ireland, Monaco, India, Canada and the UAE all had one restaurant in the top 100 list. The awards also awarded its chef of the year accolade, which this year went to Swiss chef Daniel Humm, chef and co-owner of Eleven Madison Park, which came in a fourth in the list and The NoMad in New York City, which placed 89th. Both Grant Achatz and Heston Blumenthal were shortlisted. Young chef of the year went to three Michelin-starred Eneko Atxa who runs third-best restaurant in the world, Azurmendi in Spain. Head Chef of San Francisco’s Saison Joshua Skenes, and American Southern cuisine specialist Sean Brock were both shortlisted for the accolade.

"As Australians are beginning to feel the onset of winter's chill, Aussies travellers are looking to escape this year's cold in exchange for a European summer. Recent data released by KAYAK.com.au has revealed that most Aussies are planning their mid-year getaways in Europe. Research by the travel search engine further indicates that Aussies are planning to travel abroad between May and August, while seven out of the top ten holiday destinations are in Europe. Australian tourists are planning to holiday in destinations across Europe, the number one choice being the ancient city of Athens in Greece . 1) Athens, Greece . 2) Istanbul, Turkey . 3) Toronto, Canada . 4) Warsaw, Poland . 5) Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam . 6) Dublin, Ireland . 7) Barcelona, Spain . 8) Colombo, Sri Lanka . 9) Santiago, Chile . 10) Vienna, Austria . Debby Soo, Vice President APAC at KAYAK, says Australians don't seem bothered by the cost of their trip, as long as it means they can stay away from the cold. 'Australia is often thought of as a nation of sun-seekers and the upswing of searches for places like Athens, Istanbul and Ho Chi Minh City support that notion,' she said. 'Destinations like Warsaw, Colombo, and Santiago also suggest Aussies are looking for more diverse escapes. 'People don't appear to be put off by distance, cost or the time it takes to reach somewhere – especially if it means they get a break from winter.' Second of the top 10 destinations Aussies are looking to escape to this winter is Istanbul - the cultural and historical heart of Turkey . Another hotspot among Aussie tourists is Toronto in Canada, according to recent data released by KAYAK.com.au .

The number of Australians heading overseas has also increased in recent years, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Between 2002 and 2012, the amount of Australians travelling overseas increased from 3.5 million to 8.2 million. The strong Australian dollar sees Aussies still keen to spend their hard-earned wages on trips overseas and new experiences and sights. Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam is said to be the fifth destinations Aussies are searching for this winter . Dublin, Ireland also makes it on the top 10 planned holiday destinations for Aussie travellers . Barcelona in Spain is one of the seven European countries which make it on the top 10 list .

"The girlfriend of a British student killed in the Alps plane tragedy told last night how he switched flights ‘at the last moment’ - and revealed she did not blame the co-pilot who crashed the jet. Paul Bramley, 28, died when Andreas Lubitz locked the Germanwings flight's captain out of the cockpit before flying the plane into a mountainside, killing all 150 people on board. But girlfriend Anneli Tiirik, 23, said she did not blame Lubitz, 27, who had hidden a sick note on the day of the crash and was found to have researched suicide methods in the days leading up to it. Couple: Anneli Tiirik (right) said she did not blame the co-pilot for the death of her boyfriend Paul Bramley (left) Killer co-pilot: Andreas Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit before flying the plane into a mountainside . She told the Sunday People: ‘I cannot hate or blame someone for being sick. Instead of blaming sick people and trying to understand their motives from the perspective of a health mind, we should concentrate on changing the system that enables such people to be in positions of power.’ The music student - who began dating Mr Bramley four years ago - said she hoped airlines would bring in greater checks, such as brain scans, to prevent similar disasters in future. She said she had waited for Mr Bramley at Manchester Airport, having flown in herself from Estonia, before later learning of the crash. ‘He was originally meant to land in Manchester on the Monday night, but he changed his flight at the last moment for Tuesday. Tribute: Flowers in front of a monument in Le Vernet, France, in homage to victims of the Germanwings flight . Martyn Matthews (centre left, with his family), 50, from Wolverhampton, was among the other Britons killed . ‘That was all the information his mum and I had, because he had switched off his mobile phone. I had a bad feeling because he would never have left me alone waiting like that.’ Probing: Search operations last month at the crash site of the Airbus A320, near Seyne-les-Alpes . She added that she had been at the airport for a few hours when a relative of his came to pick her up. The woman got out of her car with tissues in her hand, and Miss Tiirik then knew ‘the worst had happened’. Originally from Hull, Mr Bramley was studying hospitality and hotel management at Ceasar Ritz College in Lucerne and had been set to start an internship on April 1. He had just finished his first year at the college and was flying home via Dusseldorf from a few days holiday with friends in Barcelona when he was killed. The other Britons killed were Martyn Matthews, 50, from Wolverhampton, and seven-month-old Julian Pracz-Bandres, from Manchester, who died alongside his mother, Marina Bandres Lopez Belio, 37, originally from Spain. Many UK airlines changed their rules in the wake of the crash to ensure two people were in the cockpit at all times. The Mail on Sunday reported last month how Mr Bramley’s father made an emotional appeal for the 150 dead not to be forgotten and demanded airlines be more ‘transparent’. Fighting back tears in Digne, close to where his son perished on March 24, Philip Bramley said: ‘What is relevant is that it should never happen again; my son and everyone on that plane should not be forgotten, ever. I don’t want it to be forgotten, ever.’ He added: ‘I believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly. We put our lives and our children’s lives in their hands. 'I want to see this cloud over this town lifted and the natural beauty be restored and not to be remembered by the action of a single person.’ Stressed pilots warned air chiefs about a possible rise in cockpit suicides a month before the Germanwings disaster, it was claimed today. More than 6,600 captains and first officers were asked about working conditions – with a report revealing allegations that many pilots were becoming ‘ticking time-bombs’. The European Commission-funded study insisted that financial pressures, a lack of job security and excessive working hours were leaving many airmen and women depressed. Professor Peter Turnbull, one of the experts who helped compile the report, said: ‘All these pilots tell you that they still go to work when they know they shouldn't be flying.’ He added: ‘When this report was published, the main discussion around it was what it would take for the industry to take notice. Everyone said a crash.' A British Airline Pilots Association spokesman said: ‘Insecure forms of employment, such as zero-hours contracts, have been a major concern for pilots for some time. ‘However, the Germanwings accident is still under investigation and there is no evidence at this stage that employment conditions were a factor in that tragedy.’","Anneli Tiirik, 23, also reveals boyfriend switched flights 'at last moment'

"A massive extension of Margaret Thatcher’s landmark right-to-buy housing policy will be announced by David Cameron today. In a bold pitch to blue collar voters who delivered Lady Thatcher’s three election victories, the Prime Minister will call the Tories ‘the party of working people’. He will pledge discounts of up to 70 per cent to allow all 1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home. Scroll down for video . Thatcher's plan: Prime Minister David Cameron will announce an extension of the right-to-buy scheme which will allow all 1.3million families in housing association properties to buy their home . The subsidy will be funded by forcing councils to sell off their most expensive properties when they become vacant. Mr Cameron will borrow a phrase used by Mrs Thatcher in her first speech as party leader to declare the ‘dream of a property-owning democracy is alive – and we will fulfil it’. ‘The next Conservative government will extend the right-to-buy to all housing association tenants in this country – 1.3million extra families – a new generation given the security of a home of their own,’ he will say. Mr Cameron is also expected to promise to link the minimum wage to increases in the income tax allowance – meaning more than a million workers on £6.50 an hour will pay no tax at all. Original plan: The right-to-buy scheme became Lady Thatcher’s most famous single policy . Launching his party’s election manifesto, the Prime Minister will urge voters not to risk a change of government: ‘Let’s not waste the past five years. ‘Now is not a time to put it all at risk, but to build on the progress we have made. 'We are the party of working people. So if you want a more secure Britain, if you want a brighter future for your family, and for you, then together, let’s build on what we’ve done – and see this through.’ The pledge to extend right-to-buy, which was introduced in 1980 but has now been stopped in its tracks by Labour in Wales and the SNP in Scotland, will delight the Tory faithful, who were buoyed last night by a six-point poll lead over Labour. Senior figures, including Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson and David Davis, have been calling for the measure to be at the heart of the party’s manifesto. The original right-to-buy saw more than 1.5million council homes being sold off at discounted rates. Leading to a surge in home ownership, it became Lady Thatcher’s most famous single policy. The Coalition government has already increased right-to-buy discounts for council homes, meaning more are moving into the private sector. But most tenants living in homes provided by housing associations – not-for-profit bodies that have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing – do not qualify. Enabling them to buy their homes is expected to require major changes to the 1996 Housing Act, and is likely to be fiercely opposed by housing associations themselves. As well as promoting home ownership, the scheme could also dramatically reduce the vast housing benefit bill. Promises: The Prime MInister, pictured posing for a selfie  as he campaigned in Alnwick on Monday,  will pledge discounts of up to 70 per cent on housing association properties, should the Tories win the election . Currently, taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower paid workers who live in housing association properties. The 1.3million housing association homes are occupied by 2.75million people. ‘At the heart of this manifesto is a simple proposition. We are the party of working people, offering you security at every stage of your life,’ Mr Cameron will say today. ‘If you’re a young person looking for training, if you’re looking for a decent job, if you want to buy your own home, if you’re raising a family and need help with childcare, if you fall ill, and need to rely on our NHS, if you are reaching retirement, and want real security. We are there for you – offering security at every stage of your life.’ Some Labour figures, including former welfare minister Frank Field and former Cabinet minister Alan Milburn, have previously championed the idea of extending the right-to-buy to housing associations. Ruth Davison, of the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said: ‘Extending right-to-buy to housing associations is the wrong solution to our housing crisis. While extending right-to-buy will see some people being able to buy their own home with help from the taxpayer, these are people already living in good secure homes on some of the country’s cheapest rents.’ How does right-to-buy work? Introduced in 1980, it gives council house tenants discounts to buy their home. Labour dropped its opposition to the policy but, in 1999, Tony Blair’s government cut the top discount from £50,000 to £38,000 and sales slowed. What has the Coalition done? It has sought to reinvigorate the scheme, cutting from five to three the number of years tenants need to have been in a home before they can buy it and upping the discounts to a maximum of £77,000 for most areas. Are housing association tenants covered? Housing associations – autonomous, not-for-profit bodies that receive public money and loans from the private sector to provide low-cost homes – are largely exempt. However, around 800,000 HA tenants have a limited ‘right to acquire’ with discounts capped at between £9,000 to £16,000. The other 500,000 tenants lack any right to buy. What are the Tory proposals? They would legislate to give all housing association tenants full right-to-buy. Tenants in houses would get a 35 per cent discount, increasing by 1 per cent for every extra year they have been a tenant. Those in flats will get a 50 per cent discount, going up 2 per cent every year. Discounts for houses and flats would be capped at the lower of 70 per cent or £102,700 in London and £77,000 across the rest of England. How will this be paid for? The Tories say they will make councils sell off expensive properties when they become vacant. Council homes that rank in the most costly third of all properties of that type in their area will be sold off. Around 15,000 such properties become vacant each year, because tenants die or move. The sell-off could net £4.5billion a year. What about the proceeds? They will be split, with a proportion used to replace on a ‘one-to-one’ basis the council homes sold off. The new properties would be more affordable, probably in less expensive locations, and could be built either by a council or housing association. Another slice of the proceeds would be used to fund the new right-to-buy discounts for housing association tenants. The rest would go to create a £1billion fund, enabling councils to bid for cash to develop brownfield land for housing. It would enable them to clean up derelict or contaminated land, and could lead to 400,000 new homes in five years, Tories say.","David Cameron to announce extension to right-to-buy housing policy .

"Kenya has bombed two Al-Shabaab camps in Somalia in the first major military response to last week's attack by the militant group on a Kenyan university that left 148 people dead. Air force jets blitzed compounds in Gondodowe and Ismail, both in the Gedo region bordering Kenya on Sunday, a Kenya Defence Forces source said today. Cloud cover made it difficult to establish how much damage the bombings caused or estimate the death toll. 'We targeted the two areas because according to information we have, those (Al-Shabaab) fellows are coming from there to attack Kenya,' the source said. Kenyan army spokesman, Colonel David Obonyo, later said: 'The two targets were hit and taken out, the two camps are destroyed.' Scroll down for video . Slow response: Kenyan elite troops were called in to aid in the pre-dawn massacre where 148 people were killed, but did not arrive until just before 2pm . Nation in mourning: A woman  cries after she has viewed the body of a relative, one of the 148 people killed in Thursday's attack on a university, at Chiromo funeral home, Nairobi . This picture of a classroom strewn with dead bodies has emerged revealing the true horror of the massacre . Gunmen from the Al Qaeda-aligned group killed 148 people on Thursday when they stormed the Garissa University College campus, some 200km (120 miles) from the Somali border. Kenya has struggled to stop the flow of Al-Shabaab militants and weapons across its porous 700km border with Somalia. Al-Shabaab militants have killed more than 400 people in Kenya since April 2013. An African Union peacekeeping force that includes Kenyan troops carried out arrests and seized ammunition in an Al-Shabaab camp in Gondodowe last August. News of the bombings came after it was claimed Kenyan special forces took at least seven hours to respond to the brutal massacre at Garissa University. Elite troops were called in from Nairobi to Garissa, some 225miles from the capital, to aid in the pre-dawn attack on the university, but soldiers did not arrive until the afternoon, local media claims. The critique comes as one of the four gunmen responsible for the brutal mass-murders has been identified as a lawyer son of a Kenyan government official. Government representatives have defended the long response time, comparing fighting terrorism with being a goalkeeper as 'they only remember the one you missed'. Paraded: The naked bodies of the alleged attackers were driven around Garissa before the pickup truck parked at a primary school . In the primary school playground, hundreds gathered to look at the bodies of the men accused of being the attackers . Kenya's elite Recce Company in Nairobi were called in as soon as the first reports of Thursday's attack emerged, which took place around 5.30am at Garissa University College. However, as troops were flown in from the capital, help did not arrive at the scene until just before 2pm, Kenyan newspaper Nation reports. 'This is negligence on a scale that borders on the criminal,' the Nation wrote in its editorial on Sunday, recalling how survivors said 'the gunmen, who killed scores of students with obvious relish, took their time.' Some journalists based in Nairobi who drove to Garissa after hearing the first reports of the attack arrived before the special forces, who came by air. Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed defended the slow response time to the massacre, where 148 people were killed, using a football analogy. 'Fighting terrorism is like being a goalkeeper,' she said. 'You have 100 saves and nobody remembers them. They remember that one that went past you.' Interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka also dismissed the criticism. 'If you look at how we responded it was not bad at all, say, compared to Westgate,' he told the Nation. 'It takes time to assess and make the decisions, escalating it from National Security Advisory Committee to the National Security Council and then to scramble the elite units, get them to the airport and fly them to Garissa which is a two hour flight. There were many moving parts.' A crowd gathers outside the morgue to catch a glimpse of the corpses of the alleged terrorists who killed 148 . Members of the public gather outside the mortuary window to view the bodies of the alleged attackers in the mortuary . People gather to catch a glimpse of the bodies of the alleged terrorists at the hospital mortuary in Garissa . Yesterday, the interior ministry revealed the identity of one of the four gunmen responsible for the massacre on Thursday. Abdirahim Mohammed Abdullahi was the son of a government chief in Mandera County, Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said. The chief had reported his son missing last year and said he feared that he had gone to Somalia, said Njoka. Abdullahi graduated from the University of Nairobi with a law degree in 2013 and was viewed as a 'brilliant upcoming lawyer,' according to someone who knew him. It is not clear where he worked before he disappeared last year, Njoka said. On Saturday, the decomposing bodies of Abdullahi and his three accomplices accused of carrying out the brutal massacre were paraded in front of a large crowd at a primary school. The authorities drove the naked, bloated corpses of the four alleged terrorists around the town in a pickup truck from the mortuary to Garissa Primary School. Hundreds of people, some grieving for the loved ones they lost in the siege, gathered in the sweltering heat to catch a glimpse of the men who are believed to be responsible. Pictures of the crowds and the bodies piled onto the vehicle are being shared on social media. Four attackers died at Garissa, but only Abdullahi has been named. It was hoped that crowds viewing the corpses might identify them. Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, emerged after two days of hiding inside wardrobe at the university, and was initially too petrified to believe police officers were not al-Shabaab gunmen . Survivor Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding and drinking body lotion to survive, was rescued . Earlier in the day, security forces rescued Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding in a wardrobe at Garissa University College and drinking body lotion to survive. Survivor Ms Cheroitich, who hid under a pile of clothes, spoke about her ordeal following her rescue. She told reporters that she was initially too petrified to come out of the wardrobe, but a lecturer she knew eventually convinced her that police officers were not the al-Shabaab gunmen - 50 hours after the barbaric attack began. Kenyan troops searching the building were alarmed when they heard sounds coming from inside a wardrobe. A police officer said: 'She kept asking for reassurance from the security forces they were not al-Shabaab before she could come out. 'She was given milk and rushed to the Garissa hospital, where she is being observed before being given counselling.' Speaking later in hospital, the survivor said she told officers from inside the wardrobe: 'How do I know that you are the Kenyan police?' 'I was just praying to my God,' Ms Cheroitich, a Christian, said. Four other survivors from the massacre at Garissa University College were found yesterday. A photograph from inside one of the classrooms at the university has emerged, showing at least 12 bodies strewn across the floor, which is covered in blood. Survivors: A woman reacts after seeing her son who was rescued from the Garissa University College attack . Relatives are reunited with their loved ones who survived the attack (centre) at Nyayo stadium in Kenya's capital Nairobi . At least three people appear to have been huddled in fear in the corner of the room when they were murdered by the militant Islamists. The terrorists raided the university early on Thursday morning, overwhelming guards and murdering people they suspected of being a Christian. A total of 148 people were killed in the  siege, with the gunmen shooting and beheading those who could not recite the Koran. Most of those killed were students but two police officers, one soldier and two watchmen are among the dead. Kenya's interior minister, Joseph Nkaissery said the four terrorist gunmen had strapped themselves with explosives. When officers shot at them, they exploded 'like bombs' and shrapnel injured officers. Kenyan security officials  said dozens of hostages were freed and four of the gunmen, believed to be armed with AK-47s, were killed. The Interior Ministry said five suspects had been detained, some while trying to flee to Somalia, where al-Shabaab is based. Four were Kenyans of Somali origin, and the fifth was Tanzanian, the ministry said. Officials said all three were associates of Islamist teacher Mohamed Mohamud, who is believed to have masterminded the attack. There is a £145,000 bounty on his head. A woman who survived the attack (centre) is reunited with relatives at Nyayo stadium in Nairobi . The interior ministry said the three suspects arrested at the border had coordinated the attack. Two people were detained at the university, including a security guard and a Tanzanian man. 'We suspect the Tanzanian, who was hiding in the ceiling, was one of the combatants,' ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said. 'He had ammunition with him when he was arrested on Thursday night. We suspect the guard facilitated the entry (into the university).' In a chilling warning, the terrorist group said more attacks like the university massacre were planned. 'Kenyan cities will run red with blood,' Al-Shabaab said in a statement, according to the SITE intelligence monitoring group. The militants said the barbaric attack was in retaliation for killings carried out by Kenyan troops fighting the rebels in Somalia. 'This will be a long, gruesome war of which you, the Kenyan public, are its first casualties. 'No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath.' Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said that those behind the attack were 'deeply embedded' in Kenya, and called on Kenyan Muslims to help prevent radicalisation. 'Our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities,' he said in a televised speech. 'Radicalisation that breeds terrorism is not conducted in the bush at night. It occurs in the full glare of day, in madrasas, in homes, and in mosques with rogue imams.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A hero doctor put his own life on the line to rescue one of his colleagues, by offering to swap places with her when a knife-wielding patient took her hostage. Accident and emergency doctor Lin Xikun knew exactly what he had to do when he walked in on nurse Long Yufang being threatened with a knife by a bare-chested man. The People's Daily Online reported he immediately offered himself up as an alternate hostage - allowing Long to go free. Hostage: The terrifying moment a man walked into a hospital in China and threatened a nurse with a knife was caught on film . The terrifying situation began at about 11am on April 9, when the man walked into the hospital in Dongguan, Guangdong Province. He had been brought in by police the night before. 'He told people that he didn't have any money to get home and not only did he not find anyone willing to give him the money to go home, he injured his leg in the process,' emergency department nurse Huang Chunyan recalled. When he returned the next day, he was carrying a knife. Video footage shows the man wheeling himself to the pharmacy, before he takes the knife out to threaten the nurse. But when he sat down with her, he reassured her: 'Don't worry, I am not going to harm you.' However, he did ask her to call the police and reporters. But Nurse Long - who realised now she would not be harmed - had already screamed out in fear. Hero: Within moments one of the accident and emergency doctors (right) walked in and took her place . Dr Lin heard the scream, and rushed to her aid. Nurse Huang said: 'Dr Lin then told the man ""Look you are scaring the nurse. She is terrified. You just want a hostage right? Let me swap places with her"".' The hostage taker agreed, and Dr Lin went to sit with him - allowing the nurse, who was clearly terrified, to escape. His ordeal went on for a further 10 minutes before the local police arrived, and the hostage taker voluntarily put the knife down. Gentleman: Doctor Lun Xikun, pictured in the room later, managed to keep him calm until the police arrived . However, his brave actions have won the doctor a legion of fans. 'He is like a real gentleman. Like a God,' one nurse said. A police spokesman said later the man had no intention of harming anyone, but just wanted to highlight his plight.","Man walked into hospital in Guangdong Province and took nurse hostage .

"Enter the term 'CEO' into Google images and you'll be presented with a grid of smiling men in suits, most of them stock images, with a few snaps of Steve Jobs thrown in. Scroll down and you'll eventually find your first female face: none other than Barbie, 'CEO Barbie' to be precise, a doll which first appeared in the Eighties, dressed in a miniskirt and clutching a briefcase. The image of Barbie is the 96th result on the page, and ironically comes from a 2005 spoof article courtesy of The Onion that jokingly states 'women don't run companies'. Spot the stereotype! Barbie is the 96th image to come up on Google Images when you enter the search term 'CEO', after rows and rows of grinning suit-clad men . Several high-powered women, including women's right campaigner Chelsea Clinton, have re-tweeted the results of the search, which is being seen by many as a sad reflection on the general state of women in the workplace. Google, like other search engines, generates images based on a knot of complex algorithms related to file names and key words. The more 'popular' and relevant an image is, the higher up the ranks it will move. After Barbie, the next female - and the first human one - you'll find upon searching Google Images for 'CEO' doesn't pop up until several lines more of men, and is Jessica Herrin, CEO of a jewellery company called Stella & Dot. Incidentally, a new study from the University of Washington recently found that results like these are indeed contributing to gender bias, and perpetuating outdated views on women in the workplace. Shining example? The image (pictured) is of 'CEO Barbie', a doll which first appeared in the 80s, dressed in a miniskirt and clutching a briefcase . Noted: Chelsea Clinton was one of the many high-powered women to retweet the results of the search . The study concluded: 'Manipulated image search results could determine, on average, seven per cent of a study participant’s subsequent opinion about how many men and women work in a particular field.' Earlier this year, it was determined by the Professional Boards Forum’s BoardWatch that for the first time ever, the proportion of women on FTSE 500 boards in the UK had reached 20 per cent. Of the images returned by Google from a 'CEO' search, only 11 per cent were of women. And unlike most scenarios concerning gender inequality, nothing is to blame here but a set of internet algorithms. Funny side: One Twitter user deemed the phenomenon 'hilarious' In a nutshell: The Atlantic pointed out that Google Images' definition of a CEO was 'mostly white guys and Barbie' Misrepresentation: Others hinted that the results were woefully out-of-date .","Barbie is the 96th image to come up when the term 'CEO' is searched .

"Two thieves murdered a pensioner and dumped his body in an abandoned mine then made it look like a cycling accident, a court heard today. Kevin Cooper and Trewen Kevern allegedly beat David Alderson and left him to drown, before using his keys to steal £40,000 from a safe where he also kept a haul of guns. Police originally thought that the 72-year-old victim - a keen cyclist - had died as a result of falling from his bike, because he was dressed in lycra at the time. Killed: David Alderson was found dead in an abandoned copper mine in January last year . But Truro Crown Court heard that Kevern, 22 and Cooper, 34 - two cousins whose relatives were close to Mr Alderson - lured him to a disused mine at Wheal Maid near Carharrack in Devon and killed him in January last year. Prosecutor Martin Meeke QC told the jury: 'David Alderson was beaten about the head, possibly until he was unconscious. His body was dragged to a pond into which he was dumped face down. 'In the pond he drowned. “Whether his head was forced down into the water we cannot be sure. The only survivors were these defendants.”' Trial: Kevin Cooper is accused of murdering Mr Alderson alongside his cousin Trewen Kevern . Cooper and Kevern then went to the victim's flat in Falmouth and used his stolen keys to steal £40,000 in cash which he kept in a safe. Mr Meeke said of Mr Alderson: '”He was a keen cyclist and frequently to be seen around Falmouth on a racing bike. He often wore cycling shoes and leggings even when he was not on his bike. '“He was wearing such an outfit when his body was found in the pond. It was at first thought that he had a cycling accident. '“Cycling was not his only interest. Another interest was guns. He had a collection of guns. All the guns were licensed and were legally held by David Alderson. There were ten of them there.” 'He was a member of the Land’s End Shooting Club and he had a substantial amount of ammunition at his flat –- the guns and ammo were held in two different safes in his flat.' The jury heard that Mr Alderson, who kept the keys to his flat, car and safe on a cord round his neck, was 'not short of cash' and had once withdrawn more than £43,000 in £50 notes from his local bank. He was planning to buy a third safe for 'something highly illegal', believed to be two unlicensed guns, the court was told. Kevern's sister Tammy lived in a flat below Mr Alderson, and grew close to the pensioner before his death, calling him 'granddad', jurors heard. Discovery: Mr Alderson's body was found at the Wheal Maid mine in Cornwall . Mr Alderson gave Tammy a £1,000 gift and changed the terms of his will to leave his estate to her instead of his own estranged children. Mr Meeke said that on the night of his death, Cooper had lured Mr Alderson to the disused copper mine by making him think he was collecting the illegal guns he wanted. After they killed him, Cooper and Kevern made up a cover story about robbing a travellers' site in order to hide the truth from their family, the court heard. Both defendants deny murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","David Alderson, 72, was found dead in a Cornish copper mine last January .

'Our sister Robyn spoke to her for 55 minutes on the phone on Saturday night about how excited she is about marrying him. 'She wants to get married and wants to be there.' Kim Scott said her thoughtful and crafty sister had handmade flower pot table placements and designed invitations for the wedding. 'She was the most thoughtful person - my birthday was on Easter Monday and she didn't message me and that's just not like her,' she said. 'I've lived in London and now I live in Abu Dhabi and if I've ever had a birthday or big event she's the first one to send a card.

The couple got engaged in Thailand and their wedding was planned to take place at the Eat Your Greens function centre in the NSW town of Eugowra. Mr Leeson-Woolley said he last spoke to Ms Scott at 10am on Sunday morning. 'I was in Canowindra, back at mum and dad's place, and she was in Leeton,' Mr Leeson-Woolley told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'Everything seemed pretty fine. 'One of her friends rang her on Easter Sunday and she was saying how she was excited and couldn't wait. That's the last time [anyone heard from her].' Mr Leeson-Woolley told ABC: 'I've been with her for five years and... [her disappearance is] just out of the blue, out of character for her.'

"A Georgia police chief who said he accidentally shot his ex-wife while they slept was indicted on Wednesday on a misdemeanor reckless-conduct charge, a prosecutor said. Peachtree City Police Chief William McCollom called 911 early New Year's Day to report inadvertently shooting his ex-wife, Margaret, as they slept in their suburban Atlanta home. The shooting left Margaret McCollom paralyzed below the waist. McCollom resigned from the chief's job in March. Peachtree City Chief of Police William McCollom, pictured left, dialed 911 to report accidentally shooting his wife Margaret, right, as she slept in their suburban Atlanta home early New Year's Day . Griffin Judicial Circuit District Attorney Scott Ballard said investigators found no evidence McCollom intended to harm Margaret McCollom. However, Ballard said he concluded the shooting could have been prevented. The prosecutor said McCollom told investigators he drank alcohol and took medication to help him sleep. Ballard said the investigation showed that McCollom, a former firearms instructor, woke during the night when he heard barking dogs, prompting him to grab his service handgun from a dresser and search the house. He returned to bed with the gun and told investigators he woke next to the sound of a gunshot, Ballard said. The chief said he suspected he might have been trying in his sleep to move the gun to a nightstand. 'The gun was in the bed, I went to move it, and I put it to a side and it went off,' McCollom told a 911 dispatcher, according to a recording of the call. McCollom worked in policing for nearly 30 years in Wyoming, Florida and Georgia. He resigned from the police chief position in Georgia in March . Investigators found no evidence that McCollom was trying to hurt Margaret. He was indicted on Wednesday on a misdemeanor reckless-conduct charge . Margaret McCollom told police at the hospital that she was asleep when the shooting happened but believed it was an accident, according to state investigators. The couple divorced in 1999 but later reunited. 'When I look at the facts, it appears to me that this is reckless conduct,' Ballard said. If convicted, McCollom could face a year in jail. McCollom's defense attorney, Thomas Cook Jr., did not respond to a message seeking comment. McCollom worked in policing for nearly 30 years in Wyoming, Florida and Georgia. Personnel records showed no evidence of criminality, serious misconduct or recklessness in his past. The New Year's Day shooting happened after McCollom had woken up to a noise and walked around with his gun before bringing it back to bed with him .","William McCollom, the chief of police in Peachtree City, Georgia, called 911 on January 1 to say he had accidentally shot his wife, Margaret .

"A prisoner who helped stab a man in a random attack has been posting photographs of himself posing in his cell on Facebook - just a day after another inmate was filmed partying in jail. Royston Coates, who is serving a 10-year sentence for wounding, boasted about watching TV from prison and showed off his muscles in a string of pictures. He also encouraged friends to call him on his mobile - even though both phones and social media are banned in all prisons. It is the second such incident to emerge within two days, after a murderer was caught drinking prison hooch in a video he shared online. Scroll down for video . Jail: Prisoner Royston Coates has posted a string of photographs from inside his jail cell . Inmates: Coates posed up alongside another prisoner in one of the photos on Facebook . Prison authorities have now shut down the criminal's Facebook account after being alerted to the messages he has posted. Over the past six months, Coates has repeatedly sent out messages to his 300 Facebook friends updating them about his life inside jail. His messages reveal that he has been allowed to watch popular TV shows such as The X Factor and The Only Way Is Essex, as well as an England football match. Photographs taken last month show that he has a television set and DVD player in his cell, with the walls covered in photographs. Facilities: Coates's cell has a television and DVD player, and is covered in photographs . Mugshot: Coates was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2013 for attacking a man . In one of the first posts, from last October, Coates joked: 'Go out or stay in? Hmmmmmm.' In another message, he claimed he was 'glad I am locked away' so he wouldn't have to mix with other people in his home town of Macclesfield, Cheshire. A spokesman for the Prison Service said they were investigating the matter, and had asked Facebook to close the page. Coates was jailed in October 2013 alongside his friend Hayden Whittaker after he admitted helping to stab a man with a kitchen knife. He held the victim down while Whittaker knifed him, shortly after the pair had failed to get in to a block of flats where they were trying to sell drugs. Killer: Dashem Tesfamichael, 30, who was jailed for stabbing a young father, has been filmed partying behind bars, it emerged yesterday . Coates later boasted about what he had gone, sending a text message to friends in which he said 'I put the gun to his head.' The victim suffered a collapsed lung following the savage attack. A prisons spokesman said: 'Anyone caught accessing social networking sites or instructing others to do so on their behalf will be subject to strict disciplinary action. 'No prisoner should be in any doubt that if they break the rules they will be stripped of privileges and may be reported to the police for further action, which may result in extra time being added to their sentence.' It is not known which jail Coates is serving his sentence in. His photographs emerged just a day after a murderer was filmed partying to prison hooch and singing along to rap lyrics in a video shared on WhatsApp. Dashem Tesfamichael, 30, who stabbed a young father to death in 2006, clutched a glass of illegal alcohol in the clip, which also showed a large stash of party food. The footage was captured on a banned mobile phone before being sent out to friends of the prisoners involved.","Royston Coates was jailed for 10 years for holding down a man while his friend stabbed him in a random attack .

"The average woman will spend an eye-watering £18,000 on products for her face in her lifetime, but may be throwing those hard earned pennies down the drain by applying them incorrectly. Indeed, many women make common mistakes every single day that could lead to their skin ageing faster. FEMAIL called on the best dermatologists in the business to shed some light on the classic mistakes women make and to share their vital tips for ensuring you're getting the most from your skincare regime. Scroll down for video . Many women spends hundreds of pounds a month on expensive skincare products but make common mistakes every single day that could lead to their skin ageing faster . DON'T ONLY USE SPF ON HOLIDAY . Perhaps one of the most common misconceptions women have is that you only need to use an SPF in boiling climates. Wrong. In fact, an SPF should be an essential part of your daily skincare regime, says Dr Mike Bell, Skincare Scientific Advisor for Boots UK. 'Protecting your skin from the sun and environmental stress is really important, particularly if you want to proactively delay the signs of ageing,' he said. Even when there isn't a ray of sunshine in the sky, your skin is still at harm. UVA  rays can penetrate glass, meaning your skin is at risk from ageing through your car windows or even when sitting at your desk. Dr. Adam Geyer, Kiehl’s Consulting Dermatologist, concurs. He said: 'Apply a broad spectrum, high SPF sunscreen before heading out the door each morning, with reapplication every 2-3 hours during peak outdoor exposure.' APPLY CREAMS IN THE CORRECT ORDER . Another simple way to make your products work harder (particularly if you've spent a small fortune on them) is applying them in the right order. Indeed, products with a thinner consistency - such as serum - should always be applied before thick face creams. Products with a thinner consistency - such as serum - should always be applied before thick face creams . Those creams with heavier consistencies can actually stop the lighter ones from penetrating the skin and doing the job they've been designed to do - practically making them redundant. NEVER SLEEP WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN . This is a common mistake copious amounts of women make - but one that can easily be rectified. Many people have forehead breakouts due to the oil clogging up their pores. Always tie your hair back loosely before you get into bed. By sleeping with your hair and fringe down, the oils from your locks (not to mention the greasy hairspray and serums you've used in the day) are kept well away from your face. NOT EVERYONE NEEDS A TONER . Cleanse, tone and moisturise is a mantra for millions of women, sold by the beauty industry as a sure-fire way to fresh, glowing skin. But while the benefits of cleansing and moisturising are obvious, part of the routine is simply habit for many women - and few question its benefits: toning. Toning is meant to remove the last traces of dirt and grime, leaving skin dewy and pores closed. According to market intelligence firm Mintel, one in five of us uses toners daily. But many women who religiously apply this classic skincare product don't realise toners can include harsh ingredients such as alcohol, which can dry out even the most oily skin, and parabens, which have been shown to induce allergic reactions. 'The alcohol found in toners can be a trigger for rosacea, increase the risk of breakouts in acne-prone skin or exacerbate sensitivity,' reveals cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting. This means that regular use of toners could leave the skin irritated, inflamed and vulnerable to environmental damage. Dr Bunting believes that even if your toner doesn't harm your skin, its place in your beauty regime may be redundant. 'Soap used to leave behind residues, but today's cleansers are designed to rinse clean and don't disturb the skin's natural equilibrium in the same way, so there's no need to use a toner.' Dr Harold Lancer, author of Kim Kardashian's favourite book, Younger, comments: 'Most skincare regimens include a toner step, but not everyone needs one. 'Toners are primarily formulated to return the skin to its natural ph level. The ph is the balance between acidity and alkalinity in your body. The skin on the face is at its healthiest when it is slightly acidic. Acid prohibits bacterial growth that can contribute to acne and helps maintain the skin’s barrier function, keeping moisture in and harmful substances out. Alkaline skin is more prone to lines, wrinkles and sun damage. 'All that would seem to make toner a must, but if you have relatively normal skin, exfoliate regularly, and use a cleanser that does not strip your skin of its natural moisture, you should be able to maintain a healthy ph level. Lifestyle changes will do the rest.' By sleeping with your hair and fringe down, the oils from your locks (not to mention the greasy hairspray and serums you've used in the day) are kept well away from your face . DON'T OVER-CLEANSE . While the key to acne-free skin is squeaky clean skin, you can do more harm than good by over washing your face. You can also over exfoliate by buffing away too much of your top skin layer, which serves as a protective barrier against environmental toxins and sun damage - both of which accelerate the ageing process. Dr. Geoff Genesky, Kiehl’s Head of Laboratory, emphasises that consumers should also be careful to follow product instructions very carefully, especially when using products that have anti-ageing benefits but that can be a bit harsh to the skin's outermost layers. 'Making sure to wear sunscreens when using retinol or alpha hydroxy acid products comes to mind,' he said. 'As does limiting application to once or twice a week in the case of products with high concentrations of acid exfoliating ingredients or cleansers with particularly rough scrub particles.' DON'T USE TOO MUCH PRODUCT - AND DON'T BE LURED BY EXPENSIVE CREAMS . 'Don't be swayed by marketing hype - using the right product for your skin type is key,' advises Emma Leslie, editor at Escentual.com. 'Buying a cult £120 moisturiser that's optimised for dry skin when your skin is oily means that you won't reap its full benefits, and your skin will start to misbehave. Chat to a professional, they'll be more than happy to point you in the right direction.' Leslie also warns of the dangers of getting carried away and applying too much product. 'Applying more product doesn't mean you'll achieve better results,' she said. 'In fact, applying too much product could overload and irritate the skin, particularly around the sensitive eye area. Apply less product and pay more attention to the way you apply it (many brands will provide a step-by-step specialised application method), and you'll glean greater results.' USE THE RIGHT TECHNIQUES TO APPLY YOUR EYE CREAM . Cammie Cannella, Kiehl’s Vice President of Global Education and Customer Relations, explains another important tip: to be sure that you don’t use too much of any type of product in the eye area, to avoid overwhelming the skin there and potentially exacerbating any puffiness. 'For best results, dispense a very small amount - about the size of a pea - onto your fingertips and dot the product around the orbital bone first, then go back and lightly pat or press the formula into your skin (ideally using the ring finger, which is weakest and therefore the least likely to unnecessarily pull or stretch the delicate skin around the eyes),' she said.","Women spend £18,000 on products for the face in one lifetime .

"A restaurant manager feared huge debts after forking out £2,000 on a bizarre addiction which meant he had to wear new underpants every day. Curt Almond, 26, from Bristol, spent at least £40 a week buying new Calvin Klein boxers so that he could slip into a new 'crisp pair' every day of the week. But after wiping out most of his savings, Mr Almond realised that it was 'bankruptcy or boxers' - and that he needed to wean himself off his addiction. Scroll down for video . Addicted: Nando's manager Curt Almond almost landed himself in debt after forking out £2,000 on a bizarre addiction which meant he had to wear new underpants every day . Obsession: The 26-year-old, from Bristol (pictured left and right) spent at least £40 a week buying new Calvin Klein boxers so that he could slip into a brand new 'crisp pair' every day of the week . He has now reverted back to the normal routine of wearing and washing his boxers several times over - and has saved himself thousands in the process. He said: 'When I first started wearing new boxers every day, I loved it. I treated myself to really nice Calvin Klein ones. It always felt great to slip into a crisp pair. 'It got to the point where I didn't feel comfortable unless I was wearing a new pair. 'But, eventually, my money started to run out and I had to buy budget ones instead. Finally, when a huge bill came in one day, I looked at finances and realised that I was spending all my savings on underpants. So I managed to wean myself off the compulsion.' During his year-long addiction, Mr Almond bought 365 pairs of new boxers - which were then thrown into the bin after just one wear. He said his bizarre habit began after the breakdown of a relationship. 'Crisp pair': During his year-long addiction, Mr Almond bought some 365 pairs of new boxers - and threw most pairs into the bin after just one wear . Whenever they stayed over, they would wear the same underwear for several days running, which he thought was 'disgusting'. So, in a bid to get over his former partner, Mr Almond started wearing a fresh pair every day. He also moved back in with his mother, meaning he had extra money to spend on his obsession. He said: 'I did all my own washing and that meant that my mum never found out about my addiction to clean boxers. 'Luckily she never looked through my bin - it was full of boxers that I had only worn for one day at a time and then just thrown away. 'The way I saw it was that people spend so much money on cigarettes and alcohol. For me, this was just how I chose to spend my money.' Mr Almond eventually began feeling the squeeze when his mother increased his rent by £100. But, as his budget grew tighter, he simply reverted to budget boxers instead. 'At Christmas, when the shops changed their stock, I had no choice but to buy loads of boxers that had 'jingle balls' printed on them,' he said. But Mr Almond was again forced to rethink his lifestyle when he  received a hefty insurance bill through the post. He said: 'All of my savings had to go on paying my insurance. I tried to pick up odd jobs to fund my love for new boxers but it still wasn't enough to keep afloat. I knew I had to stop. 'After forking out for that big payment, I went upstairs and noticed that I only had three new pairs of boxers left. I panicked and started asking myself if my addiction to new boxers was weird. 'For the first time in a year, I mustered up the courage to put a pair of boxers in the wash. It felt really strange. 'Eventually, I started to rationalise it by telling myself that it was only me that had worn these boxers and I'm a hygienic person so they must be fine.' It was only once Mr Almond overcame his boxer addiction that he felt comfortable chatting about it with his friends. 'I was watching a TV show about people with weird habits and I remember telling my friend about my addiction to fresh boxers,' he said. 'She said that I was absolutely crazy and couldn't understand why on earth I spent so much money on underwear.'","Curt Almond, from Bristol, spent £40 per week on new Calvin Klein boxers .

"It seemed a somewhat unusual honeymoon destination for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. But the couple insist they fell in love with the 'calm' of Ireland on a previous visit and just had to return. Of course, they did it in style, staying at the 18th-century Ballyfin, at the foot of the Slieve Bloom Mountains in the centre of the country. And now the five-star hotel has been given the highest accolade, declared the grandest hotel in Ireland by Conde Nast Traveller magazine. Splendour!

Set at the foot of the Slieve Bloom Mountains, the five-star Ballyfin played host to the famous couple last May . The high profile couple were seen travelled by Mercedes to the hotel during their first holiday as a married couple, last year. The famous couple headed to the picturesque Co Laois area, following tying the knot in an opulent Italian wedding ceremony last May 24. Many were baffled at them shunning popular exotic holiday destinations such as the Seychelles and Maldives but Kim tweeted her explanation. 'We spent Kanye's bday in Ireland a few years back & fell in love with it! Its such a calming relaxing place!' The couple enjoyed a relaxing stay at the hotel, which has only 20 rooms on its 614 acre estate .

Last year Tourism Minister Paschal Donohoe revealed that visitors to Ireland from Great Britain increased by 11.3 per cent, with an extra 178,200 visitors on 2013. Visits from Kim and Kayne, combined with the filming of Game of Thrones, helped to boost these numbers dramatically. Ballyfin remained discreet on the impact of the couple's stay on its own popularity.

"A new vaccine to stimulate the body's immune system could offer a cure for HIV. The 'kick and kill' strategy aims to eradicate the virus, by stimulating the immune system - the body's natural defence mechanism - with a vaccine. Researchers believe the injection could flush out dormant HIV hiding in white blood cells with a chemical 'kick', allowing a boosted immune system to identify and kill the cells. The theory, developed by researchers at University College London, the University of Oxford and the University of North Carolina, is based on a single patient case study. Scientists hope a new 'kick and kill' vaccine could flush out HIV hidden in the body before stimulating a person's own immune system to kill the cells . 'Our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails,' study co-author Dr Ravi Gupta, of UCL, said. 'We're still a long way from being able to cure HIV patients, as we still need to develop and test effective vaccines, but this study takes us one step closer by showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce.' The study looked at a single 59-year-old man in London who was an 'elite controller' - meaning his immune system could control HIV for a long period of time without his needing treatment. Elite controllers, who make up 0.3 per cent of HIV patients, eventually require treatment to prevent progression to AIDS. But they can go a lot longer without treatment because their immune systems are more active against HIV. The patient in the study had both HIV and myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow. The bone marrow produces white blood cells, including those that help to control HIV. Pioneering new treatments for HIV, flu, ebola and cancer are being developed by scientists harnessing man-made DNA. Experts have discovered how to create strands of artificial DNA, each mimicking a different killer disease, and inject them into patients. The idea is that the patients' immune systems will then be able to recognise the threats and eliminate them. Inovio, one of the companies behind the technique, has begun trials in humans, after strong results in the lab. The American company is using the method to attack flu, ebola and certain types of cancer – as well as HIV and hepatitis. Experts have already started trials on female patients to see if they can stop them developing cervical cancer. To treat the patient's myeloma, his bone marrow was completely removed and replaced using his own stem cells. When the bone marrow was removed, the immune system was severely impaired, allowing the HIV to re-activate and replicate. This caused the level of virus in his bloodstream to rise from fewer than 50 copies per millilitre to approximately 28,000 copies per ml before is immune system's function returned. When the patient's immune function returned about two weeks after the transplant, the levels of HIV in his bloodstream rapidly fell. His immune system reduced HIV levels at a similar rate to the most powerful treatments available, bringing them back down to 50 copies per ml within six weeks. Professor Deenan Pillay, also of UCL, said: 'By measuring the strength of the immune system required to keep this virus under control in this rare individual, we have a better idea of the requirements for successful future treatment. 'We also managed to identify the specific immune cells that fought the infection. 'This is a single patient study, but nevertheless it is often the unusual patients who help us to understand the HIV disease process.' The man was not given any anti-HIV drugs, due to concerns about side-effects affecting his cancer treatment. The researchers noted it is possible that an equally strong immune response in combination with powerful drugs could have cured the HIV completely, however they state that is far from certain. Dr Ravi Gupta, of UCL, said: 'Our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails. We're still a long way from being able to cure HIV patients, but this study takes us one step closer, showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce' 'We need to be cautious in interpreting observations from a single subject,' said Dr Nilu Goonetilleke, who began working on the study at the University of Oxford and is now at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 'However, demonstration even from a single subject, that our immune system can rapidly control HIV-1 tells us a lot about the types of immune responses we should target and augment through vaccination.' Dr Gupta adds: 'Drugs to stimulate reactivation of dormant HIV are still imperfect, and we do not know if they would be able to flush out all of the HIV from the body. 'Likewise, it remains to be seen whether a vaccine could enable a normal HIV patient's immune system to kill HIV with the full strength of an elite controller. 'Our study is a proof of principle and the results are promising, but it is unlikely to lead to a cure for at least a decade.' The study was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.","Scientists believe future vaccine could trigger body's immune system .

"Ed Miliband was accused of 'offensive' behaviour 'touching on racism' by a Sikh community leader yesterday after banning journalists from a place of worship. The Labour leader visited the Gurdwara – a Sikh temple – during a campaign tour of the Midlands on Wednesday. But his team banned national media journalists from the event – despite the fact that Gurdwaras are traditionally open to all. Worshippers were also banned from using cameras and phones to take pictures of the Labour leader, who had donned a red head-covering to comply with Sikh customs. Scroll down for video . Behind closed doors: Ed Miliband, donning a red head-covering to comply with Sikh customs, in secret footage from the Gurdwara . During the visit, Mr Miliband would answer only a small number of questions from the Sikh press. But even one of the Sikh journalists was allegedly asked to leave Labour's battlebus after straying from a list of agreed questions. Davinder Singh, an adviser to the Sikh Federation who attended the visit, said the attitude of the Labour leader's team went against the ethos of his faith. He said the decision to shut people out of the temple contradicted the tradition that the doors to a Gurdwara are always open to all. And he suspected the Labour leader did not want to be widely pictured in a head-covering in case the pictures were embarrassing – something he said was 'offensive, even touching on racism'. He told the Daily Mail: 'The whole thing was very carefully stage managed. They said there will be no cameras whatsoever, they were telling people not to even use their phones to take any pictures inside – that is unheard of inside a Gurdwara. Some of the party officials were downright rude. 'My children, who are three and six, were ushered out of the way. The whole thing did not feel right. 'It was a missed opportunity on his part and it left some people feeling offended. You don't do that in a Gurdwara – usher people around.' The incident will increase concern about the 'controlling' nature of Labour's election campaign, in which the Press and members of the public are kept at arm's length from the party leader – a criticism also levelled at the Tories. Public visit: David Cameron at the Golden Temple in Amritsar . Mr Singh said he suspected Mr Miliband was trying to ingratiate himself with the Sikh community but was 'worried about the reaction of non-Sikhs' if he was seen in the headgear at the Leamington and Warwick Gurdwara. 'There's a feeling that they wanted publicity within the Sikh community,' he added. 'They wanted people to know he had ticked the box of visiting a Gurdwara – but that he didn't want the publicity to go any wider.' Mr Singh, whose organisation is urging politicians to sign up to a ten-point Sikh Manifesto, said it was disappointing that Mr Miliband had refused to pose for pictures or make a public statement about Labour's stance on Sikh issues. He added: 'Labour told the media it was a private visit, but that's nonsense. Was he going there for prayers? Of course not – it was part of the campaign.' Labour dismissed the criticism and said journalists were barred out of respect to worshippers. But it is thought that campaign chiefs are determined to prevent Mr Miliband creating an embarrassing photo opportunity in the run-up to the General Election. He has endured a string of such photo opportunities in the past, including excruciating pictures of him trying to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year. Labour campaign bosses are determined to prevent similar gaffes and are exerting tight control on access to the leader. Sky News broadcast footage on Wednesday evening showing the doors of the Gurdwara being closed after Mr Miliband entered. Only an official Labour Party photographer was allowed inside, and pictures were not released to the national media. The only images of him inside came from shaky mobile phone footage smuggled out by a worshipper. It showed that once inside, Mr Miliband took off his shoes and donned a red head-covering known as a ramal. He was also presented with a traditional orange scarf, or siropa, which is given as a mark of respect to dignitaries. Broadcasters requested access to the event but were refused. But Mr Miliband held a brief Press briefing for three journalists from the Sikh media on Labour's battlebus. They were told they could each ask one question, which was agreed in advance. But a witness said one was asked to leave after departing from the agreed question. He was eventually allowed to stay and ask if the party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. A journalist from the Sikh media asked Mr Miliband if his party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar (file picture used) Shalbinder Singh Malle, secretary of the Leamington and Warwick Gurdwara, which co-operated with Labour over the visit, insisted worshippers were not offended by the event. He added: 'It went smoothly and we felt it was a success. 'We were told not to take pictures and one or two people may have been disappointed but I wouldn't say anyone was upset or offended by it. No one complained.' The row risks provoking cynicism about Mr Miliband's motives. Electoral experts believe Britain's 500,000 Sikhs could play a key role at next month's election. A Labour spokesman said: 'It is ridiculous and untrue to say that Ed Miliband did not want to be pictured at the Gurdwara. 'The visit was widely covered by the national and Sikh press and many worshippers took pictures inside with Ed Miliband. 'To respect worshippers in the prayer hall, Ed Miliband gave press interviews, including with the Sikh Federation, outside the temple.' But Mr Singh said the visit contrasted with a visit by David Cameron in February to the Gurdwara, adding: 'People who were there said it was very different. He was more relaxed and people could come and go, which is strange because you'd think the Prime Minister would have much tighter security.' Mr Cameron also visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar in 2013.","Labour leader accused of 'offensive' behaviour during visit to Sikh temple .

"Sandra Malcolm's body was discovered at her home in Cape Town, South Africa . A British ex-pat has been found hacked to death at her home in South Africa, it has emerged today. Sandra Malcolm's body was found at her Cape Town home by her grandson who reportedly climbed through a window when nobody answered the door. Reports in South Africa suggest the 74-year-old's attackers had mutilated her - although police have yet to confirm this. Mrs Malcolm, originally from Dundee in Scotland, was found on Sunday morning at the Capri Mews complex in the Marina Da Gama area of the city. The pensioner had been planning to return to Scotland next month to visit family in Tayside. She had lived in South Africa for 35 years and is survived by two daughters, three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Her nephew, Colin Chalmers, of Dundee, today said the murder had left the family 'distraught'. 'I'm absolutely gobsmacked, I've never had to deal with anything like this before, it's completely shocking. 'All I know is that my auntie has been murdered, I don't want to court any of the rumours around it because we know very little at this stage.' One neighbour, who asked not to be identified, told reporters they were horrified by the murder. He said: 'This is a quiet community, this is shocking, I still cannot believe it. 'I saw her on Saturday afternoon last. She had some friends over.' He described his murdered neighbour as 'friendly' and 'burly', adding: 'It's so strange because we didn't hear anything, no struggle or a gunshot. 'The grandson, we understand, found her after climbing through the bathroom window. 'I left for church before 10am and I walked past her flat and I didn't hear or see anything. When I came back from church I saw the police vans and they said she had been murdered. 'The family is so shaken they are not in a state to speak.' Details are still emerging of how the pensioner came to be found at her flat. Mrs Malcolm, originally from Dundee in Scotland, was found on Sunday morning at the Capri Mews complex in the Marina Da Gama area of the city (pictured) South African news networks reported that neighbours said the pensioner was last seen with friends on Saturday afternoon. Police in Cape Town declined to comment on the circumstances of her death but said a post-mortem will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death. Forensic experts and detectives  combed the scene for hours on Sunday. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said: 'The motive for the killing is unknown at this stage. A post-mortem will be held to establish the exact cause of death.' The murder comes amid a  wave of anti-immigrant violence in South Africa. Hundreds of African immigrants have fled their homes in the country in recent weeks to escape xenophobic attacks and protests.","Reports suggest Sandra Malcolm's body was mutilated by her attackers .

"Britain should be wary of adopting trendy pupil-led teaching techniques from Scandinavia because they may be making standards worse, a new report claims. Progressive education experts in the UK have long pushed for our system to emulate the group work and independent study that is popular in Finland, which has regularly topped international league tables. But a new analysis of Finnish education suggests pupil aptitude has actually declined since the country embraced fashionable teaching methods. Pupil-led techniques: A new analysis of Finnish education suggests pupil aptitude has actually declined since the country embraced fashionable teaching methods (file picture) According to research by the Right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies, Finland only did so well before because of the influence of traditional teacher-led methods. But it has slipped down international rankings tables as the new liberal techniques became more widespread. The findings will add weight to arguments by Michael Gove that a return to traditional teacher-led lessons are the way to raise standards in schools. The former education secretary made it his mission to fight the ‘progressive’ methodology of the education establishment, which he referred to as ‘the Blob’. Report author Gabriel Heller Sahlgren said: ‘My research shows that the methods that we have been trying to push through in England and America for years are not good for test scores. ‘Pupils who aren’t motivated are not necessarily interested in learning. If you give them too much freedom, it’s difficult to know if they’re learning anything. It’s not very effective. Former education secretary: The findings will add weight to arguments by Michael Gove (pictured) that a return to traditional teacher-led lessons are the way to raise standards in schools . ‘Here in the UK, there is a tendency to abolish traditional methods because they’re old, but we need to decrease this bias.’ Finland was proclaimed an ‘education superpower’ after appearing at the top of international rankings tables between 2001 and 2009. Many in the education establishment have pushed for the Finnish model of pupil-led learning to be used as an inspiration for the British system. Instead of giving whole-class instruction from a blackboard, teachers have instead adopted small group work, independent learning and educational activities and games. But today’s report, which examines education policy and performance in Finland over the last half century, found implementation of the new methods coincided with a recent slump in performance. Between 2006 and 2012, Finland’s performance in PISA tests run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) declined. It sunk by 18 points in scientific literacy, 23 points in reading literacy, and 29 points in mathematical literacy. In 2006, it was second in the world for maths, while in 2012 it was 12th. Rankings for reading and science also slipped several places. Report author: Gabriel Heller Sahlgren (above) said the methods 'are not good for test scores' Teachers training in the 1990s learnt the new methods and only began to teach them in the 2000s, the report said. Before this, education in Finland had been traditional, hierarchical and teacher-led, according to the author, and it was this that was responsible for its stellar performances in the league tables. Mr Sahlgren added: ‘The reforms in Finland that people are crediting with its improvement actually only began in the early 2000s. ‘When Finland was improving, the education system was very authoritative and teacher-led. Finland was improving in the 1980s but rounded off in around 1995. In the early 2000s, it started to fall.’ The report, titled ‘Real Finnish Lessons’, said that Finland’s education system had instead been buoyed by socio-economic factors until recently. These included a strong work ethic and cultural sense of responsibility, as well as the high status of teachers leading to talented individuals entering the profession. Mr Gove prompted a fierce backlash from teachers two years ago after saying he wanted them to stop using innovative approaches which ‘dumbed down’ education. He gave an example of ‘making Plasticine models to represent Hitler’s main aims as Fuhrer’ as a method which had ‘nothing to do with passing on knowledge’. He said part of the problem was a ‘belief that education should not be an activity in which the teacher imparts knowledge to the child but a pursuit - by the child - of what it finds interesting’. Mr Sahlgren is Director of Research at the Centre for the Study of Market Reform of Education think tank.","Finnish methods include pupils working in small groups or independently .

"Depraved militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have savagely beheaded a man accused of practising sorcery and witchcraft. Harrowing images of the killing are being shared by bloodthirsty supporters of the terror group on social media and show the victim lying in a pool of blood with his severed head resting on his back. One of those distributing the sickening pictures is a man claiming to be a British militant fighting for the terror group who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Bakr al-Britani. The gruesome photographs are understood to have been taken near Tikrit in Iraq's Salah al-Din province, where members of the Iraqi Army and allied Shiite volunteer militias have had great success in forcing the terrorists to withdraw in recent weeks. Scroll down for video . Sick: This photograph shows the blindfolded and bound man wearing a brown jumpsuit as a bearded terrorist lifts an 18-inch long kukri machete high into the air ready to behead the defenceless victim . Harrowing: This image - far too gruesome to publish in full - shows a close-up of the man's lifeless body, with his severed head resting on his back and surrounded by prayer beads . The exact crime the beheading victim is accused of committing is not known, but images of his violent death were uploaded to Twitter saying he was a 'sorcerer'. Terror: One of those distributing the images is a man claiming to be a British ISIS jihadi who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Bakr al-Britani . The first photo shows the blindfolded and bound man wearing a brown jumpsuit as a bearded terrorist lifts an 18-inch long kukri machete high into the air ready to behead the defenceless victim. A second image far too gruesome to publish in full then shows a close-up of the man's lifeless body, with his severed head resting on his back. It is the exactly the same position British and American hostages are placed in after being savagely beheaded by ISIS' British executioner in chief Mohammed Emwazi, also known as Jihadi John. Surrounding the man's lifeless body are dozens of brightly-coloured prayer beads. It is likely the man had been selling the items, which ISIS terrorists consider bid’ah, meaning a 'reprehensible innovation'. As is so often the case with ISIS' brutal public executions and amputations, huge crowds are seen in the streets to witness the man's beheading. Young men and children and seen lining up in a town square and jostling for position as they struggle to get a better view of the atrocity. Horror: The execution in Salah al-Din took place as Iraqi forensic teams working in the nearby, newly liberated city of Tikrit started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain the bodies of up to 1,700 soldiers . Girsly task: ISIS overran Saddam Hussein's hometown last June, capturing the 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee Camp Speicher - an air base previously used by U.S. troops on the outskirt of Tikrit . The execution in Salah al-Din province took place as Iraqi forensic teams working in the nearby, newly liberated city of Tikrit started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain the bodies of up to 1,700 soldiers brutally murdered by ISIS last year. Kamil Amin from Iraq's Human Rights Ministry said the work started on Monday on eight locations inside Tikrit's complex of presidential palaces, where much of the killing took place. ISIS overran Saddam Hussein's hometown last June, capturing around 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee Camp Speicher, an air base previously used by U.S. troops on the outskirt of Tikrit. Later, the Islamic State group posted graphic images online that appeared to show its gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after loading the captives onto flatbed trucks and then forcing them to lay face-down in a shallow ditch, their arms tied behind their backs. Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in Saddam Hussein's army. Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the late Iraqi dictator's military. Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq and became involved with ISIS either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator's 2006 death. Influence: Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of Saddam Hussein . One former Syrian rebel who became an ISIS regional commander told the Washington Post that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group's day-to-day business were ex members of Hussein's Baathist army. During one meeting in which he dared to disagree with fellow commanders at an ISIS meeting, the man calling himself Abu Hamza was placed under arrest on the orders of a masked man who had sat silently and almost unnoticed at the side of the room, listening and taking notes. Although the enigmatic commander's real name was never revealed to him, Hamza said that he later discovered that the man had been an intelligence officer for the Iraqi army before joining ISIS. The same went for the other ISIS commanders Hamza met, who either used code names or no names at all in the hope of concealing their past as members of Hussein's army. As well as their extensive military expertise, another key element of the commanders' appointments has been the fact the ex-Baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to Hussein's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s. Crucially, oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income.","Terrorists beheaded the man in a public square in Salah al-Din province .

"There is often a negative stigma attached with being a female who chooses to live alone, especially in Sydney's affluent Eastern suburbs. 39-year-old Julie Sweet has lived alone in Clovelly for five years and has never been happier . But while female solo-dwellers are being labelled as sad, lonely and socially isolated, a new study has shown that of these women, the majority have university degrees, reputable careers and healthy social lives. The study conducted by the Australian Institute of Family Studies shows that a quarter of Australians have opted for solo living and 70 percent of the women are more likely to have a university degree than the men. According to Daily Life, the affluent suburbs of Potts Point, Rushcutters Bay and Elizabeth Bay make up nearly 60 percent of solo households. This means that the women who live alone in the Eastern suburbs are fast becoming more successful than their male counterparts. However, many feel as though they are still judged for their residential choice. 39-year-old Julie Sweet feels that she is often stigmatised by friends and family. 'I feel that people often judge when you don't fit into a certain box,' Ms. Sweet told Daily Mail Australia. 'I am constantly questioned by extended family and friends of friends on why I continue to live alone.' Ms Sweet had lived with close friends for all of her life, and although feels she was spoilt with them, she now resides in Clovelly in Sydney's East by herself and has never been happier.

"Riddick Bowe was once seen as the world's best heavyweight fighter and reportedly had $15million, but he is now offering to post tweets for $20 . He was once the double heavyweight champion, with a career that allowed him to retire from the ring with a rumoured fortune of $15million. Now Riddick Bowe, of Maryland, has found himself tweeting happy birthday messages and adverts for insurance firms for anyone who pays him $20. The 46-year-old recently offered to 'tweet anything' for people who credit him through PayPal, sharing the messages with his 450,000 followers. His offer seems a far cry from the fame he enjoyed in the 1990s as the only man who could beat Evander Holyfield. Bowe explained his plan to this thousands of followers in a post. He said: 'I will tweet anything to anyone just paypal me $20 bowe@riddickbowe.com. Thats whats up. Bowe . And as apparent proof of his pledge a number of bizarre messages have since appeared on the former boxing champion's Twitter account. One post read: 'I tell you all now @JakeLeeYes is twice the fighter I ever was. Thats whats up. Bowe' And in others he posted messages from people asking for dates and venting their frustrations at taxi drivers, as well as promoting websites, small businesses and hotels. He wrote: 'Im now in the business of endorsing yo companies helping those small business get off them ground Im try help the little guy thats what i do.' His actions seem a fall from his hey day in the 1990s when Bowe was widely regarded as the best heavyweight fighter in the world. He motched up victories over former champion Evander Holyfield in 1992 at Caesars Palace and Andrew Golota, who was disqualified for low blows. He retired in 1997 and went on to join the Marine Corps Reserves, but dropped out while he was training. Next the boxer's fortunes were to take an even more disastrous turn after he was imprisoned for 18 months for domestic violence after he held his now ex-wife and children against their will. In 2004 he returned to the ring and won three bouts in unconvincing fashion. Bowe posted a message to his 451,000 followers offering to post any messages they wanted, and his tweets since then - from asking for dates to promoting companies - has proved that he means his offer . By 2005 Bowe had filed for bankruptcy - a stark contrast to the days when he was rumoured to have $15million career earnings. His last fight was a win over Gene Pukall in Germany in 2008. By 2009 he was at a New Jersey flea market, according to the New York Times, selling his wares and speaking of his aim to return to the ring. In 2013 Bowe made a comeback as a Muay Thai fighter, but was spectacularly beaten in the second round. At the time he said he had tried the sport because he was bored of retirement and needed the cash. Bowe (right) faced Evander Holyfield (left) in 1992 and became the first person to beat the undefeated boxer . Bowe (left) is pictured in 2004, having beaten his opponent Marcus Rhode at Fire Lake Casino Oklahoma . The boxing champion has a chequered history with Twitter - being forced to apologise last year after he posted a message saying he wanted all Liverpool fans to die. He later said his message was a joke, as a dedicated Everton fan. In the 1990s Bowe became renowned for his victory over Holyfield, who has suffered a similar loss of his fortune. Holyfield beat Bowe the following year in a rematch and also scored several victories over Mike Tyson. But most of Holyfield's £150million fortune has now gone, frittered away on gambling, funding three expensive divorces and maintenance payments for some of his 11 children.","Riddick Bowe was once seen as best heavyweight boxer in the world .

'Thanks to all these people my son will forever be immortalized by social media. I guess some people do live forever. 'But i will always be sorry for the whole thing weather it be known or not.' On Saturday, Whittington posted bail with a court date set for April 24. The relationship between the toddler and Whittington has not yet been officially confirmed by police but the owner of Vest Market Harry Dindral said the man was the boy's father and said that he's seen them in the store together before. The video posted to social media and shared thousands of times shows a boy running through Vest Market. The police were notified of the video after it was leaked online. They asked the public for help identifying the man in the video who ruthlessly punched the small child. 'That was horrible, man,' owner of Vest Market Harry Dindral told the Daily News. Horrifying: Video shows the injured boy crying on the floor, then the man who may his father, yanking him up off the ground by his shirt . 'The worst thing I've ever seen,' he said of the incident at his establishment. Dindral says he was in the back of the store when his employee ran to him and told him to watch the surveillance video to see if there was any proof of the violent assault. Dindral later gave the footage to cops who were able to track down the suspect. 'It was the right thing to do,' Dindral told the Daily News. 'You don't hit a child like that.' Local Tattoo artist Chris Danaher who works near the market said he could never fathom acting violently towards a child. 'I would never imagine treating a child like that,' Danaher told ABC. 'His wife or girlfriend or whatever was clearly pregnant. She had no regard to it. She picked up her son and left the store,' he added. Danher said sadly the child is too young to truly understand what is going on. 'It's terrible. That kid is obviously too young to know what was going on. Honestly, couldn't be more than 3 years old, and I just couldn't imagine anyone doing that to me or me doing that to a child whatsoever,' said Danaher. The boy was later examined by medical personnel at his home and he did not require hospitalization. It is unknown whether or not he will be placed in new custody. A second video released on Friday shows Whittington allegedly picking up his son like a rag doll. The potential child abuse case is currently under investigation.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Fraser Ross, who founded the Kitson fashion brand, is caught up in a $1million legal wrangle after being accused of swearing at staff in a Los Angeles store . The tycoon behind exclusive fashion brand Kitson has been caught up in a $1million legal wrangle after being accused of swearing at staff in a Los Angeles store. Fraser Ross, who founded the company, is embroiled in a legal dispute after his behaviour led the company running the Kitson branch in Los Angeles Airport (LAX) to file a lawsuit to end their business relationship. Kitson, which has shops in California and the Far East, is hugely popular with celebrities including Victoria Beckham, Lady Gaga and Kylie and Kendall Jenner, who have all been spotted with the brand's blue bags. The multi-millionaire, from Aberdeen, is in the midst of an ugly public battle over allegations he swore at workers at the LAX outlet. Despite bearing the Kitson name - Mr Ross' middle-name - the two stores in LAX are not run by him. Instead, another business called Hudson pays Kitson a licensing fee to use the brand. It is alleged that Mr Ross is unhappy with the way the shops are being managed and has made his feelings clear to staff. Now Hudson has filed a $1million lawsuit to end the business relationship. Brian Timmons, a lawyer for Hudson, said: 'This is like a dysfunctional marriage that has been going on for a long time.' In 2013, Hudson inserted a clause into the contract with Kitson, giving it power to veto any Kitson employee coming to the airport stores. Mr Timmons claims that the firm abided by the agreement until last spring, when Mr Ross began showing up without warning and behaving 'inappropriately' toward employees. He said: 'He started saying, ""you are running the brand into the ground. There is too much dust on the shelves"". Lots of nitpicky things. 'It's one thing to correct performance or provide criticism to employees. You know the difference when you go over the line, when you use inappropriate adjectives.' Kitson is popular with celebrities, including the likes of Kendall and Kylie Jenner (left) and Jennifer Love Hewitt (right) Despite bearing the Kitson name - Mr Ross' middle-name - the two stores in LAX  (pictured) are not run by him . According to the LA Times, Hudson asked Kitson to pay a $280,000 penalty for violating the terms of their agreement and another $750,000 as compensation for lost profits and the costs of re-branding the two stores after the partnership is terminated. Last month Kitson launched a counter legal action saying that Hudson failed to keep the airport stores sufficiently clean, organised and staffed, and sold non-Kitson merchandise in them. Kitson spokeswoman Courtney Saavedra said Mr Ross did not want to comment. She added: 'Our founder is very passionate about our brand and being represented correctly. That is never going to change. 'As far as berating employees, as far as the language they are stating that's used, that's simply not true.'","Kitson fashion brand founder allegedly swore at employees in LA store .

"Hannah McWhirter (pictured) engaged in the threesome with a co-worker and her husband but when her boyfriend found out said she was raped . A woman accused a married couple of rape after her boyfriend found out she had a threesome with them in a Travelodge hotel room. Hannah McWhirter, 21, of Banff, Aberdeenshire, engaged in the ménage a trois with co-worker Dionne Clark and her husband Shaun in July 2013. She even exchanged texts with the couple after their threesome telling them how much she enjoyed herself. But when Mr Clark told the John Lewis department store worker's boyfriend about their hookup she claimed she had been raped. McWhirter appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court yesterday where she admitted wasting police time with false rape claims. Fiscal depute Elaine Ward said the accused had become close friends with Mrs Clark, 29, after starting work in the same shop in January 2013. The court heard that over time Mrs Clark introduced McWhirter to her husband Shaun, 35. Mrs Ward said: 'Both Mr and Mrs Clark and the accused spent a lot of time together socially and exchanged texts and other media messages on a daily basis. 'The nature of their relationship became more intimate and in June 2013 they discussed having a threesome and booking a hotel for that purpose.' The court heard that on July 13 the three met up in a Travelodge in Aberdeen while McWhirter's boyfriend was on a night out, oblivious to what was going on. Mrs Ward said: 'On the following day the accused and Mrs Clark exchanged several text messages saying that they had enjoyed the previous night.' The fiscal depute said McWhirter and the Clarks continued to meet socially and appeared 'happy' in each other's company. McWhirter accused co-worker Dionne Clark and husband Shaun (pictured) of rape following the threesome . The court heard the three met up in a Travelodge in Aberdeen while McWhirter's boyfriend was on a night out . But the relationship started to deteriorate after McWhirter took a day to respond to a text from Mrs Clark about being admitted to hospital. Bosses at their work later found out about the incident but McWhirter denied that the threesome had happened during a meeting in September 2013. The court heard that a month later things took a turn for the worst. Mrs Ward said: 'On October 11, the accused's boyfriend was standing outside her place of work when Mr Clark advised him of the threesome and showed him text messages from the accused. 'This later resulted in the accused being confronted by her boyfriend. 'She initially denied that the incident had taken place, then admitted it but said it was forced.' The court heard their relationship ended and McWhirter returned to live with her mother - continuing to claim that the Clarks had raped her. McWhirter has now admitted wasting police time and rendering Mr and Mrs Clark (pictured on their wedding day) to suspicion under the sexual offences act between October 13 and November 14 2013 . Police then began investigating her claims. McWhirter claimed she had been on a night out with friends before bumping into Mr and Mrs Clark. Mrs Ward said: 'She stated that at the end of the night she had to use the bathroom so went to their hotel room and then gave police details of a forcible rape.' The Clarks were interviewed under caution by police on October 16. However McWhirter's friends did not back up her night out story. After further mobile phone analysis took place in November 2013, McWhirter admitted she had been a willing participant. Yesterday she admitted wasting police time and rendering Mr and Mrs Clark to suspicion under the sexual offences act between October 13 and November 14, 2013. Sheriff Graham Buchanan deferred sentence until next month for the preparation of reports. McWhirter, who was released on bail, wept as she left the dock yesterday.","Hannah McWhirter, 21, had threesome with co-worker and her husband .

"An HIV-positive Ohio man accused of sexually assaulting three girls has pleaded not guilty to 19 counts in court, where a prosecutor said one of them, a 12 year old, is pregnant. Keith Anthony Allen, 27, of Columbus pleaded not guilty Monday to charges including rape, felonious assault and gross sexual imposition. He remains jailed with no bond, and court records listed no attorney for him. Allen is accused of raping two 12-year-old girls since September and fondling a third girl. Remanded: Keith Anthony Allen, 27, of Columbus pleaded not guilty Monday to charges including rape, felonious assault and gross sexual imposition. He is accused of raping two 12-year-old girls  and fondling a third girl . The assault charges allege he raped the girls while knowing he was HIV-positive and had consensual sex with a woman without telling her he has the virus that causes AIDS. Prosecutors say Allen could face a life sentence if he is convicted of having sex with a child under 13. The case marks the first time that the Franklin County prosecutor’s office has charged an adult with molesting children while knowing that he carries the virus that causes AIDS. 'I was outraged when I saw that police report,' Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O’Brien told The Columbus Dispatch. O’Brien said Allen had access to the two 12-year-old girls because his girlfriend is related to one of the children and the other sometimes spent the night with them. The assaults took place between September 1 and March 22, according to the indictment. Allen has been in the Franklin County jail since his arrest on March 25. His bail was set at $1 million. O'Brien says he is unaware of the health status of the victims in this case, whether or not any of them contracted HIV through Allen.","Keith Anthony Allen, 27, of Columbus, Ohio, is facing 19 charges .

"Former soldier John Young, 66, has been left blinded in one eye after thugs through a brick at him through his front door when he confronted them about throwing stones at his property in Oldham . A newlywed pensioner has been left blinded in one eye after being hit in the face with a brick hurled into his home by vandalising yobs. Former soldier John Young, 66, and his new wife Elaine, 54, were sat in the front room of their home in Oldham, Greater Manchester, when thugs began pelting his front window with stones. When one brick smashed the glass, Mr Young went and opened his front door to remonstrate with the attackers only to be struck in his left eye by another brick. He suffered an open wound to his forehead and a serious injury to his left eye and was taken to hospital. However, despite undergoing emergency surgery, doctors were unable to save his eyesight meaning he is now blind in one eye. The retired HGV driver, who formerly served with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers during the Irish troubles, said he now 'doesn't feel safe in his own home' following the attack last Friday. He said: 'I have lived here nearly all of my life and never had any problems before and I just don't understand why these people have targeted us. 'We just cannot believe what has happened.' Police have launched an investigation into the attack but said there appears to be no motive and it could be a case of yobs 'messing around'. The attack occurred just three weeks after the couple, who have no children and who met just 14 months ago, got married. They were writing thank you cards for the wedding gifts they had received when their home was targeted at around 11pm on April 18. Mrs Young, who works for The Alzheimer's Society charity, said: 'We were sat down writing all of the thanks you cards. 'It was the first time we had been in the house since our wedding and it was getting late, around 11.20pm. Mr Young and his wife Elaine, 54, were sat in the front room of their home in Oldham, Greater Manchester, when thugs began pelting his front window with stones. He was targeted when he went to confront them . The offenders threw stones at the living room window (pictured) before targeting the front door of the house. Mr Young was hit by the brick when he opened to the door to question why they had smashed his windows . The glass panel on the front door of Mr Young's house was smashed when bricks were thrown at the property last Friday. Mr Young was taken to hospital after being hit with a brick but doctors could not save his left eye . 'We did see a man outside and then there was a crash as a brick hit the window. The glass shattered. The next minute we knew there was glass shattered all over the hall because a brick had hit the door. 'John opened the door and the man was standing there shouting 'come on, come on'. The next minute John is covered in blood. 'I just wish he had never opened the front door. I had already called 999 and for him to go out was a mistake but it obviously was a natural reaction to what was happening. 'We don't have any idea why it happened. We feel like it must have been wrong place, wrong time. John has never had trouble before and neither of us can understand why these people would do something as low as this. 'I have got a flat in Southport so we are moving there now. I don't think either of us want to come back after what's happened. We are just too scared to live in this neighbourhood.' Detective constable Gareth Gwilliam, of Greater Manchester Police, said the second brick was thrown 'directly' at the man but wouldn't reveal how many offenders were involved in the incident. He said: 'At this stage, there appears to be no known motive for this attack. 'It might be there is no motive other than the culprits were messing around and for whatever reason thought it would be funny to throw bricks at someone's house. The attack occurred just three weeks after Mr Young married his partner Elaine, who he met just 14 months ago. The couple are pictured on their wedding day at Gretna Green in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland . The couple had been sat quietly in the living room of their Oldham home writing thank you notes for the gifts they received on their wedding day - just three weeks ago (pictured) - when the attack occurred last Friday . Police said the brick was thrown 'directly' at Mr Young when he answered the door of his home (pictured). Officers said there appeared to be no known motive for the attack and said it could be yobs 'messing around' 'However, there is absolutely nothing funny or clever about what they did and as a result of their wanton and reckless actions, this man has been left with a permanent disability and a loss of sight in one eye. 'Understandably, he is a mixture of angry and devastated so we need to establish who was responsible for this senseless incident and bring them to justice. 'I would therefore urge anyone who saw anything, or if you suspect who may be involved, to call us immediately.' Anyone with information about the incident should contact police on 101.","John Young, 66, struck in eye by brick hurled through front door by thugs .

"A Russian warship and two bombers strayed close to UK territory yesterday in yet another apparent attempt to test Britain’s defences. A destroyer equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes entered the English Channel along with two other Russian ships. It forced the UK to send a heavily-armed frigate to monitor the vessels. A map showing the how jets were launched from RAF Lossiemouth yesterday, shortly after HMS Argyll was deployed to monitor a Russian destroyer and two other ships as they passed through the English Channel . Just a few hours later, two Russian long-range Bear bombers, capable of carrying nuclear missiles, hugged British airspace – prompting the RAF to deploy two Typhoon fighter jets. Sources claim both incidents may have been an attempt to ‘snoop’ on a huge Nato war games exercise taking place in Scotland. Even though Russian military inspectors were invited to attend the show of strength, the timing raised suspicions that Vladimir Putin was using access to the site to test UK reaction times. It later emerged that the Russians had actually been at the Typhoons’ base at RAF Lossiemouth when the warplanes were scrambled. No explanation: Experts said Russian President Vladimir Putin's move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression .

If armed the ship's commander could have targeted the aircraft in self defence . June 2014 - HMS Montrose was sent to monitor a Russian corvette in international waters near Denmark's Baltic coast. The frigate was then circle by a Russian maritime patrol craft . October 2014 - RAF Typhoons intercepted a Russian Bear aircraft over the North Sea and Russian warships pass through the Channel escorted by the Navy . October 30, 2014 - 26 Russian bombers, tankers and fighter jets on military exercises are intercepted around Europe in just 24 hours. Jets are scrambled by the RAF and allies in Germany, Portugal and Turkey after the 'unusual' spike in activity, which saw two giant Tu-95 Bear H bombers fly close to Britain . November 2014 - HMS Argyll monitors a heavily armed Russian warship as it strayed close to the UK while passing through the English Channel and Strait of Dover . January 2015 - Typhoons were dispatched from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland and RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to intercept two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles as they flew south of Bournemouth . February 17, 2015 - HMS Argyll intercepts a Neustrashimy-class warship and its accompanying tanker as they headed home after a deployment in the Mediterranean in the English Channel . February 19, 2015 - Two RAF Typhoon jets scrambled from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to escort two Russian bombers in international airspace off the coast of Cornwall. April 2015 - Royal Navy's HMS Argyll monitors Russian Udaloy class destroyer Severomorsk along with a tanker and a support ship as they move through the English Channel. The incursions are the latest in a long line of apparent tests by Moscow as tensions between Britain and Russia rise. The Nato naval operation – Exercise Joint Warrior – was aimed at encouraging Mr Putin to calm his recent aggression toward the UK. But Sir Michael Graydon, former head of the RAF, said the Kremlin was using Cold War tactics to ‘snoop’ on the exercise and called for higher defence spending to defeat a ‘resurgent’ Russia. He said: ‘This is a classic return to the 70s and 80s when every exercise conducted by Nato was snooped on. ‘We’ve trumpeted the fact we are holding such a large exercise and the fact they are snooping on it doesn’t surprise me at all.’ He added that Britain should spend more on defence: ‘Our capability to deal with these sorts of threats is diminishing because we don’t have the manpower... we need resilience.’ A source added: ‘It may be that they are observing the military exercise being held off the coast of Scotland.’ Under a European treaty, the Ministry of Defence were forced to accept an inspection by Russian experts and they arrived in Scotland on Monday. Yesterday the destroyer Severomorsk, a tanker and a support ship returning from the Mediterranean were intercepted by the Royal Navy as they passed through the Channel. Plymouth-based HMS Argyll, a Type 23 frigate with a crew of 185, was sent to monitor the vessels. A source said the Russians may ‘poke their noses in at the exercise off Scotland’ before heading home. An RAF spokesman said the two Bear bombers, which flew off the north-east coast of Scotland hours later, were escorted away. More than 100 Russian aircraft were intercepted last year, three times more than during the whole of 2013. In November a four-strong Russian flotilla sailed through the Channel and earlier this year two Bears flew south of Bournemouth.

"A female cyclist was killed in a rush-hour accident with a lorry in central London today. Witnesses reported seeing the front wheel of her bike 'completely squashed' under the lorry following the accident close to Lambeth Bridge near the Houses of Parliament at about 9.30am. Today's incident was the fifth death of a cyclist in the capital this year - all involving lorries - prompting cycle campaigners to organise a 'vigil and die-in' at the site. Accident: Witnesses reported seeing the front wheel of her bike 'completely squashed' under the lorry . Police response: Today's incident was the fifth death of a cyclist in the capital this year - all involving lorries . One witness told the London Evening Standard: 'The front wheel of the bike was completely squashed under the front wheels of the lorry.' Another said: 'The lorry was stopped on the roundabout at the junction of the bridge and Millbank, and the bike was under the front left wheel. The front wheel was trapped under the lorry.' And marketer Katherine Jacques tweeted: 'Just walking over Lambeth Bridge and finding roads shut. Another cyclist killed this morning. Lorry still there. Horrible, eerie silence.' Metropolitan Police said officers were called by paramedics at about 9.33am and the cyclist was pronounced dead at the scene at the junction between Millbank and Horseferry Road at 10.03am. A Westminster City Council spokesman said: 'We are shocked and saddened by the tragic incident at Lambeth Bridge and our deepest condolences go out to the cyclist's family and friends.' Councillor Heather Acton, the council's cabinet member for sustainability and parking, said: 'I am shocked and saddened by the tragic death of a cyclist, who was someone I knew. 'As with any death on our roads, I shall be making sure that all steps are taken to investigate what happened, and to continue to assess and pursue what can be done to protect all cyclists in the city. 'My deepest condolences go out to the family and friends of the cyclist. The council will continue working with TfL and the Metropolitan Police to support the investigation into the incident.' The action group Stop Killing Cyclists has organised a protest at the scene on April 20 at 6pm. Memorial: The incident has prompted cycle campaigners to organise a 'vigil and die-in' at the site . Scene: The cyclist was died at the scene at the junction between Millbank and Horseferry Road (pictured) One of the cyclists killed earlier this year was mother-of-two Claire Hitier-Abadie, 36, who was riding a cycle hire 'Boris bike' when she had an accident with a Crossrail lorry in Victoria in February. Transport for London (TfL) drew up improvement plans for the Lambeth Bridge northern roundabout which it put out for consultation in 2012. But TfL's report on the consultation said: 'Having considered responses to consultation, and following concerns voiced by Westminster City Council, we have decided not to proceed with these planned initial improvements at Lambeth Bridge northern roundabout. 'Instead, we will concentrate our resources on developing more substantial improvements that meet the expectations of Westminster City Council and other stakeholders.' TfL said today that it was still working on the improvement plans. Meanwhile, TfL has announced that work has begun on a £25million package of improvements, including dedicated cycle routes, at Elephant and Castle northern roundabout in south London. The roundabout had the most accidents involving cyclists in London in the period 2009 to 2013, according to insurance company Aviva. Crossing: The accident happened close to Lambeth Bridge (above, file picture) near the Houses of Parliament . Mark Johnson, a presenter on Share Radio's breakfast show, told MailOnline: 'I live in Kennington and cycle across Lambeth Bridge every day to our studios near Millbank, so I know how dangerous the roundabout is at the north end of the bridge. 'I'm also very concerned at the speed that construction lorries travel at in the built up urban areas of Central London.' He added: 'I spoke to police officers at the scene who said they are also very concerned about the issue, but that unfortunately they don't have any authority to make safety changes. 'They said it's the borough councils that need to redesign the road layouts to ensure cycle safety.'","Her bike's front wheel was 'completely squashed' under lorry in incident .

"Killer cop Michael Slager is not eligible for South Carolina's death penalty even if he is convicted of murder, according to local prosecutors. The North Charleston police officer can't be executed for shooting Walter Scott in the back because the killing did not include any of a list of narrowly-defined 'aggravating circumstances' which state law says are conditions of the death penalty. It came as evidence against Slager continues to mount, the latest of which is dash cam footage of him discharging a Taser into a black man's back filed as part of an excessive force lawsuit. The video shows Slager weighing in on an arrest in progress, announcing that he's going to Tase Julius Garnett Wilson, who is laying on the floor, then discharging his weapon. Taser: Michael Slager, the North Charleston cop charged with murder, is pictured above firing a Taser at a black man being held down by two fellow officers. The man being stunned is now filing a lawsuit . Killing: Slager is being held in prison on murder charges after this video emerged of him shooting derad 50-year-old Walter Scott . As Wilson writhes on the floor he then yells 'turn over or you're going to get it again' in the footage, dated August 2014. Wilson, who was pulled over on his way to work at 4am for having a faulty tail light, is seen on dash cam recording insisting he has done nothing wrong, and demanding to know why he is being placed under arrest. Charges: Slager is facing an accusation of murder - but won't face the death penalty . The two officers, including Slager, don't explain and instead demand that he get out of the car. After one points a gun at him, he is seen being pulled out of the car. According to ABC News4, the officer in question said he drew his pistol after Wilson reached for something in the car. A third officer then arrives, and takes over from Slager attempting to subdue Wilson. Slager then warns his fellow officers to stand back before discharging the Taser. Attorneys for Wilson allege that his civil rights were breached, according to the New York Times. Wilson was charged with driving under suspension and resisting arrest. He pleaded guilty to resisting arrest, but the driving charge was later dropped. Other lawsuits against Slager are likely to follow in the light of his highly-publicized killing of Scott, a 50-year-old father of four. Mario Givens, who files an excessive force complaint against Slager in 2013, also said he intends to mount another case. Givens says that Slager knocked on his door and threatened him with the Taser unless he put his hands on his head. When he did, Givens claims Slager used the Taser on him anyway. Slager was looking for Givens's brother, Matthew, who is significantly shorter than him. Killed: Walter Scott, pictured above left and right, was shot dead by police officer Michael Slager on April 4 . A murder indictment and any trial for Slager is still months away - but prosecutors have already said that there is no chance he will be executed. Charleston County's chief prosecutor Scarlett Wilson made the point Monday, after media reporting on the shooting widely pointed out that South Carolina law does include the death penalty. However, she said Monday that 'based on the facts received thus far, it does not appear South Carolina's death penalty provision applies in this case'. The state law which outlines the possible punishment for murder lists 12 'aggravating circumstances' which enable the death penalty. Some include other crimes being carried out at the same time, including torture, rape, drug trafficking, kidnapping, burglary and arson. Other provisions allow the death penalty if the victim is a child, a police officer, witness or court official, and if the crime is part of a mass murder. Scott's death reignited a public outcry over police . treatment of minorities that flared last year after the killings . of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, New York City, and . elsewhere. North Charleston fired Slager last week after he was charged . with murder. A cellphone video showed him shooting at Scott's . back eight times as he ran away. Slager, who was being held in Charleston County jail, could . face 30 years to life in prison if convicted. A spokesman for the North Charleston police department . declined to comment.","Michael Slager, who shot Scott in North Charleston, isn't eligible for death .

"For most of us the thought of eating insects might prove to be one culinary step too far. But the consumption of locusts, crickets, worms and grubs could become very much a part of our diet as the cost of meat production rises, and the demand for meat grows. In tonight's final episode of BBC Two's Back In Time For Dinner, the Robshaws – Brandon, 53, Rochelle, 52, and their children Miranda, 17, Rosalind, 15 and Fred – who have travelled from the 1950s to the end of the millennium are served the food of the future. The Robshaws sample insects in tonight's episode of BBC Two's Back for Dinner . Two billion people worldwide already supplement their diet with insects . The experiment, filmed for a six-part TV programme, ended with the family feeling extremely grateful for the variety of foods available today. Presenter Giles Coren and food historian Polly Russell serve the family a radical dinner of Mexican spiced cricket tacos, Asian worm stir fry, buffalo worm tart and cricket kebabs. The family also attempt burgers made with a mixture of insect and beef protein, and sample cookies made from insect flour. 'In the future meat supplies might be a problem,' presenter Mr Coren says in the programme. 'Insects have been hailed as a solution to our meat problem; full of protein, low in fat and packed full of nutrients they are already part of the staple diet in parts of Africa and Asia.' The lack of traditional meat proteins can be put down to population expansion, food historian Polly Russell explains. 'As populations grow globally there is a huge pressure on the amount of meat that is produced because as developing countries start getting richer and people start adopting Western-style diets, which tend to consume a lot more meat,' she said. Entomophagy (eating insects) could have a positive impact on the environment and world hunger if crunchy exoskeletons could replace typical meat. Throughout the show, in the 1950s the children had to wait patiently for their father to finish his dinner, knowing his leftovers would be their supper. The 1960s saw the birth of the sugary cereal, while motorway service stations became almost fashionable as places to eat. The Robshaws found that food in the 1970s was brightly-coloured - but perhaps less enticing - than before . In the 1970s, working women were learning to balance their careers with cooking for the family. The decade also saw the rise of the Pot Noodle. In the 1980s goats cheese, mange tout and kiwi fruit became the foods to impress your dinner party guests. Gourmet dishes and nouvelle cuisine took over from the simple but hearty dishes of earlier decades. By the 1990s, sushi and curry were as popular as traditional English dishes and ready meals became the norm. For the final episode, the family discussed the food of the future; insects. On top of health benefits, insects are seen as a solution to meet the demands of food supply and are viewed as a more environmentally-friendly method of food production. A recent UN report identified edible insects as a sustainable food source for the future. Figures indicate two billion people worldwide already supplement their diet with them. And once better technology has been developed for farming insects, they really have better potential of becoming a major food source, experts say. Chef Rene Redzepi's pop-up restaurant Noma Tokyo has a menu that begins with a starter of prawns and ants . Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca, which was co-founded in 2007 by Masterchef winner Thomasina Miers, started to introduce the alternate protein source to diners in 2013. In January this year, it brought chapulines fundido to the menu, made with one of Mexico's most sustainably farmed, yet unusual ingredients - grasshoppers. Chefs cook the fried chapulines (grashoppers) with softened shallots, garlic and smoky chipotle chillies to create a salsa, which is served with queso fundido, a mixture of grated mozzarella and cheddar cheese and a side of corn tortillas. Thomasina Miers gave FEMAIL her take on the dish. She said: 'It's just not in our psyche at the moment, but we don't have any issues eating shrimps or prawns, so I think it's just a question of creating a dish that will appeal over here. Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca served chapulines fundido - made with  grasshoppers - to its menu in January this year . Archipelago restaurant in Cleveland Street has love bug salads, bushmans's caviar (caramel mealworms, blinis, coconut cream and vodka jelly) and a dessert called Medieval Hive (brown butter ice-cream, honey and butter caramel sauce and a baby bee) on the menu. This summer chef Adam Holcroft will open Britain's first insect restaurant in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, this summer, serving dishes which feature crickets, bugs and worms. The 37-year-old head chef says it will be the first restaurant in the UK dedicated to serving insects as protein to show  bugs can help feed the booming global population. Asian Forest Scorpion - Scorpions have a strong, bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce. Paris Street Rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied Transylvanian Pinot Noir, so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of flavours. Mealworms - Match their nutty taste and light, crunchy texture with a crisp Clare Valley Viognier wine that has just the right combination of fruit and richness. Zebra Tarantula - Tarantulas are normally eaten deep fried, so think similar to fish and chips. A lively full bodied Chardonnay will stand up to the complex fishy flavours of the tarantula. Sago Worms - These worms have a distinct taste a bit similar to bacon so you need a big meaty red with loads of punch to match that savoury flavour. McLaren Vale Shiraz is fresh with loads of red fruit and spice . BBQ Locusts - Locusts taste a bit like an exotic bar snack and with the BBQ flavour you'll need a wine with a hint of sweetness. The Hacienda de Lluna Moscatel is a gorgeous lightly bubbly pink that works well as an aperitif. Chocolate dipped locusts - These locusts are essentially a savory dish as they taste a bit like sunflower seeds, but also have the sweetness from the chocolate. A rich robust wine with loads of sweet fruit will stand up to these flavours. Giant Waterbugs - The meat inside the water bug's body tastes a bit similar to a sweet scallop, while the head has hints of anise, so you'll need to find a wine that can match well with seafood and stronger flavours. A dry sherry, and a Fino at that, is the only choice here. The crisp citrus and nutty flavours will complement their complex flavours. Queen Weaver Ants - Their slightly sour and crunchy tastes like a lemon. They would go well with an aromatic white with pretty fruit and floral notes. A Gewürztraminer provides the perfect balance to crunchy textures. Asian Forest Scorpion - Scorpions have a strong, bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce. Paris Street Rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied Transylvanian Pinot Noir, so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of sweet and sour. Crickets - The flavours are much harder to distinguish in crickets and so they are often prepared with garlic and salt. Nevertheless the nutty flavor that comes through means a perfect fit is a rich full-bodied white wine like Albariño. Garlic Chapulines - Have an earthy and grassy flavour and a very crunchy texture, therefore we recommend a creamy dry Champagne that will match well with the earthy flavours (similar to matching with mushrooms) and crunch.","BBC's Back In Time For Dinner claims that grubs are the future of food .

"Thousands of people have launched a campaign to stop an 11-year-old boy being deported to Bangladesh weeks after his little brother died following a long battle with cancer. Maarij Khan and his mother Mushammat are set to be removed from their home in Newcastle after the Home Office turned down their bid to remain in the UK. Now 3,500 people have signed a petition to allow the schoolboy and his mother to stay in Britain, where Maarij's 10-year-old brother Saffat is buried. Saffat died of meningitis last month, after his fight against an aggressive form of cancer and several rounds of chemotherapy left his immune system fatally weakened. Deported: Maarij Khan, left, has been told he must leave Britain and move to Bangladesh weeks after the death of his brother Saffat, pictured right receiving an award for bravery . The family first came from Bangladesh to the UK in October 2007 to live with Maarij and Saffat's father, who was studying for a PhD. Saffat was subsequently diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, a type of childhood cancer which attacks connective tissue in the face and left him severely disfigured. After years of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, he fell ill with meningitis, and died on March 4. The Home Office denied the family's  request to stay in the UK after their visa expired in 2013. They tried to challenge the decision, but a tribunal turned down their appeal last year. The boys' father  returned to work in Bangladesh in March 2014. Mushammat, 34, said: 'All Maarij knows is Newcastle, all his friends are here, his life is here. He and Saffat were incredibly close, they were inseparable and his death has left him heartbroken. 'He goes and sits at his brother's graveside each day. The thought of him never being able to do that again is terrible to us all. 'The support we've had from all parts of the Tyneside community has been humbling and we very much want to stay in the area that has become our home.' Maarij's supporters say that he has become withdrawn and shy after Saffat's death, and warn that his education will suffer if he is sent to Bangladesh. Heartbroken: Maarij has become withdrawn after his brother's death, according to his family . Immigrants to the UK who are on a student visa, and their family members, are only allowed to stay in the UK until their course comes to an end. They must then apply for a new visa, such as one linked to a specific job, or return to their home country. However, under the Human Rights Act 1998, immigrants facing deportation are able to appeal on the grounds that being forced to leave the UK is a breach of their human rights. A number of immigrants have claimed that their 'right to respect for private and family life' under Article 8 of the Act would be breached if they were made to leave their new home in Britain. However, the use of the Human Rights Act has attracted controversy because convicted criminals have tried to use it to avoid being deported. Local councillor Dipu Ahad has set up an online petition calling on the Home Office to reconsider its decision. He said: 'It must be heartbreaking for the mother and brother of Saffat, knowing that they may be deported very soon, and they are unlikely to have access to Saffat's resting place ever again. I can’t even begin to imagine the pain.' The family's last chance is to appeal to the Court of Appeal, but they are unlikely to succeed unless they can prove that the authorities have made a legal error. A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'On February 6, 2013 the family applied to the Home Office for leave under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (right to respect for private and family life), this was refused by the Home Office on January 22, 2014. 'The family subsequently lodged an appeal against this refusal. This appeal was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal, which is independent of the Home Office, on August 26, 2014. 'This decision was subsequently upheld by the Upper Tribunal (also independent of the Home Office) who dismissed the family’s appeal on December 17, 2014. 'The family sought permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal, via the Upper Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal rejected that application on March 19, 2015. 'The family have a further, final, right to appeal direct to the Court of Appeal.'","Maarij Khan, 11, and his mother Mushammat set to be deported from UK .

"Stunned researchers have found one of the UK's most important manuscripts is full of ghosts. Dating from 1250, The Black Book of Carmarthen is the earliest surviving medieval manuscript written solely in Welsh, and contains some of the earliest references to Arthur and Merlin. Now, researchers have found a series of hidden faces and message in it. The Black Book of Carmarthen is the earliest surviving medieval manuscript written solely in Welsh, and contains some of the earliest references to Arthur and Merlin. Using a combination of ultraviolet light and photo editing software, the images were recovered. Dating from 1250, The Black Book of Carmarthen is the earliest surviving medieval manuscript written solely in Welsh, and contains some of the earliest references to Arthur and Merlin. The book is a collection of 9th-12th century poetry along both religious and secular lines, and draws on the traditions of the Welsh folk-heroes and legends of the Dark Ages. 'It's easy to think we know all we can know about a manuscript like the Black Book but to see these ghosts from the past brought back to life in front of our eyes has been incredibly exciting,' said Myriah Williams of Cambridge's Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic. The book is a collection of 9th-12th century poetry along both religious and secular lines, and draws on the traditions of the Welsh folk-heroes and legends of the Dark Ages. Williams and Professor Paul Russell from Cambridge's Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic (ASNC), believe that a 16th century owner of the book, probably a man named Jaspar Gryffyth, erased centuries' worth of additional verse, doodles and marginalia which had been added to the manuscript as it changed hands throughout the years. Using a combination of ultraviolet light and photo editing software, the 16th century owner's penchant for erasure has been partly reversed to reveal snatches of poetry. Currently, the texts are very fragmentary and in need of much more analysis, although they researchers say they seem to be the continuation of a poem on the preceding page with a new poem added at the foot of the page. 'The drawings and verse that we're in the process of recovering demonstrate the value of giving these books another look,' Williams said. 'The margins of manuscripts often contain medieval and early modern reactions to the text, and these can cast light on what our ancestors thought about what they were reading. 'The Black Book was particularly heavily annotated before the end of the 16th century, and the recovery of erasure has much to tell us about what was already there and can change our understanding of it.' The faces are only visible under UV light - and are invisible to the naked eye . Williams and Russell will present a lecture at The National Library of Wales today, part of a larger exhibition on the life and work of Sir John Price, one-time owner of the Black Book. There, they will detail some of their findings, stressing the importance of continued research on the manuscript. 'What we have discovered may only be the tip of the iceberg in terms of what can be discovered as imaging techniques are enhanced,' said Russell. 'The manuscript is extremely valuable and incredibly important – yet there may still be so much we don't know about it.' Despite its value today, the Black Book of Carmarthen (so called because of the colour of its binding) was not an elaborate production, but rather the work of a single scribe who was probably collecting and recording over a long period of his life. This is readily visible on the manuscript pages themselves; the first pages feature a large textura script copied on alternating ruled lines, while in other parts of the manuscript – perhaps when vellum was scarce – the hand is very much smaller and the lines per page tight and many. Measuring approximately only 17cm by 12.5 cm, the book is made up of 54 pages of vellum (animal hide) and came to the National Library of Wales in 1904 after being bought, alongside other manuscripts, by the Library's founder, Sir John Williams. An example of the latter is the earliest poem concerning the adventures of the legendary Arthur, which sees the famed hero seeking entrance to an unidentified court and expounding the virtues of his men in order to gain admittance. Other heroes are praised and lamented in a lengthy text known as Englynion y Beddau, the Stanzas of the Graves, in which a narrator presents geographic lore by claiming to know the burial places of upwards of eighty warriors. Arthur makes an appearance here as well, but only insofar as to say that he cannot be found: anoeth bid bet y arthur, 'the grave of Arthur is a wonder'. Other famous figures also appear throughout, including Myrddin, perhaps more familiarly known by the English 'Merlin'. There are two prophetic poems attributed to him during his 'wild man' phase located in the middle of the manuscript, but additionally the very first poem of the book is presented as a dialogue between him and the celebrated Welsh poet Taliesin. Since the creation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae in the 12th century there has been a connection between Carmarthen and Merlin, and it may be no accident that the Black Book opens with this text.","Black Book of Carmarthen is the earliest surviving Welsh manuscript .

And the tools of his unique trade include a spoon and a barbecue skewer, which he dips in dark chocolate. The service started out as a simple novelty when the owner began etching rabbits, which coincide with the cafe's theme, into cups of coffee. But the idea quickly expanded when customers started asking for more intricate and complicated designs. This means tourists to the area can leave with a special memento from their time that they can show off to family and friends alike.

'I want to go one step further and give them a picture of their baby, their boyfriend, or their favourite cartoon character. If that makes them happy, that makes them smile, that's cool.' According to the Mr Yonzon, the biggest challenge he faces is to get the picture etched into the froth before it dissolves and the coffee turns cold. But he claims that his art can be done with almost any type of coffee drink and that the final product will depend on the thickness of the beverage and the amount of froth that tops it.

"As if it wasn't bad enough having a job that involves routinely entering strangers' homes, these estate agents may have just been put off for life. As a part of Sky Living's promotion for its upcoming three-part drama, The Enfield Haunting, real London estate agents were invited to value a house in a viral video. What they didn't know, is that the house had been rigged with special effects to give the appearance of being possessed by a ghost. London estate agents were invited to a fake haunted house, where they were subject to terrifying pranks . Installed with secret cameras, microphones and booby traps, the unsuspecting estate agents are subject to cruel, but hilarious, pranks - which prompt hysterical reactions. An ordinary house in Enfield is chosen as the location, and to draw the estate agents in, is a pretend homeowner, Rosie, who wants her house valued. Upon entering the house, Rosie solemnly explains to the estate agents that the house was owned by her brother, who just so happened to also pass away in it. An ordinary house is chosen in Enfield for unsuspecting London estate agents to value . Cameras are installed the walls and members of the team monitor the hilarious reactions . An estate agent is invited into the house and greeted by the fake homeowner, Rosie. This already to serves to unsettle one estate agent, as his eyes widen in surprise. Once the scene is set, the funny pranks begin, and a shelf collapses randomly behind the estate agents. One reacts by literally leaping into the air and retracting his arms to his chest in a protective stance. Another startled estate agent lifts his hands up into the air in an automatic surrender position. Another gasps and raises her hand to her mouth, her shoulders jolting. Rosie (pictured right) explains to the estate agent (pictured left) that her brother recently died in the house. The estate agent looks nervous and unsettled . A shelf behind the estate agent collapses and he reacts with leaping into the air in shock . When the shelf collapses, another estate agent gasps, her shoulder jolting in shock . Already unsettled by the shelf, Rosie proceeds to lead them up the stairs, and gestures for them to look at the bathroom, while she attends to her phone ringing in another room. One of the estate agents is looking around, as the tap switches on by itself. As he goes to turn off the tap, it switches off by itself. Confused, he turns to leave the room, at which point the tap begins creepily running again, and again, turns off when he reaches towards it. In one room, marbles begin violently spilling out of one of the cabinets randomly. A combination of the noise and surprise causes one estate agent to shriek . As the marbles spill out of the cabinets, another estate agent throws his hands up in the air in surprise . He exits the room appearing puzzled and disconcerted. In the next shot, the estate agents are seen entering another bedroom, at which point marbles begin spilling violently out of one of the top cabinets, which is again met with hilarious reactions. As well as horrified screams and petrified stares from the estate agents, one of them throws his hands up in a surrender position, insisting: 'I didn't touch anything!' A cabinet randomly and violently topples over prompting a gasp from the estate agent . A woman is shocked as the cupboard doors begin rattling and things begin spilling out loudly . Frightened, another man turns around as the door slams violently behind him . Many of the estate agents are truly alarmed at this point and go in search of Rosie, the fake homeowner. Upon entering another bedroom, the team really begin to up the ante with the special effects. First a stocky wardrobe unit loudly topples over onto the floor, and the door creakily swings shut by itself. One woman presses her hand to her chest, truly gobsmacked and exclaims: 'Woah! ' Another man screams frantically for the owner of the house. A woman stares at the wardrobe doors in horror as they begin to open and close and things begin to tumble out . She appears horrified as the door slams by itself behind her, her arms crossed in a protective stance . One man decides to intervene in the ghostly occurrence and kicks the spinning chair angri . Several of the wardrobe unit doors begin rattling and opening randomly unassisted, with objects falling out, and a chair begins spinning on its own. One of the estate agents cowers in the corner, shakily running his hands through his hair and appears evidently faint. Another man comically kicks the spinning chair and shrieks: 'Get Out!' At this point, many can't take the strange disturbances any more and run down the stairs, where the team members are revealed and they are let in on the prank. With relieved expressions and nervous laughter, they seem grateful that there is in fact no ghostly presence. The estate agents are let in on the prank as the cameras are revealed. One in particular seems extremely relieved that it is all a joke . 'Genuinely, I thought it was real': One estate agent appears shaken from his fake haunting experience . One said: 'I'm actually speechless, like my heart's actually going.' Another insists: 'Genuinely, I thought it was for real.'

"An eight-year-old boy was taken to hospital after falling victim to a prank when he was suffocated until he passed out. Police in Manchester have now issued a warning to parents over the game, known as 'sleeper', which officers say is potentially fatal. The child's details have not been release but a Greater Manchester Police spokesman said the child is believed to have had underlying health problems and is expected to make a full recovery. Officers from Greater Manchester Police have been forced to issue a warning on Facebook (pictured) after an eight-year-old boy was hospitalised after a playground suffocation prank called 'sleeper' went wrong . The 'sleeper' prank involves a child having their nose and mouth held shut by another child until they black out from lack of oxygen. The youngster was treated in hospital on Wednesday after they were a 'sleeper' victim, police said. Officers in North Manchester believe it is a new craze and have alerted parents. GMP's North Manchester division posted on their Facebook site after the incident: 'Dangerous New Craze Warning - Attention all parents/guardians...We have received reports of a new craze called 'Sleeper' This involves children completely covering the mouth and noses of younger children until they completely pass out. Manchester's city centre chief councillor Pat Karney (pictured) has said the craze must be stopped 'before we have a tragedy on our hands' 'This is extremely dangerous, a child is currently in hospital being treated after falling victim to this game. Please advise every child you know and warn them of the dangers, this could easily lead to concussion or even death. The post has now been shared more than 11,200 times on the social network. GMP's Facebook post received a flurry of responses from followers, some claiming the game dates back several years. Tasha Williams replied: 'This was happening when I was at school although it was someone pushing on your chest really hard or on your throat, it is a stupid game.' Linzi Walker added: 'It's not new it's been going for years and years.' But Pete James said: 'Only buzz I used to get as a kid was putting a crushed carton in the back wheel of my bike and making it sound like a motorbike! What's wrong with kids??'

"Shelly Sterling has spoken out about her legal victory over her husband's alleged mistress V. Stiviano, saying she took the much-younger woman to court 'for justice'. The billionaire wife of former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling said she felt vindicated by the judge's ruling this week that Stiviano, 32, must return $2.6 million in sugar daddy gifts. Donald Sterling, 80, had lavished his alleged girlfriend with gifts including a $1.8 million house, luxury cars and stocks - all while hiding them from his wife of six decades. But Shelly insisted on Wednesday she didn't take them to court over the money. Scroll down for video . Vindicated: Shelly Sterling, pictured at a Clippers game last month, will receive $2.6 million from a woman her husband Donald showered with gifts. Shelly has said she took the woman to court 'for justice' 'I did it for justice,' she said. 'I think when somebody harms you in so many ways, justice has to prevail.' Shelly Sterling said she would donate the proceeds to charity. Despite acknowledging marital problems, she also said she and her husband never separated. She said she drafted divorce papers last year, but never filed them. The couple testified at trial last month in Los Angeles Superior Court about their love for each other, displaying cards they had exchanged. Still, Donald Sterling is suing his wife and the NBA over the $2 billion sale of the team. A year ago, a recording of Donald Sterling telling Stiviano not to associate with black people led the NBA to ban him for life and fine him $2.5 million. His wife then negotiated a deal to sell the team with ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer after doctors found Donald Sterling incompetent to handle his business affairs. Together: Donald Sterling is pictured with V. Stiviano in 2011 as they watch the Clippers play. He lost the team last year after a recording emerged in which he told Stiviano not to be seen with black people . Shelly added on Wednesday that she mourns the loss of the team. 'It was a horrible thing to go through,' she said. 'They were like my family. To this day I still feel very bad about it.' Her husband's lawyer on Wednesday criticized her lawsuit as a 'pet project' that had extended Stiviano's time in the spotlight. 'The sums spent by Shelly Sterling in pursuing this matter likely exceeds any amount that will be recovered,' attorney Bobby Samini said. 'We remain perplexed that so much time, energy and money have been allocated to litigating with Ms. Stiviano.' Shelly Sterling's attorney scoffed at that statement. 'What do you expect from the lawyer for a husband who was caught red-handed gifting his mistress with millions of dollars of family money,' Pierce O'Donnell said. In court: Stiviano, pictured heading to court last month, accepted gifts worth $2.6 million from the older man and has now been ordered to hand them back over. The exact nature of their relationship was never clear . Shelly Sterling had filed the suit against Stiviano a month before the recording of her husband telling Stiviano not to associate with black people created an uproar and led the NBA to ban him for life. In court, Shelly Sterling's lawyers used other recordings from Stivian's iPhone to show he bought his alleged mistress a house, a Ferrari and other things. Stiviano and the 80-year-old billionaire were heard discussing how to shield gifts from his wife. 'The truth is that everything that I have, you've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you,' Stiviano said in snippet played in court. During the course of their two and a half years together, Sterling gave her a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Range Rover, and paid the lion's share of a $1.8 million duplex. Sterling testified that he paid for the house, though Stiviano said she had contributed an unknown amount of money given to her in small bills by family members that she saved in a bedroom drawer. But Judge Richard Fruin Jr. said this claim was 'not believable' and he relied instead on a recording in which she told Donald Sterling: 'I want Shelly to know you bought me the house.' Still smiling: Stiviano, pictured showing off her new braces, was seen out in Los Angeles earlier this month . He ruled earlier this week that Stiviano must now turn over the keys to the $1.8 million house and pay Shelly Sterling some $800,000 that her husband showered on the younger woman in gifts. It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers games. In the subsequent furor, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2 billion. The recording was leaked weeks after Shelly Sterling sued Stiviano, alleging she was her husband's mistress but the exact nature of their relationship was never clear. Stiviano called him a lover and father figure but said they never had sex. Donald Sterling called her an 'ex-friend' on the witness stand, though he said in recordings that he loved her and wanted to give her everything.","A Los Angeles judge ruled this week that V.

"My first trip to New York was with my aunt when I was about 18 and I had been appearing in Coronation Street for about 12 months. I can remember it all so clearly. We had a lot of fun together - we went to see the musical Chicago on Broadway and did lots and lots of shopping. We returned to the city that never sleeps in January 2001, eight months before the terrible events of 9/11, and one of the first things my boyfriend Sylvain Longchambon and I did on my latest trip was to visit the site of the World Trade Center to see the monument to those who died. It was a very poignant moment. Coronation Street star Samia Ghadie and boyfriend Sylvain Longchambon take a selfie in New York . There were hundreds of people visiting the memorial at the time but everybody was quiet and extremely respectful. Sylvain and I flew to the US from Manchester and spent four nights in the city. I love flying from Manchester if I can, not just because it's nearer to my home but because it's not so vast and sprawling as either Gatwick or Heathrow. We stayed at the Marriott where the service was fantastic - when we checked in the concierge desk wanted to know if they could help us to make bookings for shows or restaurants. And when we got to the room, we were met by a butler who immediately took away our shoes for shining - very impressive. You don't get that at a Travelodge! We had a beautiful suite on the 31st floor, giving us panoramic views of Central Park. We valued the fact that the suite had a separate lounge area, and it came in really handy because during our stay Sylvain's cousin in New York celebrated his 30th birthday, so lots of people came back to our room for a glass of bubbly. We sipped champagne as we gazed out across Manhattan - and The Rovers Return suddenly felt a very long way away. The JW Marriott Essex House as seen from Central Park, of which it boasts panoramic views . One of Samia and Sylvain's first stops was to pay their respects to those lost on September 11, 2001 . On the second night of our break, we went on the Bateaux New York cruise, which offers an unforgettable three-hour trip along the Hudson River. We enjoyed cocktails and then a great three-course meal, and after that there was music and dancing. You can go outside on deck where you have amazing views of Manhattan. Actually we only just made the cruise by the skin of our teeth. President Obama was in New York to address the United Nations and as we were in a taxi heading for the pier to board the cruise, we discovered that the police had closed a lot of the streets to let the President's motorcade through. With the clock ticking and our yellow cab going nowhere, we decided to get out and find the nearest subway station. Once our train reached its destination, we had to dash to get to the cruise boat, but fortunately we just made it on time. I'm so glad we did because to see Manhattan like that was an unforgettable experience. The couple, who met as partners on Dancing on Ice, enjoyed a Bateaux New York Cruise of the Hudson . The bright lights and busy traffic of Fifth Avenue which Samia covered extensively during her four-day trip . During our break, we saw most of the famous sights, including the Statue of Liberty, where we took some great pictures. We didn't manage to catch a show, though - we simply ran out of time. We wanted to have a juicy steak at a proper New York steakhouse. Friends had told us about a place called Burger Joint in Le Parker Meridien Hotel - it doesn't look very special (in fact, there's graffiti all over the walls outside) but it's reckoned to serve the best burgers in town. I have to agree they're pretty special. It was Sylvain's first visit to New York and he absolutely loved it. He also enjoyed the shopping. We must have covered the whole of Fifth Avenue during our stay, and yes, purchases were made. I have to confess I bought a few dresses. The pound was very good value against the dollar at the time, so there were a lot of bargains to be had. I calculated that many things were half the price compared with the UK - so how could I resist? While Samia shopped at famed New York stores such as Tiffany and Co, Sylvain worked out in the gym . For bargain shopping, Samia recommends discount outlet store Century 21 for lots of major brands . Sylvain wasn't always my shopping buddy. He chose to remain at the hotel a few times and work out at the gym. So while I was at Tiffany's he was on the running machine. A crowd of paparazzi turned out to be for Lady Gaga, but sadly a selfie with the pop star wasn't an option . Despite our world renown as an ice-dancing couple - we met while we were partners on the ITV show Dancing On Ice - we managed to resist the lure of the rink at the Rockefeller Centre. For Sylvain, ice skating is too much like work. I still skate from time to time and I have to say I'm a lot better at it than I was on the programme. I think that's because I'm just doing it for fun now and there's no pressure on me. If anybody is looking for good shopping, I can recommend BCBG - it's great for dresses, and their prices are excellent. If you're after big savings, head to Century 21, which is like an outlet store for lots of major brands. Friends had told us about it before we travelled to New York. I'm glad they did because the prices were so temptingly low. And of course I also made sure to visit the Disney Store to get presents for my little girl - we were loaded up with bags from there, much to her delight, when we returned to England. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the trip was when we had stopped to have lunch at a small Italian restaurant on Central Park near our hotel . While we were eating, we noticed a crowd gathering - with lots of paparazzi photographers. We were wondering who was going to emerge when out stepped Lady Gaga. It was the ultimate holiday treat - it was just a shame I couldn't arrange a selfie with her. That would have been the icing on the cake. American Sky (0843 636 2001) offers a three-night holiday to New York from £899pp. This includes accommodation in the JW Marriott Essex House New York on a room-only basis and return flights with British Airways from Heathrow.

"Scientists from the University of Wollongong are designing ultra-durable condoms they claim could feel even better than nothing at all. The contraceptive is made with hydrogel, a strong and flexible solid which can be made to feel and act like human tissue. The groundbreaking design will eventually offer functions like self-lubrication, topical drug delivery, and even electric conductivity, dramatically changing the capacity of male contraception, reports Science Alert. Scientists from the University of Wollongong are designing ultra-durable condoms they claim could feel even better than nothing at all . The contraceptive is made with hydrogel, a strong and flexible solid which can be made to feel and act like human tissue . The Australian team behind the design, led by materials scientist Robert Gorkin, won a grant for a next generation condom in 2013, giving them access to US$100,000 to use on research. 'Our original idea was just to try to prove that an original material could replace latex,' Mr Gorkin said. 'We were starting from scratch, we had an idea that these new materials would have the same properties as rubber with a nicer feel, but we weren't sure if they had the right properties for a condom.' 'The early indications are that the materials are strong enough and actually do prevent against the transfer of small biological molecules,' he said. Robert Gorkin, the leader of the research team responsible for the design, said: 'If you make them so pleasurable that people can't wait to put them on, then more people will use them' The team won a grant for a next generation condom in 2013, giving them access to US$100,000 to use on research . Hydrogel has been around for decades, but it has risen to prominence in recent years, after being used in prosthetics for the likes of eye implants and blood vessels. The researchers now plan to partner with Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne to conduct biometric testing to measure the bodies response to the material. 'We'll be able to look at brain activity to see whether it really feels better than latex,' said Gorkin. 'If you make them so pleasurable that people can't wait to put them on, then more people will use them, and we can hopefully stop the spread of disease. It's as simple as that.' Hydrogel (pictured) has been around for decades, but it has risen to prominence in recent years, after being used in prosthetics for the likes of eye implants and blood vessels . The researchers plan to conduct biometric testing to measure the bodies response to the material . Gorkin is hoping to design the product to accommodate for the around the cultural and social needs for birth control. 'It's a branding exercise as much as a scientific one,' said Gorkin. 'A material alone can't change the way we look at sex, but we believe it can definitely help.'","The design comes from scientists at the University of Wollongong .

"The troubled son of an influential San Diego businessman was arrested last week for allegedly attempting to kidnap a 7-year-old girl from a local elementary school. Jack Henry Doshay, 22, appeared in court for the first time on Friday as he pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping, false imprisonment with violence and child cruelty. Noticeably absent from the court room were the suspect's parents, Karen and Glenn Doshay. Glenn Doshay is a minority owner of the San Diego Padres and a former investment manager who focuses on charitable causes with his wife. Scroll down for video . Caught: Jack Henry Doshay, 22 (left), was arrested last week after allegedly attempting to kidnap a 7-year-old girl from a Solana Beach, California elementary school. On the right, the police sketch of the suspect before Doshay was arrested . Frightening: Prosecutors are accusing Doshay, the son of a prominent local businessman, of attempting to kidnap a 7-year-old girl from Skyline elementary school on March 23 (seen above) Doshay's lawyer Paul Pfingst said he told his client's parents not to show up at the hearing since it would be short, and said they are likely to attend court on Thursday when their son has a bond hearing.  He is currently being held without bail at the Vista jail. 'The family is obviously very distressed,' Pfingst said after the arraignment, 'very distressed a young girl had that traumatic experience.' Doshay was arrested on Wednesday, nine days after he allegedly tried to kidnap a 7-year-old girl from Skyline Elementary School in Solana Beach. Officials say the incident happened around 3:30pm, just as classes were letting out for the day. Doshay allegedly grabbed the young girl, who has not been identified, as she was walking from class to after-school care and tried to cover her mouth with packing tape in an attempt to smother her screams. Parent's worst nightmare: Make Paeske is the father of the girl Doshay allegedly tried to kidnap. His daughter was freed when teachers and parents overheard her screaming for help . Censored: When he appeared in court on Friday, reporters were not allowed to take pictures or broadcast Doshay's image. His layer Paul Pfingst pictured on the right . Emotional issues: Doshay was allegedly arrested at a residential facility on Wednesday where he was seeking treatment for depression . But teachers and parents heard the girl's cries for help and found her struggling with Doshay, who in turn fled the scene in a newer model black Ford Flex SUV. Police say Doshay has no connection to the girl, but that his brother lives near the school. Doshay was arrested nine days after the incident, after police released a sketch with his description and got over 150 tips from the public. He was taken into custody at a residential facility where he was receiving treatment for depression. Pfingst said his client has sought inpatient and outpatient treatment for depression on other occasions in the past. At a press conference following Doshay's arrest, the father of the girl he attempted to kidnap spoke out about his family's relief and the daughter who is 'our inspiration' and 'hero'. 'This guy messed with the wrong girl and the wrong community,' father Mike Paeske said. 'San Diego County families can sleep a little better knowing that one less threat is out there on the streets.' When Doshay appeared in court on Friday, reporters were barred from taking his picture or broadcasting his image. If convicted, Doshay faces up to 11 years in prison.","Jack Henry Doshay, 22, was arrested at a residential facility Wednesday where he was receiving treatment for depression .

"Upmarket Bentleys and Porsches are more likely to break down than much cheaper cars, according to a survey. The two marques finished bottom of a 38-strong table of vehicle manufacturers judged on reliability. Scroll down for video . Reliability: Bentleys and Porsches are more likely to break down than cheaper cars according to a survey . The list price of Bentleys ranges from £136,250 to £224,700, yet the manufacturer and Porsche finished bottom of a 38-strong table judged on reliability . Thousands of cars aged three to eight years old were assessed on their failure rate, age, mileage and cost of repairs. The most reliable was Honda, with Suzuki second and Toyota in third place while Chevrolet and Mazda were joint fourth. Overall, the most reliable models were the Honda Jazz and Mitsubishi Lancer while the least reliable was the Audi RS6, which was also the most costly to fix, with an average repair bill of £1,003. Electrical faults were the most common across all cars, accounting for almost a quarter of visits to garages. Axle and suspension faults were also common, affecting 22% of cars. What Car? magazine compiled the table with the Warranty Direct website. What Car? editor Jim Holder said: 'Honda's success in the reliability index is chiefly down to low failure rates. But, when things do go wrong, the cars are also relatively cheap to fix. 'Reliability is always one of the key attributes buyers look for when considering a used car purchase, so manufacturers that consistently demonstrate durability will always do well with the consumer.'

"Authorities forced alleged gang members to reveal their tattoos after they were arrested during a nationwide operation that saw more than 1,200 people detained. Teams from Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stormed properties associated with 239 crime syndicates following a six-week operation known as Project Wildfire. Officials from 215 local, state and federal law-enforcement agencies seized hoards of weapons, drugs and cash at the addresses and at least 913 have already been charged with a range of crimes including rape, murder and sexual assault. As they were booked into jail, some of the suspects were forced to take off their shirts and reveal their ink - many of which are believed to be tied to gangs. Detained: A gang member arrested during raids by Homeland Security and Customs officials across the country shows off his head tattoo in Dallas, Texas (left). The letters could mean he was a member of a Sureno (Mexican Mafia) gang and was originally based in El Paso. Another suspect covered in tattoos poses in Lubbock, Texas (right) Images released following the raids show tables covered in confiscated guns and defendants showing off their gang tattoos. The greatest activity took place in the San Juan, Dallas, El Paso, Los Angeles and Detroit. Most were U.S. citizens but 199 foreign nationals were also arrested from 18 countries in South and Central America, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Caribbean. Of the individuals arrested, 976 were gang members and associates. Homeland Security Investigation (HSI) agents also arrested – or assisted in the arrest – of 231 other individuals on federal and/or state criminal violations and administrative immigration violations, for a total of 1,207 arrests. Of the total 1,207 arrested, 1,057 were males and 150 were females. From those in crime syndicates 913 were charged with criminal offenses and 63 were arrested administratively for immigration violations; 650 had violent criminal histories, including 19 individuals wanted on active warrants for murder and 15 for rape or sexual assault; and 199 were foreign nationals, of which 151 were gang members and gang associates. Suspect: A man shows off his ink before being booked into jail in Lubbock, Texas, following the nationwide raid where more than 1,200 people were arrested. One of the markings on his back is of the Virgin Mary . Identity: Two more suspects reveal their tattoos to the authorities in Dallas (left) and Denver, Colorado (right).

Sarah R. Saldaña, the director of the ICE, said in a statement: 'Criminal gangs inflict violence and fear upon our communities, and without the attention of law enforcement, these groups can spread like a cancer. 'That’s why ICE works with law enforcement partners around the country to stamp out gang activity wherever it takes place.' Homeland Security's Greg Mandoli told Fox News: 'This is where grassroots law enforcement starts. This is how we get a baseline read of what’s happening… it all builds on itself…this is what federal agencies, investigative agencies like HSI, are doing to target transnational criminality. 'We’re looking to prevent, deter and protect communities. The public doesn't realize what’s happening in a federal investigative agency like HSI and the breath of the investigations that we’re doing.

"A teenager diagnosed with a deadly brain tumour has raised $80,000 needed upfront to pay for urgent surgery. Jackson Byrnes, 18, has flown from Lismore in northern New South Wales to Sydney to be operated on by renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo, the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see Jackson paralysed. For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront by Tuesday night, so that he can undergo the operation on Wednesday morning. On Monday morning they reached the target on their GoFundMe page, but Jackson's mother says the family needs an additional $45,000 to cover chemotherapy and other hospital fees. Three weeks ago the 18-year-old was told by doctors that he had a stage four brain tumour that was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jackson Byrnes, 18, has flown to Sydney for a risky operation to remove the tumour on his brain . For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront for the risky surgery . Jackson's girlfriend Jahnae Jackson (right) noticed he had developed a lump three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI . His family refused to accept the dismal diagnosis and took matters into their own hands and found Dr Teo, who said he was willing to perform the operation if the family understood the risks. Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said Dr Teo explained to her that  her son would most likely be paralysed down his left side. 'But he's already paralysed because the tumour is pressing down on that side of his brain, that's why we've just said go for it,' Ms Byrnes told Daily Mail Australia. 'I can't afford not to because I won't have my son around if I don't take these risks. 'Dr Teo is the best brain surgeon in the country, I've got my son's life in his hands basically.' Dr Teo, director of Sydney's Centre for Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery, said other surgeons were technically able to perform the surgery but he was the only one prepared to do it. 'People think that it's futile because he's got a malignant tumour and it's very aggressive,' Dr Teo told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's significant weakness down his left side and they think his quality of life is such that he wouldn't want to live anyway.' But Dr Teo said he makes decisions based on what his patients want. 'If a patient really wants it and knows the risks and understands how risky the operation is I'll usually respect the patient's wishes,' he said . The 18-year-old (pictured left, getting his head shaved) at a recent fundraising event . Jackson Byrnes was diagnosed with a stage four tumour three weeks ago and needed $80,000 for surgery . Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his GoFundMe page, but said the family still needed more . 'He is a lovely boy and he's only young. 'I said ""You know you're going to be paralysed"", I've told him the worst case scenario. 'He understands that and he wants to live.' Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain. 'If you can buy him time with surgery then the hope is you're going to get a good response to the chemotherapy and radiotherapy and a significant extension of time,' he said. 'Even if we could buy him six months of life the hope is we're going to come up with new treatment in that time.' Dr Teo said the $80,000 payment required for the surgery was standard. Jackson needs  $80,000 by Tuesday night in order to pay for his surgery upfront, and another $45,00 for fees . Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo is the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see Jackson paralysed . 'I operate at a private hospital and they insist on upfront payment, you can't blame them they run it like a business,' he said. 'I don't know how much it costs I don't try and talk about the money side of things. 'But that is the cost of everything and it's also an insurance for the hospital should he get complications.' Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his GoFundMe page, but said the family still needed more. 'It's amazing that we did it in four days,' Ms Byrnes told Daily Mail Australia . 'But I need more money because $80,000 is just for Dr Teo. 'The hospital fees are another $45,000 and I have to pay for MRIs and CT scans, all the radiation and chemo treatment.' Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain . Taking to his Facebook fundraising page - Jackson Byrnes Brain Tumor Surgery Fund - friends of Jackson thanked the thousands of people who have made donations to the page. 'Overwhelmed with joy and gratitude,' the page posted on Monday morning. 'Thank you to everyone that contributed to this and more. Over 12K was also raised in the last week by local community.' According to the Gold Coast Bulletin, Mr Byrnes' girlfriend, Jahnae Jackson, noticed he had developed a lump  three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI. He was rushed to the Gold Coast for a biopsy which found a stage four tumour buried deep in the teenager's brain. Mr Byrnes was told they would not operate due to how deep the cancer was, but instead suggested chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Messages of support and promotion of the cause have flooded social media for the Casino teenager . The donations have been coming in thick and fast since the GoFundMe page was created . Knowing that this was not enough, Mr Byrnes and his family searched for a specialist who would perform the dangerous procedure. They found neurosurgeon Charlie Teo who would operate on Wednesday as long as he received an upfront payment of $80,000 by Tuesday evening. The family then turned to social media and crowd sourcing in a desperate plea for donations. 'Most boys his age begin their journey into adulthood with hopes , dreams and anticipation of what lies ahead and excitement of the endless opportunities of what life will bring them,' Mr Byrne's fundraising page on GoFundMe reads. 'It is not a time to be enduring a fight for your life.' Victorian finance, leasing and risk management company Morris Finance have made the largest donation to the cause by pledging $2000. '#savejackon has reached past the half way mark at $40,255 with two days to go,' a supporter posted on Twitter . In nine days over $76,000 was raised for the teen's surgery . Rooftech Australia, Summerland Credit Union and Alstonville Quality Meats have also donated generous sums for Mr Byrnes. Messages of support have also flooded social media for the Casino teenager. 'Thoughts and prayers going out to you Jackson, stay strong,' wrote one well wisher on the fundraising page. 'Hoping for the best possible outcome for you! Hugs from our family to yours!' wrote another. The Twitter hashtag #savejackson has also been circulating through the Casino and Lismore area.","Teen with deadly brain tumour has raised $80,000 for emergency surgery .

"A man sentenced to death in the killings of a baby and her grandmother said he's so dissatisfied with his attorneys he'd rather be executed now than continue seeking a new trial with them. Raghunandan Yandamuri, 29, who had served as his own lawyer before being convicted of murder, accused the attorneys of not responding to his calls or letters. He said Monday in Montgomery County Court if his appeal keeps going the same way he would rather be executed immediately. Raghunandan Yandamuri, 29 (left), of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, is appealing his death penalty sentence for a murder but says that he would rather be executed than continue with his lawyers. Above, Nov 2012 . Yandamuri was convicted in the grisly stabbing death of Satayrathi Venna, 61 (left) and the suffocation death of her grandchild Saanvi, 10 months (right) Judge Steven O'Neill called that 'a little dramatic.' Attorney Henry Hilles said he and colleague Stephen Heckman have spent more time with their client 'than has ever occurred in Montgomery County history.' 'Mr. Heckman and I met with Mr. Yandamuri at the prison tens and tens and tens of times at his request over the two plus years that we were representing him. It boggles my mind to hear him claim that we have not made ourselves available to him,' Hilles told the Times Herald. Yandamuri was a technology professional outside of Philadelphia and knew the baby's parents in what prosecutors called a botched kidnapping plot. The Indian national was given two death sentences in the 2012 slayings of 10-month-old Saanvi Venna and 61-year-old Satayrathi Venna. He was expressionless as the verdict against him, which included up to 62 years in prison for kidnapping, burglary, and abuse of a corpse, was read in October. Prosecutors argued Yandamuri hatched the kidnapping plot to pay for a gambling habit. They said he was mired in gambling debts and told police he committed the crime after losing at least $15,000 at a casino. He told investigators he panicked after the grandmother, who had opened her family's apartment door to him, was killed in a struggle over a kitchen knife he had carried. Yandamuri, an Indian national working as a technology professional outside of Philadelphia, acted as his own lawyer during his trial before his post-conviction hearings were taken over by lawyers . Yandamuri told police he accidentally dropped the baby, put a handkerchief over her mouth to quiet her and tied a towel around her head. He said he then left the baby — with her dark hair, huge dark eyes and white dress — in a trash-strewn, unused sauna in a basement fitness center and when he returned hours later with milk for her she was unconscious. Prosecutors said that the man kept the baby in a suitcase in the trunk of his car for days and slashed the elder Venna's throat to the bone. Yandamuri knew the baby's parents, who also were young Indian tech professionals, from his King of Prussia apartment complex. The defendant had gone to a birthday party for the baby's mother, had met the visiting grandmother and used family nicknames in a ransom note demanding $50,000, authorities said. 'They both are working, so I thought maybe they have some money,' Yandamuri told police in a videotaped statement. 'My intention was not to kill anyone or not to harm anyone. I only tried to kidnap the baby.' At trial, though, Yandamuri argued two other men forced him at gunpoint to help and said he was pressured into confessing. 'Mr. Heckman and I met with Mr. Yandamuri at the prison tens and tens and tens of times at his request over the two plus years that we were representing him,' attorney Henry Hilles (pictured) said . He also said during a post conviction sentencing hearing that he would rather receive the death penalty than sit through the hearings where relatives spoke about the victims, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. His mother Padmavathi traveled from India took the stand and said that her son had been traumatized since age ten after his father was killed in a terrorist attack. She said that he had previously tried to kill himself by drinking kerosene. Yandamuri has tried to file motions on his own since the beginning of his appeal, but they cannot be accepted because he is not representing himself. Hilles and Heckman plan on challenging the death penalty as well as alleged bias during Yandamuri's trial. All death penalty cases in Pennsylvania are given automatic appeal up to the state supreme court level. Earlier this year Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf declared a moratorium on the death penalty, citing bias in proceedings, expense and inefficiency in repeated appeals. The state has not executed anyone since 1999.","Raghunandan Yandamuri, 29, sentenced to two death sentences last year .

"A mayoral candidate has bungee jumped from a bridge where his ancestor plummeted 160ft to his death for a drunken bet worth just a sixpence. Dave Roberts, who is in the running to become the mayor of Middlesbrough, followed in his great-great-uncle Daniel McAllister's footsteps by leaping off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees. However, instead of falling to his death like his relative did more than 100 years ago - Mr Roberts survived the jump which he carried out for a children's charity. Dave Roberts, who hopes to become the mayor of Middlesbrough, has bungee jumped off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees 100 years after his ancestor jumped to his death for a bet worth just a sixpence . Mr Roberts, a 50-year-old former TV and radio presenter, said 'Daniel, this one's for you' as he jumped off the bridge - in reference to his great-great-uncle Daniel McAllister who died after leaping off the bridge in 1913 . The 50-year-old former TV and radio presenter, from Marton, Middlesbrough, said: 'I thought it was going to be sheer terror, but I actually really enjoyed it. 'I had a good moment just before the jump. The guy was saying, I am going to count to three, and then you are going to jump. 'I said, I need to speak to my relative. I said: ""Daniel, this one's for you. I am going to collect your winnings"". 'I screamed like a child as I was going down, but thoroughly enjoyed it.' Mr McAllister was challenged to jump off the bridge by a friend after drinking in a pub in Port Clarence in a bet worth a sixpence. He died on May 4, 1913 at the age of 30. Newspaper articles from 1913 about Mr McAllister's death (pictured) tell how he 'dived to his death' and drowned following an 'amazing act of bravado' The cause of death was listed as: 'Shock and suffocation from drowning through jumping from the Transporter Bridge in a spirit of bravado whilst under the influence of drink.' Father-of-two Mr Roberts, who grew up listening to stories about his ancestor, managed to track down Mr McAllister's death certificate, which listed him as a general labourer of Washington Street in Middlesbrough. Mr Roberts, who was handed a sixpence and a beer after his jump this week, said: 'A century after Daniel was killed, and in a bid to exorcise the ghost of my ancestor, I decided I would have a go at the jump as well. 'But I wanted to do it as a charity event, and make sure I was safely attached to a bungee rope! 'The Daniel McAllister story has been in the family for over a century. 'No one really believed it to be true as all attempts to link it to the 1913 bridge jump had failed due to searching the wrong line of the family tree. 'Then we found a 1899 marriage certificate of Daniel's sister Emily, which opened a new route and this finally provided the link we needed.' Mr Roberts, who lives with his wife Francesca, 45, and children Kari, 14, and Luke 12, is running for mayor having moved back to England from a job in Singapore 18 months ago where he was vice president of business development for Fox TV. He said: 'This was all fun and games but I am a serious mayoral candidate for the town who has a great sense of humour and I'll be making a lot of serious points in the run-up to the election as I am a Middlesbrough lad who cares deeply about his town. 'Normally town mayors get set for the high jump after their term in office, this one got out of the way before the hard work starts.' He asked Teesside residents to stump up £2.50 - roughly what a sixpence would be worth today - to support him and raise money for the MFC Foundation which helps children in need.

"Hundreds of mourners have gathered  to farewell three children who died when their mother's car crashed into a Melbourne lake. Bol Manyang, one, his four-year-old sister Hanger and her twin brother Madit were laid to rest in tiny white coffins at St Andrew's Church in Werribee on Saturday morning. Their mother Akon Guode and father Joseph Tito Manyang sat in the church's front row, alongside older sister Awel, 5, who survived the horrifying crash on April 8. Scroll down for video . The three children who died when their mother's car crashed into a late in Melbourne have been laid to rest . Mourners held on to each other outside the church as the tiny coffins were wheeled inside. Sudanese AFL footballer Majak Daw arrived at the church and signed a book of condolences for the children before making his way inside. During the ceremony, mourners wept as the children's cousin, Makok Kuol, described them as 'three beautiful angels'. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Kuol told the congregation from the pulpit that four-year-old Madit was destined for great things. The crash  killed four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (pictured) and their one-year-old brother Bol when the 4WD plunged into a lake . One-year-old Bol (left) and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger (right) all died after the 4WD they were in crashed into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west . 'Everyone who came to my family's house, you would feel the joy of having this boy run up into your arms,' Mr Kuol said . 'A young, energetic Australian has been ripped from us by the work of the devil. Mr Kuol paid tribute to his 'sweetheart' cousin Anger and said her younger brother BoI was a precious young boy, who will be remembered for 'the best smile, the laughter, and the joy he brought to all of us.' After the ceremony the children were taken to the Werribee Cemetery where they were buried. Mourners wept and clung on to each other as the tiny white coffins were wheeled into the church . Police are still investigating how the car ran off the road and ended up in a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's west on April 8 . Police are still investigating how the car ran off the road and ended up in a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's west on April 8. Ms Guode, who was driving, was interviewed after the crash but was released without charge. Police are appealing for witnesses including a woman, believed to be in her 30s, who was walking with a pram near Lake Gladman at Wyndham Vale and may have seen the crash before alerting others. Investigators are also appealing for further help from the South Sudanese community including anyone who knows the family's movements the day of the accident. Last week it was revealed that five-year-old Awel who survived the crash, believes her three siblings who died were eaten by crocodiles. Joseph Tito Manyang (left), the father of three children killed, held hands with a friend as they walked from the church with pink booklets in their hands . Akon Guode (centre), the mother of three children was inconsolable as she witnessed her children being buried . Awel (left) survived the accident that killed her siblings and believes they were eaten by crocodiles . The young girl believes her younger sister and two brothers died when they were taken by a crocodile because the children associate the giant reptiles with water. Their father, Joseph Tito Manyang, said Awel remembers the accident. 'Always when they see water they think of crocodiles, so that's what she said. She said they'd fallen into the water and there were crocodiles eating my younger brothers and sister,' Mr Manyang said, according to the Herald Sun. Mr Manyang's partner and mother of the children, Akon Guode, was released from police custody last Thursday night after homicide detectives questioned her over the crash. She told them she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident and remembers her children crying out. Ms Guode had been sent to stay with a relative following the crash, after portraits of the deceased children and memories of them running around the family home became too much. Akon Guode told Police she was feeling 'very dizzy' before the accident and remembers her kids crying out . She was released from custody after police questioning . 'She's very shocked,' Mr Manyang said. 'She was crying every 10 minutes. She remembers everything at home and how the kids were walking around and playing.' Mr Manyang says his partner told him she 'didn't feel herself' as she was driving and can only remember parts of the aftermath of the crash, The Age reports. But she does recall being in the water and hearing her surviving five-year-old daughter Awel saying 'Mama, the children are falling under the water'. Mr Manyang was struggling with the news his three young children had died. 'The feeling is very hard for me,' he said. Sudanese AFL footballer Majak Daw was seen at the service . Mr Daw signed a book of condolences for the kids, who were of Sudanese decent . 'My kids, they were very good ... always, they were happy. Especially the twins. It is a big shock to me to get this information.' He revealed Ms Guode called him at 2.16pm on the Wednesday afternoon but by the time he returned the call there was no answer. 'Bol, is still shy, is one year and a half, always we play together, that's what has happened, but it is a big shock for me to get this information. It has happened to me, to lose three children at once,' he told SBS radio. It comes as Mr Manyang defended the children's mother saying he didn't believe she caused the crash deliberately and said she was extremely distressed. Mr Daw paid tribute to the children and showed his respects by attending their funeral . Awel Manyang, pictured here as a baby with her mother Akon Guode, believes her three siblings who died in the crash at a Melbourne lake were eaten by crocodiles in the water . The children's father, Joseph Tito Manyang (second from right), was hugged by a mourner at the crash site at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west . 'She is a very good mother,' he told the Herald Sun. 'She loved the kids. She took care of the kids. I don't think she planned to do anything. 'I'm still believing she's innocent. 'My message to the community - because there is a lot of talking around, there is untruths - what I can tell them is they have to wait for the report from the police investigation, that will be the truth.' He  made an emotional visit to the crash site last week, where floral tributes were starting to build up from the Sudanese community who knew the family and from strangers. Ms Guode, who is the mother of seven children, came to Melbourne from South Sudan to escape war after her first husband died. The children's mother, Akorn Manang, was behind the wheel of grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it plunged into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . Police have retrieved the four-wheel-drive after it was plunged into the Wyndham Vale on Wednesday . Mourners pray at a makeshift shrine at the scene where a 4WD was submerged in Lake Gladman . Mr Manyang's 16-year-old niece, Amani Alier, said the family were trying to console him following the devastating news. 'He's shattered, he couldn't stop crying, his nose was bleeding,' she said. 'He just dropped when he saw a picture of his son on the wall. It's so hard for him to deal with. He loved those kids.' The tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children . The 2005 Toyota Kluger is expected to be removed from the lake late on Thursday morning . The family with seven children moved from South Sudan to Australia in 2008 . Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children . Police have confirmed the mother is assisting the homicide squad with their investigation as they appealed for members of the Sudanese community to come forward if they knew anything about what was going on in the family's life. 'We need to understand what led to this, we need to understand the background of this family, we need to understand what was happening in their lives,' Superintendent Stuart Bateson said. 'Hopefully this will lead to a greater understanding of what led to this incident. We appeal especially to the Sudanese community who might know what was happening in this family's life, what their movements were before this tragedy.' The search and rescue team remained at the scene to try and pull the car from the water, which is reportedly about 20 to 30 metres from shore . Detective from the Homicide Squad and the Major Collision Investigation Unit have spoken to some witnesses but they are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. It is not yet know if it was a deliberate act or an accident, according to police. It's believed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger 4WD was travelling towards Pedder St and Minindee Road when the incident occurred. Police particularly wish to speak to anyone who saw the car between 3.30 and 3.45pm. Witnesses or anyone with further information about the incident should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Victoria police said that the exact circumstances of how the car went into the lake are yet to be determined .

"From now on there will be a lot less facebook photos with people cuddling up to tigers on their Thailand holidays. The famous Tiger Temple just outside of Bangkok, popular with tourists for being able to interact with the big cats, has been forced to shut due to keeping the animals without permits. Wat Pa Luangta Bua Yanasampanno has been told that their 147 tigers must be handed over to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation by Friday or they will be seized. The news will no doubt please animal rights activists who have been campaigning against the mistreatment of the big cats at the sanctuary. End of Tiger Temple! The temple, just outside of Bangkok, has been told all animals must be handed over by Friday as the monks do not have permits for them . The Bangkok Post reported that the National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation's Department Chief, Nipon Chotiban, had issued the closure following a raid in February. The investigation was launched following multiple complaints of trafficking endangered species, illegally selling animals and possible mistreatment of the animals. Although the results of the raid have not revealed to the public, the chief has said the temple did not have permits for the cats. Chotiban says that the tigers are to be moved to the Khao Pra Thap Chang Wildlife Breeding Centre in Chom Bung district and Khao Son Wildlife Breeding Centre in Suan Phung district in Ratchaburi province. Animal rights activists have been complaining against the treatment of the tigers for years . The carnivores at the temple are hand-raised from an early age by monks in an attempt to control their aggressive behaviour . Having a picture with tigers is a popular tourist attraction at the Kanchanaburi  sanctuary . Thai Visa News reported the Wildlife Conservation Office director, Tuanjai Nujdamrong, said: 'As Wat Pa Luang Ta Bua does not have proper cages and clear animal nurturing facilities, we can see that the temple has no intention to open as a public zoo. 'Therefore, they did not receive a reply when they sought a licence extension from the department and their [former] licence is no longer valid.' The tiger sanctuary, ran by Buddhist monks, has been open near Kanchanaburi since 1994. It has been shrouded by controversy and numerous complaints about the treatment of the chained up tigers. The tigers will be rehoused at the Khao Pra Thap Chang Wildlife Breeding Centre in Chom Bung  and Khao Son Wildlife Breeding Centre in Ratchaburi province .

"She recently revealed  her then boyfriend Jerry O'Connell 'flirted with and felt up' Rebecca Romijn at a party over a decade ago. And photos from that party reveal a loved up couple just moments before Giuliana Rancic became a woman scorned. The television personality - with the maiden name DePandi at the time - cuddled up to the Stand By Me actor on the red carpet at the Maxim Magazine Hot 100 party in Las Vegas back in June 2004. Scroll down for video . Former flame: Giuliana Rancic and Jerry O'Connell were pictured together at the Maxim Hot 100 party in Las Vegas in June of 2004 . The other woman: Also in attendance at the event was actress Rebecca Romijn . Giuliana looked perfectly content to pose with the actor, but Jerry's attention seemed to be elsewhere as he appeared to be rather distracted. The blonde beauty was flying solo to the event as she had announced her separation with actor John Stamos just two months prior. However she appeared to be still sporting the ring on her wedding finger as she showed off her model frame in a black ensemble. Her divorce with the Full House star was made official March 2005. Juicy: In her new book the 40-year-old television presenter revealed that Jerry was 'talking up Rebecca as a prelude to feeling up Rebecca', as he appeared to be a bit distracted while the couple posed for pictures . In an excerpt of her upcoming memoir titled Going Off Script obtained by Page Six, Giuliana dishes the details of Jerry and Rebecca's rather scandalous meeting. 'Little did I know he was in the VIP area, talking up Rebecca. As a prelude to feeling up Rebecca,' she wrote. Following his encounter with the X-Men actress at the party, Jerry became unreachable, and Giuliana decided to talk to him face-to-face at his residence. Newly single: Rebecca was all alone at the event as she had just announced her separation to actor John Stamos just two months prior, but appeared to still be wearing the wedding ring . Beautiful in black: It was no wonder that Jerry was enchanted with the X-Men actress at the event as she showed off her model figure in a dark ensemble . There, the actor flippantly dumped her: 'Nope. Sorry, homegirl...Things change, but you take care, OK?' Jerry and Rebecca went on to marry in 2007 and have two children together. This all happened after a prior incident of the Jerry Maguire star's infidelity as she detailed her tumultuous relationship with Jerry, who she first met in San Diego. Their romance - which ran from 2003 to 2004 - turned sour when Giuliana discovered Jerry had been cheating on her with Geri Halliwell, aka Ginger Spice. Still together: Jerry married Rebecca in 2007; here the couple are pictured in February in Los Angeles . The E! star wrote of the affair: 'I was being two-timed for one of the lesser Spices?' Jerry's apology did not exactly impress the TV star. '""Yeah, I know. I’m so sorry. I don't know what happened."" He had as much emotion as the customer-service representative who tells you your bags missed the flight,' she penned. He sure was busy: Jerry also had a fling with Geri Halliwell from The Spice Girls; here she is pictured far left with her band mates Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Mel B and Mel C . Giuliana ended up giving Jerry another shot, which was followed by the events at the Maxim party with the former Sports Illustrated cover girl. While Giuliana's love life is now going strong with husband Bill Rancic, the actress has now found herself putting out another fire. Just a month earlier the now 40-year-old star stirred up controversy when she commented on Fashion Police that Zendaya smelled of 'patchouli oil' or 'weed' when she arrived to the Oscars with dreadlocks. Love at last: Giuliana has been married to The Apprentice winner Bill Rancic since 2007 - here the couple are pictured in October in Los Angeles . On Monday, Giuliana - who looked fantastic with a bubble gum pink lace top that was paired with a high-waisted white peplum skirt - appeared on the talked to theToday Show to talk about the incident. 'I made a reference to the hippie culture. I talked about patchouli oil, which is a hippie perfume. And in the editing process, some of the gestures I made, some of the things I said were taken out for time,' the beauty said. 'I made peace signs, I said ""bohemian"" twice - those were taken out for time.' Dishing the details: She looked fantastic while leaving the Trump International Hotel in New York City on Monday, just a day before release of her new tell-all Going Off Script, which details romance with Jerry .

"An eccentric man is fighting to keep his driving licence photo as a picture of him with a colander on his head because it is his 'religious right'.

'Our religion is a minority but the DVLA is discriminating because it allows people who practise major religions to wear headgear in pictures.' The musician had his appeal rejected last month but hopes to emulate fellow believer Niko Alm from Austria, who won the legal right to wear the headgear in his licence photo in 2011. Mr Alm sent off for the licence in 2008 and he was invited to the doctor's to check he was mentally fit to drive, but after three years, his efforts finally paid off. Mr Harris began following the religion, along with his daughter Astri, 4, after it was set up in the USA in 2005 to protest the teaching of creationism as an alternative to evolution in science classes. Members claim to believe that an invisible alien made of spaghetti and meatballs created the universe after 'drinking heavily.' According to its tongue-in-cheek website their 'only dogma ... is the rejection of dogma'. Rejection: Mr Harris has already been turned down once by the government agency but has sent off a fresh photo wearing the headgear and in a second bid . A DVLA spokesman said: 'The photograph must be clear and be a current likeness to allow the Police to link the driver to driving entitlement held without confusion or ambiguity. 'Headgear is generally not acceptable, but may be permissible on religious or medical grounds and any exemptions are dealt with on a case by case basis.' Religious exemptions include the Sikh turban and the Islamic Hijab. Mr Harris, who plays banjo in The Iron Boot Scrapers, vows to fight his corner until he runs out of appeals when he will be forced to send a photo of him without the colander. He said: 'When I get to the final appeal I will have to send a photo without a colander but that would be a bad day for religious freedom.' Other countries including the United States, Austria and the Czech Republic allow Pastafarians to wear the metal sieves in their licence pictures. The Austrian authorities allowed Niko Alm to wear the unusual headgear as it is deemed a suitable accessory for his 'Pastafarian' religion . Shawna Hammon from Oklahoma was allowed to pose for her driver's license wearing a spaghetti strainer on her head because it falls under the state's rules for religious headwear . In September last year Shawna Hammond from Oklahoma, U.S. was granted permission to wear one in her licence photograph. She said  the photo obeyed the state's laws that requires people remove their glasses and wear a religious headpiece that does not cover their face, create shadows, or display text or logos. Earlier that year, Christopher Schaeffer, a council member in Pomfret, New York wore a colander on his head as he was sworn into office. In 2013, a Czech man was allowed to wear the headgear on his official identity card after officials ruled that turning down his request would be a breach of the country's religious equality laws. In 2005, a physics graduate from Oregon State wrote a letter about a 'Flying Spaghetti Monster' as a form of protest against the Kansas State Board of Education's decision to allow the teaching of Intelligent Design as an alternative to evolution in public schools. By professing belief in a supernatural entity composed of pasta and meatballs, Bobby Henderson, 24, called on 'Pastafarianism' to be given equal time in science classrooms alongside Christian theory. Word rapidly spread and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (CFSM) now has thousands of followers, mainly on college campuses and in Europe. The central tenet of CFSM is that an invisible Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe 'after drinking heavily'. Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day - and consider pirates 'absolute divine beings'.","Ian Harris, 51, is challenging DVLA over rights to wear colander in licence .

"A water main break in New York City caused evening commute hysteria Wednesday as a surge of brown water poured into a West Village subway tunnel sending travelers scrambling for cover and a different route home. The 12-inch water main broke around 6:45pm at 13th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, reports CBS New York, shutting down three train lines in both directions. As crews scrambled to stem the flow and get to the bottom of the leak, unamused New Yorkers whipped out cell phones to capture the rare sight of an underground deluge on video. Deluge: A water main break sent brownish water cascading down through the roof of a Manhattan subway tunnel on Wednesday . Rush hour: The break occurred in the West Village before 7pm while the evening rush was still going strong . It wasn't clear what caused the break. Video footage shows water flooding onto the subway tracks as stranded straphangers look on. Around 500 riders were soon forced out of the subway. Officials said there was no 1, 2 or 3 train service in both directions between Chambers Street and Times Square/42nd Street. The water also inundated the street corner where the break occurred and can be seen lapping at a West Village convenience store in overhead footage taken at the scene. Firefighters told CBS2 that as much as 2 feet of murky water, more than enough to reach the electrified third rail, had accumulated in some places before the water began to recede. That came around 8:40pm when the water main was shut off so the water could finally drain away. Snarled: The break also affected things at street level, where seas of city water threatened businesses and snarled city traffic . The main break also forced utility workers to shut off steam service to some businesses in the area and a major hospital . Firefighters told CBS2 that as much as 2 feet of murky water, more than enough to reach the electrified third rail, had accumulated in some places before the water began to recede . The official New York City Transit Subway Twitter account posted pictures starting around 9pm showing crews working toward getting the the water pumped out. However, it remained unclear whether the break would be affecting service during the morning rush hour Thursday. According to CBS2, the nearby Lenox Hill Healthplex was experiencing problems stemming from the break. 'Steam has been disconnected from the hospital – it is affecting the hospital with that utility at this point,' FDNY Battalion Chief John Porretto said. Residential buildings in the area remained largely unaffected.

"A suicidal Air Force veteran claims he was put on hold repeatedly by the VA helpline on Saturday night and almost ended it all as his depression nearly got the better of him. Missing his wife who had recently passed away from cancer, a desperate Ted Koran, 59, phoned the Veterans Suicide Hotline but all he got was a recorded message. Ted said he was put on hold three times for 10 minutes at a time and the only reason he decided not to kill himself on Saturday was to care for the 60 rescue animals he and his wife had looked after together. Scroll down for video . Depression: Ted Koran says that he came very close to ending his own life when he failed to get through to a counselor on the VA Suicide Hotline on Saturday . 'My wife and I saved them, and they saved me,' Ted Koran said to ABC Action News from his home in Florida. Ted Koran's experience highlights the increasing problems the VA is facing with its Veterans Crisis Hotline as it fights depression among ex-servicemen. First set up in 2007, the service had 60 calls a day on four manned phone lines. Today it has 52 operators fielding up to 1,000 phone calls a day, but the service is at breaking point. Despite statistics which say 22 veterans end their lives every day across the US, depressed former soldiers are still being put on hold by helplines. Sadness: Ted (right in his Air Force uniform) said he was thinking suicidal thoughts because he was struggling to deal with the loss of his wife Karen, (left with Ted) who passed away six months ago . Anguish: Ted said that he has battled with severe depression since his wife (Karen, right) passed away and wanted someone to talk to on Saturday night . Love: The Koran's ran The Critter Place out of Weeki Wachee in Florida and only the thought of the 60 animals he and Karen (pictured) cared for stopped Ted from ending his own life on Saturday . Help: The loss of Karen (pictured) was devastating to Ted. The Veterans Association estimates that 22 former servicemen and women end their lives daily - a figure that could be reduced they claim if they got more funding for their helpline service. On Saturday, Ted admitted to suffering an emotional breakdown. 'I was missing my wife Karen,' he said to ABC Action News. Ted's wife passed away from cancer six months ago and he says he needed help. 'I went to the only place that I knew and that I had available to me, the VA,' said Ted. The first call for help Ted made to the James Haley VA Center in Tampa ended in a recorded message giving him the 800 number hotline. He claims he was then put on hold for 10 minutes. 'I had to sit there patiently, in emotional distress, in tears, wanting to give up, desperately needing someone to talk to,' said Ted to ABC Action News. Much loved: Ted has assured his friends and family that he will get through the death of this wife (pictured) and has asked them not to worry . Frustrated, Ted said he hung up and redialled two more times. 'They had me on the verge of saying to hell with it,' he said. Damningly, Ted claims that when he finally got hold of a counselor, they were of little help. A Scripps national investigation also found shocking instances of suicidal vets unable to get through to speak to a counselor. One veteran claims he was on hold for 36 minutes. 'The very ones that are supposed to be there for me let me down,' said Ted. However, following national attention, Ted claims he was phoned by the VA who wanted to speak to him. Ted took to Facebook on Tuesday and wrote that the two phone calls he had with the VA were a mixed bag. 'Had two calls from the VA. One from a social worker at the James Haley Tampa VA. Another from the VA crisis hotline headquarters,' wrote Ted to Facebook. 'The first hour long conversation didn't go so well. He ended up getting upset at me because by the end I felt that he was just doing his job and I didn't feel any compassion in that he only called me because his superior told him to contact me. 'He was the very reason I was reluctant to seek 'professional' help for so long. 'The VA Crisis hotline call went totally different. By the end of that hour long conversation I wish I could have given her a hug.' For confidential support in the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Line on 1-800-273-8255.

"Tragedy: Dr. Frederic Brandt was battling with extreme depression before his suicide on Sunday a police report revealed on Tuesday . Fredric Brandt was suffering suicidal tendencies for just 10 days before he killed himself, revealed the police report into the tragic passing of the celebrity plastic surgeon. Brandt was discovered hanged inside the garage of his Coconut Grove home by his friend, John Joseph Hupert, at around 9.15am on Easter Sunday morning. According to the police report, Hupert was concerned for his friend and was staying with the doctor because he was suicidal. The last time Hupert said he had seen Brandt alive was around 11.30pm on Saturday. The police report says that Brandt's psychiatrist Dr. Saida Koita had become so worried for her patients state of mind that she ordered Hupert to stay with him to monitor him. She also revealed she had him on daily medication and was seeing him everyday for therapy sessions. The news that Brandt had descended into severe suicidal depression only very recently comes after claims that the 'Baron of Botox' killed himself after a 'bullying' TV series penned by Tina Fey aired on Netflix. The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt premiered on Netflix on March 6 and features a character called, Dr Franff. Played by comedian Martin Short, Franff has a high-pitched laugh, a speech impediment and absurd habits like drinking from a surgical bag. His face appears to be a grotesque exaggeration of Brandt's own appearance. Indeed, sources close to Brandt said the doctor, who suffered from depression, told People magazine he was 'definitely hurt' by an apparent portrayal of himself on the Netflix show. The friend called the Kimmy Schmidt send up 'bullying,' but added that it did not cause his suicide. Sources were today opening up about how Brandt was wounded by the characterization - though they said that this suicide could not be pinned on one insulting TV show. A friend speaking to People said: 'It was making fun of him for the way he looked and it was mean and it was bullying. '...It wasn't the only thing troubling him, it was just one factor. It definitely hurt him. He was absolutely upset, who would want that? But that was not why he committed suicide. But it didn't help. Scroll down for videos . Discovery: Dr. Brandt was found by a friend inside his home early on Sunday morning having taken his own life . Startling resemblance: Dr 'Franff' (played by Martin Short) – his name was Grant, but Franff is how he pronounced it due to all the surgery and injectables he’d presumably had - is lampooned in Tina Fey's Netflix show Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . Brandt worked with stars including Madonna, Stephanie Seymour and Jane Holzer. Left, the doctor is pictured with morning show host Kelly Ripa in 2011 at his Dr Fredric Brandt's SiriusXM launch and right, with comedian Joy Behar at the same event . Speaking out: Jeff Richmond, left in New York City today, spoke out on Monday over the death of Dr Fredric Brandt. The plastic surgeon was reportedly upset over his portrayal in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which Richmond's wife Tina Fey, right with Martin Short, created and for which Richmond has producing credits . Another source, speaking to the New York Daily News, said that Brandt had become fixated on his appearance and cried in front of patients. The source said: 'He worked 15-hour days, his office was jam-packed, and I paid him a compliment. He was so sensitive he started to cry. He said how awful the public was, and how mean people are. He was really affected by negative feedback.' When DailyMail.com asked Tina Fey's husband Jeff Richmond about Brandt's death near his home in New York City's Upper West Side, he said he hadn't been aware of it. Richmond is an executive producer and music composer on his wife's show. He said: 'That's very sad. I don't know anything about it. I just got home. Tina might know, I don't. She's not home.' Brandt was highly-regarded for his cosmetic work across the industry, with high-profile stars including Madonna, Stephanie Seymour and Kelly Ripa. The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami where he lived alone with his dogs.

Report: The report reveals the circumstances in which the body of Brandt was discovered inside his Miami home . Successful businessman: Dermatologist Dr. Frederic Brandt poses for a portrait with his newest additions to his skin-care line in 2013 . Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy. Franff's platinum blond hair and tight skin have a stark resemblance to that of cosmetic dermatologist Fredric Brandt . Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. It was also widely known that Dr Brandt injected products including Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvéderm, Voluma, The Times reported, into his own face, erasing his wrinkles, leaving him with full lips and an ageless quality. The doctor told The Times that people often asked him if he was from Sweden. Brandt grew up in Weequahic neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey where his parents ran a candy store. His father died when he was a teenager and he lost his mother before he graduated from Rutgers University in 1971. He went on to attend Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia. He completed residencies at NYU's Department of Internal Medicine and then in Dermatology at the University of Miami. He set up a practice in Coral Cables, Miami in 1982 and began part-time work in New York in 1998 but quickly expanded to become one of the most in-demand cosmetic appointments.","Fredric Brandt had been suicidally depressed for 10 days before he took his own life .

But at eight months pregnant with her first child, the 26-year-old has revealed being an expectant mum has been one of her toughest roles of her life so far.

"Whilst overseas backpackers visiting Sydney beaches are often told to go back to where they came from, Sutherland Council is instead exploring the idea of allowing them to camp right on the beach. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the council have voted to explore the possibility of allowing campervans to park at allocated locations with 'high tourist appeal,' in order to deter travellers from bypassing our most beautiful beaches. Among these locations are Cronulla beach and Wanda beach, both in southern Sydney, as it was found that due to a shortage of accommodation, many tourists were neglecting these areas altogether. The Sutherland Shire Council is exploring idea of allowing overseas backpackers to park their campervans in allocated locations right on the beach . Cronulla beach is often bypassed by tourist due to the shortage of accommodation in the area . Many locals have already had a negative response to the backpacker vans crowding the beachside streets . This motion was proposed by Councillor Steve Simpson due to the economic boost the backpackers bring to the area. On average, seasoned travellers spend $700 on eating out and shopping during a stay. Many locals have already had a mostly negative response to the backpacker vans crowding the beachside streets. Although most are well-behaved, their bad reputation stems from those who act in a disorderly manner during their stay. 'We want people to come to our country, we want them to visit us, but in many cases it is as long as you don't come in my street and don't come in my area,' he said. This motion was proposed by Councillor Steve Simpson due to the economic boost the backpackers bring . Some locals believe it cannot be done without rezoning open park areas due to rising land values in Cronulla . 'I want them to spend money and go to restaurants.' According to Mr Simpson, a short-stay camping site close to the beach would encourage seasoned travellers, retirees and various campervan users to the areas. He believes this would also solve the current issue of younger visitors parking their vans illegally on the streets. 'If you put people in areas that are well-maintained, and they can go there at a reasonable cost, it takes away that problem of being harassed in streets, and people knocking on their windows,' he said. Sutherland Mayor Kent Johns is keen to attract more tourists but keep away those who act in an unwelcome manner. This proposal aims to solve the current issue of younger visitors parking their vans illegally on the streets. Mayor Kent Johns is keen to attract more tourists but keep away those who act in an unwelcome manner . President of the Cronulla Chamber of Commerce, Mark Aprilovic, disagrees with Mr Simpson's vision. 'Where can you put them  and how can do you do this without offending the local people?' said Mr Aprilovic. Others believe that this feat cannot be done due to rising land values in Cronulla. 'There is only one hope near Cronulla and that is to rezone open park areas in front of the Green Hills Land estate,' the owner of Cronulla Beach Youth Hostel Michael Keogh said. Mr Keogh is often asked by young backpackers if they can sleep in their vans and still use his facilities and he always declines.","Sutherland Council is exploring idea of allowing overseas backpackers to park their campervans in allocated locations right on the beach .

"Christine Carriage, 67, (pictured) was handed a six-month suspended sentence at Norwich Crown Court . A grandmother hoarded 1,300 items of stolen clothing in her tiny bungalow – which police said was like a ‘warehouse’. Officers raiding Christine Carriage’s one-bedroom home found that 340 of the stolen items still had price tags on. But this week the 67-year-old walked free from court. A total of 1,337 items of clothing, shoes and handbags – valued at £5,620 – were seized by police from the home in Bowthorpe, Norwich, on November 4, 2013. William Carter, prosecuting, said police found an 8ft-long clothes rail bending under the huge weight of the clothing in one room. He said: ‘The officers described the property as looking more like a clothing warehouse than a dwelling. Each room was packed.’ On Wednesday, Carriage admitted acquiring, using or possessing criminal property. When police searched the house, she was at the property with son Shane Carriage, 45, and grandson Luke Hall. Officers found cash, drug paraphernalia and at least an eighth of a kilo of cocaine. Carriage had convictions for dishonesty from the 1960s and 1970s, and two convictions for shoplifting in the 1980s, as well as one in 1996 and another in 2012. Philippa Page, defending, said some items were Carriage’s clothes and those of her son, grandson and late husband. She said Carriage was guilty of mistaken family loyalty in allowing her ‘increasingly out-of-control’ grandson to store stolen clothes at her home. Sentencing Carriage, Judge Maureen Bacon told her: ‘You have been a dishonest woman through all your life. 'I don’t see why I should inflict your keep on the public purse by sending you to prison today.’ She was given a suspended six-month jail sentence, ordered to do 120 hours of unpaid work and told to pay an £80 victim surcharge at Norwich Crown Court. But Carriage and her son were cleared of supplying cocaine last August after Recorder Peter Wallis ruled there was no case to answer. Hall had previously admitted supplying cocaine, possessing cocaine and possessing criminal property and was jailed for 34 months.

Upwards lightning is possible, but is very rare - with current estimates suggesting less than one per cent of lightning strikes travelling in an ‘upwards’ direction.

Typically lightning is seen from a distance, or from the side, and it is rare to capture an image almost directly beneath a bolt. As a result, this can skew its perspective. In particular, if the bolt is travelling straight at the viewer - so they are almost looking up the length of the bolt -  it can make it appear as if it is curving because of its forked nature. There have been examples of lightning appearing to make complete circular loops, but this is also a trick of the eye. Lightning is caused by the build up of electrostatic charge in clouds. As they develop, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud, and between the cloud and the ground. Upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to Earth, and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds. The preceding flash causes an electrical field change, which allows an upward positive leader to originate from a tall object like a building or wind turbine. During winter snow storms, it is possible for tall objects to initiate upwards lightning without preceding flashes. Upwards lightning is very rare - estimates suggest less than one per cent of lightning travels in an ‘upwards’ direction. It is typically classified into three groups. The smallest are starters, which extend up to a  altitude of 12 to 19 miles (20 to 30km). Next are jets, which extend 25 to 31 miles (40 to 50km), and the last are gigantic jets, which reach 44 to 56 miles (70 to 90km). Positive charge builds up in one area of the cloud, while negative charges build up in the other - typically the top and bottom of the cloud respectively. If this build up of charge reaches a certain level, the insulating capacity of the air breaks causing the negative charges to escape or 'leap' from the cloud either onto another another cloud - known as sheet lightning - or to the ground. As negative charges gather in the bottom of a cloud, the negative charges in the ground are forced from the surface, leaving it positive. When a so-called 'streamer' of negative charges leaps from the bottom of the cloud, it is therefore attracted to the ground, which in turn emits a streamer of positive charges from the ground up. In particular, the negative 'stepped leaders' fork downwards looking for the best conductive path to Earth, with the least resistance. This is why these stepped leaders typically travel straight down from the cloud. As the streams connect it causes electrons to jump, or 'return the stroke', and an electrical current begins flowing, which creates lightning. This flash temporarily equalises the charged regions, until the opposite charges build up again. Lightning can occur between opposite charges within the thunderstorm cloud, known as intra-cloud lightning, or between opposite charges in the cloud and on the ground, referred to as cloud-to-ground lightning. And there are roughly five to 10 times as many cloud flashes as there are cloud-to-ground flashes. Within these strikes are two types of ground flashes known as natural and triggered. The latter includes strikes to very tall structures, planes, rockets and towers and goes from the ground up to the cloud. Natural lightning is cloud to ground. Upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to Earth, and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds. The preceding flash causes an electrical field change, which allows an upward positive leader to originate from a tall object. Upwards lightning is very rare - estimates suggest less than one per cent of lightning travels in an ‘upwards’ direction - and it is typically classified into three groups, based on peak altitude. The smallest are starters, which extend up to a maximum altitude of 12 to 19 miles (20 to 30km). Next are jets, which extend 25 to 31 miles (40 to 50km), and the last are gigantic jets, which reach 44 to 56 miles (70 to 90km). Lightning is caused by a build up of electrostatic charges. As they develop, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud, and between the cloud and the ground. If this build up reaches a certain level, the insulating capacity of the air breaks. The negative charge 'leaps' from the cloud either onto another another cloud - known as sheet lightning - or to the ground (pictured) When a so-called 'streamer' of negative charges leaps from the bottom of the cloud, it is attracted to the ground, which in turn emits a streamer of positive charges from the ground up. In particular, the negative 'stepped leaders' fork downwards looking for the best conductive path to Earth, with the least resistance. This is why these stepped leaders typically travel straight down from the cloud (pictured) However, the upward movement of the lightning in Mr Murray's image doesn't appear to extend as high as other forms of upward lightning, and storm chaser Dan Robinson suggests an alternative. He explained: 'Sometimes a lightning channel will have the illusion of 'looping back' on itself or having bright knots in it. The reason behind this phenomenon is quite simple. 'Lightning is three-dimensional - it 'zigs' and 'zags' in all directions. As the streams connect, it causes electrons to jump, or 'return the stroke', and an electrical current begins flowing, which creates lightning. This flash temporarily equalises the charged regions, until the opposite charges build up again. Upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to Earth, and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds . Upward lightning is typically classified into three groups. Starters extend up to an altitude of 19 miles (30km), jets extend to 31 miles (50km), and the gigantic jets reach up to 56 miles (90km). The upward movement in Mr Murray's image doesn't appear to extend this high, however, and storm chaser Dan Robinson said if part of a bolt is coming straight at you, it will appear to loop back on itself even when it's not . 'Most of the time you'll view a lightning channel from the side and it'll appear to travel in one general direction only. 'However, if that lightning bolt - or part of the lightning bolt - is coming straight at you, that is, you are looking at it from one end. It will appear to loop back on itself, sometimes even appearing go back upwards. 'The bright knots in a lightning channel you sometimes see in lightning photographs are the result of the same phenomenon - they are just smaller, tighter 'loops'. It appears brighter because there is more than one section of lightning channel 'overlapping' in the camera's frame.' The Met Office's lightning expert Sven-Erik Enno told MailOnline: 'On the particular photo it seems that the upper part of the channel may be pointed towards the observer. 'In such perspective the upward movement of the horizontal channel may be more amplified - the approaching horizontal channel seems to rise higher in the sky as approaching plane seems to rise higher above the horizon although its real altitude does not change.' The map above shows the average yearly counts of lightning flashes per square kilometer from 1995 to 2013. Areas with the fewest number of flashes each year are grey and purple; areas with the largest number of lightning flashes - as many as 150 per year per square kilometer (0.4 square miles) - are bright pink. The Democratic Republic of Congo was found to have the most over the period .","Image was taken by emergency services officer Scott Murray who dubbed the phenomenon 'looping lightning'

"An informant who spent the last 27 years working for the DEA as an undercover operative in exchange for the promise of US citizenship says he'll be deported now that he has retired. Carlos Toro, 66, worked as a mid-level member of the Medellin Cartel in the 1980s when a confrontation with his boss caused him to flee from Colombia fearing for his life. Toro came to the United States and eventually began working for the DEA as an informant after providing information about a number of his former bosses and associates. Scroll down for video . Carlos Toro, seen in 1982, is facing deportation from the United States after working for the DEA for 27 years . Toro, 66, was one of the DEA's strongest assets and helped carry out undercover stings around the world . Carlos Lehder Rivas of Colombia was taken down thanks in part to former Medellin Cartel member Toro . The ex-cartel member became one of the DEA's most important assets  and helped the agency carry out undercover stings around the world, CBS News reported. He wasn't paid for work, but was told he would be rewarded with US citizenship. That has not happened and Toro is now technically living in the US illegally after declining health forced him to retire, according to the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting. The DEA refused to help Toro with his citizenship after he went public with his plight. He said: 'If I am sent back to Colombia, I would be dead within the first four hours.' 'I am scared to death. I don't sleep anymore. 'I'm only thinking about what happens if they come for me. 'The United States government has sentenced me to death.' Information provided by Toro aided in the prosecution of ex-Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega (seen 1990) His fears sound reasonable considering his work aided in the prosecution of cocaine overlord Carlos Lehder and former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. DEA agent Mike McManus, who was Toro's handler for two years, gained notoriety after working with the uniquely-suited operative. McManus who arrested George Jung - the drug dealer portrayed by Johnny Depp in 2001's Blow - gave Toro $5,000 for an operation after the DEA declined to help, the Huffington Post reported. He said: 'It is government bureaucracy at its worst. 'He deserves to live life ever after in the United States. He's done his debt, he's paid his dues, he's done his service.' One of Toro's former colleagues recently gave him $5,000 for an operation after the DEA declined to help . Toro remains in limbo while trying to get a green card or a passport, and he can't collect social security benefits until he secures one of those documents. His final temporary visa expired on January 1 and Toro is prepared to go into hiding if he must. He said: 'I messed up, in a big way, many years ago. 'But I atoned. 'Many times over, I atoned. 'All I want now is what they promised me.'","Carlos Toro was promised he could stay in the US but is facing deportation .

"Three years ago, Pakistan had almost completely eradicated polio, a devastating disease which paralyses its victims' legs but is preventable with a simple injection. Today, it's on the rise again after the Taliban declared the vaccine to be a 'Western conspiracy' and a 'bio-weapon' that would actually make children sick, and waged violent attacks against those found to be supplying it. But mother-of-three Farhina Touseef - the subject of Channel 4's Unreported World - is risking her life by leading a team of medics as they travel door-to-door through dangerous Taliban strongholds offering the free vaccines to parents. Mother-of-three Farhina Touseef (pictured) is risking her life by leading a team of medics as they travel door-to-door through dangerous Taliban strongholds offering the free vaccines to parents . Flanked by reporter Nelufar Hedayat, Farhina takes her life into her hands on every mission she goes, unsafe in the knowledge that more than 80 health workers before her have been slaughtered by the Taliban. The Taliban, a Islamic fundamentalist political movement which was toppled from power after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, is famed for its hard-line policies and brutality against women. In Pakistan, polio has been on the rise since the Taliban declared the vaccine to be a 'bio-weapon' that would actually make children sick. Pictured, reporter Nelufar Hedayat with two polio victims . Two young sisters, Maheen and Mariam, pictured with their brother, contracted the disease after their father, a conservative cleric, refused to give them polio drops . It is opposed to music, television and education for girls over the age of ten, among other things - the polio vaccine included. Farhina, along with several other of the government-spearheaded teams, is desperate to stop the spread of the highly contagious disease, which the World Health Organisation has called an international public health emergency. '[My family] wanted me to give up work because it’s so risky,' Farhina admits. 'It’s life threatening. My husband said 100 per cent I should resign. But I couldn’t do it.' There have been 322 cases of polio across the country in the last two years, the majority of them children under three. Pictured, Maheen and Mariam's mother, who wanted them to have the vaccine . Farhina, pictured hiding beneath her veil, takes her life into her hands on every mission she goes, unsafe in the knowledge that more than 80 health workers before her have been slaughtered by the Taliban . Vaccination - administered in drop-form into the mouth - is the only way to stop the spread of polio, and there is no cure. There have been 322 cases of polio across the country in the last two years, the majority of them children under three. Farhina tells Nelufar that many of the people they try to help refuse the medicine and are hostile – dangerous even, having been indoctrinated by the Taliban. Two of her colleagues were gunned down on the job in 2012 by the terror group for issuing the vaccine. Farhina and the Channel 4 team travelled to Orangi Town, a particularly hazardous region, to meet a family devastated by polio. Two young sisters, Maheen and Mariam, contracted the disease after their father, a conservative cleric, refused to give them polio drops against their mother’s wishes. She hopes that with the help of leg braces, Mariam may be able to walk again within three years, but for Maheen, it’s too late. Another cleric, Aisha Usmaini, teaches 400 women and preaches against the vaccine, incorrectly claiming that it contains 'human foetal tissue' and is part of the 'war against Muslims'. Many of the families they try to help refuse the medicine and are hostile – dangerous even, so Farhina must travel with armed guards everywhere she goes (pictured) Vaccination - administered in drop-form into the mouth - is the only way to stop the spread of polio, and there is no cure. Pictured, Nelufar with two members of the team who provide the vaccine . Sadly, these claims didn't appear from nowhere. The American CIA has admitted to using a vaccination campaign as cover back in 2011 to allow them to go house to house in their hunt for Osama Bin Laden. Back home, preparing to go out for another day vaccinating children, Farhina is concerned about her own children. 'God forbid, I worry that if something happens to me, what will happen to my family?' she tells Nelufar. 'One day when Pakistan is free from polio, I will have time for my family. But right now my other children need me.' Unreported World airs tonight on Channel 4 at 7.30pm .","Farhina Touseef travels the country administering the free vaccine to kids .

"A man was left with a swollen and painful penis thanks to injecting himself with petroleum jelly in the hope it would make his manhood bigger. Father-of-one Szilveszter, 24, who now lives in Bolton, feared he would never be able to have more children after the DIY procedure left him unable to have sex. He said: 'I had to stop having sex with my wife as it's too painful. I would like to have more children but if I can't have sex I may lose my family. Father-of-one Szilveszter injected petroleum jelly into his penis as he wanted to make it bigger. Instead it became so swollen and inflammed, he was unable to have sex and was in constant pain . 'Every day is difficult for me as it's very painful and bleeding. This was the worst mistake in my life as I don't feel like a real man.' Hungarian born Szilveszter shares his story on the latest series of TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters. He said he had Vaseline injected into his penis following a friend's recommendation. He explains: 'I said to my friend I want to lose weight as I think my penis is small. He said you don't need to lose weight, I can help you. My friend injected in my penis Vaseline. Afterwards I was happy as it looked bigger.' But nine months later, his penis was swollen, painful and bleeding. He went to his GP and saw other doctors but all told him there was nothing they could do. Cosmetic surgeon Dr Vik Vijh, left, said injecting Vaseline, right, into the body is a very bad idea . Szilveszter turned to Extreme Beauty Disasters resident plastic surgeon Dr Vik Vijh who said there was hope he could be cured - but it wouldn't be easy. After examining Szilveszter Dr Vijh said: 'It's not a pretty slight, it's inflammed, it's sore, it's misshapen, his penis is a disaster.' He added: 'I have been doing plastic surgery now for 20 years and I have never seen anything like this. Injecting petroleum jelly into the penis makes no sense on any level.' Dr Vijh gave Szilveszter an MRI scan which revealed the large, hard bumps around his penis had formed thanks to his body reacting to the invasion of Vaseline. Dr Vijh explained: 'Your body has formed scar tissue around the Vaseline because it's a foreign body, your body is trying to ward it off and it gives you these painful lumps, it will soon start to ulcer through the skin. 'The other problem is the foreskin is swelling and splitting - the foreskin is 15 times more swollen than should be.' After examining Szilveszter Dr Vijh said he had never seen anything like it and the only treatment would be to 'skin' the penis to get rid of the Vaseline and scar tissue . The cosmetic surgeon said the only option would be for Szilveszter to have an operation where his penis would be 'skinned' to remove the Vaseline and scar tissue. 'I have never done this before but fingers crossed we can save his penis,' Dr Vijh said. After hours of surgery, the operation was a success. As a result of Dr Vihj removing all the Vaseline and scar tissue, Szilveszter is now back in full health following his recovery from the operation. He said: 'I am much better. It has healed well, it's painfree and working. I can have sex with my wife again. 'Many people said we can't help you. Dr Vijh did a perfect job, he has changed my life.' The father said he had learnt his lesson and won't meddle with his penis size again.

"New Jersey police have released a sketch of an infant whose headless remains were discovered last year in an attempt to track down the child's mother. On Nov. 11, 2014, the headless body of a seven-pound-five-ounce infant was found in a trash heap in Farmingdale, New Jersey. Now, more than five months later, authorities have released the sketch along with photos of evidence as they continue to investigate the child's death. The baby, who was named 'Emma Grace' by a local church, was discovered by a ReCommunity Recycling facility employee, police said in a news release. Scroll down for video . Emma Grace: New Jersey police have released a sketch of an infant (photographed), known as 'Emma Grace,' whose headless remains were discovered last year in an attempt to track down the child's mother . Evidence: Investigators located the infant's head along with two blood-soaked blouses (left and right) and a bag more than 50 miles away in Orange township . Investigators located the infant's head along with two blood-soaked blouses and a  bag more than 50 miles away in Orange township. Authorities released the sketch of Emma and the photos Friday enlisting the help of the public to locate the infant's mother. 'Detectives hope someone may recognize the baby based on the composite sketch or provide assistance to find the mother based on the items of clothing,' police said. The release states that no current evidence indicates that the mother was a 'victim of foul play,' but authorities have not ruled out the possibility. A medical examiner has determined that Emma was not stillborn, but the cause of the child's death is still unknown. Funeral: The baby's remains have been released to the Ardena Baptist Church in Freehold, which will hold a funeral for the infant Saturday . Name: The Ardena Baptist Church, who will hold a funeral for the child, gave her the name 'Emma Grace' Investigators say that if the mother is responsible for placing the remains in the trash heap, she may have been trying to hide her pregnancy prior to giving birth. 'She might have been living a different lifestyle than she was accustomed to, and since the birth she may have resumed some of her more normal routines,' police said. Based on hair characteristics, police said, the infant is of mixed race and may be of Hispanic origin. The investigation is ongoing and Monmouth County Crime Stoppers is offering up to $5,000 for information leading to the identity of the infant's mother. The baby's remains have been released to the Ardena Baptist Church in Freehold, which will hold a funeral for the infant Saturday.","New Jersey police have released a sketch of an infant whose headless body was discovered last year in an attempt to find the child's mother .

"This is the breathtaking moment a diver came face to face with a 'fish tornado' off the Mexican coast. Tori Hester, 25, from San Diego, California, was diving in Cabo Pulmo when the huge school of Trevally fish began circling above her. Husband Jeff, 26, was on hand to capture the incredible moment using his underwater camera. Stunning: Tori Hester was diving off the coast of Mexico when the school of fish began circling above her . 'Today, the biomass is booming and the ecosystem is returning to a healthy state which is how we managed to witness this incredible sight,' Jeff explained . Jeff, a marine scientist, said: 'We arrived in Cabo Pulmo, a tiny town made up of dirt roads with a population right around 100, not really sure what to expect, but had heard some pretty amazing stories about the place.' 'We were swimming along and saw a small band of Jacks heading away from us, so we followed them,' he explained. 'That small band slowly grew bigger and bigger, until out of the distance, this massive fish tornado appeared. 'I was awe-struck. I had never seen anything like that before in my life.' Tori's husband Jeff, a marine scientist, was on hand to capture the moment using his underwater camera . He added: 'It was such a productive ecosystem, with not only a large quantity of fish, but a wide diversity of organisms as well.

"Tim McGraw is facing a backlash from country music fans who say that his decision to headline a concert for a gun control charity could end his career. The Louisiana-raised singer is scheduled to raise money with a Hartford, Connecticut show on July 17 for the Sandy Hook Promise group, which organized in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in late 2012. However, anti-gun control commenters have said that McGraw, 47, risks losing his career the same way female country trio the Dixie Chicks never bounced back from criticizing President George W Bush. Scroll down for video . Country star Tim McGraw is facing backlash from conservative fans after agreeing to put on a Connecticut concert in support of a pro gun control charity. McGraw committed to a benefit concert for Sandy Hook Promise, which formed in the aftermath of one of the US's deadliest school shootings. Above, first responders at the scene of the shooting on December 14, 2012 . The conservator pro-gun blog Bearing Arms published a piece saying that McGraw's fan base 'overwhelmingly supports gun rights and views a concert benefiting Sandy Hook Promise as being a betrayal'. It draws a parallel to the Dixie Chicks fall from the graces of country music's fold after singer Natalie Maines made disparaging remarks about Bush in the lead up to the Iraq War. Commenters on the conservative blog Breitbart bemoaned a red state hero's turn towards the perceived liberal cause of gun control. 'Not real country singers in my book anyway,' AWRHawkins said. 'It is sadly apparent that these kinds of girly men are helping to destroy country music as we (used to) know it,' another, BloodofAlbion75, said. McGraw's opening act Bill Currington backed away from the project after backlash saying, 'I've never been one to take on controversial issues - I'm a singer.' 'I do feel strongly about honoring and supporting the Sandy Hook community and will be making a donation to a local organization,' he said on his Facebook page. However, McGraw, the headliner, stood by his decision when speaking to the Washington Post. Opening act Bill Currington (left) walked away from the project after the backlash but will join McGraw (right) on the rest of their tour together . McGraw said that one of his band members was good friends with Mark Barden (pictured) a musician who lost his son Daniel in the shooting . 'Let me be clear regarding the concert for Sandy Hook given much of the erroneous reporting thus far. As a gun owner, I support gun ownership,' he said. 'I also believe that with gun ownership comes the responsibility of education and safety — most certainly when it relates to what we value most, our children. I can’t imagine anyone who disagrees with that'. In a statement announcing the concert on his website, McGraw had said that 'Sandy Hook Promise teaches that we can do something to protect our children from gun violence. I want to be a part of that promise – as a father and as a friend '. He added that one of his band member's is good friends with musician Mark Barden, who lost a child in the shooting by 20-year-old Adam Lanza that killed 20 children and six adults. McGraw has been one of country music's most bankable acts for decades and has sold more than 40million records. He was estimated to bring in the 11th most money of all country artists in 2014 with $23.5million, according to Forbes. Sandy Hook Promise states its mission as to 'protect children from gun violence so no other parent experiences the loss of their child' and to help the community of Sandy Hook.","Country music star booked July 17 concert benefiting Sandy Hook Promise .

"A baby girl was given hypothermia in order to keep her alive after she developed a potentially fatal brain condition. Caitlin Kellie-Jones suffered from Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE), a type of brain damage that occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen or blood. To control the condition Caitlin was placed in a special cooling wrap within 40 minutes of her birth to keep her at the target temperature of 33.5 degrees for 72 hours. Nicola Kellie-Jones and partner Paul with children Caitlin and Dylan are raising money to help other children . Medics gave little Caitlin, pictured, hypothermia in a bid to prevent any brain damage . Caitlin, pictured, was diagnosed with Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy minutes after she was born . It allows the brain to cool down and minimises the damage from the lack of oxygen. Thankfully, Caitlin, now ten months old, recovered from HIE and is able to feed and play. Her parents, Nicola and Paul, are hoping it will not have affected her ability to walk and talk but they must wait to find out. Ms Kellie-Jones,  27, from Chorley, Lancashire, said: 'Caitlin was in an incubator surrounded by doctors and nurses. 'She wasn't moving or breathing for herself, and was making no noise. 'I had an image in my mind of our first cuddle which was taken away. Doctors were telling us she was very poorly and just to take it hour by hour. 'It was such a relief to bring her home.' Caitlin was born on May 10 last year weighing 7lbs 4oz after a normal pregnancy. She was whisked away by doctors immediately to be placed on a specialist cooling machine. Despite her ordeal, Caitlin, who is now 10 months old, seems to be developing normally . Ms Kellie-Jones, right, wants to raise £16,000 for additional cooling machines to help save other babies . Ms Kellie-Jones said: 'My mum was a neonatal nurse for many years and I often visited her at work and would see all of these babies in their little incubators and see families in and out visiting their babies, but I never imagined it would be me. Ms Kellie-Jones said the next important stage is whether she will be able to walk and talk normally . 'We couldn't look to the days ahead and my mum told me to take lots of pictures. I knew what they were all trying to tell me, everyone thought she wouldn't make it. 'I didn't move from her side for hours. I had the doctors and nurses tell me the worst case scenario so I could prepare myself, but it was very upsetting to hear she might not make it. 'Paul was the opposite, he wanted to know the best possible outcome. 'We were lucky that we were able to get Caitlin on one of the machines, otherwise we might not have been bringing her home.' Caitlin was born and treated at Royal Preston Hospital, where there are only two cooling machines available. Ms Kellie-Jones said: 'We are extremely lucky that the last cooling machine was available for our daughter that day. 'I'm trying to raise money now for two cerebral function machines for the hospital, which monitor brain activity for any signs of brain damage, and, if I raise enough, another cooling machine for the neonatal unit. 'My target is to raise at least £16,000. 'Her brother Dylan, 10, is doing a sponsored bike ride with his granddad to help too. 'At his age he could have thought what happened to Caitlin was normal, but he came to see her every night and loves her to pieces.' Caitlin will need follow up appointments until she is two, but it is hoped she will make a full recovery. To donate go to: www.justgiving.com/CaitlinsCoolingCause .

"Many people have experienced the loss of a childhood pet, but for one little boy, a funeral for his goldfish was almost too much to bear. The pet in question? A goldfish, named Top. Brooke Geherman, from Alberta, Canada, posted a video of her young son, Kowen, sending off his beloved pet the right way: by flushing it down the toilet. Young Kowen is devastated by the loss of his pet goldfish, Top, and holds a toilet funeral . The home video is filmed by mother, Brooke Geherman, and sees Kowen stood in the family bathroom, cradling his deceased goldfish. She asks her son: 'Who's Top?' Kowen responds by pointing and responds solemnly: 'This one.' The young boy cradles the fish before kissing it repeatedly in a heartbreaking move . In a heartbreaking move, the young boy then proceeds to kiss the lifeless goldfish repeatedly. Canadian mum Brooke then asks: 'Where are you going to put him?' He gestures at the toilet and answers: 'In the toilet'. At which point, the boy drops the goldfish down the toilet and flushes it. As Top begins to circle the bowl, he looks at his mum in a mixture of surprise and shock . As the goldfish disappears, Kowen realises he will never see Top again and tears start brimming in his eyes . As the goldfish circles the bowl and disappears from sight, Kowen seems to come to the realisation that he will never see his goldfish again. He looks at his mum with tears brimming in his eyes, before bursting into tears. As he becomes more distressed, his mother comforts him, and he cries on her shoulder, shrieking the name of the fish repeatedly . The video is aptly captioned: 'Boy loses best friend'. It has so far racked up 374,551 views. One user commented comfortingly: 'Don't worry little boy, there's plenty of fish in the sea...' To which another user replied wistfully: 'But only one Top.'","Brooke Geherman posted video of her son, Kowen on YouTube .

"Jurors have started deliberations in the case against a man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, whose 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement. Etan Patz 'is larger than his very little, important life,' Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in closing arguments at the Manhattan murder trial of Pedro Hernandez. She asked jurors to convict Hernandez of murder, saying he was a calculated killer who committed a terrible crime and then spent three decades trying to hide from it. Shira Patz and Stanley Patz, the sister and father of Etan Patz, arrive for court, in New York,  Wednesday: Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez . Pedro Hernandez, left, is accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, right, who vanished in 1979 . Hernandez confessed in 2012 in a case that has confounded law enforcement for decades. Etan's body was never found, nor was any trace of clothing or his belongings. He had never been considered a suspect - his name appears only once in law enforcement paperwork at the time Etan disappeared. The defense says the admissions are made up, the ravings of a mentally ill man who sees visions and has a low IQ. A teenage stock clerk at the corner shop, Hernandez knew there were children in and out of the store, and Etan had been there countless times, the prosecutor said. She said Hernandez saw Etan with a dollar and calculated he wanted a drink, so he asked him to the basement. 'Day after day he saw this beautiful little boy,' she said. 'One day, he acted on an impulse and did something terrible to this little boy.' She said the motive was sexual, and Etan likely fought back. 'The quickest and easiest way to shut him up and shut him up permanently was to choke him to death,' she said. Rosemary Hernandez, left, and Becky Hernandez, the wife and daughter of Pedro Hernandez, arrive for court in New York, on Wednesday . Stanley Patz, left, the father of Etan Patz, arrives for court on Wednesday, although his estranged wife Julie, right, hasn't been pictured at court in recent days . Illuzzi-Orbon said his first confession to a prayer group shortly after the boy disappeared was the most accurate - he was confessing to God, and he was trying to unburden himself. Prayer circle members testified that Hernandez made tearful admissions during a 1979 retreat that matched some of what he told authorities on video 33 years later: He gave a child a soda, took him to the store basement and choked him. Two said Hernandez also admitted abusing the boy; when talking to police, Hernandez denied molesting Etan. A former neighbor and his ex-wife also testified he told them about killing someone in New York. The Maple Shade, New Jersey, man made the stunning admissions to police after authorities received a tip from a relative who saw news reports of the case in 2012. Site: Hernandez was working in 1979 at this corner convenience store, near where Etan was last seen where the man said he threw the boy's body into trash . 'I grabbed him by the neck and started choking him,' said Hernandez, now 54. 'I was nervous. My legs were jumping. I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me.' Defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said the confession video shows 'a man sitting there convinced he killed a child - on a day that he doesn't know, at a time he doesn't know, at a location near a bus stop that he doesn't know.' The defense has suggested that the real killer is a convicted pedophile jailed in Pennsylvania who was the longtime suspect in the case. That man, Jose Ramos, denies involvement. However, a former federal prosecutor and FBI agent testified that Ramos told investigators he was '90 percent' sure a boy he took from a park was Etan, and Hernandez's former prison cellmate testified that Ramos admitted molesting the boy. 'Two confessions,' Fishbein said. 'Which person is more likely to have been a predator?' Etan's photo was one of the first on milk cartons. The day he went missing, May 25, became National Missing Children's Day. Etan Patz's 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement .","Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez, the man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz in 1979 .

"The biggest ice cover on North America’s Great Lakes in decades is backing up important shipping deliveries with 18 freighters currently wedged in the ice, unable to move. Extraordinary aerial photographs taken above Whitefish Bay on eastern Lake Superior, Ontario, show some of the freighters lined up across a frozen expanse.

Nowhere to go: The James R Barker Lake Freighter is shown trapped in ice in this aerial photo near Whitefish Bay . Mark Gill, director of vessel traffic services for the U.S. Coast Guard, told the Duluth News Tribune: ‘This is just crazy how much ice we have out there, we’ve had 35 square miles of ice descend upon and affix itself [to existing ice].’ The ships desperately need a path cut through the lake by Canadian and US ice breakers, which have been hampered by the extreme conditions. Gill added: ‘The ice is very mobile. There’s a lot of water in it. Hit with the icebreakers, it moves and doesn’t take the break. It’s been very slow to say the least.’ The ice breakers on the scene include the US Coast Guard cutter Alder – the largest US icebreaker, according to the Tribune. Breaking point: The ships’ ability to manoeuvre is extremely limited because the ice is able to penetrate their hulls .

"These are the four Royal Navy sailors charged with the gang rape of a young woman at an alcohol-fuelled party in a Canadian barracks. The men, who were taking part in a Royal Navy ice-hockey team tour of Nova Scotia, allegedly attacked a 21-year-old local woman. The assault was reported to police by the woman immediately afterwards. Scroll down for video . Charged: Royal Navy sailors Joshua Finbow, 23, (left) and Simon Radford, 31, (right) pictured in uniform and training . Held: Craig Stoner, 24, (left) and Darren Smalley, 35, (right) are being held by military police in Canada . Joshua Finbow, 23, a submarine engineer, Craig Stoner, 24, Simon Radford, 31, and Darren Smalley, 35, were arrested six days later. They were led into Dartmouth Provincial court on Friday partially masking their faces under their hoodies. The men were charged with sexual assault causing bodily harm and group sexual assault. A spokesman for the Canadian military police said the four were at a drinks party at the Shearwater naval base near Halifax on April 10 when the alleged offence took place. The alleged victim, who is a civilian, was taken to hospital and examined by sexual assault nurses. Shearwater is a secure military facility where ID is needed for access. The woman was reportedly invited on to the base to attend a party linked to the ice hockey tournament. Lieutenant Colonel Francis Bolduc, commanding officer of the Canadian Forces National Investigations Service (CFNIS), said: 'This is a disturbing accusation of sexual assault. 'I'm pleased with the full co-operation provided by the British authorities to support the hard work and diligence of the CFNIS team in responding to this matter.' In custody: Joshua Finbow (left) and Simon Radford (right) as they are led from court in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia . Detained: Craig Stoner, 24, (left) and Darren Smalley, 35, (right) are in shackles as they are led away following a brief court appearance in Canada . Military police seized bedding, clothing and electronic devices such as mobile phones, laptops and iPads belonging to the men. They also forensically examined the room the attack is alleged to have taken place in, along with nearby areas. If found guilty, the men could face 14 years in jail. The charges will cause serious embarrassment to senior Royal Navy officers. One source said: 'I expect very high-ups in both the Canadian and British navies are going to be watching this case closely.' Radford – understood to be the team's coach – lives in Gosport, Hampshire, with his wife Yvonne, and their daughter. He had posted on Facebook on April 5 about travelling to Halifax from Heathrow. The day after the alleged attack he said he was at the city's harbour. Naval base: The East Coast Navy base at Halifax, Nova Scotia, near to where the alleged incident occurred . Last night his wife said she had not spoken to him since his arrest. It is understood Finbow, of Stockbridge, Hampshire, also has a partner. The day before the incident, the team had taken part in curling at an ice rink. Then on the day of the alleged attack, the team played against the Canadian Fleet Diving Unit in the morning, followed by the Shearwater over-45s team in the afternoon. Hal Puddifant, Shearwater arena manager, said: 'They seemed like a good group of guys, there were a couple of Canadians on the team. They cancelled some games. I have no idea why.' The four spent the weekend in jail and will appear again before Dartmouth Provincial Court today to determine whether they will receive bail. Crown attorney Scott Morrison said: 'It is a sensitive issue and a very serious charge. 'At this point it's possible they could be released, but the main issue is whether or not they will be allowed to leave Canada.' A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the navy 'takes allegations of this nature very seriously, however as legal proceedings continue it would be inappropriate to comment further'. The team's Facebook page was taken down following the arrests, as were the men's personal Facebook pages. The Royal Navy ice hockey website was taken down 'due to maintenance'.

"Hadas from Eritrea, Africa, talks about her experience of being circumcised (picture posed by model) A woman who still suffers from the painful consequences of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) says she doesn't blame her mother for taking her to have the procedure when she was just a baby. Hadas (not her real name to protect her identity), who now lives in the UK, had 'the cut' in Eritrea, where circumcision for girls is widely practiced, when she was just a few months old. She said: 'In my culture, it is believed that when the vagina is cut, the desire to have sex is cut as well and that sex is only something a woman does with her husband to have children.' 'Most people in Eritrea think that if a girl is cut, she will grow up to be a good girl; that she will not bring shame on her family and she will marry well. 'If a girl is not cut, they think she will grow up to be a ""slut"" - a girl who thinks about sex and will not be satisfied by one man. 'People believe that a girl who is not cut will bring shame on her family with her behaviour, that no one will marry her and she will be abandoned. 'Most people feel this way in my country and it is only those who are educated that disagree with the practice of cutting.' Hadas' story reveals how entrenched the culture of FGM is Eritrea, which borders Sudan and Ethiopia, where the barbaric practice - the partial or total removal of external female genitalia for non-medical reasons - is even said to prevent women growing up to be clumsy. Girls are mutilated by someone with no medical training, often using instruments such as a knife, pair of scissors, scalpel or razor blade. Anaesthetic isn't used and the victims are often forcibly restrained. Hadas was too young to remember her ordeal and only found out the truth by hearing her parents arguing - as her father had not wanted her to be subjected to it. She said: 'My father was an educated and modern man who disagreed with the belief and culture of cutting. My mother was from a traditional family and from a different community of people to my father. 'My mother had taken me to be cut while my father was away on business, as she knew he would not have allowed it. I was cut and sewn up when I was just a few months old, and when my father found out he was furious.' 'The first time I heard about cutting was from overhearing my parents fight about it, which they did throughout my childhood. 'I am not angry with my mother for taking me to get cut; my mother is a traditional person and hasn't been educated about it. She thought she was doing the best for me.' Scroll down for video . Women selling their goods on the colourful Monday market of Keren, Eritrea, Africa . Growing up, Hadas' mother told her 'horror stories' about women who had never married because they hadn't been cut. Other negative stereotypes were also attached to women who had not had the procedure. Hadas said: 'In my culture there is a belief that if a girl is clumsy, she had not been cut. People from my country, even believe this here in the UK. 'I was at church recently and I dropped a glass of water. While I was cleaning the mess up, an older woman said to me ""you didn't have the cut"". 'She did not say this with anger or as a joke; she said it as a matter of fact, because she doesn't know differently.' Now in her early 20s, Hadas only recently came to realise that FGM is not the norm for all women and has found support as she deals with its consequences from children's charity the NSPCC. She said: 'I grew up not knowing that I was different, or that being cut was not normal for every other girl in the world. Hadas first came into contact with the NSPCC in the UK following a horrific ordeal where she was brought to the UK by sex traffickers. She revealed: 'I was separated from my family after problems started in my country and I was trafficked to the UK by men who raped me. It was incredibly painful for me, so painful that I couldn't think. I have grown up believing that this level of pain during sex is normal, but I now know differently.' 'I didn't talk to anyone before I met  the NSPCC as it's not something that you speak about. Before I saw the nurse I didn't notice any difference in my body as I'm the same as other girls from my home town. 'I believe cutting is something that should be stopped. It is a disgusting practice that many people only do because they believe that the stories around it are true and they are uneducated. 'I do not think that people really understand the problems which female genital mutilation can cause for girls.' Hassan Hafez, a barber from Egypt, mimics the way he used to perform female genital mutilation . Thanks to being a victim of FGM, Hadas worries about her future and whether she will be able to have children. She said: 'I look ahead and see problems with any relationships that I choose to have because I'm afraid that sex will hurt. My periods are painful too and I've been told it will be very painful to give birth.' The NSPCC believe 23,000 girls under 15 could be at risk of FGM in England and Wales even though it became a criminal offence in the UK in 1985. In 2003 it also became a criminal offence for UK nationals or permanent UK residents to take their child abroad to have female genital mutilation. Anyone found guilty of the offence faces a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. Despite this, many young girls are taking abroad during 'cutting season' aka the school holidays where they are mutilated without pain relief while being forcibly restrained. The charity is working to stop FGM - which they believe is a form of child abuse - and ask professionals who worry a child is at risk to contact them on the number below. Cupcakes designed to look like vaginas were baked for the International Day of Zero Tolerance to FGM in Exeter in February, 2014 . Those who have suffered as a result of FGM can also call the number for help and support. NSPCC Head of Child Protection Operations John Cameron said: 'We know from contacts to our FGM helpline that there is a major problem in some UK communities where children are subjected to this appalling abuse. 'Many thousands of children are at risk of being taken abroad to be cut and families are starting to get smart about this - they are getting the message that agencies are focusing on children who are a bit older so people are now beginning to subject children to FGM at a much younger age. 'We would urge anyone who has a concern or needs advice to contact the NSPCC’s FGM helpline on 0800 028 3550 or email fgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk - it doesn't matter if you're uncertain, we're here to talk things through and you may in turn stop a child from being subjected to this barbaric practice.' Since launching in June 2013, the NSPCC FGM helpline has been contacted 662 times regarding concerns about FGM. Of the calls, 259 of the cases have been so serious that they have been referred to children's services and the police. If you are worried about a child or would like support or advice please contact the NSPCC FGM helpline on 0800 028 3550 or fgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk – you can remain anonymous if you wish.","Hadas had the barbaric practice in Eritrea, Africa, where FGM is common .

"Shocking surveillance footage shows a mob using a hammer, a rocking chair leg and Mace as they beat a homeless man into a coma during a suspected act of revenge. The video taken in the forecourt of the Sunoco gas station on North 5th Street in Philadelphia shows five people, including two children, storming out of a minivan and attacking the helpless 51-year-old.

The youngster accused the man of jockeying with him while asking to fill motorist's tanks for spare change. At the end of the video he is brought out of the car so he can look at the injuries inflicted on the victim, as he lies bloodied on the floor. The boy's mother, 34-year-old Aleathea Gillard, allegedly used the rocking chair leg while close family friend, Shareena Joachim, 24, is said to have carried the Mace. The pair were arrested and charged with attempted murder and related crimes. Lieutenant Dan Brooks of Northwest Detectives said: 'Just watching, you see the viciousness of it.' Police found the minivan outside Einstein Medical Center - where the victim had been taken - shortly after the attack, with Gillard and Joachim inside.

The survey, conducted by eHarmony, found that 54 per cent of women believe they prioritise love (versus 46 per cent of men), yet they actually spend less time actively looking for dates than male counterparts, spending only 38 minutes per week rather over blokes who pitch in a good 71 minutes of effort a week. So why is the quest for love  so challenging? Women admit it's all about the perfect partner, with 67 per cent saying they haven't met 'the one' yet and 64 per cent admitting that their perfect 'check list' is fairly extensive. Ostracised: Single woman Candice Ingram (pictured right) tells Daily Mail Australia that she was not invited to a friend's birthday dinner because she would 'ruin table numbers' Riding solo: 53 per cent of women hate being the only single person at a family gathering . While 60 per cent of men also admit they haven't met the right person yet, 24 per cent think 'all the good ones are taken.' Life sure isn't all roses for singletons though, both men and women struggle with the lonely part of single life with 33 per cent of men saying they hate having too much time to themselves (whereas 77 per cent of women enjoy more 'me time') and 52 per cent of women admitting they hate being told from doting couples how happy they are or being the only single people at a family gathering. Sydney-based singleton Candice Ingram, 39, agrees that you get treated differently when you're single. Sick of sympathy: Sydney singleton Candice Ingram, 39, hates the sympathy she gets from coupled friends . 'I once had a friend's husband say ""Sorry Candice, I can’t invite you to my birthday because you’ll ruin my table numbers!""' 'I was horrified. I’m still Candice whether I'm single or not, I still have a brain of my own and am an individual,' she says. This mass of unwanted sympathy that becomes naturally attached to spouse-less women is something Ingram struggles with the most. 'I hate people's perception of you, 'it's like - ""oh shame"" when they find out. And I always end up defending myself and saying ""you don’t have to feel sorry for me, I'm actually quite happy being single"".' - source: eHarmony . In the  eighteen months Ingram has been back on the single scene,  while she has had over 20 dates she does believe being single in the big smoke is hard. 'In Sydney men just don’t seem to approach women. I previously lived in London and you would often have men ask to pull up a chair and join you.' 'Yet here, all my single friends (including those who have lived in South Africa, London and  Australia) agree Sydney is hardest place to date in the world.' Ingram says it doesn't help either when the ratio is a complete disadvantage, with the Australian Beuareu of Statistics showing that in the 30 to 54 bracket, there are almost 27,000 more women than men. So this man drought Ingram says means that women are losing a fighting battle. Single slackers: New eHarmony study finds while women want love, they spend almost half the time that men do seeking it . Soul mate success: 60 per cent of men don't think they have found 'the one' yet . Not to mention Sydney based  dwellers have a difference in priorities too. 'People  in Sydney are more focused on careers than finding love and when you team that with less availability of men  vs other countries and the fact the older bracket is often married with kids, it's just hard.' She does agree though that while she will do her best to get out there, there is often still a certain laziness that comes with wanting to give up on the love hunt. 'If I have a brilliant but long day at work and then go out with friends, it's nice to not make an effort and relax with people that know you. You don’t have to be ""the happiest, best, funniest,"" you can just have a glass of wine and relax.'","eHarmony relationship survey reveals pros and cons of single life .

"An artist who turns dead animals into unique works of art has recently come under fire for his bizzare sculptures. Sean Crawford, from Carterton, New Zealand, said he picked up his distinctive style after his family taught him about hunting and taxidermy on the farm he grew up on. ‘Taxidermy was a big part of my culture,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘As a kid you would watch the eyes following you around the room and I think that became a bit of a fascination for me, you know, capturing the animal in a precise moment, almost frozen in time.’ Scroll down for video . Former plumber Sean Crawford made a splash at the Australian Traffic Jam Gallery with his taxidermy sculptures . After producing works without taxidermy, he decided he wanted to add a more 'natural' layer to his work . He said he can understand why some people find his work 'a bit ungodly’, but in his opinion, there is nothing worse than ‘art that doesn't affect you at all.’ While some religious folk have taken issue with the fact Mr Crawford is 'manipulating the animal' by using animal parts in his work, he maintains that he’s only used parts that would have otherwise gone to waste. ‘We don’t really select the animals. They are a product of hunting for meat or pest control.’ He said he can understand why some people find his work 'a bit ungodly’, but in his opinion, there is nothing worse than ‘art that doesn't affect you at all.’ ‘It’s one of those things that people either like or they don’t,’ he said. Mr Crawford said he’s been influenced by Gothic Revival architecture and literature that dealt with themes of being dismantled and put back together . Taxidermy: ‘It’s one of those things that people either like or they don’t’ Mr Crawford has three animal sculptures currently on display at Traffic Jam Galleries at Neutral Bay on Sydney's lower north shore. Sean Crawford said his interest in taxidermy started at a very young age as he watched his family hunt on their farm . He chose a running rabbit, a standing rabbit and a small bird enclosed in a metal cage for the Australian exhibition called 'untitled'. The bird is intact while the rabbit sculptures only feature half the animal with Mr Crawford expertly manipulating steel beams to make the sculpture whole. He said he spends a lot of time studying the anatomy and posture of each animal to make sure his 'twist' on classical sculpting is as authentic as possible. ‘I am building the surface, not out of stone, but through an accurate mapping of the rest of the animal,’ he said. Mr Crawford said he’s been influenced by Gothic Revival architecture and literature, like Frankenstein or Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, that dealt with themes of being dismantled and put back together. He said using animals has let him add another ‘natural’ layer to his steel structures. Mr Crawford travelled to Sydney from his New Zealand home to personally deliver three of his controversial sculptures, where he said he got ‘quite a reaction’ on opening night. Mr Crawford said he spends a lot of time studying the anatomy and posture of each animal to make sure his 'twist' on classical sculpting is as authentic as possible . ‘I am building the surface, not out of stone, but through an accurate mapping of the rest of the animal’ Sotiris Sotiriou, a curator at Traffic Jam Galleries, said his clients have had a great response to the unique ‘amalgam of sculpture and taxidermy’. ‘To be honest all of our clients have quite enjoyed it, people can be grossed out a bit but I think they are more interested in the end.’ He said once museum visitors learned that the animals weren't killed for art, they were much more accepting of the animal and steel hybrids. In his most recent work, Mr Crawford was commissioned to build the Cloak of Remembrance for Anzac Day, which will be unveiled on April 25 at the New Zealand Embassy in Washington.

"A senior Labour MP has admitted that the party would look to 'forge a common alliance' with the SNP to ensure Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister. David Lammy, who is standing for London Mayor, said the SNP was a party Labour could 'do business with' in the event of another hung Parliament. The admission comes amid increasingly stark warnings from the Tories that the SNP will hold Labour to 'ransom' if it holds the balance of power in Parliament next month. Scroll down for video . David Lammy, appearing on ITV News last night, said the SNP was a party Labour could 'do business with' in the event of another hung Parliament . Polls suggest Nicola Sturgeon's party are on course to win up to 50 seats on May 7 – wiping out any hopes of a Labour majority. But the Scottish First Minister has vowed to work with Mr Miliband to 'lock out' David Cameron from Number 10 in exchange for higher government spending, more taxes and increased borrowing. Former prime minister John Major will today warn that Britain faces a 'daily dose of blackmail' from the SNP if they have the power to bring down a Labour government. With 16 days to polling on May 7, Sir John will say that a Labour-SNP administration would lead to 'weak and unstable' government and wreck Britain's economic recovery. Mr Miliband has ruled out joining a formal coalition with the SNP but has refused to be drawn on whether he could work with them on a vote-by-vote basis. However, speaking on ITV News last night, Mr Lammy went further – insisting that a deal with the SNP could be struck. Mr Miliband meanwhile has accused the Prime Minister of 'threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom' by talking up the prospects of Scottish nationalists in the May 7 General Election . Speaking on Newsnight last night Mr Miliband insisted he would not form a Coalition with the SNP after the election . He said: 'We are fighting for a victory. I think we can win this election. But clearly, after the general election, you would forge common alliance with parties that you can actually do business with, and the SNP must be part of that story.' It comes after Labour's shadow House of Commons leader Angela Eagle said in the event of a hung parliament Labour 'would speak to any party that has got representation in the House of Commons in order to try to build a majority for a Queen's Speech that the country desperately needs'. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the admission exposed the threat posed by an SNP-Labour alliance. He told MailOnline: 'One of Ed Miliband's most senior MPs is openly talking about forming a 'common alliance' with the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon has called on Ed Miliband to forge an 'anti Tory' alliance . 'The British public will pay through their noses for the higher taxes, the higher debt and the higher benefit payments an SNP-Miliband government will rack up.' 'There's only one guaranteed way to stop this – vote Conservative on May 7.' Speaking on the BBC's Today programme this morning, the former foreign secretary William Hague said the Tories needed to 'sound the alarm' over the threat posed by the SNP. He said: 'We have the danger here that people who want to break up the United Kingdom will be running the United Kingdom in a few weeks' time if there is a Labour government with a large number of Scottish Nationalist MPs. 'And it's not the Conservatives who have talked that up; it's the story, whether of opinion polls or of what everybody's talking about on the ground.' He added: 'Unless we have a Conservative majority we will be faced with a Labour government in a minority dependent on Scottish Nationalists, that they will make impossible demands, they will demand higher taxes, higher welfare spending, weaker defences every single day for five years and that will be disastrous for families across the UK and for the whole future of the United Kingdom.' Mr Miliband meanwhile has accused the Prime Minister of 'threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom' by talking up the prospects of Scottish nationalists in the May 7 General Election. Speaking this morning Mr Miliband insisted there would be no coalition with the SNP and denied Nicola Sturgeon's party would hold the whip hand on policy, telling BBC1's Breakfast: 'A Labour government led by me, what happens in that Labour government will be decided by me, not by the SNP.' Labour had 'fundamental differences' with the SNP, such as the nationalist party's desire for a second independence referendum within five years, he said, adding: 'I'm not having that.' Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had been 'talking up' the SNP in the hope that it would take votes and seats from Labour north of the border and allow him to 'crawl back' into 10 Downing Street. 'I think David Cameron is playing fast and loose with the United Kingdom,' said the Labour leader. 'This is somebody who has given up hope of winning a majority. He is trying to boost the SNP. 'I think David Cameron is now threatening the integrity of the UK with the games he is playing. And I think Conservatives are now ashamed of what he is doing.'","David Lammy said the SNP was a party Labour could 'do business with'

"Iran has sent two warships to the waters off Yemen while the US has accelerated moves to supply weapons to the Saudi coalition as foreign powers get drawn deeper into the conflict. The Alborz destroyer and Bushehr support vessel sailed from Bandar Abbas to the Gulf of Aden today with military bosses claiming the move is designed to protect Iranian shipping from piracy. It comes as Saudi Arabia continues to lead a bombing campaign to oust the Iran-allied Houthi movement which has taken most of Yemen and forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee to Riyadh. Scroll down for video . Smoke billows from a Saudi-led airstrike on Sanaa, Yemen earlier today amid reports Iran has sent a navy destroyer and another vessel to the Gulf of Aden .

A Houthi fighter aims a weapon upwards as smoke rises from a building after a Saudi-led airstrike on a street in Sanaa, Yemen . Saudi Arabia and several Arab allies have imposed an air and naval blockade on Yemen in a two-week campaign that has been condemned by Iran, which has called for dialogue. The Iranian ships will patrol the Gulf of Aden, south ofYemen, and the Red Sea, Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari said in comments cited by Press TV . Meanwhile, Washington deepened its involvement in the conflict as aid agencies scrambled to deliver help to civilians caught up in the campaign now heading into its third week. The Red Cross has warned of a 'catastrophic' situation in main southern city Aden where militia loyal to fugitive President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi have been holding out against Houthi Shiite rebels and their allies within the security forces. Gunfight: A man fires towards Houthi rebels.

Scores of people have been killed or wounded in the street fighting in the heart of the port city of Aden . Scores of people have been killed or wounded in the street fighting in the heart of the port city and aid agency Doctors Without Borders said it feared many more had been unable to reach hospitals. The main Shiite power Iran, which has strongly opposed the Saudi-led intervention, stepped up its efforts for a negotiated settlement with a visit to Saudi ally Pakistan by Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif. Islamabad has so far deflected appeals by Riyadh to join the coalition of nine - mainly Sunni - Arab countries intervening in Yemen, for fear of deepening sectarian divisions at home and across the Muslim world. US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was stepping up weapons deliveries and intelligence sharing in support of the Saudi-led coalition. 'Saudi Arabia is sending a strong message to the Houthis and their allies that they cannot overrun Yemen by force,' Blinken told reporters in the Saudi capital.

'In support of that effort we have expedited weapons deliveries,' he said after talks with Defence Minister Mohammed bin Salman and other Saudi officials. A US defence official told AFP that Washington was sending primarily precision-guided munitions. The coalition launched its air war on March 26 as the rebels and their allies closed on Hadi's last refuge Aden, prompting him to flee to neighbouring Saudi Arabia. Riyadh accuses Tehran of backing the rebels and has vowed to bomb them into surrender to prevent them establishing a pro-Iran state on its doorstep. But the rebels have powerful allies within the security forces who have remained loyal to longtime strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, forced from power in 2012 after a year-long, Arab Spring-inspired uprising. Eight rebels and three loyalist militiamen were killed in clashes in Aden overnight, a military source said. Saudi-led warplanes also bombed rebel positions at the city's international airport and the huge Al-Anad air base to its north, another military source said.

Al-Anad was a key monitoring post in Washington's longstanding drone war against Al-Qaeda until it withdrew its troops as fighting intensified last month. Last week, Al-Qaeda seized much of Hadramawt provincial capital Mukalla. On Tuesday, they attacked one of the last loyalist strongholds in the city. US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter acknowledged on Wednesday that the fighting in Yemen was complicating Washington's counter-terrorism efforts but vowed they would go on regardless. 'Obviously it's always easier to conduct CT ops when there is a stable government willing to cooperate,' he said. 'That circumstance now obviously doesn't exist in Yemen but that doesn't mean that we don't continue to take steps to protect ourselves. We have to do it in a different way, but we do and we are.'

As Iran's top diplomat prepared to visit, Pakistan said it would take its time deciding whether to accept the Saudi request to join the coalition. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said Pakistan was 'not in a hurry' to decide and that diplomatic efforts were under way involving Turkey and Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has expressed support for the coalition without providing military forces, held talks in Tehran on Tuesday. 'We both think war and bloodshed must stop in this area immediately and a complete ceasefire must be established and the strikes must stop,' his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani said after their meeting.

The dramatic chase happened as school children left their classrooms on their way home. Yassir Ali, pictured, was jailed for 14 monts for dangerous driving following the high-speed car chase through Birmingham in February . Ali flew through several junctions, ignoring red lights and pulling onto the wrong side of the road in a desperate attempt to avoid capture. The police squad car tries to keep up with Ali, but on several occasions was forced to slow down because of the danger posed to other road users. The dashcam footage shows that roads were very wet at the time of the chase and it was raining fairly heavily. Eventually the police were able to arrest Ali after he lost control of the car as he tried to swerve around a line of traffic and got stuck between a bollard and the front of a shop. Ali was jailed at Birmingham Crown Court for 14 months for dangerous driving. PC Neal Drew, from the Central Motorway Policing Group, said: 'Ali's actions that day were completely unacceptable and by driving the way he did he put innocent members of the public at risk.

"Canadian actor Jonathan Crombie died on Wednesday night in New York after suffering a brain hemorrhage. He was 48 ears old . Anne of Green Gables actor Jonathan Crombie died of a brain hemorrhage, aged 48. The actor is best known for his role as Gilbert Blythe in the Canadian television drama film Anne of Green Gables and two sequels. Toronto-born Crombie died on Wednesday in New York, his sister Carrie Crombie told CBC on Saturday. 'He was funny, he was sweet, he loved acting, he loved comedy and singing and dancing. As a little kid, he just loved Broadway shows and all of that kind of stuff and would sing and dance in the living room,' Carrie Crombie said. She said that her brother was always proud of playing Gilbert, the school rival, boyfriend and eventual husband of the leading heroine in Anne of Green Gables. He really enjoyed the series, she said, adding that he was 'very proud of it'. Crombie, who was the son for former Toronto mayor and Canadian Cabinet minister David Crombie, was never screen-tested for the show. He was discovered at 17 when he was performing in a high-school production of The Wizard of Oz, according to E!. 'We met him and he was cast. It was a perfect storm. ... It just all worked perfectly,' Green Gables producer Kevin Sullivan told CBC. He continued: 'I think for legions of young women around the world who fell in love with the Anne of Green Gables films, Jonathan literally represented the quintessential boy next door .

'I think there will be hundreds of people who will be floored that this has happened. It's such a devastating tragedy. 'In reality, Jonathan was as generous, as kind, as sensitive and as ambitious, in some ways, as the character he came to be identified with.' Carrie Crombie said that her brother's proudest moment, however, was what came after Green Gables. '[But] I think his proudest part was when he played the lead in The Drowsy Chaperone on Broadway.

"This is the moment an 11-year-old boy became stuck in knee-deep mud and had to be rescued by a hovercraft. The child was on holiday in Burnham-on-Sea with his family from Manchester when he walked across the mudflats on Wednesday. Seemingly unaware of the low tide, he quickly became stuck and had to be pulled to safety by the coastguard in its  hovercraft. He was unhurt in the incident, and was seen leaving the beach smiling. Scroll down for video . An 11-year-old boy had to be pulled to safety after becoming stuck in knee-deep mud on in Burnham-on-Sea . The coastguard used a hovercraft to reach the boy, with two members of its mud rescue team enlisted to pull him out to safety . The 11-year-old was returned to safety shortly afterwards. His relieved family were visiting from Manchester . At around 3.30pm yesterday the coastguard was called to Brean Beach after reports of the boy becoming stuck. Emergency services used a hovercraft to bring him back to the beach unharmed. 'The boy had been wading out across the mudflats at low tide and unfortunately got into difficulty in thick mud in that part of the beach,' said Mark Newman, Chairman of BARB Search and Rescue. 'Many people have been stuck there, it's well known to be a dangerous spot.' The beach warden noticed the boy standing in the flats as he tried to reach the sea and alerted the coastguard. 'We were called in our hovercraft, we got to the scene very quickly and flew down the beach around 600m to the boy. The boy was flown back to hard sand and was not harmed in the incident at around 3.30pm yesterday afternoon . The boys' worried family watch on as the hovercraft reaches him. The stretch of coast is particularly dangerous, said experts . 'Two members of the Coastguard mud rescue team safely rescued him, taking him on board. 'Together they flew back down the beach to his very relieved parents. 'He wasn't worse for wear but obviously it is frightening when you do get into difficulty in the mud, that's why we always advise people to keep to the hard sand and watch the tide times.' The stretch is one of the most dangerous parts of the coast, Mr Newman added. 'The tide was just starting to come in which was another reason. You can find yourself in difficulty very quickly, the tide comes in very quickly.' It was the second time in a week the team had to use the hovercraft to rescue a youngster. On Easter Sunday a 15-year-old girl was flown away from Berrow in an incident that was 'very similar', Mr Newman added. BBV-6 The Spirit Of Lelaina is named after Lelaina Hall, a five-year-old who died in 2002 after becoming stuck in mudflats. Her death sparked a campaign to raise enough money to build a hovercraft to save people who find themselves in danger in the area. It was launched the following year in her memory.","The youngster was wading in the mudflats at Burnham-on-Sea yesterday .

"Robert Kennedy Jr has apologized for describing the number of children injured by vaccines as 'a holocaust'. The nephew of President John F Kennedy used the term last week during the screening of a film that links autism to a chemical found in several childhood vaccinations - despite evidence to the contrary. On Monday, following a storm of criticism, he publicly retracted his statement. Back track: Robert Kennedy Jr has apologized for comparing vaccinated children to holocaust victims . Kennedy said he had been struggling for a way to convey the effects of autism on children and their families. 'I want to apologize to all whom I offended by my use of the word holocaust to describe the autism epidemic,' Kennedy said in a statement. 'I employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families.' He said he will use other words to describe the autism crisis in the future as he promotes the documentary Trace Amounts. The film purports that there is a connection between thimerosal - a chemical found in several childhood vaccines - and a rise in autism among American children - despite the majority of the scientific community dismissing any connection. Its release comes amid protests against a California bill that would limit vaccination waivers for schoolchildren. Incendiary comment: He made the comment last week while promoting a film that implies there is a link between thimerosal - a chemical used in vaccines - and autism, despite medical evidence to the contrary . It has generated such an acidic debate that some opponents have compared the proposal's author online to Adolf Hitler. State Sen. Richard Pan, a Democratic pediatrician from Sacramento, said he was under added security in response to his bill. The proposal will be heard Wednesday in a Senate education committee. Thursday marks Holocaust Remembrance Day. 'The word holocaust should never be used as a flippant throwaway line to make a point in a debate,' said Assemblyman Marc Levine, vice chair of the Legislative Jewish Caucus, during a Holocaust remembrance event on Monday in the California Assembly.

"Tamara Pacskowska, who posed as a wealthy pensioner to try and sell a £1million Bayswater mews house from under the owner's nose . A Polish conwoman who posed as a wealthy pensioner to try and sell a £1million house from under the owner's nose wept as she avoided jail today. Tamara Pacskowska pretended to be 76-year-old Georgina Bagnall-Oakley at meetings with estate agents and solicitors in November last year over sale of the home in Bayswater, West London. The 56-year-old, from Croydon, South London, could not speak English and took her daughter-in-law Monika Brzezinska, 34, along with her on the visits to help her translate. The fraudsters were eventually caught out in a solicitors office while they were on the cusp of completing the sale of the house to fellow conman, 26-year-old Benjamin Khoury, . Today at Southwark Crown Court, Pacskowska sobbed as she was given a community order and made to pay costs after previously admitting fraud. Mother-of-three Brzezinska, who also wept throughout the hearing, and Khoury, were also spared jail after they too admitted a fraud charge. Brzezinska thanked the judge after the sentence was passed while Khoury grinned in the dock. Pacskowska used a fake driving licence and passport bearing her photograph and Mrs Bagnall-Oakeley’s name and details in the scam. She claims she was offered £3,000 to pose as the owner of the property by a woman allegedly named Amisha Singh. Khoury, of German-Israeli heritage who lives in Hackney, east London, charged prospective buyers £50 to show them around the house and also had paperwork relating to the property in his bedroom. Mrs Bagnall-Oakley bought the property in Clarendon Mews in 1982 with her husband Hugo and it was transferred solely to her name in 2014. She was renting it out at the time. The victim said she was left feeling ‘vulnerable, apprehensive and anxious’ after she discovered someone had tried to steal her identity. In a statement to the court, she said: ‘My initial reaction upon learning about the fraud was that of shock that this could so nearly have succeeded. ‘My identity had been stolen and left me feeling vulnerable, apprehensive and anxious. ‘I would not wish this on anyone in the future.’ Monkia Brzezinska, Pacskowska's daughter-in-law, left, and Bejamin Khoury, who also admitted fraud, also escaped jail . Prosecutor Peter Zinner described the scam as an ‘audacious and sophisticated’ attempt to steal the property, valued at about £950,000. He said: 'In so adopting the sole owner’s identity, purported to be the vendor of the property and instructed solicitors to sell the property for that sum and it was only the subsequent intervention of the police just before completion of the sale that prevented the property from being sold from under the owner’s feet.' All three defendants were sentenced to two years imprisonment suspended for two years, ordered to carry out unpaid work and pay £250 each towards prosecution costs. Judge Michael Grieve QC added: ‘It’s not easy to establish your roles in these offences. ‘One is left to wonder how there could ever have been a realistic prospect of Mrs Pacskowska, who is Polish and speaks little if any English, passing herself off as Georgina Bagnall-Oakeley to the satisfaction of a qualified solicitor. The £1million house in Clarendon Mews, Bayswater, which the group had tried to sell from under owner Georgina Bagnall-Oakley's nose . ‘Ms Brzezinska I can only conclude that your role was to support and interpret for your mother-in-law. ‘It’s absolutely clear that there were others who lay behind this fraud who would have substantially benefitted from it and who used you to open yourselves up to high risk for relatively little reward. ‘You took part willingly and for financial gain and provided photographs to be used on false driving licences and passports. ‘Others played leading roles in this fraud which on one view was a very sophisticated property fraud. ‘But your mission was doomed to failure. The victim said she was left feeling ‘vulnerable, apprehensive and anxious’ after she discovered someone had tried to steal her identity to sell her home, pictured . ‘There was an anonymous tip-off to the solicitors who alerted the police and officers then lay in wait for you in November.’ He added: ‘The value of the sale and intended loss to the victim, a 76-year-old lady, is put at just short of £1million. ‘An elderly lady stood to lose almost £1million through the theft of her property. ‘She speaks of the vulnerability that the theft of another person’s identity can cause.’","Tamara Pacskowska pretended to be 76-year-old Georgina Bagnall-Oakley .

"An explosive new report reveals that the United States began secretly tracking phones long before the events of 9/11 or passage of the Patriot Act. In 1992, a Drug Enforcement Agency operation which has since been discontinued, monitored every telephone call made from the United States to one of the up to 116 countries on their watch list for drug trafficking, including almost every country in both North and South America. USA Today uncovered the details of the program, whose vastness was not known until now, and whose practices, especially in gathering bulk information, later became a model for the National Security Agency. Scroll down for video . It has been revealed the government began secretly tracking phone calls under a program created for the Drug Enforcement Agency in 1992 . The DEA program and its aims had been revealed earlier this year in a report from the Justice Department, though there was no mention of just how big the program was, and the amount of data the agency was authorized to gather. This is also now the oldest known example of the American government authorizing this level of tracking on unknowing citizens of the country. The goal was to infiltrate drug trafficking rings, especially those that were previously unknown to members of the DEA and federal government. The program also allowed agents to monitor calls the ruled out the possibility of foreign ties to the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building by American Timothy McVeigh. The program only recently shuttered, and was used for nearly two decades, with top Justice Department officials in four administrations - George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama - approving the data collections. The data collection did not however allow DEA investigators access to the actual content of calls, just the numbers dialed and time of the calls were all recorded. A 1998 request for Sprint to release their call records to the program labeled it as 'one of the most important and effective Federal drug law enforcement initiatives.' The program was eventually halted not because it had run its course, but rather out of fear for public response should the details be revealed. That decision came from Attorney General Eric Holder in September 2013, just months after Edward Snowden began systematically releasing classified information he obtained while working at the NSA, most notably documents that detailed the agency's reach, which while viewed by some as crucial and necessary, was seen by many as an Orwellian nightmare, specifically as it pertained to the freedoms and allowances the agency had been granted when it came to spying on Americans. The DEA confirmed this, and they now send subpoenas on a daily basis to telephone companies to obtain records. Former officials who worked at the agency prior to and during the program's inception speak of it as a necessity at the time as they attempted to combat the seemingly untouchable and infallible Colombian drug cartels. In that regard the program was a massive success, allowing agency officials to take down larger members of drug organizations thanks to a system that no longer required them to reach out to the phone companies every day, where the could only request individual phone records. And this years before the program had begun, and the agency was working with just the principles they had developed, two supercomputers and a team of analysts. Officials could not reveal those the program helped the agency to capture, but we do know that Colombian barons Carlos Lehder, Griselda Blanco and Daniel Barrera Barrera, also known as El Loco, were all captured by or with the help of the DEA in the years prior to the program. The success of this new system impressed President George H.W. Bush, who spoke of the idea of 'sophisticated intelligence-gathering and Defense Department technology' in a 1989 speech, the first time these concepts had been mentioned by a president. Those successes were short lived however, and just three years later drug crimes were hitting record highs while also turning increasingly violent, especially in Miami. It was around this time that the DEA program was approved, with President George H.W. Bush, along with Attorney General William Barr and chief criminal prosecutor, Robert Mueller, giving the agency these new data collection privileges in the final months of his first term. The report did not reveal when exactly this happened, and if he granted this before or after his failed bid for reelection. The DEA, who just years earlier were reaching out to phone companies in search of individual records, would now receive phone company records on a daily basis thanks to a request from the Justice Department. What's more, whereas before the focus was on getting records only of those who were known drug suspects due to time constraints, the agency now received a list of every single phone call from an American phone line to a country on the drug watch list. The countries changed, with some coming on then going off then coming on again, but the data as always the number and time of the call. There was push back from some of the telephone companies at the time, but never to the point that any of them challenged the subpoenas in court. They may have also seen no point in challenging these subpoenas in a court when those companies that did show hesitation received a letter from the Justice Department 'urging them to comply.' The aforementioned letter to Sprint in 1998 was an example of these notes sent to the phone companies, and given the fact that six years later there was still unease about turning over these records it would seem this was a constant battle throughout the years the program was active. That same letter provides another look at why going to court may have seemed pointless, as the Justice Department wrote that the program was 'legally appropriate' in the note, penned by then deputy assistant attorney general Mary Lee Warren. The scope of what the records could be used for was heavily checked prior to 9/11, with all the data being used to investigate drug investigations, with the exception of a few incidents that were seen as potential threats to national security, like Oklahoma City. With the program now shuttered, there are some concerns about the list of countries on the DEA list being revealed, though officials said that in many cases they were aware of the program, which would likely be just as beneficial to them as to the United States. The information was also passed along to foreign governments who in turn used it in building their own cases and investigations.","It has been revealed the government began secretly tracking phone calls under a program created for the Drug Enforcement Agency in 1992 .

"A gold trinket box presented to an officer famous for losing his leg at the Battle of Waterloo has sold for more than £100,000. The 18-carat gold rectangular piece was a gift to Lord Uxbridge, whose stoic exchange with the Duke of Wellington after losing his leg to a cannonball has become etched in history. In a famous example of the British stiff upper lip, after realising he was gravely wounded Uxbridge turned to the British military commander and said 'by God, sir, I've lost my leg', to which Wellington replied 'by God, sir, so you have!' Auctioned: This gold trinket box, presented to Lord Uxbridge for his heroics in The Battle of Waterloo, was sold to a private collector for more than £100,000 . His leg was buried near the battlefield but later dug up and used as a macabre tourist attraction. The gold Irish Freedom Box was given to the aristocrat, who was by then Marquess of Anglesey, in 1828 by Trinity College Dublin when he served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The top has a finely embossed coat of arms with a frame of rocaille shells and foliage around it and the base has another coat of arms with a similar border. The cover coat of arms is Lord Uxbridge's, otherwise known as Field Marshal Henry William Paget. The coat of arms on the base is that of Trinity College Dublin. Famed for losing his leg: Lord Uxbrige commanded 13,000 Allied cavalry and 44 guns of horse artillery at the Battle of Waterloo . Piece of history: The 18-carat gold Irish Freedom Box was given to the aristocrat, who was by then Marquess of Anglesey, in 1828 by Trinity College Dublin when he served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland . The box is about three-and-a-half inches long and weighs just six ounces. It was sold by Bonhams to a private collector for £100,900. Jon Baddeley, managing director at Bonhams Knightsbridge, said: 'The battle of Waterloo was one of the most significant military encounters of the 19th century and the outcome had a profound effect on the future of Europe so not surprisingly there was a lot of public interest is this sale and the bidding from collectors was fierce.' Lord Uxbrige commanded 13,000 Allied cavalry and 44 guns of horse artillery at the Battle of Waterloo. At around 2:30pm, at a crucial stage in the battle, he led a charge of the 2,000 heavy cavalry of the Household Brigade and the Union Brigade to push back the French. The charge succeeded in sweeping the French infantry away but Lord Uxbridge was unable to rally his troops, who ran on in pursuit and were cut up by counter-attacking French cavalry. First ever prosthetic leg: When Uxbridge lost his leg he is said to have stoically remarked 'by God, sir, I've lost my leg'. This wooden limb, the firtst ever articulated wooden limb, was designed for him and remains in the Cavalry Museum at Plas Newydd, on the Isle of Anglesey, Wales . He spent the rest of the battle leading a series of charges by British light cavalry formations, and had eight or nine horses shot from under him. One of the last cannon shots fired on June 18 1815 hit his right leg - requiring it to be amputated above the knee. After being wounded, Lord Uxbridge was transported to his headquarters in the village of Waterloo. The remains of his leg were removed by surgeons - without antiseptic or anaesthetics. Bloody encounter: A painting of the Battle of Waterloo by William Holmes Sullivan . Another famous anecdote records the officer as saying 'the knives appear somewhat blunt' as he underwent the horrendous procedure. In recognition of his gallantry, the Prince Regent created him Marquess of Anglesey and made him a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath five days after the battle. On the one day of fighting at the Battle of Waterloo there were close to 55,000 either killed, wounded, or missing in action from both sides. The staggering density of the injured men - around 2,291 per mile on the front line - compared with 234 over the same area on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916 - meant that a huge number were left to bleed to death on the battlefield.","Rectangular 18-carat piece was gifted to Lord Uxbridge for his heroics .

"A baby sitter accused of fatally shaking a 14-month-old baby in her care has been convicted of aggravated manslaughter and child endangerment but acquitted of murder. Michelle Heale of Tom's River, New Jersey claimed she was trying to burp Mason Hess when he began choking on his applesauce in August 2012. But when she pulled him off her shoulder his neck snapped backwards, killing the boy. However she now faces 30 years in prison after a jury found her guilty of killing the youngster. When the verdict was read out, the 46-year-old sobbed uncontrollably and told her lawyer over-and-over again: 'I didn't do it.' She then turned to her husband and, according to the Asbury Park Press, told him to make sure her five-year-old twins do not forget her. Scroll down for video . Michelle Heale (pictured left in court on Friday) of Tom's River, New Jersey, has been found guilty of killing Mason Hess (right) by snapping his neck after shaking him . During her testimony, she broke down as she reenacted what happened in court using a doll . Heale was babysitting Mason as she was a friend of the family (Mason's mother Kellie above) and her husband Michael and Mason's father Adam worked together as detectives . She was then placed in handcuffs and taken into custody to await her sentence next month. Heale testified that the toddler went limp after she hit him between his shoulder blades to save him. The boy was flown to a hospital and died three days later. Doctors later determined the boy suffered severe brain, spine and retinal damage from a violent shaking. But jurors heard conflicting medical testimony. During 'I hit him hard on the back. I may have hit him harder than I should have,' Heale said through tears after demonstrating on the doll. 'I hit him about four or five times, and then I felt the applesauce come out. I felt it on my shoulder and I felt it on my shirt.' Thinking the crisis had been averted, she took Mason of her shoulder. 'As I brought him down, his head snapped back ... he was completely limp,' she said. 'His eyes were open, but he wasn't doing anything. ... Everything was flopping.' Mason died on September 1 after being airlifted to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Courtesy of Asbury Park Press/APP.com . Medical examiners determined that Mason (above with his parents Kellie and Adam) died as a result of homicide caused by blunt cerebral trauma . The Heale and Hess families, including Mason's mother Kellie, had been friends for years. Heale spent most of her day expressing her disbelief over the situation, first being told she had to leave Mason at the hospital as she was suspected of hurting him and then being charged with murder. 'I thought they were going to take my kids from me because I was told that I had hurt Mason,' Heale said. 'I thought that once they were made aware that I had my own kids that they were going to take them from me.' Heale, was able to keep custody of her children. She told the jury at the end of her testimony: 'I would never hurt Mason or anybody.'","Michelle Heale of New Jersey claimed she was trying to burp Mason Hess .

"Exactly two weeks after Harvey Weinsten was accused of groping an Italian model during a business meeting, things seem to be back to normal for the Oscar winner and his designer wife. Weinsten was spotted looking remarkably relaxed and chipper as he stepped outside the couple's New York City townhouse on Thursday while wife Georgina Chapman has been sharing photos of herself hard at work creating the upcoming Spring/Summer 2016 bridal collection for her much beloved fashion brand Marchesa. Chapman even had a little helper joining her in the design room on Thursday - the couple's son Dashiell. Scroll down for videos .

Georgina Chapman (above)  has been busy working on her upcoming Spring/Summer 2016 bridal fashion show for her brand Marchesa . She was joined by the couple's son Dashiell in her design studio on Wednesday (above) Weinstein looked much improved from photos taken last week in which the movie executive seemed depressed and downtrodden as he headed to the office, appearing to almost smile at photographers as he got into his car on Thursday afternoon. The couple may still be dealing with some problems however, with one of Chapman's society pals revealing just how angry she is with her husband to the New York Daily News. 'She’s furious!' said the socialite. 'She thinks it’s embarrassing not only to her, but to their kids.' That being said, she is reportedly eager to put the entire thing behind them, if only for their two children, which also includes daughter India. 'She doesn’t want this to interrupt her business or embarrass the kids any more than it already has,' added the unnamed socialite. Ambra Battilana, who claims Weinstein stuck his hand under her skirt, met with prosecutors on Tuesday as a criminal probe into the incident continues. The model, 22, also claims Weinstein asked if her boobs were real during their business meeting. Weinstein has reportedly made himself available for questioning whenever needed, and no charges have been formally filed against him at this time. Ambra Battilana (above) claims the movie executive groped her during a business meeting .

The couple along with their two children all spent Easter together at their Connecticut home with georgina sharing a photo of Easter eggs (above) The perfectly polished Chapman, 38, and notoriously brash Weinstein, 63, began dating in late 2004 and were married three years later at their Connecticut estate. The wedding, in which the British beauty wore one of her own designs, was packed with celebrities, including Cameron Diaz, Renee Zellweger, Naomi Watts, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez and Vogue editrix Anna Wintour, to name just a few. They welcomed daughter India in 2010 and son Dashiell three years later. Weinstein, one of the most powerful executives in Hollywood, took home an Oscar in 1999 for the Miramax film Shakespeare in Love, but has had some troubles of recent with The Weinstein Company, which he and his brother started in 2005 after leaving Miramax. There are rumors that they are preparing to sell off their television division to British broadcaster ITV for as much as $950million, this according to The Hollywood Reporter. Chapman on the other hand has become one of the most in-demand designers in the industry, with Marchesa growing at a staggering rate since she and partner Keren Craig debuted their first collection in 2004. Hollywood's biggest stars go to the two ladies not only for major red carpet events, but also their own special occasions, with the brand being a frequent choice for celebrities on their wedding day. Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Lopez, Eva Longoria, Olivia Wilde, Kerry Washington, Miley Cyrus and Reese Witherspoon are just a few of the A-listers who have donned one of the brand's gowns. Chapman has yet to comment about the groping incident. Max Dundas, a long term representative for Chapman, told MailOnline: ‘I spoke to Georgina this week, they spent the entire weekend together as a family and their relationship is as strong as ever.'","Harvey Weinstein was spotted looking chipper and pleasant outside his New York City townhouse on Thursday .

"Mario Balotelli receives the most abuse and Chelsea the greatest volume of discriminatory messages on social media, according to extensive research undertaken by Kick It Out. Sportsmail can reveal the shocking, acidic culture of discrimination — mainly based on race, gender or sexual orientation — aimed at Premier League football clubs and their players on the internet. Football's anti-discrimination campaigners teamed up with Tempero and Brandwatch to produce the most detailed findings of discrimination online. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is the Premier League player who receives most abuse online . Balotelli was on the end of 8,000 messages, with Arsenal's Danny Welbeck (above) receiving 1,700 . They discovered an abusive message is directed at a Premier League club or one of their players every 2.6 minutes with a total of 134,400 posted on Twitter, Facebook, forums or blogs between August 2014 and March 2015. 1 – Chelsea v Liverpool, Capital One Cup – 27 January 2015 . 2 – Sunderland v Manchester United, Premier League – 24 August 2014 . 3 – Arsenal v Manchester City, Community Shield – 10 August 2014 . 4 – Manchester United v Arsenal, The FA Cup – 9 March 2015 . 5 – Liverpool v Manchester United, Premier League – 22 March 2015 . 6 – Chelsea v Arsenal, Premier League – 5 October 2014 . 7 – Liverpool v Chelsea, Premier League – 8 November 2014 . 8 – Manchester United v Liverpool, Premier League – 14 December 2014 . Of the most popular players investigated, Liverpool striker Balotelli received by the far the most with more than 8,000 discriminatory messages directed at him and Arsenal's Danny Welbeck faced 1,700. In each case, at least 50 per cent of the abuse was racist. Meanwhile Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge received 1,600, more than 60 per cent of which related to sexual orientation. The clubs facing the most abuse reflected the top five in the league — albeit in a different order — Chelsea receiving 20,000, Liverpool 19,000, Arsenal 12,000 and Manchester United and City both getting 11,000. Almost a third of the abusive posts were racist, a quarter were based on gender and just under a fifth about sexual orientation. A further 11 per cent were about disability, nine per cent anti-semitism, five per cent islamophobia, two per cent about age and one per cent regarding gender reassignment. Daniel Sturridge received 1,600 abusive messages, 60 per cent of which related to sexual orientation .

Daniel Sturridge . – Approximately 1,600 discriminatory posts directed at him . – More than 60 per cent of the posts directed at him were discrimination based on sexual orientation . The city that generated the highest volume of discriminatory posts by far was London, with 26,433 recorded during this campaign. Manchester is second with 8,331 and Liverpool follow with 6,792. Each of those are places with large populations which are home to successful clubs. Social media, in particular Twitter, has been a constant problem for football clubs since it grew in popularity, with Premier League stars and clubs having millions of followers. Manchester United tried to ban Twitter among their players in 2010 to little success. Former Liverpool player Ryan Babel was the first professional player to face action for a post online when he accepted a Football Association charge of improper conduct and was fined £10,000 for criticising referee Howard Webb on Twitter in 2011. Last year, Rio Ferdinand was suspended for three matches and fined £25,000 by the governing body when he included the word 'sket' — slang for a promiscuous woman or girl — in a reply to a tweet mocking him. Rio Ferdinand was suspended for three matches and fined £25,000 for a tweet include the word 'sket' In January this year, Stoke defender Robert Huth was handed a £15,000 fine and banned for two games for replying to a Twitter account which posts sexual images of individuals and asks users to guess their gender. Balotelli was fined £25,000 and banned for one match for a controversial image he posted on Instagram. Yet it appears the growing problem is in social media's use for attacking clubs and players which is spiralling out of control.

"The owner of an Indiana pizza restaurant who was forced to close shop after she told a local news reporter that her establishment would not cater a gay wedding reaffirmed her beliefs in an interview on Saturday. Crystal O'Connor, owner of Memories Pizza in Walkerton, said that she stands by her statement, and that she does not hate gay people - she just does not support gay marriage. She then responded to the now staggering $850,000 that has been raised in support of her establishment by saying; 'God has blessed us for standing up for what we believe, and not denying him.' Scroll down video . Crystal O'Connor (above), owner of Memories Pizza in Walkerton, Indiana, says she stands by her decision to never cater a gay wedding . She has closed her store (above), but said she will reopen again and $850,000 has been raised for the business by supporters in just two days . Demonstrators gather outside the City County Building on March 30, 2015 in Indianapolis, Indiana . In her interview, with Fox News Business' Neil Cavuto, O'Connor also said; 'It is not a sin that we bring gays into our establishment, and to serve them. It is a sin, though, if we condone. If we cater their wedding.' She then added; 'We feel we are participating, we are putting a stamp of approval on their wedding, and we cannot do that.' And despite all of her recent troubles, O'Connor said she is ready to get back to work, she is just not sure when she will open. 'I am still shaken over this, and I will be the one that's serving the customers and answering phones and I'm not ready to face that yet,' she explained. It was a contributor from Glenn Beck's The Blaze who set up the fundraising page on GoFundMe for the pizzeria, with a goal of helping 'the family stave off the burdensome cost of having the media parked out front, activists tearing them down, and no customers coming in.' As of Saturday afternoon, $850,000 had been raised in just two days. The news comes a little over a week after Indiana passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which allows businesses to openly discriminate against gays, and just a few days after O'Connor told a local news station she would refuse to serve her pizza at a gay marriage ceremony. Speaking to ABC57, Crystal O'Connor said: 'If a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding, we would have to say no.' The establishment has been in operation for nine years, and the interior  is adorned with crosses and bible quotes. Just outside the pizzeria, a signs states that the staff begin each morning with a prayer. 'We are a Christian establishment,' O'Connor confirmed. O'Connor said in a recent interview with Neil Cavuto (above) of the money raised; 'God has blessed us for standing up for what we believe, and not denying him' Meanwhile the NCAA has voiced their concern with Indiana's new law. On Saturday, openly gay basketball star Jason Collins and openly gay Division I star Derrick Gordon from the University of Massachusetts showed up to watch the games during the March Madness tournament at Indianapolis's Lucas Oil Stadium . Both men have expressed how upset they were with the new law, and how happy they were with the NCAA's response to Governor Pence. 'The NCAA, they took a bold step,' Collins said earlier this week. 'I think bold leadership is what's needed. I'm very proud of the NCAA taking such a stance and moving forward they definitely need to make sure the fans, the teams, the players, everyone involved with sporting events, when they go to these venues, when they go to these states, these cities, that all members of the community are protected by the laws there.' The stadium was also a protest site as hundreds of people marched through the city's downtown, calling for Indiana to add protections for gays and lesbians in the new law. Their chants attracted to attention of basketball fans who were at the stadium for the Final Four games, and some offered cheers of support. Also on Saturday, openly gay basketball stars Jason Collins and Derrick Gordon (above) arrived for the NCAA Final Four in Indianapolis . The protest came days after Indian Governor Mike Pence signed revisions into the controversial law. The revisions prevent businesses from using the law in court to defend refusing to provide services to any customer because of their race, religion or sexual orientation, according to CNN. But protesters wanted the revision to add sexual orientation to one of the protected categories included in the state's anti-discrimination law to prohibit workplace discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. They chanted 'Hoosiers don't discriminate! No more Band-Aids masking hate!' as they walked toward the stadium carrying rainbow flags and signs reading messages like 'No hate in our state' and 'Equal rights for all'. Police officers who blocked intersections so the protesters could march along downtown streets without incident estimated that between 500 and 600 people took part in the 'peaceful' march. There were no signs during the march of supporters of the state's religious freedom law.","Crystal O'Connor, owner of Memories Pizza in Walkerton, Indiana, says she stands by her decision to never cater a gay wedding .

"David Rylance has been jailed for stealing more than £50,000 from his dying mother, who was suffering from Alzheimer's . A trusted son has been jailed for stealing more than £50,000 from his dying mother, blowing the cash on gambling, a holiday and cinema tickets. When pensioner Margaret Rylance realised her money appeared to be going missing from her bank account, her concerns were put down to her having Alzheimer's disease. But in reality her son David Rylance, 47, had been slowly siphoning the money away, spending it on luxuries for himself as well as everyday living costs. A £13,000 fee to move his mother, from South Shields, into a care home in January 2013 had to be paid by the council because her bank balance had been diminished by her son's spending. Newcastle Crown Court heard one of Mrs Rylance's accounts held just £1,000 at the time of her death in July 2013. Her son continued to access the cash until the balance was zero. Rylance, also of South Shields, admitted theft and fraud involving £52,000 and was jailed for two years and three months. Judge Penny Moreland told him: 'Your mother had had anxieties in the last years of her life that her money was going missing but, because of her illness, that was not taken seriously. 'This was a gross breach of trust. It is hard to imagine someone more vulnerable than an elderly lady with Alzheimer's, unable to protect herself from you accessing her accounts and taking what you wanted. 'You simply treated her money as your own.' The court heard Rylance was in charge of an appointee account set up at Lloyds Bank, which held his mother's cash after her Alzheimer's diagnosis in 2009. Prosecutor Tim Gittins told the court: 'It is clear, very soon after he opened the account, he began to use the monies for his own purposes.' Rylance would transfer large sums of cash from the account into his own, which he used for online gambling, Mr Gittins said. Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard one of Mrs Rylance's accounts held just £1,000 at the time of her death in July 2013 . He would also place bets on gambling sites directly from the appointee account. 'The amounts of monies varied from a couple of hundred pounds to £8,000 in one particular month in June 2010,' Mr Gittins added. 'There were, in fact, substantial wins over that period as well.' The court heard Rylance also had access to his mother's regular banks accounts, which he also stole from. Mr Gittins said the crimes had a devastating impact on Rylance's sister Lesley Wilson. The prosecutor said: '[Ms Wilson] said it was a physical blow to find out the truth of it. 'She describes her mother and father had very little when they started out and had built up what they had by working very hard. 'She was devastated to find out the monies had been spent in the way they had by the defendant. 'There had been concerns expressed prior to her death by Mrs Rylance herself about monies going missing and the like. To a certain extent it was put down to her deteriorating condition.' Prosecutors accepted Rylance's claim that some of the cash was used for his mother's benefit. Vic Laffey, defending, said Rylance felt 'shame and remorse' for what he did. Mr Laffey said: 'He tried to get himself out of a hole when all he achieved was to dig himself further in. 'He was drowning in obligations. He was in the grip of quite significant financial problems and in particular a significant and debilitating gambling addiction.' Rylance will receive none of his mother's remaining estate, which will be divided between his siblings.","David Rylance, 47, stole thousands of pounds from his own dying mother .

"A 'perfect' mansion which has been sold for £51million in an exclusive part of London has become one of the UK's most expensive  homes - and the buyer also has to pay £7.6m in stamp duty. The sprawling house, built on the site of an old telephone exchange in Chelsea, west London, has been sold for 300 times the average price of home in England and Wales. But the stamp duty alone, paid on top of the price of the home, is enough for the Treasury to pay the annual salary of 330 nurses. This sprawling house, built on the site of an old telephone exchange in Chelsea, west London, has been sold for 300 times the average price of home in England and Wales . The transaction means it is one of the most expensive homes to ever sell in the UK. Spread across four floors, the house is 18 times the size of the average new home, with nine bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a cinema, a Japanese water garden and an indoor swimming pool. The owner, who commissioned the mansion, had put the house on the market for £55 million. It has now been bought by an offshore company  for £51,191,950, according to Land Registry figures. A spokesman for Knight Frank, which sold the home, would not comment further. The property is situated on Boltons Place, at the top of The Boltons, an exclusive street made up of late 19th and early 20th Century mansions. The huge tax bill, the equivalent to 15 per cent, is down to the buyer using a Bermuda-based company to buy the property. Under the Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings (ATED), which is payable by companies that own UK residential property, there is a further bill of £218,200 each year. The property has now been bought by an offshore company for £51,191,950, according to Land Registry figures . Spread across four floors, the house (pictured left) is 18 times the size of the average new home, with nine bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a cinema, a Japanese water garden and an indoor swimming pool . Knight Frank's Knightsbridge office had previously described the property as an 'exceptional detached recently built mansion' which was 'presented in immaculate condition throughout'. The advert said: 'The intention from the outset was to bring together the very best in the fields of construction and building services together with the most accomplished artisans and craftsmen to create and build the perfect house. 'Only materials of the highest quality have been employed by the most skilled workmen in order to create a house of unparalleled and exacting design.' The 17,500 sq ft house was built on the site of an old BT telephone exchange, which three developers bought for £15million in 2002. Estate agents Knight Frank's previously described the property as an 'exceptional detached recently built mansion' which was 'presented in immaculate condition throughout' They then demolished the building and commissioned architects Barrett Lloyd Davis to design three mansions. The properties, which were built by Walter Lilly & Company and completed in around 2006, feature a double height entrance hall along with glass lift. Simon Barnes, a property consultant, today described it as 'the perfect home'. It was built on top of an old telephone exchange in the upmarket Boltons Place, Chelsea . He said: 'The properties weren't built by developers to sell, they were built for them to live in. 'They are amazing. There is a spacious hallway, very good reception rooms and bathrooms. They are as near a perfect home as you can get. Great for entertaining in, and great for living in. 'In Prime Central London, 99 per cent of these houses are listed or in a conservation area so you can't just rip one down and rebuild it. 'Boltons Place was built on an old telephone exchange. In Prime Central London it is unique. The sale represents great news for the Treasury and the owner has a wonderful new home.' Alex Newall, managing director of Hanover Private Office, described the mansion as 'an awesome space'. He said: 'Boltons Place is well laid out and in a superb location. There are only a handful of homes like this in London. 'The ceilings are four-metres high, there is a massive lift, the master suite takes up a whole floor - it really is an awesome space. 'There is demand, but it is the availability that is the problem. Most streets are listed so it is difficult to find somewhere to build a house like this. A lot of people will keep the facade, but rebuild the house behind it.' Henry Pryor, a buying agent, added: 'Strange though it may seem this property looks good value when you consider what you could pay for flats in one of the posh new developments in Knightsbridge and Mayfair.'","The house sold for 300 times average price of home in England and Wales .

"A body found in the Mississippi River over the weekend has been identified as Minnesota fourth-grader Barway Edwin Collins who has been missing for nearly four weeks. Authorities said the body of the ten-year-old was found on Saturday around 1pm by searchers from a Boy Scout troop - about ten feet from the river's edge in Brooklyn Center. Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering said authorities have electronic evidence that shows the boy's father, Pierre Collins, 33, was in that area at the time the boy disappeared. However, she did not elaborate on the nature of that evidence. Police said on Sunday that the boy's father is a primary suspect as the case becomes a homicide investigation. A body pulled from the Mississippi River on Saturday has been identified as Barway Edward Collins (above), 10, who has been missing for nearly a month . Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering said authorities have electronic evidence that reveals that the boy's father, Pierre Collins, was in that area at the time he disappeared (above Revering during a news conference on April 12, 2015 in Crystal, Minnesota) Barway's father, 33-year-old Pierre Collins (pictured left as he stands with his wife, Yamah, during a vigil held for his son last month) is a primary suspect in the homicide investigation involving his son . 'This location is consistent with our knowledge of Pierre Collin's activities on March 18 and he remains a primary suspect,' said Revering. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said the cause and manner of Barway's death are still being investigated. The case is being considered a homicide based on the autopsy and information from the medical examiner, said Revering. A report last month by Fox 9 said that according to sources, Pierre Collins, took out a life insurance policy in Barway's name totaling $30,000 not long before the child went missing. The boy's father, who has said he is innocent, has not been arrested or charged in relation to the incident, but Revering said authorities have his passport to ensure he stays in the country. Police were stationed at his apartment complex for his own protection after reports of death threats. On Sunday, Pastor Harding Smith, of the Spiritual Church of God who has been acting as the family's spokesman said when the family received the news, there were a lot of tears, according to Twin Cities. 'There were lots of tears and lots of screams,' he said. 'There was disbelief, hurt, sadness. There is a deep sense of loss when you enter that home.' Alexander Collins, executive director of the Liberian Ministry Association, said: 'We also want to make clear to the perpetrator of this tragedy, that wherever you are, you will be found. This evil will be found. 'Wherever you are hiding, under a car, underground, make no mistake our community does not abide this evil.' The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said the cause and manner of Barway's death are still being investigated . Barway, who was a student at Evergreen Park World Cultures Community School, was last seen after school last month. In video released by police (scenes from footage above), Barway says 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle' In a March 25 interview with the Star Tribune, Pierre Collins said he was not home when his son disappeared and he was upset to be considered a suspect. 'I've been working with the police just to bring my son home,' he told the newspaper. 'I will do whatever they want just so Barway can come home. I have nothing to do with Barway's missing.' His wife and Barway's stepmother, Yamah Collins, also said she and her husband did not know who took the boy, and they pleaded for his safe return. Pierre Collins (right), accompanied by Pastor Harding Smith (center), the family's spokesman, was interviewed by Nancy Grace last month, saying that he failed the polygraph test because he was very emotional . Police said on Sunday that the boy's father (above) is a 'primary suspect' as the case becomes a homicide investigation . Police released a video of Barway riding a bus after school. In the video, the boy said 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle.' 'The father and the party described as an 'uncle' are likely the last known people to have seen Barway,' Revering said, as reported by the Star-Tribune. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway's father has not been completely truthful with us.' Addressing the footage on the bus, Pierre Collins explained to Nancy Grace that in the Liberian community, children commonly refer to adults as 'uncle' or 'auntie.' When pressed by Grace about the failed polygraph test, Collins explained that he was 'very emotional' during the test. 'I wasn't...myself when I took the polygraph,' he said. The boy was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school (above a massive billboard featuring a missing ad for Barway) Barway, who was a student at Evergreen Park World Cultures Community School, was last seen after school last month. The boy was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school. A call to the school bus company revealed that the 10-year-old was dropped off outside his building at around 4.15pm. Video surveillance from his apartment complex shows he was about to go inside, but then turned around as if he was called over to the parking lot by someone he knew, and he walked away, police said last month. Rosario Ramirez left and her children Daniela, five, Isaac, nine, and Juan, 11, pay their respects to Barway Collins during a vigil at Cedarwood apartments in Crystal, Minnesota held last month . A young boy adds a donation for Barway Collins' family to the pile during the vigil last month . The family told the Star Tribune that Barway emigrated from his home country of Liberia, where his mother lives, to stay with his father in 2011. The father said he wanted 'to make him better' and for Barway to eventually go to college. While looking for Barway, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies searched the area with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses.","Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minnesota apartment complex March 18 after school .

"It has the most famous zebra crossing in the world outside it, and has hosted every major name in music in the last 80 years, but Abbey Road studios has never before been open to the public. Despite receiving around 500,000 visitors a year, mostly to walk the famous crossing, the studio doors have been shut to those not recording ever since 1931 - that is, until now, thanks to a new collaboration with Google. The result is Inside Abbey Road, a new web app that takes users on an interactive, immersive and hugely detailed virtual tour of the inner workings of Abbey Road. Scroll down for video . Fine-tuning: The interactive app shows sound engineers and producers working as they look into Studio 1 . Classical music legend Sir Edward Elgar opened the studios on 12th November 1931.

With the aim of sharing some of this history, Google has stepped in to showcase as much of it to the public as possible, in a range of ways. Those familiar with Google Street View will find plenty they are used to in the way Inside Abbey Road is navigated, with a point and click of the mouse, as well as click and drag to scan the more than 150 360-degree images that make up the experience. But these are only the top layer to the app, which then has several animated sequences in place of images that show sound technicians at work in the three studios and mastering suite. Then added to this are a range of information points in the form of short articles on subjects ranging from cutting vinyl records to creating stereo. History: There are archive photos from Abbey Road down the years, as well as YouTube videos (pictured next to the piano) of performances placed in the exact spot they were filmed from.

The image, shot by Iain Macmillan, shows John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr walking over the crossing. Since then, hundreds of thousands of tourists have flocked to Abbey Road to recreate the iconic image. In December 2010, the crossing given Grade II-listed status for its 'cultural and historical importance'. There are archive photos from Abbey Road down the years, as well as YouTube videos of performances that are placed in the exact spot they were filmed from. These include music videos from the likes of Take That, Kate Bush and Bastille, as well as an interview between Zane Lowe and Jay Z.

Ringo Starr and George Harrison from The Beatles arrive at Abbey Road studios in November 1966. The band recorded around 90 per cent of their music there between 1962 and 1970 . Abbey Road studios was opened on 12th November 1931 by classical music legend Sir Edward Elgar. The first custom-built studio complex of its kind, Elgar used it in its early years to record some of his famous pieces. The facility had been fashioned out of a 16-room residence at 3 Abbey Road, St. John's Wood which had been bought by record company EMI in 1929. It has three recording studios and has been used by every major name in music over the last 80 years. Studio one can play host to a 110-piece orchestra and 100-person choir simultaneously and has been used by the London Symphony Orchestra and the Glenn Miller Orchestra among others. In June 1962 The Beatles made their first recording there in what was the start of an artistic collaboration that would last until 1970 when the group split. In total, around 90 per cent of the legendary band's music was recorded at Abbey Road studios. Five years after recording there for the first time,history was made when a worldwide satellite television link-uip was broadcast from the studio of The Beatles performing All You Need is Love live. An estimated 350 million people listened to the broadcast. Among the famous artists to have recorded at Abbey Road are the Spice Girls, Pink Floyd, Cliff Richard, Queen and Shirley Bassey. Hundreds of thousands of Beatles fans make their way to the studios every year and many of the walls and signs in the vicinity of the building are covered with Beatles-themed graffiti. In 2010 rumours began circling that cash-strapped EMI were looking to sell the studios. A year later the company sold its recorded music division for £1.2billion to the French-owned Universal Music Group. Because it is a working studio it is closed to the public. But now, thanks to Google's new web app, music fans can enjoy and interactive, virtual tour of the building. One of the most eye-catching moments within the app is the animated panorama that places users at the centre of the London Symphony Orchestra as they perform in one of the studios.

"Looking at  Jourdan Dunn, no one would ever think that the 5ft 11in supermodel has ever had confidence issues. The London-born beauty is the new face of Maybelline New York, she was British Vogue's February 2015 cover star, and also the first black model to walk for Prada in a decade. But the 24-year-old has now revealed that as a teenager her life was made a misery by cruel bullies who taunted her for her striking looks to the extent that she felt physically ill. Scroll down for video . Jourdan Dunn has revealed in an interview that she was severely bullied at school, which led to her suffering from incredibly low self-esteem . In an interview with The Times,  Jourdan said she was often picked on from primary school until secondary school when the situation was so bad she had to be home-schooled. 'I didn't want to leave the house,' she remembered. She added: 'I didn't want to look in the mirror. I would feel physically sick. I hated being me. 'I hated going to school. I already didn't like the way I looked and now people were making me feel bad.' As a result, the teenager began skipping school, which led to her being home-schooled for a while. The supermodel was famously scouted at the sunglasses counter of Primark in Hammersmith, at just 15. The 24-year-old supermodel has defied her bullies' expectations by becoming a household  name and a celebrated regular on the runway - walking for the likes of Balmain, Fashion for Relief and Topshop Unique (pictured left to right) The model used to feel 'physically sick' looking in the mirror when she was being bullied. Now she walks for the likes of Victoria's Secret (pictured in 2013's show) In the interview, Dunn revealed that even after she was scouted, she still had to deal with being hurtfully rejected - now because of the colour of her skin. She has since criticised the fashion industry for the scarcity of black models. She became the first black model to secure a solo British Vogue cover star this year since Naomi Campbell's last cover on the fashion bible in 2002 - 13 years ago. She explained: 'It's hard for black girls. 'A lot do give up, because if you don't have an agency who is going to push you, you are just there doing nothing and having to deal with all the rejection.' Despite dealing with prejudice - which extended to being backstage at a show, where make-up artists and hairdressers could not cater to her skin tone - she persevered.

She was 18 when she got pregnant, with her  son, Riley, now five.

While she was pregnant, the model also learned that her son had sickle cell disease - characterised by anaemia and severe pain. 'I owe it to other little black girls' - Dunn revealed in the interview that she perseveres to set a good example for other 'ethnic-looking girls' To raise awareness about the disease, she became an ambassador for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America last year. Speaking out about juggling a modelling career and being a full-time mum and carer, Jourdan is determined. She said: 'Becoming a mum, realising that you are responsible for this human being for the rest of your life is daunting. 'You have to get your s*** together. On top of that, having a sickle cell child has been a lot to deal with... It's made me grateful for everything that is around me.' The 24-year-old ambassador for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America is also a single mother of 5-year-old Riley, who suffers from Sickle Cell disease .","Stunning beauty, 24, was bullied throughout school for her striking looks .

"Child welfare authorities say the father of a three-year-old girl found alone near a suburban Chicago forest preserve left her in a trash can. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services spokesman Andrew Flach tells the Chicago Tribune that an initial investigation found that the girl's father put her in a trash can and drove away. Faiz Ikramulla, 35, was arrested and charged on Thursday with aggravated kidnapping. The little girl is believed to be named Aliya. Aggravated kidnapping: Faiz Ikramulla, 35 (left), was arrested and charged on Thursday with aggravated kidnapping after allegedly dumping his three-year-old daughter, Aliya (right), in an Illinois trash can . Scene: The child was found by a passer-by wandering near Milwaukee Avenue and Palatine Road in Prospect Heights, Illinois around 6:30 pm Tuesday . He's jailed in Van Buren County, Michigan, pending extradition proceedings. A passer-by found the girl Tuesday evening along a roadside near the forest preserve in Prospect Heights. She was crying and waving her hands. The Cook County Sheriff's Office says the girl could only provide her first name and was identified after investigators learned her mother was in the process of filing missing person reports for Aliya and Ikramulla. It was then they realized Ikramulla was wanted in relation to Aliya's kidnapping and that there was warrant out for his arrest. Police in Van Buren County, Michigan, notified Cook County Sheriff’s police and said they had located Ikramulla and arrested him. Both of the girl’s parents were initially under investigation, but authorities said there are no plans to arrest the girl’s mother, who is cooperating with DCFS investigators, The Tribune reported. Flach said DCFS has had no previous contact with the family, and the girl has no brothers or sisters. Prior arrest: Faiz Ikramulla, 35, was arrested in Mary 2014 in Portage, Wisconsin, for allegedly attacking police during a traffic stop. He is also said to have screamed out 'God is great' in Arabic . Ikramulla will now be extradited to Illinois to face charges. He has been charged with kidnapping because police say he was trying his hide his daughter, according to The Chicago Sun Times. If found guilty of the aggravated kidnapping charge, he would face a mandatory sentence of six to 30 years in prison. He might also be fined upwards of $25,000. This is not Ikramulla's first run-in with the police. In May 2014 he was arrested the Wisconsin man was arrested in Portage, accused of violently attacking police officers during a traffic stop and shouting God is great in Arabic. He was covered in bruises and red marks at the time of his mug shot. At the time Ikrumulla was charged with two counts of battery to law enforcement, three counts of resisting law enforcement, four counts of criminal recklessness and two counts of leaving the scene of an accident, NWI.com reported last year. He was also charged with misdemeanors including two counts of battery to law enforcement, two counts of resisting law enforcement and four counts of criminal recklessness.","Faiz Ikramulla, 35, was charged on Thursday with aggravated kidnapping .

"Time fries when you're having fun. Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield, 65, celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted. 'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Eddingfield told Fox. Scroll down for video . Dedicated employee: For most of her life Judy Eddingfield has been employed as a server at Winstead's in Kansas City and says it's the only job she's ever had or ever wanted . Is that you? A staff member at Winstead's said she believes one of the women in this photograph is Judy when she first started working at the restaurant . Classic establishment:  This is a photo of the The Winstead family who own the restaurant showing up for work in 1940 around the time when Judy Eddingfield's mother started working there . Eddingfield says she remembers when French fries and a classic Coca-Cola cost just 65 cents at the same restaurant she's worked at for half-a-century. For Eddingfield, slinging burgers with a smile is a family tradition. On April, 6, 1965 Eddinngfield began working at the restaurant where she was trained by her mother who had already been employed at the establishment for 13 years. Eddingfield said that her first day on the job when she was just 15-years-old she spilled a shake all over a woman's fur coat and thought for sure that she'd be fired. 'The tray tipped over and vanilla malt slid down a lady’s fur coat. I was so embarrassed,' Eddingfield told the Kansas City Star 'Of course, she hollered,' said Eddingfield. All was forgiven after Winstead's, open since 1940, got the coat cleaned. Eddingfield along with many of her siblings continued to provide top notch service. Loves to serve: Judy Eddingfield says that her kind customers are what make her job worthwhile . Lots of love: Winstead's honored Judy Eddingfield last week for her wonderful 50 years of working at the classic burger restaurant . 'I had two brothers, my sister, my mother, two aunts, two cousins and lots of friends that have worked here,' said Eddingfield. 'I was three years old when my mother started here, so I've been eating these burger 60 some years.' Eddingfield says she even met her first husband outside the restaurant and they married 18 months later. The Kansas City Star reports that one of Eddingfield's favorite Winstead’s memories was when Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow of the television series 'Leave It to Beaver' came to eat there in the late 1970's. She said that Mathers was 'talking with his hands' and knocked sent his food flying everywhere. Marriage: Judy Eddingfield even met her true love who she calls 'Frog' at Winstead's and the pair married 18-months-later . Celebration: Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted . 'Leave it to Beaver,' his on-screen brother said jokingly, almost as though it were scripted. On a scarier note, Eddingfield says she once was closing up the restaurant when a man started knocking on the door with a gun. She called 911 and hid in the bathroom until the police arrived. Eddingfield's employees say that as she gets older Eddingfield gets more delightful and that she is always willing to share her knowledge of the business. 'She trained me to be her. Pleasant as she is, prompt. So that people will come here for you and continue to come,' said server Sue Allen who has been there for 13 years. Close knit team: Eddingfield, pictured with some of her coworkers, has a passion for serving food . Nothing's changed!: Winstead's when it first opened in 1940 has an almost identical style to the Winstead's that's here today . Eddingfield's biggest tip she ever received was a generous man who treated his entire staff in 2014 and staff agree it was well deserved. Eddigfield turns 66 on May 13 and though she is getting older, she plans to keep on working as long as she is healthy. When asked why she chose to stay at the establishment for so long, she replied that the customers make her job worthwhile. 'The customers really make it special,' she says. General manager Kathi Fern says that Eddingfield is one of her best employees. 'It's just amazing the way she treats her customers,' said Fern. 'I call her my dinosaur. She's a dying breed and there will never be servers like her again.' said Fern of her dedicated employee. Classic drive-thru: Winstead's was established in 1940 and to this day is known for serving quality burgers at their drive-thru .","'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Judy Eddingfield said of Winstead's in Kansas City .

"A teenage boy who shot and killed a teacher and wounded several others in an attack inside a school in Barcelona had a 'hit list', local media reports. The 13-year-old boy is said to have listed 25 names of teachers and pupils he intended to kill and had told classmates of his plans as recent as last week, but none had taken him seriously. The teenager reportedly walked into the school armed with a machete and crossbow around 9.15am this morning, killing a male teacher and injuring two students and two teachers. Scroll down for video . Distressed relatives of students wait outside the Barcelona high school where a 13-year-old boy allegedly shot and killed a teacher using a crossbow, and injuring four people . Students reunite with their families as others wait for news outside the high school in Barcelona as it is claimed that the teenage attacker had told classmates he was planning to 'kill all the teachers' Two young girls comfort each other as students and staff were allowed to leave the school this afternoon . The teenager is said to have launched the attack in his own classroom, targeting his female Catalan teacher and her daughter, also a student at the school, Spanish media reports. According to a witness, the boy had been late for class and shot and injured the female teacher in the face, before stabbing her 13-year-old daughter. Student Gemma Jarque said she and her classmates barricaded themselves into their classroom when they heard the attack. 'We were just starting the class and suddenly we heard screams... so we shut ourselves inside our classroom in order to be safe', she said. 'We saw the teacher lying on the floor in a pool of blood.' Another student, Paula Amayuelas, said the boy had been bullied before in school. She said he 'didn't have problems but he was kind of a loner .... Other students would pick on him.' The boy is undergoing a psychiatric examination will not face criminal charges because he is under 14, the age of criminal responsibility in Spain. The victim, a male substitute teacher, had come to the aid of the woman and her daughter after hearing their screams and was shot and killed as he attempted to protect them, El Pais reports. The week before the attack, the teen had told classmates 'several times', that he was going to kill all the teachers before committing suicide, but none took him seriously and wrote it off as a bad joke. The boy, only identified by his initials M.P.C., had also said it would be easy to carry out an attack in the school with 'good weapons.' Judicial staff members take out the body of a teacher allegedly killed by a student armed with a crossbow at the Instituto Joan Foster  in Barcelona, Spain . Horror: Emergency Service members accompany two women out of the Joan Fuster Institue in Barcelona as it emerged that the teenage attacker had a 'kill list' A visibly distressed man, believed to be a member of staff, is helped out of the school . Aftermath: Students and parents leave the Joan Fuster Institute in a bus in Barcelona while police hold the suspect in the school . Following his detention after the slaughter, the boy was taken to a hospital for a psychiatric examination, said Jose Miguel Company, a spokesman for the Barcelona prosecutor's office. 'He was very disturbed and saying strange and incoherent things,' said Company, who added that the examination is aimed at determining whether the boy has psychiatric problems or whether he was faking them. The knife and crossbow used in the attack are believed to belong to the boy's father, who is reported to have kept a collection of weapons at home. His sister, also a pupil at the school, is reported to have fainted when she discovered what had happened. A friend of the sister of the alleged killer, who has not been named, said: 'She is a lovely person but he did strange things.' The female teacher attacked only suffered superficial wounds and her daughter is being treated in hospital with minor injuries. Another victim, a 14-year-old boy, was stabbed in the chest, but is now in stable condition in hospital, El Pais reports. Barcelona police said the boy has been arrested but would not confirm the weapon used in the attack. The attack took place in the Sant Andreu neighborhood of the city just after 9am, and the boy was detained shortly afterwards. The regional Mosses d'Esquadra police force are understood to be holding him at his school this morning on the orders of a judge so he could be examined by experts. Attack: The 13-year-old boy reportedly burst into the school armed with a knife and crossbow, killing a male teacher and injuring four others . Shocking: The attack took place just after 9am this morning and police confirmed the boy has been detained . Although he was earlier reported to have fired an arrow at the injured female teacher, sources later said he used the tip of the crossbow to stab her in the head and a leg. The school caretaker is understood to have wrestled him to the ground and disarmed him. Mossos d'Esquadra said in a statement: 'We have identified a minor on suspicion of the death of a teacher at a school in Barcelona. 'The incident happened inside the school about 9.15am when the minor allegedly attacked the teacher with a sharp object. 'During the incident four people were slightly injured, two female teachers and two pupils. 'Three of them have been transferred to hospital and one of them, a female teacher, was treated at the scene. Police are investigating the incident.' The attack took place on the 16th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre when seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot and killed 12 students and one teacher. The 1999 massacre in Columbine, Colorado, is the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history. A spokesman for regional police said it was too early to determine whether Monday's attack was an attempt to copy the Columbine attack.","Boy, 13, arrested after deadly attack at secondary school in Barcelona .

"Secret Service agents will take a bullet for the President of the United States, but apparently they won't swim for him. When the public commissions with jurisdiction over the White House heard proposals for beefing up the presidential mansion's perimiter, they were told that the government wouldn't be digging a moat around the building. That idea, it turns out, was actually under consideration. But NBC-TV4 in Washington reported that 'there was concern expressed about having to retrieve people from it.' Ultimately saner heads prevailed: The National Park Service and the Secret Service are recommending the addition of half-inch-thick spikes, angled away from the White House, to the existing fence. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . A JOKE TAKEN SERIOUSLY: One television network mocked up what 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue might look like surrounded by a ditch filled with water to deter would-be intruders . A Washington, DC television station showed this mockup on Thursday, depicting the angled steel spikes that will soon be atop the White House perimeter fence . The new spikes, officially known as 'pencil protrusions,' will be bolted on at the top for a year or more while an entirely new fence – as tall as 10 feet – is planned and fabricated. The White House might also get a prison-style double fence with space in between, but barbed wire has been ruled out. A sitting U.S. congressman suggested in November that the Secret Service would be better able to protect the president and his family if 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue took a more mediaeval approach to security with a moat. Tennessee Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen made the idea part of his brainstorm in a Q-and-A session with then-Acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy during a Capitol Hill hearing. 'Would a moat – water, six feet around – be kind of attractive and effective?' a straight-faced Cohen asked. LOW-TECH FENCE: A man named Omar Gonzalez scaled the existing wrought-iron barrier in front of the White House in September – and ran all the way into the White House while carrying a knife in his pants pocket . Clancy replied that changes to the presidential mansion's perimeter fence was the main upgrade under consideration. 'Like a higher fence?' Cohen followed up. 'You're right sir, a higher fence would certainly help us,' the Secret Service director told him. In the hearing, conservative Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas suggested that if the White House won't build a fence or a wall on America's southern border, strengthening the White House's fence should be an equally bad idea. Obama administration officials have long argued that fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border would be worthless. 'I would think that if the admin's gonna being consistent,' Gohmert said, 'it's now time to remove the fence from around the White House, 'cause if it isn't good enough for our border, it shouldn't good enough for our White House.' Secret Service Acting Director Joseph Clancy played mop-up in November, apologizing to Congress for hooker scandals, security breaches and a shooting . MAKE IT TALL: Texas Republican Rep. Louis Gohmert said last year that if the Obama administration doesn't want a border fence between Texas and Mexico, it shouldn't expect one around the White House . Or else, the right-wing firebrand added, Obama's policymakers should admit that 'maybe there really is some real virtue in having a fence that slows people down.' Among the Secret Service's recent embarrassing episodes has been a series of fence-jumping security breaches, including a man with a pocket knife who made it all the way into the East Room. Cohen, the moat-proposing Tennessean, found mention of that hair-raising moment amusing in November. 'This guy got further in the White House than some of my Republican colleagues have ever gotten,' he said, laughing.","White House planners say they're ready to recommend spikes at the top of the mansion's fenceposts to better protect the president .

"The legal adviser to Alison Saunders was a barrister in the same chambers as the son of Lord Janner (pictured), it has emerged . The legal adviser to Alison Saunders was a barrister in the same chambers as the son of Lord Janner, it emerged last night. The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that the Director of Public Prosecutions consulted Neil Moore – a barrister at 23 Essex Street where Daniel Janner worked – over whether to prosecute Lord Janner, The Times reported. And senior police officers probing allegations of child abuse offences against the Labour peer have reportedly raised concerns about Mr Moore's involvement in the decision to not proceed with his trial. Last night a CPS spokesman said Mrs Saunders made the decision not to prosecute on her own, and that Mr Moore told her he had been in chambers with Lord Janner's son before discussing the case. He said Mr Moore had acted properly at all times. In a further blow to Mrs Saunders, senior Conservative politican David Davis last night labelled her 'the worst DPP in modern times'. He told The Sun that the treatment of journalists charged with paying public officials was 'heavy-handed and lacking in judgment'. Mrs Saunders said it was her job to make 'very difficult decisions', but the Lord Janner row showed no sign of abating last night. The DPP justified her decision not to prosecute by saying experts agreed Lord Janner, 86, was in poor health due to advanced Alzheimer's disease. But she admitted the former Leicester West MP should have been charged three times before – in 1991, 2002 and 2007. Mrs Saunders said it was her job to make 'very difficult decisions', but the Lord Janner row showed no sign of abating last night . Mrs Saunders blamed police and prosecutors and launched an independent review, but her remarks stoked fears of an establishment cover-up. Yesterday, calls grew for a judicial review of the decision, which Leicestershire Police said it was considering. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who exposed Liberal MP Cyril Smith as a paedophile, said criticism of Mrs Saunders suggested something had 'clearly gone very badly wrong', adding: 'It's hard to see how her position remains tenable.' More questions emerged about Lord Janner's health last night as it was revealed he wrote to the House of Lords a fortnight ago to extend his role.","Alison Saunders consulted Neil Moore, a barrister where Daniel Janner worked, over whether to prosecute the Labour peer .

"Encounters with common dolphins off the west of Scotland have more than doubled over a decade, according to experts. And now research is under way to find out why, with scientists proposing that climate change may have caused the surge in numbers. Common dolphins were once a rare sight in the Hebrides, preferring warmer waters found further south, leading experts to believe that global warming has led to pods moving north. Encounters with common dolphins (a stock image is shown) off the west of Scotland have more than doubled over a decade, according to a leading research body. Monitoring by Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust teams has seen the number of encounters increase by 68 per cent over the past 12 years . Monitoring by Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust teams has seen the number of encounters with common dolphins increase by 68 per cent over the past 12 years. The dolphins come to the Hebrides in spring to take advantage of seasonal food stocks, travelling in large groups and sometimes forming ‘super-pods’ of thousands of individuals. The species, which are smaller than the area’s resident bottlenose dolphins, often approach boats and play in the wake, the trust said. While they were once drawn to warmer waters above 10°C south of the area, climate change is  causing sea surface temperatures in the Hebrides to rise by around 0.5 °C a decade. And warmer water species appear to be colonising new areas further north or closer to shore, the trust said. The dolphins are moving further north than they did decades ago, possibly because the water has become warmer. While the shift could create new feeding opportunities for the common dolphins, it could increase competition between other types of dolphin or seabirds. An Oystercatcher on the Isle of Mull is shown . The shift north could be creating new opportunities for the common dolphins to find food in new areas, but may mean the species is competing for fish with other types of dolphin or seabirds. Volunteers will live, work and sleep on Silurian research ship for up to 12 days. They will receiving training and work with scientists to conduct visual surveys, acoustic monitoring using specialist equipment, and cetacean identification through dorsal fin photography. They will also help run Silurian - giving them a chance to learn to sail and navigate. Areas covered depend on the weather but will range from Mull of Kintyre in the south, Cape Wrath in the north and St Kilda in the west. These seas are one of Europe’s most important cetacean habitats. Participation costs range from £683 to £1,500 to cover boat expenses, accommodation, training, food and insurance, and support the trust’s research. More information can be found at HWDT. Colder water species such as the white beaked dolphin could be forced to retreat further north, and while the trust said it had found no evidence of the white beaked dolphin being displaced, continued monitoring of the situation is needed. The charity is calling for volunteers to join its research vessel Silurian to help conduct visual surveys and acoustic monitoring and identification of cetaceans. This includes dolphins, whales and porpoises. Dr Conor Ryan, sightings and strandings officer at Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust said: ‘An increase in common dolphins means that those wishing to encounter dolphins in the wild are in luck - but further research is needed to explain why this is happening, the extent to which it has been caused by human activity and the implications for other cetacean species.’ Kerry Froud, the trust’s biodiversity officer, added: ‘Our research expeditions depend on volunteers. ‘In return they offer the opportunity of a lifetime to contribute to a better understanding of cetaceans and basking sharks, whilst enjoying the beautiful scenery of Scotland’s west coast and experiencing exhilarating sailing.

Now, researchers have shown that passive smoking affects plants too, which can take up nicotine from contaminated soil and plumes of smoke. The finding may explain why some spices, herbal teas and medicinal plants have high concentrations of nicotine in them, despite none being allowed in insecticides. Researchers have shown that passive smoking affects plants too, which can take up nicotine from contaminated soil and plumes of smoke (illustrated with a stock image) Nicotine was frequently used as an insecticide until it was banned by the European Union in 2009 because of its toxicity. But a surprisingly large number of food crops and plant-derived products still contain very high levels of nicotine. Dirk Selmar and his colleagues at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, set out to uncover whether there are reasons for this beyond the use of illegal insecticides. They used peppermint plants, which contain minimal traces of nicotine, in a series of mulching and fumigation experiments. He said: ‘Tremendously elevated nicotine levels were detected after fumigation with cigarette smoke.’ The researchers showed for the that that peppermint plants (a stock image is shown) can take up high concentrations of nicotine from contaminated soils, as well as taking in the drug from smoke . Cats and dogs whose owners smoke are twice as likely to develop some types of cancer as those whose owners do not. Dogs that are exposed to tobacco smoke are much more likely to develop nose and lung cancers than dogs not exposed to smoke. Smaller pets and birds can also be affected as they are very sensitive to the effects of smoke. Previous research, by Tufts University, near Boston, US, also found that cats that live with smokers are twice as likely to develop Feline Lymphoma, a serious cancer of the blood and immune system. It is believed that when cats groom themselves they ingest contaminated dust, soot, ash and nicotine which was caught in their fur. They also showed for the first time that that peppermint plants can take up high concentrations of nicotine from contaminated soils. The team analysed plants in soil mulched with cigarette tobacco for more than nine days to find that the resulting nicotine concentrations in them were several times higher than the maximum residue level set by European authorities. The study, published in Springer’s journal Agronomy for Sustainable Development, suggests that the reported high levels of this substance may indeed originate from tobacco. The researchers found a drastic decrease in nicotine concentration in plants as time progressed. This is likely because nicotine was taken up by the roots of the peppermint plants and processed in their leaves. ‘Our results suggest that the widespread occurrence of nicotine in medicinal, spice and food plants may, at least in part, be due to other nicotine sources apart from the illegal use of insecticides,’ Dr Selmar said. As well as being interesting to the food industry, the findings prove that substances such as alkaloids, can be transferred from one plant, after its death, to another. Such ‘horizontal transfer of natural products’ sheds light on the hitherto unexplained success behind farming practices such as crop rotation and the co-cultivation of certain vegetables.","Technical University of Braunschweig researchers analysed peppermint .

"Argentina has branded British attempts to explore the seas around the Falklands Islands for oil ‘illegitimate’ and says it will mount a legal challenge – but has ruled out another conflict. Daniel Filmus, Argentina’s secretary of state for the islands, told an event in London that Britain’s decision to increase military spending in the South Atlantic was ‘gunboat diplomacy’. Mr Filmus said military conflict ‘belongs to the past’ and claimed: ‘The United Kingdom can count on Argentina as an ally.’ Argentina has branded British attempts to explore the seas around the Falklands Islands for oil ‘illegitimate’ But he added: ‘The unilateral and illegitimate appropriation of non-renewable natural resources that is being carried out by the UK in the South Atlantic has been the subject of continued protest by the Argentine Republic. ‘Argentina has been forced to resort to defensive measures,’ he said, using ‘the law and political action as its main tools in order to protect the natural resources in the area under dispute’. He said Argentinian judicial authorities would consider the case against British companies involved in the oil exploration. Addressing the question of possible future conflict, Mr Filmus said: ‘Argentina bears no grudge against the inhabitants of the islands in spite of all the manoeuvres designed to prove otherwise. 'What Argentina is not going to do is give in. We do not wish to spend another penny on arms. It is through negotiations that we will solve this. 'We do not know how many years it will take... But what justification can there be for mothers crying over the deaths of their sons? It really must be dialogue.’ Daniel Filmus's comments sparked a furious reaction from Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (pictured) Mr Filmus’s comments sparked a furious reaction from Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who told Sky News: ‘It is an outrageous piece of bullying and threatening against the Falkland islanders’ perfect right to develop their own economic resources and Argentina needs to stop this kind of behaviour and start acting like a responsible member of the international community.’ Britain defeated Argentina in a 1982 war over the South Atlantic islands and administers them as an overseas territory, whose population of around 3,000 voted overwhelmingly to remain under British rule in a referendum in 2013. Argentina says it is the rightful owner of the islands, which it calls Las Malvinas, a claim dating back centuries to the Spanish colonial era. The dispute has escalated in recent years with the discovery of oil and gas deposits.","Argentina claims British exploration around Falklands for oil is ‘illegitimate’

"Air crash investigators examining a computer belonging to Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz are trying to determine whether the killer 'spiked' his captain's drink to force him into the toilet. Lubitz, 27, crashed the Airbus A320 passenger jet into the Alps changing the aircraft's altitude to just 100 feet using the autopilot, sending it on collision course with the Alps. German prosecutors believe that Lubitz may have added a chemical to Captain Patrick Sodenheimer's coffee to remove him from the flight deck. Scroll down for video . Andreas Lubitz may have spiked his Captain's coffee so he would be left alone on the aircraft's flight deck . Investigators have been scouring Lubitz's computers to determine his state of mind before the tragedy . Lubitz remained silent during the final eight minutes of the flight as it flew into the Alps . Once Captain Sodenheimer closed the cockpit door, Lubitz enabled special security features preventing the reinforced door from reopening. The safety systems were introduced following the 9/11 attacks although the designers did not consider a rogue pilot seeking to kill himself while taking his passengers and fellow crew with him. Already it has emerged that Lubitz used his computer to research methods of killing himself as well as information concerning the cockpit door locking mechanism. It is understood that European safety chiefs had concerns about Germanwings' safety procedures in the weeks before the crash. In November 2014, the European Commission contacted several airlines and 'had asked for clarification to make sure all airlines actively observe rules'. Following the crash, it emerged that Lubtiz suffered from crippling depression although Lufthansa, who own Germanwings, did not pass on this information to aviation regulators. Investigators believe that Lubitz, 27, informed its flight school when he returned from a several-month break in pilot training in 2009 that he had experienced an episode of 'severe depression'. Lufthansa has said he subsequently passed all medical tests. The EU has detailed air safety regulations, which included rules on a pilot's mental health, that member states need to take into account. EASA regularly tests whether the 28 EU nations adhere to those standards. 'This is a normal and regular occurrence,' said the official.","Investigators have been searching Andreas Lubtiz's internet search history .

"Pamela Anderson has come in for criticism for her very public show of support for an Arizona sheriff notorious for his controversial opinions and racial profiling of Latinos. Joe Arpaio, who calls himself ‘America’s Toughest Sheriff’, and the former Baywatch star appeared  odd soul-mates as they joined together at the Maricopa County Jail on Wednesday to promote the benefits of an all-vegetarian diet. Arpaio says cutting meat from the meals served to the more than 8,000 inmates has saved an estimated $200,000 per year. The jail has been serving vegetarian meals for 16 months now. Scroll down for video . The odd couple: PETA spokesperson Pamela Anderson joined forced with controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio on Wednesday to promote the benefits of a vegetarian diet for prison inmates . Pamela Anderson was all smiles as she joined Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio to serve vegetarian meals to inmates at the Maricopa County Jail, making it the first jail in the country to go entirely vegetarian . Inmates are served a peanut butter sandwich with oranges and some crackers for brunch and a hot meal comprised of different vegetable and soy dishes for dinner. Anderson, a longtime vegan and a spokeswoman for the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said she hopes the meal initiative stands as a model for prisons and jails across the country. Anderson and PETA have came under fire for their association with the polarizing Arpaio, who has long faced criticism that he unfairly targets minorities for law enforcement. He has described himself as an 'equal opportunity guy, I lock up everybody.' PETA’s Senior Vice President Dan Mathews told ThinkProgress that the food he saw and tasted during a tour of the food factory plant last month was healthy. 'I was incredibly impressed to see the fresh produce,' he said. But a Fox News affiliate reporter who visited in 2013 commented that the carrots in the stew were brown and that the soy looked like 'wood chips.' Anderson and PETA have came under fire for their association with the polarizing Arpaio, who has long faced criticism that he unfairly targets minorities for law enforcement . Anderson, dressed in a red and black stripped top, signed autographs for inmates as she toured the prison which includes an outdoor area known as Tent City . Arpaio responded, 'Oh, that’s probably just dirt. Don’t worry about that.' Inmates, who receive just two meals a day, have previously called the food being served as 'slop.' The stunt at Maricopa County Jail on Wednesday as described as 'a new low for PETA' by ThinkProgress. Anderson, dressed in a red and black stripped top, signed autographs for inmates as she toured the prison which includes an outdoor area known as Tent City. An outdoor jail with electric fencing, Tent City can hold more than two thousand immigrant detainees. Because the heat can rise to 137 degrees during the summer months, the tent structure serves primarily as brutal physical punishment. 'We're saving a lot of lives and I think it's very helpful and encouraging to get people to eat compassionately and make non-violent choices,' said Anderson. Anderson, a longtime vegan and a spokeswoman for the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said she hopes the meal initiative stands as a model for prisons and jails across the country . A press conference at Tent City came to an abrupt end when reporters asked the sheriff to compare the $200,000 meat-free savings to the $14 million the agency is spending to comply with a court order that found sheriff's deputies discriminated against Latino residents. 'It's comparing apples to oranges,' Arpaio said. 'We won't be getting into that today, thanks very much.' An appeals court on Wednesday upheld key findings in the 2013 ruling that deputies under Sheriff Arpaio systemically committed racial profiling of Latinos. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the previous ruling by District Judge Murray Snow that unconstitutional practices targeting immigrants had extended traffic stops in the Phoenix area. The decision by Snow marked the first time that the sheriff's office known for immigration enforcement had been found to have racially profiled people. The judge is requiring Arpaio's officers to video-record traffic stops, collect data on stops and undergo training to ensure they aren't acting unconstitutionally.

"Stunning images have surfaced of an elusive albino dolphin that can change colour from white to pink when it's emotional. The rare mammal has been making waves at the Taiji Whale Museum in southern Japan, where it draws vast and fascinated crowds. While bottlenose dolphins are typically grey, the mammal is completely white– apart from the quirky tendency to turn pink when it's feeling angry, sad or even embarrassed. Scroll down for video . An albino bottlenose dolphin frolics inside the Taiji Whale Museum in southern Japan . The phenomenon results from the animals thin skin, which means its blood vessels can cause a change in skin tone depending on their emotional state. Essentially, they blush in the same way as humans. The rare specimen is believed to be only the second one ever put on display in an aquarium after it was purchased from fishermen last year. The animal was controversially captured during the annual dolphin hunt in the town of Taiji in January. Its quirky colouration meant the fishermen would get more money selling it to an aquarium than as meat. While bottlenose dolphins are typically grey, the mammal is completely white– apart from the quirky tendency to turn pink when it's feeling emotional . The rare animal - believed to be only the second one ever put on display in an aquarium - has been drawing in huge crowds of fascinated beholders . The Taiji hunt was made notorious by the 2009 Oscar-winning documentary 'The Cove,' which depicted fishermen  capturing hundreds of dolphins for aquariums or to be killed for meat. Japan's Wakayama Prefecture, which includes Taiji, reported that 1,218 dolphins and small whales were captured there in 2011, though it did not specify how many of those captured were killed. Environmental activists filed a lawsuit against the Taiji Whaling Museum in May 2014, claiming it had refused experts to check on the safety of the elusive dolphin. But the museum claims the creatures health has been monitored through periodic blood tests, and that they are keeping it 'physically and mentally healthy' for further research. The pink tone is a result of the animals thin skin, which means its blood vessels can cause a change in skin tone depending on their emotional state . Environmental activists filed a lawsuit against the Taiji Whaling Museum in May 2014, claiming it had refused experts to check on the safety of the elusive dolphin. It was also reported the museum did the animal a favour - albino dolphins are easy prey at sea as they unable to blend in like their grey coloured relatives. Experts claimed it was remarkable that the animal had survived so long before being taken to the museum. Taiji Whaling Museum, along with the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology and the Institute of Cetacean Research, published a study about the dolphin in Mammal Study March 2015.

"The Kardashians might be at the forefront of fashion trends, but apparently not the waist-trimmers, or 'girdles' as Sophie Falkiner calls them. Australian TV presenter, model and mother of two, Sophie Falkiner reveals she's been ahead of the trend, ten years before the Kardashians began Instagramming it. While Khloe Kardashian recently attributed the corset-like waist trainer as the tool behind her new, slim figure, Falkiner says she discovered the benefits while interviewing Hollywood plastic surgeons for a work assignment years ago.

"Alarmed by a rash of explosions and injuries caused when amateurs make hash oil, lawmakers in Colorado and Washington are considering spelling out what's allowed when it comes to making the concentrated marijuana at home. The proposals came after an increase in home fires and blasts linked to homemade hash oil. In Colorado, at least 30 people were injured last year in 32 butane explosions involving hash oil — nearly three times the number reported throughout 2013, according to officials with the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, a state-federal enforcement program. Scroll down for video . Nicholas Broms, who was involved in a drug-related explosion last November, poses for a photo showing his burn scars from the explosion in Portland, Ore. Washington's legal marijuana law in 2012 did not permit the production of hash or even edibles at home; it technically remains a felony even to use weed purchased at a state-licensed store to make brownies. Nevertheless, many people have done it. Federal prosecutors in Seattle have brought charges in five cases where hash oil operations blew up, including at one apartment complex where an 87-year-old former mayor of Bellevue died after sustaining an injury while trying to escape a fire that started in another unit. People make hash oil at home for the same reasons they make beer, wine or booze — to save money, make it to personal taste, or as a hobby. Though there are safer methods, such as soaking marijuana in a vegetable-based glycerin, one common practice is to force a solvent such as butane or propane gas or liquid through leafy cannabis, a process that separates its psychoactive material from buds, leaves and stems. After the extraction, the hash-maker then releases the gas or boils off the liquid, leaving behind marijuana's psychoactive material in a potent goop. The resulting product — called hash oil or shatter or wax in even more concentrated form — can be used in vaporizers or added to foods without the grassy taste raw pot imparts. Without proper ventilation, though, the gases can pool in a room, where a spark from an appliance can trigger a severe explosion, knocking buildings off their foundation in some cases. Washington lawmakers are proposing to allow limited home hash production, though butane or other explosive gases would be banned except for use by commercial producers. Safer methods would be OK, and adults would be allowed to use cooking oil, butter or similar substances to make edibles. Alarmed by a rash of explosions caused by amateur hash production, Colorado and Washington lawmakers are considering limits on making the marijuana concentrate at home . 'We have a little problem here with people blowing themselves up,' said Washington state Sen. Ann Rivers, the Republican sponsor of that state's measure. 'Anything we can do to stop that from happening.' In Colorado, where hash regulations vary by jurisdiction, a bill up for its first vote next week in a House committee would establish a similar ban on the use of explosive gases to make hash. 'People who make it at home, they can do so with alcohol or methods that are safe,' said Colorado state Rep. Yeulin Willett, a sponsor of the bill. Colorado's largest jurisdiction, Denver, banned some types of home hash production late last year. A similar ban is under discussion in the state's third-largest city, Aurora. But some marijuana activists argue that when pot is legal, concentrating it at home should be legal, too. They compare the hash explosions to fires caused by turkey fryers and call it a problem with a new product that is best addressed by consumer education. 'Sure, there have been numerous dangerous explosions and fires from idiots who are determined to blow themselves up participating in activities which need considerable safety precautions,' said Timothy Tipton of the Rocky Mountain Caregivers Cooperative. Tipton insisted that butane extraction is perfectly safe with proper ventilation or when done outside. Supporters of home production also say Colorado's law is on their side. The state's marijuana legalization measure specifically included concentrated marijuana and all its production methods. This photo released Wednesday, May 21, 2014, by the Central Pierce Fire and Rescue, shows debris following an explosion the night before in Puyallup, Wash. when hundreds of butane canisters exploded . Just last month, the Denver district attorney dropped a case against a man facing felony charges of manufacturing marijuana concentrate and fourth-degree arson. The man, Paul Mannaioni, was charged last year after a hash oil explosion sent him and two other people to a hospital. Mannaioni challenged the legality of Denver's hash oil ban, prompting Colorado's former attorney general to say the marijuana amendment allows limits on home production. The charges were later dismissed after prosecutors said they couldn't tie him to the explosion beyond a reasonable doubt, leaving the legality of the city's hash oil ban unresolved. Some marijuana advocates said a statewide ban would invite more legal challenges. 'It's a patient's right to make their medicine,' said Jason Warf of the Southern Colorado Cannabis Council. But Colorado lawmakers backing the homemade limits said the state should err on the side of caution. 'This is something we need to nip in the bud,' Willett said.","Lawmakers in Colorado and Washington are considering spelling out what's allowed when it comes to making the concentrated marijuana at home .

"A three-year-old boy has been accused of killing his mother by pushing her down a lift shaft in China by one of their neighbours. Xie Hong Feng was found dead after falling five floors down an empty elevator shaft in her apartment block in Ningbo City in China. Her neighbour and property manager Yang Shao told police the 45-year-old had been pushed by her toddler son, The People’s Daily Online reported. Xie Hong Feng, pictured, died after falling down five floors through a lift shaft. Her three-year-old son has been accused of pushing her by the property's manager - but there is no CCTV evidence of the accident . CCTV image inside the lift shows Ms Xie with her three-year-old son. She dropped her keys in the gap between the elevator and the fourth floor, and went to the property manager for help retrieving them . The drama started when Ms Xie, in her mid-forties, went to Yang with her child for help after she dropped her key down the gap between the lift and the fourth floor, where she lived. All three got the lift to the fifth floor, and Yang, 52, pressed the button for the sixth floor. According to police statements, Yang said she used the triangular lock necessary to open the lift doors and told Ms Xie to be careful as she looked for her keys because it was very dark. When Ms Xie did not reply, Yang asked her son ‘Where is your mother?’ He answered ‘Pushed down!’, and Yang called the police. There is no CCTV outside the elevator, and police say Yang’s statement is the only evidence. Ms Xie’s husband was on a business trip when the tragic accident occurred, and one of Ms Xie’s male relatives said they are not convinced that the child pushed his mother into the shaft. Property manager Yang said Ms Xie's three-year-old son pushed her down lift shaft to her death. Investigators have brought into question why she had the authority to open the lift doors and whether she acted properly . A lift maintenance engineer claimed that property manager Yang acted illegally by opening the lift doors manually. The relatives of victim Ms Xie said they are not convinced her son pushed and killed his mother . Yang told reporters outside her home: ‘She [Ms Xie] told me that she dropped her keys in the gap. I said I will help her get it. ‘The lift doors open when we were on the fifth floor and then the child pushed his mother down to the shaft.’ The administration of work safety of Ningbo City was called in to help police investigate the cause of the accident, and they have already ruled out a malfunction of the lift. Officers are questioning why, if Ms Xie dropped her keys on the fourth floor, the group travelled to the fifth floor. Questions have also been raised over whether property staff have the authority to open the lift doors, and officers are looking at whether Yang was properly qualified to handle the lifts. Chen Zhewei, the Ningbo City Yinzhou property manager, told reporters from The People’s Daily Online that because of a lack of lift maintenance companies 10 years ago, some residential areas decided to train their staff on the use of elevators so they could deal with emergency situations. Nowadays the majority of lift maintenance and safety is outsourced to specialist companies. The fact that Yang opened the lift doors with a triangular lock is illegal, a lift maintenance engineer added, and there are very strict procedures that should be adhered to when manually opening a lift doors. These include turning off the electricity supply to the lift and keeping the triangular lock in a secure place.","Three-year-old accused of murder by the apartment block manager .

"Lucy, the oldest and most complete fossil of an early human ever found, still has a few secrets to reveal. Discovered in 1974, the 3.2 million-year-old skeleton stunned archaeologists who unearthed the fossil while digging in an isolated spot in the Afar region of Ethiopia. Now, a new look at the ancient hominin's skeleton suggests one of the bones may, in fact, belong to a baboon. Lucy, the oldest and most complete fossil of an early human ever found, still has a few secrets to reveal. A new look at the ancient hominin's skeleton suggests one of the vertebrae bones may belong to a baboon . Despite being uncovered 40 years ago, Lucy is still being studied to learn more about our ancestors. The skeleton belongs to a species called Australopithecus afarensis and is around 40 per cent complete. When discovered in Ethiopia, Lucy was the only skeleton of the species known; she would've stood 3.5 feet (about a meter) tall. Currently, more than 300 individuals of this species, which lived between about 3.85 million and 2.95 million years ago, have been uncovered . The strange discovery of a baboon bone was made when Gary Sawyer and Mike Smith at the American Museum of Natural History in New York began work on a reconstruction of Lucy's skeleton (right) The strange discovery of a baboon bone was made when Gary Sawyer and Mike Smith at the American Museum of Natural History in New York began work on a reconstruction of Lucy's skeleton. 'Mike pointed out that one of the [vertebra] fragments, which no one, including me, had really paid close attention to, looked fairly small to fit with the rest of Lucy's vertebral column,' Scott Williams at New York University told the New Scientist. The researchers thought one possible explanation was that the fragment was missed up with another, younger member of Lucy's species. A comparative study of vertebrae from other Australopithecus fossils in that region disproved this theory. The researchers analysed 11 rock samples from around the nearly complete Little Foot fossil skeleton from theSterkfontein Caves to gauge its age . Scientists have revealed a sophisticated new dating . technique shows that Little Foot, an important fossil of an . early human forerunner unearthed in the 1990s in South Africa, . is roughly 3.7 million years old. 'The age of Little Foot has been highly debated,' said . geologist Darryl Granger of Purdue University in Indiana, whose . research appears in the journal Nature. The study found Little Foot, a member of the species . Australopithecus prometheus, lived at roughly the same time as . Australopithecus afarensis, the species whose most famous . fossil, known as Lucy, comes from Ethiopia. Both species blended ape-like and human-like traits but with different features. The researchers analysed 11 rock samples from around the . nearly complete Little Foot fossil skeleton from the . Sterkfontein Caves to gauge its age. The findings may have important implications about the . evolutionary relationships among humankind's ancient relatives. The team then compared it to the vertebrae of other creatures living in that region 3.2 million years ago, and found a baboon bone was the closest fit. Williams told New Scientist that the fossil of a gelada baboon thoracic vertebra must have somehow been mixed up with Lucy's remains. The team now plan to present their findings at the Paleoanthropology Society in San Francisco next week. Our species, Homo sapiens, appeared roughly 200,000 years . ago. Earlier members of the human genus, Homo, date back more . than 2 million years. Our genus was predated by other species on . the human family tree including various representatives of Lucy's genus Australopithecus. Dr Simon Underdown, principal lecturer in anthropology at Oxford Brookes University, said: 'The co-mingling of skeletons is quite common in the archaeological record and it can often be difficult to separate out different elements if multiple bodies are mixed together. 'Lucy was not found in association with lots of other different bones and was painstakingly studied during excavation and description. Mistakes can of course be made with 1000s of fragments but that wasn’t the case here. 'Even if one fragment of a bone from the spine turns out to be from a baboon it does not alter the larger picture of what Lucy brings to the story of human evolution.' Our genus was predated by other species on . the human family tree including various representatives of the . genus Australopithecus, of which Lucy (reconstruction pictured) belonged to .","Baboon bone was spotted by the American Museum of Natural History .

"While Google and Apple are developing self driving vehicles, Nasa has revealed its vision - and its a lot more fun. Called the Modular Robotic Vehicle, or MRV, it was developed at NASA's Johnson Space Center to show off the technologies that could let man move across other planets. On Earth, however, it also has some neat tricks - from the ability to park sideways to being able to spin on the spot, as well as being driven remotely at up to 70mph. Watch the buggy in action below . Unlike a normal car, the buggy has no mechanical linkages to the propulsion, steering, or brake actuators, the driver of an MRV relies completely on control inputs being converted to electrical signals and then transmitted by wires to the vehicle's motors. A turn of the steering wheel, for instance, is recorded by sensors and sent to computers at the rear of the vehicle. These computers interpret that signal and instruct motors at one or all four of the wheels to move at the appropriate rate, causing the vehicle to turn as commanded. Nasa says the vehicles was buit 'in order to advance technologies that have applications for future vehicles both in space and on Earth.' 'With seating for two people, MRV is a fully electric vehicle well-suited for busy urban environments, it says. MRV is driven by four independent wheel modules called e-corners. Each e-corner consists of a redundant steering actuator, a passive trailing arm suspension, an in-wheel propulsion motor, and a motor-driven friction braking system. Each e-corner can be controlled independently and rotated ±180 degrees about its axis. This allows for a suite of driving modes allowing MRV to maneuver unlike any traditional vehicle on the road. In addition to conventional front two wheel steering, the back wheels can also articulate allowing for turning radiuses as tight as zero. The driving mode can be switched so that all four wheels point and move in the same direction achieving an omni-directional, crab-like motion. This makes a maneuver such as parallel parking as easy as driving next to an available spot, stopping, and then operating sideways to slip directly in between two cars. 'This two-seater vehicle was designed to meet the growing challenges and demands of urban transportation,' said Mason Markee, also with Johnson. 'The MRV would be ideal for daily transportation in an urban environment with a designed top speed of 70 km/hr and range of 100 km of city driving on a single charge of the battery. 'The size and maneuverability of MRV gives it an advantage in navigating and parking in tight quarters.' With a designed top speed of around 70 km/hr, test driving proved to be a bit of fun. Justin Ridley told an Nasa magazine: 'It's like driving on ice but having complete control. 'It's a blast to ride in and even more fun to drive. We've talked about it being like an amusement park ride. 'The 'fun' of driving was not something we tried to design for, just something that came out of the design. 'Once we got it running many of us commented that we had no idea it was going to be able to do the things it does.' 'This work also allowed us to develop some technologies we felt were needed for our future rovers,' said Ridley. The driver controls MRV with a conventional looking steering wheel and accelerator/brake pedal assembly. The driving mode can be switched so that all four wheels point and move in the same direction - perfect for parallel parking. 'These include redundant by-wire systems, liquid cooling, motor technology, advanced vehicle control algorithms. 'We were able to learn a lot about these and other technologies by building this vehicle.' The buggy can also be controlled remotely, and in the future Nasa says this system can be expanded to allow for autonomous driving. The driver controls MRV with a conventional looking steering wheel and accelerator/brake pedal assembly. Both of these interfaces were specially designed to mimic the feel of the mechanical/hydraulic systems that people are used to feeling when driving their own cars. The buggy can also be controlled remotely, and in the future Nasa says this system can be expanded to allow for autonomous driving. 'While the vehicle as a whole is designed around operating in an urban environment, the core technologies are advancements used in many of our robotic systems and rovers,' said Mason. 'Actuators, motor controllers, sensors, batteries, BMS, component cooling, sealing, and software are all examples of technologies that are being devel oped and tested in MRV that will be used in next generation rover systems. 'The technologies developed in MRV have direct application in future manned vehicles undertaking missions on the surface of Earth's moon, on Mars, or even an asteroid. 'Additionally, MRV provides a platform to learn lessons that could drive the next generation of automobiles.","Modular Robotic Vehicle developed at NASA's Johnson Space Center .

"Hattie Gladwell is just 19 but the teenager has already undergone a terrifying operation which left her with an ostomy bag, which she'll have to wear for the rest of her life. Now the pretty redhead from West Sussex has shared her story with the world in a bid to rid the stigma around those living with a stoma (a surgically created opening in the abdomen) and a bag. Writing on her amusingly frank and startlingly honest blog morethanyourbag.com, Hattie opens up about life after undergoing emergency surgery for ulcerative colitis. Scroll down for video . 19-year-old Hattie Gladwell was fitted with an ostomy bag after under-going surgery for ulcerative colitis, now she shares her experience on her blog morethanyourbag.com . She reveals all about what it's like to wear a bikini for the first time, how to have sex with a bag and how learning to live with it has affected her mental health. Hattie was admitted to hospital on January 26th of this year although she had long suffered from problems with her health after an inflammatory bowel condition was misdiagnosed. She told MailOnline: 'I was sent into hospital with suspected appendicitis, but after two failed colonoscopies, my appendix out and excruciating pain, I finally had emergency surgery for my stoma. 'The cause turned out to be ulcerative colitis but the symptoms had been fobbed off as ""women's troubles"" for years.' Ulcerative colitis is a long term condition where the colon and the rectum become inflamed and things became so bad for Hattie, she had to have her colon removed and an ileostomy bag fitted into her small intestine. She found the change to her body difficult to deal with. She said: 'At first, I was scared I wouldn't be able to live a normal life. I was scared of what people would think, and how I could go on to hide it. Hattie says that her boyfriend has been a great support - on her blog she details how the couple have maintained their sex life with her bag . 'For the first few weeks I was unable to look down at my stomach without wanting to cry. 'At only 19, there is so much pressure to be attractive to society that I wasn't sure I would cope with something that wasn't deemed ""normal"".' The ostomy bag would collect waste from Hattie's body which had been diverted through her stoma. But before long brave Hattie decided that she could not let the operation or her bag ruin her life. She said: 'A couple of weeks after surgery, I decided the worst thing I could do to myself was hide such a traumatic experience. 'My stoma is a part of me now it is what saved my life and I have no reason to be ashamed of that.' Hattie has a stoma (left) through which waste passes from her body into her bag (right) Hattie has opened up about what it was like to wear her bikini again for the first time since she had her bag fitted saying she felt happy to be in the water . She her blog which she explains is, 'a blog for those getting used to life with a stoma.' She said: 'Since speaking out, I have come to terms with my body and the change it has faced. I have become determined to make sure my life doesn't change. And I love it. 'I've never felt more open minded, I've never appreciated life more. My life hasn't changed in the slightest, if anything, I've changed. I've become more confident after choosing to embrace my body. 'I've become more understanding, and now all I want to do is raise awareness for IBD [inflammatory bowel disease] and ostomy.' Hattie revealed that she's had a huge amount of support from her friends and family, especially her mother. She said: 'My mum was pretty much my rock during the whole thing. She spent the first couple of weeks helping me with my bag before I became more independent again. I wouldn't have coped without her.' On her blog Hattie shares her experiences of getting back to normal life with a stoma. Including putting on a bikini for the first time. Since having her bag fitted Hattie has tried to continue her life as normal, pictured here dressed up with a friend for a night out . She revealed: 'Going out in my bikini was a little nerve racking. But although I started off feeling self-conscious I quickly realised that this is the body that I will be living with, and that if I wanted to do things deemed as ""normal"" I needed to get over any flaws I feel are there.' Hattie continued: 'I also needed to forget about what other people may or may not think. Because it's not their opinion that is going to keep me going – it's mine. 'I decided to wear a bikini because I remembered how good I felt wearing it last year - my first ever bikini that I'd had the courage to buy after being so body conscious for so long. 'I remembered how little fear I felt when people looked at me. I didn't want to fall back into that place where I'd hide in my towel as soon as I got out of the water. 'I told myself that my stoma is nothing to be ashamed of. So I wore the bikini that made me feel beautiful last year, and instead of falling two steps back, I moved one step further towards that self esteem I so desperately want to maintain.' Hattie plans to keep her blog going full time and says that she hopes to raise more awareness of people living with an ostomy bag . Hattie shared another photo of herself with her ostomy bag attached to her stomach . Describing the moment she headed for the pool Hattie said: 'I left the changing rooms and walked over to the pool. As my is scar very prominent I was expecting stares and fingers. But my expectations were wrong. 'Nobody stared, nobody pointed. I slowly got into the pool – not wanting to jump in, in case the pressure of the water caused my bag to float away. 'I was able to get into the pool with ease and began swimming. The water felt amazing. I couldn't even feel my bag while in the water. 'It was as if for that amount of time none of this year had happened, no surgery, no stoma, no bag. I was taken back to last year, I felt as if I was back on that same day where I felt absolutely amazing. 'I swam a few lengths before getting out to use the steam room. I was a little breathless as it was the most exercise I'd done in a while.' Hattie also says that her boyfriend Angelo Caponi has been a big part of rebuilding her confidence. She said: 'My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, meeting early 2013. We live together so there's not really much choice but to be open with him about everything. 'Which has actually been great for me as I feel so comfortable with my body around him. Our sex life hasn't changed one bit. 'Of course, the first few weeks we were very cautious and he was a bit wary as he didn't want to hurt me. 'But for me, sex was never an issue. We always had such an active sex life before the surgery and I didn't want that to change.' As for the future Hattie plans to carry on her blog which is sponsored by SecuriCare Medical and clinimed.co.uk, in order to raise awareness and end the stignma around IBD and ostomy.","Hattie Gladwell was fitted with an ileostomy bag in January this year .

"If you're heading to the beach in Oregon this spring, you won't be alone. The sands are awash with thousands of blue jellyfish-like creatures known as velella velella. The small creatures are easily blown to the shores of Oregon, California and Washington during strong winds this time of year thanks to a blue sail on the tops of their bodies. In Oregon, there are more velella velella across beaches than usual, experts say. They are covering beaches including Seaside, Manzanita, Astoria and Rockaway Beach. Incredible: Thousands of velella velella can be seen across Seaside Beach in Oregon after strong winds blew the jellyfish-like creatures onto the shore. Experts say there are more than usual this year . Washed up: They have a small sail on top of their bodies, which means they are easily blown to shore . 'It's probably been 10 years since we've had this many come on the beach,' Keith Chandler of the Seaside Aquarium told KGW. 'These guys are susceptible to the wind and when the wind comes out of the west... they just go with the direction of the wind and that'll put them on the beach.' The small blue sail on their bodies allows them to stay in the sea during normal winds, but they are weak to the strong winds this time of year. But while the creatures, which are also known as 'by-the-wind sailors' or 'purple sails', look strangely beautiful on the beaches, locals have warned admirers that they don't smell as pretty as they look. 'Just so everyone knows, when they start to rot they really stink,' Frank Lehn wrote on the Seaside beach's Facebook page, which shared incredible photos of the creatures. They will smell like fish as they decay and will likely be gone within days, KGW reported. Awash: The creatures are not harmful to humans but will begin to smell fishy as they start to decompose . Beautiful: Thousands of the creatures are washing up across Oregon, California and Washington . Velella velella are not technically jellyfish, but they are closely related to them and are similar to the Man-O-War, although these purple-blue creatures are not harmful to humans. While they do not sting, experts at Oregon State University have warned against walking barefoot through them because they contain a mild neurotoxin, The Oregonian reported. The bodies can pile up as high as six inches, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said. The washed-up creatures have also brought tiny predators, Violet Snails, to the beach, the Beach Connection reported. The snails, which are the size of a thumb nail, feast on the velella velella.","Thousands of the jellyfish-like creatures, known as velella velella, are covering beaches across Oregon, California and Washington .

"Freddo Frog has shrunk from 15g to 12g . Cadbury is cutting the size of its beloved Freddo Frogs by 20 per cent but keeping the recommend retail price the same. The miniature chocolate amphibians, which weighed a plump 20g two years ago - before they dropped to 15g, will now weigh just 12g. The shrinking of one of Australia’s most popular children’s chocolates was not widely announced but was in fact spotted by a shop owner who stocks the treats, the Herald Sun reports. Cadbury’s spokesman Julian Polachek said: ‘We’re making a change to the size of the product because of manufacturing cost increases that we can no longer absorb.’ The Freddo’s downsize is just the latest product to feel the pinch in the declining confectionery world. In February, chocolate lovers expressed their anger after Cadbury announced plans to reduce the size of their family blocks by ‘one row’ in a cost cutting deal. The best-selling blocks dropped from 220 grams to 200 grams. The Australasia managing director for Mondelez International, Cadbury’s parent company, Amanda Banfield told the Financial Review: ‘Clearly any chocolate lover is going to be a bit disappointed.’ Anticipating a backlash, Ms Banfield explained the company had decided the shrink the family block because of ‘unprecedented cost headwinds’. She blamed the increased price of ingredients and rising packaging costs for the change. Cadbury still recommends the blocks are sold for $4.99 – a price which won’t increase or decrease – but Ms Banfield highlighted that shops set the prices that they choose to sell the products at in store. Cadbury's parent company’s profit before tax rose 46 per cent from $87 million to $127 million in 2013. Thousands of angry chocolate fans complained about the change on Cadbury’s Facebook page. Creator of the Freddo Frog, Harry Melbourne, who thought up the idea of the chocolate frog named Freddo when he was an 18-year-old. He died aged 94 in 2007 . Cadbury have reduced the size of their family block of Dairy Milk by one row of chocolate . Tony Abbott carefully pours chocolate into a mould during a visit to the Cadbury chocolate factory in Hobart . Rebecca Isaako wrote: ‘You turned a $127 million dollar profit last financial year. This is complete & utter baloney!’ Kyria Economidis said: ‘What do you take us for? You guys are thieves, you want to cut it down and charge us the same? You are plain greedy.’ ‘Good bye Cadbury it has been a fun ride, but when you make it not worth it and unaffordable and then lie pffft not worth wasting my money how much would it cost to change the size of the chocolate with new moulds smaller packaging lots of money I would assume. I'll just wait for the tim tams to go on sale,’ Kirsty Logan commented. Nestle has sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in a bid to help Australians better manage their health . Cadbury chocolate produced for the Australian market is made in Claremont in Tasmania. A statement on the company’s website read: ‘Confectionery companies around the world are feeling the squeeze of increasing costs. At Cadbury, we’re feeling it too. We’ve reached a point where we can no longer absorb these increasing costs into the price of our chocolate blocks.’ In October last year, Cadbury rival Nestle sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in an apparent bid to help Australians better manage their health. The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm and weighs 24g instead of 47g. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g. The move is part of Nestle's efforts to help Australians improve their health by controlling the amount of food they eat - 'especially treats'. The company said the Killer Pythons still have the same 'recipe, taste and stretchiness' but the new size cuts the lolly's kilojoules from 630 to 336, meaning a 10-year-old can run it off in 30 minutes instead of one hour. Customers have expressed their outrage over the move but Nestle's General Manager of Confectionery, Martin Brown, said it was the 'right thing to do'. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g . The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm . 'I think lollies are just such a fun part of growing up and people have got a lot of passion for them, I really understand that, l used to love eating Killer Pythons as a kid,' Mr Brown told Daily Mail Australia. 'I can understand why there will be some disappointed Python fans, it's a short term sacrifice because it will upset customers and we'll sell less Pythons but it's the right thing to do for ongoing trust. 'This is a really important initiative for a product primarily eaten by kids, getting it at the right portion.' When Red Rock Deli chips dropped 20 grams from their packets the prize remained the same . The company said the new treat size Killer Pythons bags are the same price as the old ones, but have gone up in weight, so customers will be getting more lolly snakes in smaller portion sizes. The recommended retail price on individual Killer Pythons will be halved from $1 to 50 cents. In the past manufacturers have been called out for slashing product sizes while keeping the same packing and price. Red Rock Deli-Style potato chips were shrunk by 20 grams. And Choice spotted Oat Crisp Honey cereal packets were reduced by 14 per cent while maintaining similar packaging and that the price per 100 grams increased by 10 per cent.","Cadbury's Freddo Frogs have decreased from 15g to 12g .

"Enemy drones have become a major threat on the battlefield, and the UU Navy hopes a roof mounted laser could be the answer. Its Ground-Based Air Defense Directed Energy On-the-Move program, commonly referred to as GBAD, allowing controllers to simply drive the weapon to a target. Once drones are spotted, it can them shoot them out of the sky with a high powered laser. Scroll down for video . The system will be able to spot and track drones, then shoot them out of the sky using a 30kw laser. 'We're confident we can bring together all of these pieces in a package that's small enough to be carried on light tactical vehicles and powerful enough to counter these threats,' said Brig. Gen. Kevin Killea, vice chief of naval research and commanding general, the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory. The GBAD system is being designed for use on light tactical vehicles such as the Humvee and Joint Light Tactical Vehicle. The navy hopes the system will provide an affordable alternative to traditional firepower to keep enemy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from tracking and targeting Marines on the ground. 'We can expect that our adversaries will increasingly use UAVs and our expeditionary forces must deal with that rising threat,' said Col. William Zamagni, acting head of ONR's Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and Combating Terrorism Department. Some of the system's components already have been used in tests to detect and track UAVs of all sizes. Later in the year, researchers will test the entire system against targets using a 10kW laser as a stepping stone to a 30kW laser. 'GBAD gives the Marine Corps a capability to counter the UAV threat efficiently, sustainably and organically with austere expeditionary forces. 'GBAD employed in a counter UAV role is just the beginning of its use and opens myriad other possibilities for future expeditionary forces.' Some of the system's components already have been used in tests to detect and track UAVs of all sizes. Later in the year, researchers will test the entire system against targets using a 10kW laser as a stepping stone to a 30kW laser. The 30kW system is expected to be ready for field testing in 2016, when the program will begin more complex trials to ensure a seamless process from detection and tracking to firing, all from mobile tactical vehicles. Spotter vehicles and a control car will allow the system to operate anywhere.","Designed for use on light tactical vehicles such as the Humvee .

"Maths is a subject you either understand and enjoy or struggle through feeling rather bored. But a maths teacher from Biola University in La Mirada, California, may have just created the most interesting lesson ever. Matthew Weathers, who often posts videos of himself tricking his class on his YouTube channel, put in a great deal of planning to pull off a lesson that would  have engaged even the sleepiest student at the back of the room. Matthew Weathers, a teacher at Biola University in California, often posts videos of himself tricking his class . This amusing clip would have engaged even the sleepiest student at the back of the room . Acting inconspicuously, Mr Weathers announces to his class that if they have any trouble with some of the things he has gone over in the lesson, they can look up the answers in one of his many helpful videos. Loading one up on his screen in demonstration, the teacher watches a bit of the video before noticing that the content is backwards and stating that he is embarrassed. After acknowledging his supposed blunder again, the recorded version of Mr Weathers on the video screen suddenly halts his virtual lesson to confront the teacher in the classroom. The two then begin arguing before the virtual teacher states: ‘Oh, I’m embarrassing you, well why don’t you come over here and say that to my face.’ Pretending to question his sanity, the teacher says: ‘Wait, you’re just a video, how could I come over?’ As the virtual teacher begins telling him off, the real teacher leans out and 'pushes' the screen back . The many pupils in the class can then be heard laughing in astonishment as his virtual counterpart begins pushing the side of the screen and shuffling towards the teacher. As the virtual teacher begins telling him off, the real teacher leans out and pushes the screen back to where it was originally. The man in the video stumbles as the pupils laugh hysterically at what they are seeing. Continuing to argue, the pair fight against each other and shove the video box from left to right before the teacher announces that  his counterpart needs sorting out. He then moves the top part of his body behind the large projection screen and miraculously appears on the screen of the computer. The many pupils in the class can then be heard laughing in astonishment during the argument . Fighting against each other some more, the pair then start throwing the computer’s icons from the dashboard at each other – one flying past the virtual screen and into the room. Managing to break free from the box, the virtual teacher turns the tables and 'traps' the real teacher inside, telling him that he is now stuck inside the video. Wearing a baseball cap sideways, the rogue teacher closes the video causing the top-half of the real teacher to disappear before heading over to the legs – that dangle from beneath the screen – and attaching himself to them. The teacher then re-emerges from behind the screen wearing the baseball cap and the class erupt with laughter. The video concludes with the teacher announcing a quiz and the class clapping in admiration.","Matthew Weathers tricked his class at Biola University in California .

"Detectives investigating the cold-case murder of a mother-of-three who was battered to death in her own home in 1995 believe new DNA evidence could help solve the mystery. Janet Brown was found naked, gagged with packing tape with her arms cuffed behind her back at the foot of the stairs of her family home in Radnage, near Chinnor in Buckinghamshire. Mrs Brown's two daughters Roxanne, 38, and Zara, 43, described their hother as a 'kind and loving nurse' claiming the horror of the crime 'stays with us every day. Janet Brown, pictured, was murdered at her family home 20 years ago by an unknown assailant . Builders found Mrs Brown's naked body dumped at the bottom of the stairs of her home, pictured . The killer handcuffed Mrs Brown's hands behind her back hand gagged her with packing tape . Mrs Brown's body was found on April 10, 1995. According to the Brown sisters: 'She was attacked and killed in our family home - a place where we should all be safe.' They said they believed that their mother's murder had been pre-planned. On the night she was killed, Mrs Brown was home alone. Her two daughters and her son Benedict, then 21, had gone out. The following day, the 51-year-old nurse's naked body was found at the foot of the stairs by builders who had turned up to do work on the detached house in Sprigs Holly Lane, Radnage near Chinnor in Buckinghamshire. A post mortem revealed she died of head injuries, which detectives believe were probably inflicted by a blunt instrument like a crowbar. The motive remains unclear with police describing the circumstances of the crime as 'unusual', adding they 'keeping an open mind'. One possible line of inquiry was that it had been a break-in gone wrong, but while a window was broken and the burglar alarm triggered, nothing was taken from the home. There was also no evidence Mrs Brown had been sexually assaulted. Peter Beirne, right, of the cold case squad and Mrs Brown's daughters Roxanne, centre and Zara, right, appealed for information about the 'heinous' crime revealing forensics experts now had the suspect's DNA . There was no evidence of a sexual assault at the crime scene in Radnage in Buckinghamshire, pictured . Members of Mrs Brown's family, pictured, made a similar appeal 20 years ago following her brutal murder . Detectives said that whomever the attacker was had brought the hand-cuffs and tape used to restrain Mrs Brown along with them. Despite what police called a 'thorough and professional investigation' at the time the killer has eluded capture, leaving her broken-hearted family without justice. In a bid to finally find the culprit, detectives turned to modern scientific techniques to analyse clues found at the time. Peter Beirne, the head of Thames Valley Police's major crime investigation review team, revealed a DNA sample belonging to an unknown person had now been successfully extracted. 'These new tests have produced a DNA sample,' he said. 'It does not belong to the family and we believe it could be a vital piece of evidence linking the killer to the scene.' He would not reveal what item the DNA sample was taken from. Police say there are plans to swab a number of people who featured in the original investigation, but stress there were 'no suspects, as such' - there have never been any arrests over the case. Instead, Mr Beirne said he was first appealing to the public to put forward names of anyone they believe may have been involved, who would then be tested. It would then be 'a simple task to either eliminate or implicate people as the source of the DNA', he added. Mr Beirne, a retired veteran police officer with more than 30 years experience as a detective, said if nothing useful comes to light then investigators may then look at 'a potential mass screening' in the area. He said: 'Janet's death left three children without a mother. 'We want to bring justice to Janet's family. 'If people have suspicions, I would urge them to contact police.' Mr Beirne added: 'Somebody out there knows who killed Janet - we're asking them to make contact.' Also appealing to the public, Roxanne Brown said: 'We need your help to find them.' It was revealed had she survived, Mrs Brown would now be a grandmother with detectives saying the youngsters had been robbed of the chance to know her. A £20,000 reward is being offered for information leading to a successful conviction of the killer. Anyone who believes they may have any information about the crime is urged to call the police on 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Cold case detectives have relaunched a murder inquiry 25 years after a man was reported missing by his girlfriend. Andrew Bedford was 27-years-old when he disappeared in 1990. He was last seen eating a takeaway, possibly fish and chips, in a car in Ramsey, Cambridgeshire. The Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit has today issued a fresh appeal for information on what would have been his 52nd birthday. Andrew Bedford was 27 when he went missing from a takeaway in Ramsay, Cambridgeshire in 1990 . Officers say that given the circumstances surrounding his disappearance and the amount of time that has passed, they are now confident he was murdered. They believe he was killed on September 28 with a shotgun at a garage called Mongrel Cars, which no longer exists, in the market town. Detective Inspector Ian Simmons said: 'A team of detectives from the three force Major Investigations Unit is devoted to the cold case and we want to speak to anyone who has any information about Mr Bedford's disappearance and death. 'We would particularly like to speak to people who came forward before but maybe did not tell us everything they knew. 'No unsolved crime is ever closed.

"It may have been Miley Cyrus' pink heart-shaped nipple pasties that garnered all the attention when she paid honour to rocker Joan Jett on Saturday, but eagle-eyed fans were distracted by something else. Savvy social media users noticed that the 22-year-old, who attended the 30th Annual Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony on Saturday in Cleveland, Ohio, had given her razor a night off. Miley, 22, who is known and loved for her controversial sartorial choices, displayed a somewhat bushy underarm region as she posed for a social media snap. Scroll down for video . Miley Cyrus posed for a social media snap ahead of the 30th Annual Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony on Saturday in Cleveland, Ohio... and it appears that she had given her razor a night off . One user, Hayley Mashteare, commented: 'Miley Cyrus doesn't shave her armpits and that worries me', while Gucci Girl said that star's armpit hairs were 'freaking her out'. Jennifer Sidlow chimed in: 'Don't care how feminist/hippy you are, having armpit hair like Miley Cyrus is just no'. One fan account added: 'Armpit hair is disgusting, please shave Miley Cyrus.' Miley Cyrus bares her armpits as she speaks onstage during the 30th Annual Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony at Public Hall on Saturday . Miley's somewhat bushy underarm area caused quite a stir on social media where many users advised Miley to pick up a razor and shave . Some users leapt to her defence, with El adding: 'Why do people even care that Miley Cyrus has armpit hair? Like wow imagine that, a human with hair! How gross!' A lot of users didn't understand why people were 'freaking out' over the singer's armpit hair, with Charlie saying: 'Miley Cyrus' armpit hair isn't ""hideous"", we all see men's armpit hair but that's apparently acceptable because they're men. Please shut up' Of course, loyal fans sprung to her defence. One, named Abi, tweeted: 'Stop telling @MileyCyrus to shave her armpits? She's a woman. She doesn't have to do what you say! There is nothing wrong with body hair.' Stephanie added: 'People are losing their minds over Miley Cyrus not shaving her armpits.. how can hair offend you? It's hair...' El jumped in: 'Why do people even care that Miley Cyrus has armpit hair? Like wow imagine that, a human with hair! How gross!'. Whilst Miley's personal grooming habits caused a social media stir, she isn't the first - and probably won't be the last - to shun her razor in favour of the fuzz.

"It might not sound very romantic. But ditching the idea that we should we should marry for life could help many of us have happier relationships, according to a marriage therapist. A fixed-term Starter Marriage, in which couples sign a renewable contract - known as a 'wedlease'- would work better for many couples, argues Susan Pease Gadoua. A relationship expert has suggested that a renewable marriage contract known as a 'wedlease' would work better for many modern day couples and avoid increasing divorces . In her new book, The New I Do, which was co-written with Vicki Larson, she claims that the traditional marriage model in our modern-day culture 'sets up too many people for failure'. So, instead of promising 'til death do us part', couples in a Starter Marriage agree to be together for 'two, three, four or more years – whatever works for you and your partner'. At the end of the stated contract period, the couple decide whether they want to go their separate ways, or continue with the marriage, at which point they should draw up a revised contract. 'A Starter Marriage is a short-term contract for couples to 'try on' the institution to see if it fits – without bringing children into the mix – before jumping into a life-long contract,' Mrs Pease Gadoua said. 'We have learner's permits for driving, we have internships before starting careers and we have probationary or modifiable contracts in many other business negotiations, yet the greatest and most in-depth legal contract that most of us will ever enter requires that you commit to one person forever with precious little information about what it will entail.' Relationship counsellor Susan Pease Gadoua says that traditional weddings set people up for failure . The Starter Marriage can be an improvement on the traditional marital model because 'each spouse will need to be paying closer attention to his or her actions and stick to what was agreed to, lest his or her partner decides not to renew a few years down the road', the 53 year old claims. And if the couple do decide to part, the separation should be more amicable than other divorces might be and reduce the odds of individuals feeling like they have 'failed', she adds. 'Because a Starter Marriage by its nature avoids the drama that typically goes along with a marital dissolution, you and your former spouse will more likely be able to sit down and compare notes about what worked and what didn't.' If the couple stay together, the new contract could be amended to fit another of the specific marital models that Mrs Pease Gadoua advocates. For example, if they want children, they could sign a 'Parenting Marriage' contract (couples should remain childless while in a Starter Marriage 'because it's a bad idea to 'try on' marriage with young lives in the balance'), with new rules and goals. Or if monogamy proved a challenge during the Starter Marriage, an Open Marriage contract 'might be an attractive option', she said. But Mrs Pease Gadoua, who got married at the age of 43, stresses that the Starter Marriage is not about just marrying anyone for the sake of being married, and it doesn't mean that you should marry in the hope of it ending by a certain time – 'you're just not going to vow 'until death do us part',' she said. Susan's book The New 'I do' explores alternatives to the traditional nuptials . And, the American claims, despite its temporary nature, a Starter Marriage is not the same as cohabiting. Not only does marriage give you more legal and financial protection, couples often have different expectations while living together, and roles can be confused. She also claims friends, families, and society view cohabiters differently, with fewer people regarding them as a family unit when unmarried. Couples can also slide into living together with completely different expectations, she warns. One of the pair may see it as a way of saving on living expenses while the other assumes it's a stepping stone to marriage. A Starter Marriage can 'help couples align expectations, create a plan of what each partner will contribute to the marriage, clarify goals and strategize what will happen if one or both don't want to renew the contract,' she said. A typical contract would cover areas such as finances, sex (amount, and views on monogamy), career priorities, and even how free time should be spent (with specific rules about visiting in-laws). 'If you want to explore what being married is like, living together won't really give you the answer,' she said. 'Having a Starter Marriage with a contract, however, will. 'And it will make you smarter and more prepared for either the renewal of your marital contract or a new marriage with a new partner.' She does admit however, that limited term marriages will be unthinkable for many. 'Marriage should be considered 'successful' by what it has accomplished, not by how long it lasts,' she said. 'If people are going to continue to see marriage that way, then, yes – a renewable contract is going to create quite a bit of angst for many of them.' But Harry Benson, research director at Marriage Foundation, the think-tank which champions marriage, said the idea of a Starter Marriage 'undermines commitment' and reduces it to a 'business contract'. 'The basic premise of commitment is to make a plan for an indefinite future together,' he said. 'Anything less than that is a business contract. 'Without such a clear view of the future, there is no need to sacrifice, to forgive, to prioritise one another, all of which are fundamental characteristics of a successful relationship. 'Most importantly, commitment is about giving up other choices. If I choose you, I have stopped choosing others. 'That unconditional choice sends a signal that provides clarity, intent, and removes ambiguity. 'Setting a time limit utterly undermines commitment and sabotages it from the very beginning. 'All relationships are difficult because all of us are different. 'Even if a little over a third of marriages fail, most last for life. Success stories outside of marriage are the exception. 'The idea of a starter marriage might hold superficial appeal. But it is ultimately doomed to failure because it runs contrary to human nature. 'Everyone wants reliable love. Limited term contracts aren't the way to do it.' Divorces are most likely to occur between the fourth and eight wedding anniversary, with half of all divorces happening in the first 10 years of marriage, according to the Office for National Statistics. If you don't fancy a Starter Marriage, here are some of Mrs Pease Gadoua's other alternatives… . Parenting Marriage: Main aim is to provide a loving, stable home for children. Couple do not have to be in love. Time-limited, in that the couple agree to stay together for a specific period, e.g. until the youngest child has reached 18, or graduated from university. May feel that you have settled, and disappointed about missing out on a passionate, romantic relationship. Living Alone Together Marriage: Offers 'healthy balance between personal fulfilment and intimacy', with each spouse free to pursue own goals and passions. Good for the strongly career-driven or those with children from previous relationship as you don't have the complications of blending a family. May feel lonely or suspicious, and it can be an expensive arrangement. Safety Marriage: Marrying for financial security and a desire to live a lifestyle you are accustomed to, or aspire to. One spouse is financially secure and the other has something else to bring to the table like sex, or an ability to caretake. Might create a power imbalance, and you might face judgment from others. Open Marriage: Get to sleep with other people while maintaining an intimate relationship. If differing sex drives, can both feel satisfied. May feel jealous or shameful and insecure. Partner may become emotionally attached to someone else.","Susan Pease Gadoua says traditional marriages set couples up to fail .

"A Colorado wastewater facility went up in flames on Friday after a fracking tanker was hit by lightning, setting off a series of explosions and oil fires. Dale Lyman, a spokesman for the Greeley Fire Department, says firefighters were called to the site northeast of Greeley airport shortly after 1 p.m. They are working with NGL Energy Partners, the company that owns the site, but had to wait for the explosion risk to subside so they could use fire suppression foam to extinguish the fire, Lyman told The Greeley Tribune. Nearby homes were evacuated, however no injuries were reported. The fire began when lightning struck a water storage tank, launching it into the air. It landed 60 feet from the site. The water contained traces of hydrocarbons and petroleum as a result of hydraulic fracturing, which ignited, Fox 31 reported. The tanker  was near an injection well where fracking wastewater is pumped into the ground. Scroll down for video . Boom: A tanker carrying fracking wastewater - which contains traces of gas and petroleum - exploding at a facility in Greeley, Colorado, on Friday, after being struck by lightning in a storm. No one was injured, but the facility has likely been destroyed . Fire melts the cab of a truck as the blaze continues at a waste water storage area on Friday, April 17, 2015 near the Greeley-Weld Airport . Launched: An oil and gas wastewater tank soars through the air after an explosion at the NGL Energy Partners facility Friday . Plume: Smoke rises as a fire spreads at a waste water storage area on Friday near the Greeley-Weld Airport outside of Greeley . The area was linked to earthquakes near Greeley in May and June last year. The site is located near the intersection of Weld County Road 47 and Weld County Road 64, just northeast of the Greeley Airport. The suppression foam that used to extinguish the flames is for fighting liquid fire l and cuts off the fire’s oxygen supply and cools it down, Lyman said. NGL Energy Partners have several similar facilites across the country. The company's vice president, Doug White, said they had the incident under control. 'It was quite a lightning storm that was moving through here,' White told The Greeley Tribune. Explosion: Flames erupted about 1 p.m. at the site located near the intersection of Weld County Road 47 and Weld County Road 64, just northeast of the Greeley Airport in Colorado . Fracking site: The fire was near an injection well where hydraulic fracturing wastewater is pumped into the ground . Burning for hours: Firefighters had no choice but to sit back and wait for some of the fires to subside, because they were ignited by oil . Greeley added: “We’ve had it happen in Texas, several times, actually. 'That’s a part of the business.' While some local reports have suggested the facility was completely destroyed in the fire, White played down such talk. 'We don’t know the amount of damage,' he said. We’re still assessing the situation.' In a statement, company officials also vowed to participate fully in the investigation. Colorado wasn't the only party of the country battered by severe weather this weekend - or the only place a tanker exploded. Karnes County Sheriff Dwayne Villanueva blamed lightning for an explosion Friday at an oil tank in Karnes City, south of San Antonio, sending flames more than 100 feet into the air. Storms featuring high winds, hail and at least one report of a tornado swept through an area stretching from southern Texas to parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and central Nebraska on Saturday, and more were forecast later in the evening. Heavily populated areas with the highest risk of storms are San Antonio, Oklahoma City and Norman, Oklahoma, according to the National Weather Service. Most of North Texas, including Dallas-Fort Worth, was placed under a severe thunderstorm warning  until 1am Sunday.

The storm threatened the the Academy of Country Music’s Party for a Cause festival at Globe Life Park, Arlington,which was expected to be canceled. Fans were just asked to move indoors and take cover as the start of the festival was delayed. Reports of hail, some of up to quarter-size, were widespread Saturday afternoon along a line from central Nebraska through the plains of western Oklahoma and to the rolling plains of North Texas and Central Texas plateaus. One unconfirmed report of a tornado was received from the public in an unpopulated area of remote Edwards Plateau country, about 110 miles northwest of San Antonio. No damage or injuries were reported. The storms developed a day after at least five firefighters were hurt on Friday when their truck overturned on a rain-slick rural road in Central Texas and hit a tree. Severe weather: Intense rains came down hard and fast in Houston, Texas on Friday night, leading to flash flooding in the area . Underwater: Houston was hit with rainfall rates of 2-3 inches an hour, according to Weather Channel forecaster Michael Palmer .

The crews were responding to an initial accident after a vehicle hydroplaned on the wet road and collided with another. In Houston, some creeks and bayous filled to their banks and drivers in found water reaching nearly to car bumpers. The weather service reported Saturday that rain gauges at Reliant Park, the complex that includes the NFL Houston Texans football stadium, registered 5.32 inches over the previous 24 hours. Other readings topping 4 inches were common in parts of Houston. A storm system will produce a chance of showers and thunderstorms from the Upper Midwest to the Southeast. The northern and central Rockies will have a chance of rain and snow showers. The West Coast should be mainly dry.

"Photos marking the 50th anniversary of New York City's Landmarks Law look at the devastating architectural losses that led up to the law and how it has helped preserve beautiful old buildings as new construction sprouts up around them. Saving Place, which opens Tuesday at the Museum of the City of New York, highlights what is widely seen as a watershed moment in the city's preservation movement, the 1963 demolition of the old Beaux Arts-style Pennsylvania Station to make way for Madison Square Garden. 'Nobody really believed that a building of such civic importance would be demolished,' said Meenakshi Srinivasan, an architect and chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. 'It really created the coalescing of all factors to come together to save buildings important to New York City's identity.' Scroll down for video . A new exhibition from the Museum of the City of New York shows the former landmarks that were destroyed before they could be preserved by the city's Landmark Law, which turns 50 on Sunday. Above, the beautiful Pennsylvania Station before its 1963 destruction . The loss of the old Penn Station, which was replaced by Madison Square Garden, helped lead to the establishment of a commission that can designate historic places as landmarks and prevent them being demolished . The metal pillars of the old Pennsylvania station stand before bulldozers during its demolition. A new exhibition looks at the lead up to the preservation measures . The ornate sculptures and elaborately designed fixtures of the former Pennsylvania station lie in a heap of rubble to make way for a basketball arena and concert venue . St John's Chapel, which was built in the area now called Soho in 1807, was demolished in 1918 as the city moved to widen the street next to it . The law was signed by Mayor Robert Wagner on April 19, 1965, and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1978 following a campaign led by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to save another iconic railroad station — Grand Central. The Landmarks Preservation Commission was given a mandate to preserve buildings and places of cultural, architectural and historical significance. Owners of properties given the designation must get permits from the commission before making restorations, alterations or additions, though some still say that the agency does not have the funds it needs to look at and preserve all worthy sites as the city builds to ease an affordable housing crisis. The Randall Memorial Church (left) in Snug Harbor, Staten Island, fell into disrepair and was demolished by 1952. The Snug Harbor Music Hall (right) and other buildings in area built in the 1890s have been preserved by the city and still stand today . The City Hall Post Office, designed by A B Mullet on City Hall Park, was widely criticized as 'Mullet's monstrosity' after it opened in 1880 and was torn down in the late 1930s . The Ziegfield Theatre, one of early 20th century New York's movie palaces after it was built in 1927 (left), was torn down in 1966 to make way for an office building. The theatre later reopened nearby and still hosts film premiers, but lacks its former distinctive architecture . The TWA Flight Center (pictured in 1978) at John F Kennedy Airport is on the list of historic and culturally significant sites protected by New York City's Landmarks Law. Both its exterior and interior, designed by Eero Saarinen in the 1960s, are preserved . The Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House, which was built in 1652 and is the oldest building in New York state, was designated a historic landmark in 1968, preventing its demolition for street improvements . In its first five years, it designated 300 to 400 buildings, over a dozen historic districts and reviewed 800 applications. Today the commission's work is increasingly bigger. Over the last five years alone, it reviewed nearly 67,000 applications. Famous buildings given such designation include Radio City Music Hall, St. Bartholomew's Church, Federal Hall, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the New York Stock Exchange, Coney Island's Parachute Jump, and the Alice Austen House on Staten Island. Historic districts such as those in Greenwich Village and Brooklyn Heights make up the majority of the 33,000 properties with landmark status. The NYC Landmarks50 Alliance said there are 1,400 individual landmarks in the five boroughs in addition to interior landmarks and ten scenic landmarks at popular parks. The exhibition traces the trajectory of the preservation movement in New York City, from the end of the 19th century up to the present day. Carnegie Hall in Midtown was opened in 1891 after being financed by 19th century industrialist Andrew Carnegie. It still regularly holds concerts in the present day (right, in 2007) New York City's Landmarks Law has protected a large number of buildings in central and southern Manhattan, though it is also used to protect 19th century homes in Washington Heights (pictured) and historic places in the outer boroughs . The Unisphere in Flushing Meadows Park, Queens, was built for the 1964-1965 World's Fair by the US Steel Corporation as a symbol of world peace. It is protected by the  Landmarks Law . Documents, photos, models and drawings also are used to chronicle the landmarks' development and the losses of important structures in the 1950s and 1960s. Fragments from the destroyed Penn Station and other buildings also are on display. 'The goal of the exhibition is to show the preservation movement in a contemporary slant and its relevance today,' said Donald Albrecht, the museum's curator. Landmarking has never been about freezing the city or making the city into a museum, said Andrew Dolkart, exhibition co-curator and director of the historic preservation program at Columbia University. Rather, as the exhibition shows, preservation allows for both lively new architecture and saving the past for future generations. New York's Grand Central Terminal and its Main Waiting Room was at one point slated to be destroyed to make way for an office building before a campaign by former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis . The statue of George Washington on the steps of Federal Hall faces the facade of the New York Stock Exchange. Both buildings are  protected by the city's Landmarks Law .

"Controversial bookmakers Paddy Power have provoked outrage with a 'joke' about the African-American police beatings. In a tweet published ahead of Liverpool's clash against Newcastle tonight, the bookmakers appeared to make light of the issue in the wake of a succession of stories in the US regarding police shootings on African-Americans. On the Paddy Power Offers page, a tweet was published that read: 'Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male'. It was accompanied by a smirking picture of Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers and has resulted in a furious backlash on social media. Controversy: Paddy Power appeared to make a joke about the recent police shootings on African-Americans . One said: 'This is the most disgusting tweet I've read in probably my entire time on Twitter.' She added: 'How dare you make the execution of Black men in America the butt of your jokes'. Another quipped: 'What's funny? Black people being killed? Explain yourself.' Others lined up to condemn the bookmakers describing the tweet as 'deplorable', 'unbelievable', 'horrible' and 'disgusting'. Last week, white South Carolina police officer Michael Slager was charged with the murder of Walter Scott, a black man, who was filmed running away from the officer. Mourners at Mr Scott's funeral service were told by the pastor that his death was the result of 'overt 'racism'. This is not the first time Paddy Power - who employs Harriet Harman's son, Harry Dromey as its 'Mischief Champion' - has courted controversy. Paddy Power's controversial advert about the outcome of the Oscar Pistorius murder trial was the most complained about advertisement in Britain last year. It offered 'money back if he walks' for punters betting on the outcome of the trial. After receiving 5,525 complaints, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) pulled the advert on the grounds it trivialised 'the issues surrounding a murder trial, the death of a woman and disability.' Pistorius was last year jailed for five years for killing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, although he could be released this year. Criticism: Paddy Power's controversial advert about the outcome of the Oscar Pistorius murder trial was the most complained about advertisement in Britain last year . Earlier this year, the bookmakers attracted criticism for an advertising campaign poking fun at foreign owners of British football clubs by featuring a team of players wearing Middle Eastern robes. In the past, it has been derided for an advert showing a cat being kicked into a tree by a blind footballer. It was the most complained about advert of 2010, but was cleared by the ASA and did not face a ban. Paddy Power also created 2002's most complained-about advert, with a campaign that placed odds on two elderly women making it across the road safely. On that occasion, it was banned by the ASA. Last year, the bookmakers sponsored US basketball star Dennis Rodman to make a controversial trip to North Korea to hand over gifts to Kim Jong-un. This included an Irish Whiskey set - reportedly worth thousands of pounds - which was given as a birthday present for the North Korea dictator, . In response to the latest furore, a spokesman for Paddy Power said: 'It's clearly an acerbic reference to recent police activity in the US. And obviously, no offence was meant.'","Paddy Power said on its Twitter page: 'Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male'

Off-stage drama: Justin Bieber was reportedly put in a chokehold by security and booted out of the Coachella music festival on Sunday after trying to gain entry to Drake's gig, pictured here at the event on Friday . The drama unfurled on Sunday night when the Canadian pop star and his entourage tried to gain entry to Drake's gig. They showed they had proper wristbands, but were told by bouncers that the area was at capacity, according to the report. Eyewitnesses told TMZ that Bieber argued with security and said he couldn't stand in a huge crowd without being swamped by fans but security told him to leave.

Chokehold: The scuffle between security and Bieber was caught on camera by a festival go-er . Bieber insisted that he was personally invited by Drake, had been waiting to see him perform and angered security by standing his ground, according to the article. A staffer at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival at that point came up to Bieber and said she would escort him inside the artist's area. What he missed: Drake performed with Madonna, seen here wiping his mouth after she surprised him with an onstage kiss . She grabbed Bieber by the arm and was walking the singer and his bodyguards inside, when festival security came up from behind and allegedly put Bieber in a chokehold. Bieber's team tangled with security and the singer was then ordered to leave the festival.

"Staff attorneys at the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division are nearing a recommendation to block Comcast Corps. $45.2 billion proposal to merge with Time Warner Cable Inc., Bloomberg Business reports. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports that attorneys investigating the proposal are concerned that such a merger would harm consumers and they may submit their review against the merger as early as next week. The final decision will be made by senior officials. Block: Staff attorneys at the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division are nearing a recommendation to block Comcast Corps. $45.2 billion proposal to merge with Time Warner Cable Inc. (stock image) As reports surface that the multi-billion-dollar deal may be blocked, a spokesman for TWC questioned the reports and told Reuters that the company has been working productively with both the DOJ and the Federal Communications Commission. 'We've had no indication from the DOJ that [the report] is true,' the spokesman said. The proposed collaboration of the two cable television companies, which have both suffered drops in shares recently, drew criticism from Comcast competitors and groups that oppose media consolidation, according to CNN Money. On Schedule: Just two months ago, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts told Wall street analysts that officials are excited about the merger and the planning for regulatory approval was on schedule . The merger has been under extreme scrutiny since it was announced last February. If the deal is successful, Comcast would become the nation's leading cable and internet provider. And competitors fear that the deal would allow the company to unilaterally set programming prices for the entire industry, the LA Times reports. Just two months ago, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts told Wall street analysts that officials are excited about the merger and the planning for regulatory approval was on schedule, according to the LA Times. However, a Comcast spokeswoman told CNN that the merger would result in 'significant consumer benefits.' 'These benefits have been essentially unchallenged in the record -- and all can be achieved without any reduction of competition,' she added. 'As a result, there is no basis for a lawsuit to block the transaction.' Productively: A spokesman for TWC questioned the recent reports saying that the company has been working productively with both the DOJ and the Federal Communications Commission . Time Warner Cable: Photographed is Time Warner Cable Inc. CEO Robert Marcus, who has held the position since January 2014 . On Friday, a group of companies, public interest groups, and associations wrote a letter to FCC Chair Tom Wheeler opposing the deal that would combine the nation's biggest and second biggest cable television operators. 'The combined company would, among other things: control over half of the high-speed residential broadband connections in the United States; dominate pay-TV across the nation; combine even stronger distribution muscle with NBC-Universal's 'must-have' video programming; and control critical advertising and set top-box inputs,' the letter stated according to Reuters. '... the Commission should reject this merger because it would result in too much power in the hands of one company.'","Attorneys at the U.S. Justice Department may reportedly block Comcast Corps. $45.2 billion proposal to merge with Time Warner Cable Inc.

"An eighth-grader accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed should remain in an adult jail while awaiting trial, a prosecutor said. Defense attorney John Waldron had filed a petition to have 14-year-old Jamie Silvonek returned to the juvenile facility where she was sent the day after the body of 54-year-old Cheryl Silvonek was discovered last month. Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said Friday he will oppose the petition and Waldron's request to move the case to juvenile court, The Morning Call reported. Adult jail: Jamie Silvonek, the eighth-grader accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed should remain in an adult jail while awaiting trial, a prosecutor said . The teenager is charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy. Her boyfriend, 20-year-old Caleb Barnes, who is from El Paso, Texas, but was stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland, is charged with homicide. Cheryl Silvonek's body was found stabbed in a shallow grave about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia. Jamie Silvonek was sent to the county jail this month after she was charged as an adult and is in the women's housing unit, away from older inmates, county officials said. Authorities said Barnes and the teenager met in October, when she was 13, but she told him she was 17. The teen's mother found out about their relationship in early March and ordered them to end it. A day later, the teen told Barnes in a text message, 'I want her gone,' police said. Waldron, however, has said that because of the age difference he believes the teen must have been under 'some type of duress or coercion.' He said his client 'cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom' and she feared for her life and that of her father. Barnes' public defender hasn't returned a phone message seeking comment. Accused of murder: 14-year-old Jamie Silvonek allegedly conspired to kill her mother Cheryl Silvonek with her 20-year-old boyfriend 'because she disapproved of their relationship' Barnes, who was on leave from Fort Meade in Maryland at the time of the slaying, was previously charged with homicide. He confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, given the age disparity. 'There has to be some type of duress or coercion,' he said. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. Feared for her life: Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life . Authorities said Barnes and Jamie Silvonek met in October — when she was 13 — but that she told him she was 17. He joined the military in February of 2012. Barnes graduated advanced training from the Presidio of Monterey, California, and his awards include the Good Conduct Medal and National Defense Service Medal, Army Times reported. Cheryl Silvonek found out about their relationship in early March and ordered the couple to break up, according to court documents. A day later, the teenager told Barnes she wanted her parents dead, the documents said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. Dead: Cheryl Silvonek was allegedly stabbed to death by her daughter's much older boyfriend . 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. 'I can't stand her lying to you like this,' Jamie wrote to Barnes. 'SHE IS LYING ABOUT MY AGE,' reported Lehigh Valley Live. Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. The 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension.","A prosecutor said that Jamie Silvonek, 14, accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend to kill her mom should remain in an adult jail .

"A doctor usually deployed to major disaster zones was sent in to a hospital's under-pressure A&E department as staff were forced to treat patients in the corridor, it has emerged. The medical incident officer joined the team caring for patients at Worcestershire Royal Hospital last Friday. It came as the West Midlands Ambulance Service demanded action following delays in treatment. The Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust admitted circumstances were 'less than ideal'. A medical incident doctor, usually deployed to major disaster zones, was sent to help staff at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital's under-pressure A&E department, it has emerged . It came as the weekly national figures from NHS England showed it has missed the four-hour waiting time target for the 28th consecutive week, despite a slight improvement. The proportion of patients seen within the Government maximum of four hours at A&E departments in England is below the target of 95 per cent again - they have not been met since September 28. NHS England said 92.5 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge in the week ending April 12. This was a slight improvement on the previous week, when it was 92.4 per cent. The figures include data from last Friday, April 10, where the MIO was sent in to help at Worcestershire Royal Hospital after months of problems. A Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust spokesman apologised for last Friday's incident, and said it was 'working very hard' to prevent it from happening again. An A&E consultant at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital was one of five senior doctors who resigned from their jobs amid the crisis affecting emergency departments at two hospitals. In February four consultants from the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch quit their roles, on the same day as their colleague at the Worcestershire Royal. It left Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust with the task of filling five vacancies in a matter of months as the doctors work their notice periods. In a damning open letter to the trust, four of the consultants branded the NHS trust a 'disgrace' and claimed they had been put under 'unbearable stress'. The 1,700 word letter, signed by Richard Morrell, Sarah Crawford, Christopher Hetherington and David Gemmell, said: 'The trust appears to tolerate massive overcrowding in the county's A&E departments. 'This is a disgrace and a patient safety issue which causes serious harm to many patients and intolerable stress on all A&E staff. 'The situation has taken a heavy toll on our personal and family lives - the stress has been unbearable at times. 'We are battle-weary and exhausted by the continuous pressure that we have been under.' The trust spokesman said: 'We can confirm that on Friday April 10, West Midlands Ambulance paramedics were asked to look after a number of patients in the corridor before they could be transferred in to the care of the A&E staff. 'While the A&E department were unable to allow the ambulance staff to hand over the patients, the A&E staff were aware of their conditions and we wish to assure people that no patients came to any harm.' The spokesman said the medical incident officer was brought in after concerns were raised by the West Midlands Ambulance Service. The spokesman added: 'Both the hospital and ambulance service are working under extreme pressures at the moment, due to a number of external factors. 'Regretfully these pressures have meant some patients being treated in less than ideal conditions and we accept this is not good enough and are working very hard to put this right. 'We are sorry for any distress caused to patients and their families. 'We now need to work together with the ambulance service and other partners to sort the situation out as soon as possible.' Ray Salmon, regional organiser for Unison, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the incident was not 'a new problem' and had 'been building up over a period of months'. He described the situation as 'completely unprecedented', and that the union members were 'furious'. He said: 'One of our reps went public just after Christmas and blew the whistle about the problems and the trust tried to exclude him from the premises, we had a massive argument about that and I reckon that since then the problem is getting even worse. 'Then last week when the ambulance service had to bring in their own doctor, well that was actually just completely unprecedented, it's really winding people up.' The trust said no patients came to any harm during last Friday's incident, but Mr Salmon said the situation was starting to affect patient care. The move came as staff were forced to treat patients in the hospital's corridors. (File image posed by model) He said: 'It's a combination of bad planning and it's also a combination of under-resourcing. 'We've been saying for years the Government hasn't put enough money in to the NHS. 'You listen to the politicians at the moment and the gloating about what a great job they've done over the last five years, and they're talking about what they're going to do over the next five years. 'But the situation is at the moment there's just not enough resources gone in, there's not enough staff, and that's affecting patients, it's totally unacceptable.' According to today's NHS waiting times figures, there were 443,274 attendances in A&E for the seven-day period, up slightly on the previous week when it was 441,099. The number of people waiting for more than four hours was 7,434 - slightly lower than 7,459 a week earlier. Similarly, the number of people waiting for more than 12 hours was 15 - down from 22 the previous week. Emergency admissions were 102,163, compared with 106,160 the previous week.","Medical incident officer sent to help at Worcestershire Royal Hospital .

"Freckly-faced carrot tops once mocked for their distinctive hair are flourishing into flame-haired sex symbols as the redhead takes the celebrity world by storm. From Hollywood starlets and musical sex symbols to a certain member of the royal family, according to copper-locked actor Damian Lewis, his hair colour is having a moment on screens both big and small. Whether their rouge colouring is au naturel or straight out of a packet, we're loving the fiery-haired stars flying the flag for gingers everywhere. Scroll down for video . 'This might be a unique moment in recent history: redheads everywhere are doing well,' said Damian Lewis . The Wolf Hall star told The Sunday Times Magazine: 'The redhead stock is very high at the moment. 'This might be a unique moment in recent history: redheads everywhere are doing well - Prince Harry, Ed Sheeran, Julianne Moore, me, Lily Cole.' In truth, many of us have nurtured secret crushes on those with bold barnets for years, with Prince Harry transforming from a cute ginger kid  into a bone-fide hot-haired hunk before the nation's eyes. Then there's our admiration for the eternal glamour of Julianne Moore, who has been lighting up our screens with her lioness's mane since the 1990s. The 54-year-old has embraced her natural colour and hopes to help young reds to do the same. She even penned a bestselling children's book Freckleface Strawberry, about a young redhead girl finding confidence in a world full of blondes and brunettes. Prince Harry transformed from a cute ginger kid into a bona fide hot-haired hunk before the nation's eyes . Julianne Moore has embraced her natural colour and hopes to help young reds to do the same . For others, the love of red locks stormed its way into their hearts and hair salons thanks to the fiery females in Game of Thrones. Sansa Stark and Ygritte rock luminous-looking locks with porcelain skin, while auburn-haired Melisandre - aka The Red Woman - seduces would-be kings, turning them into putty in her hands. Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark, is in fact a natural blonde, which is what makes her red such a vibrant shade of copper. Turner has said her dyed locks are what get her recognised, and so when she's not filming for GoT, she goes back to her natural colour. Perhaps the first moment you felt a weakness for a man with a mop of auburn curls was when Eddie Redmayne let out that adorable squeak during his Oscar performance. In truth, he's only borderline ginger, with his red hue and freckles hibernating in winter. Not that Eddie would know - he's colour blind, so can't distinguish between red and green. Eddie Redmayne is actually colour blind, so is unable to see how gorgeous his red locks are . Of course we can't talk about sexy gingers without mentioning man of the musical moment, Ed Sheeran. His tattoos may look as if they've been drawn in Crayola, but his carroty mop top and ginger stubble do nothing to quash our daydreams of being the woman in his 'Thinking Out Loud' music video. Or, even better, the woman the song is about. And this singer/songwriter has revealed he doesn't plan on changing his look anytime soon. Although the reasoning behind this is more to do with his need to cover his 'non-existent' eyebrows. 'They have no definition so I just end up looking like a big white blob,' he joked to The Express. Ed Sheeran uses his red mop to cover up his 'non-existent' eyebrows. 'They have no definition so I just end up looking like a big white blob,' he joked . Arguably, though, when it comes to rocking the red, the Irish have it, as proved by the oh-so-cute Domhnall Gleeson. Inheriting his vibrant hair colour from his actor father Harry Potter star Brendan Gleeson, Dom has exchanged his dad's brutish bushy ginger beard for a tousled mop of strawberry-blond locks. He played the leading man opposite Rachel McAdams in About Time, and while he might not be Ryan Gosling (who is?), he captured our ginger-loving hearts. Domhnall Gleeson captured our ginger-loving hearts in About Time, opposite Rachel McAdams . Christina Hendricks has recently changed her crimson colour as she says goodbye to her Mad Men character . Back to the ladies, ever since Christina Hendricks strutted onto our screens in Mad Men we've had a serious case of the green-eyed monster over her hourglass curves and sophisticated strawberry waves. (It's lucky, then, that green eyes suit red hair perfectly.) But, as she bid farewell to Joan, her Mad Men character, she also bid goodbye to her ruby-red locks, trading them for a golden blonde. She's said that it was to represent her fresh start, but we suspect it may also have something to do with her being the face of Nice N Easy hair dye... Flame-haired actress Jessica Chastain is another red dipping her toe into blonde waters, as she will transform her red hair to play perhaps the most iconic blonde of all time, 1950s bombshell, Marilyn Monroe. She'll also be following in the footsteps of Amy Adams, who temporarily swapped her amber aura for a platinum 'do to play painter Margaret Keane in Big Eyes. Another actress who reached for the dye for a role is Emma Stone, who went blonde for her role as Gwen Stacey in the Spider-Man movies. She actually claims to be a natural blonde, but we refuse to believe her as she was clearly born to be red. Jessica Chastain will transform her hair to play perhaps the most iconic blonde of all time, Marilyn Monroe . Emma Stone claims to be a natural blonde, but we refuse to believe her as she was clearly born to be red . Isla Fisher bucked the blonde beach waves trend from her home country of Australia, swapping them for loose auburn curls. The actress, who is married to Sacha  Baron Cohen (aka, Ali G), has said that she likes the fact her hair makes her look different to most, but admitted she got more attention when she lightened her locks for her role as Mary Jane in 2002's Scooby-Doo. Back in 2002, Nicola Roberts made it cool to be crimson when she was selected to be a member of Girls Aloud, a girl band created on Popstars: The Rivals. Aussie Isla Fisher swapped the blonde beach waves trend from her home country for loose auburn curls . Cheryl may have hogged the spotlight, but we've always admired Nicola's doll-with-an-attitude look; her pale skin setting off her vibrant hair perfectly. Keeping on the doll theme, Lily Cole reminds us of a red-headed rag doll we had as a child - in a good way, of course. Her pale cheeks and big blue eyes offset the model's red mane perfectly, making her stand out in a world of blondes and brunettes. Indeed, this glamorous lot go to show gingers should be proud of their out-of-the-ordinary locks. Suddenly our shade seems rather dull... excuse us, we're off to call our hairdressers.","Wolf Hall actor Damian Lewis said redheads' 'stock is high'

"It was the most heartbreaking tragedy of the floods that wreaked havoc around Britain last year. Little Zane Gbangbola died at home – in the middle of the night – after being poisoned by gas. For months after his death, police and other official agencies ruled out fears that the deadly fumes had come from a nearby landfill site. Instead, they insisted carbon monoxide from a faulty pump hired by his family had caused his death. But now The Mail on Sunday can reveal the damning evidence that proves the authorities have known for 14 months that hydrogen cyanide gas capable of killing Zane had leaked into the family's home as it was engulfed by floodwater. Scroll down for video . Little Zane Gbangbola (pictured) died at home – in the middle of the night – after being poisoned by gas which authorities claimed was from a faulty pump at his house . But damning new evidence proves the authorities knew for 14 months that hydrogen cyanide gas capable of killing Zane had leaked into the family's home (pictured) as it was engulfed by floodwater . The leaked official records reveal for the first time: . Last night, claims of a cover-up over Zane's death by police, the Environment Agency, Public Health England and local authorities intensified when the documents uncovered by the MoS also revealed no traces of carbon monoxide had been detected at the home in Chertsey, Surrey. The witness statements, marked restricted and confidential, were provided to police by senior fire officers the day after they attended the scene of the tragedy on February 8 last year. But Zane's grieving parents Kye and Nicole Gbangbola have faced a 'wall of silence', leading to claims of a cover-up while public agencies repeatedly insisted the boy died from carbon monoxide poisoning and that there was no risk to the wider public. Local residents accused the authorities of lying and putting lives at risk. The Gbangbolas' neighbour, Paul Marsden, 53, said last night: 'It is a disgrace that the authorities have not warned people about the dangers lurking in this land near our homes. Dr Ivan Vince, an expert in landfill gases, said last night that it was possible the cyanide gas had leached from a nearby landfill site (pictured) 'They are hoping it will go away – but it won't. It should not have taken the loss of a young life for this to come to light. Continuing to lie to people about what is there is putting other lives at risk. 'We have said all along that they found hydrogen cyanide at Kye and Nicole's house and here is the proof.' Just hours after the tragedy, despite the fact that police were in constant communication with fire chiefs, Surrey Police Chief Superintendent Dave Miller declared that landfill gases were 'not one of our lines of inquiry' into Zane's death. The force spent the next 11 months investigating carbon monoxide poisoning as the cause, before dropping its case in January on advice from the Crown Prosecution Service that there was no case to answer in relation to a hired petrol-powered pump in the family's home which they insist was never switched on. Nicole and Kye Gbangbola also needed hospital treatment because of hydrogen cyanide exposure on the night of their son's death. For months after his death, police and other official agencies ruled out fears that the deadly fumes had come from a nearby landfill site . Kye, 48, has been permanently paralysed from the waist down because of the gas, which was used to murder millions in the Nazi death camps. The couple have struggled for answers from the police, Environment Agency, Public Health England and councils ever since – and are still waiting for a coroner's inquest to be held because of the delays caused by the long-running police investigation. The Mail on Sunday has led the way in covering the tragic case – but has been stonewalled at every turn. Now this newspaper has seen leaked statements from police interviews with senior firefighters who were among the first of dozens of emergency personnel on the scene when Zane was rushed to hospital. The highly experienced officers serve with Surrey Fire and Rescue Service's Detection Identification and Monitoring team, which is called in to investigate gases. A commanding officer's statement to police says: 'As we were about to leave the premises, one of the gas detectors went into an amber alarm indicating hydrogen cyanide had been detected at levels of ten parts per million. We left immediately.' The officer says the level of gas in the house is considered dangerous if inhaled for more than 15 minutes. An immediately fatal concentration is 50 parts per million. Fire crews fled the riverside home in Chertsey, Surrey (pictured) for their own safety after their specialist gas detectors sounded the alarm for dangerous levels of hydrogen cyanide . The reading was taken at 7.29am – four hours after Zane's mother found him unconscious in a bedroom above the hallway and rang 999. After Zane was found, emergency services had opened doors and windows to ventilate the property for several hours. The firefighters double-checked their equipment and re-entered the house on two more occasions to confirm that hydrogen cyanide was in the property at 'concentrated levels', according to their incident log. It records the gas being detected at 7.47am and 8.19am. Neighbour Mr Marsden recalled seeing the firefighters 'ducking in and out of the house in breathing apparatus.' He said: 'The fire chief said to me there was hydrogen cyanide. I asked if it was ground gases and he said that was right and everyone will have to go to hospital.' Another statement seen by this newspaper says the gas detectors used by the fire service had been tested and certified as working correctly four days before Zane's death. The Gbangbolas said last night that they could not comment on the fire service documents for legal reasons ahead of Zane's inquest, due to be held later this year. A close family friend said: 'The truth is out – they have been gassed. Kye and Nicole are very angry.' Dr Ivan Vince, an expert in landfill gases, said last night that it was possible the cyanide gas had leached from the landfill site. He added: 'If this was an old unregulated tip, it could well be that cyanides were dumped many years ago. If there is acid spilt at the site, and then the water came out due to the flooding, then that would bring acid to the cyanide and release hydrogen cyanide.' This newspaper asked Surrey Police why the force had not disclosed that it knew hydrogen cyanide had been detected in the family's home hours after Zane had died. We also asked why the force spent 11 months investigating the carbon monoxide theory. A spokesman did not answer those questions but said in a statement: 'In February 2014, the post mortem examination into Zane's death proved inconclusive. 'Further thorough and extensive tests were completed. The pathologist gave a result of carbon monoxide intoxication.' The police, Environment Agency, Public Health England, Surrey Fire Service, Surrey County Council and Spelthorne Borough Council all said they could not comment in detail ahead of the coroner's inquest. A spokeswoman for Spelthorne council said: 'We are aware it is the family's belief that there is a link between the landfill close to their home and the tragic death of their son. 'However, based on current information, we do not believe there is any evidence of a causal link.'","Zane Gbangbola died at home in the middle of the night after gas poisoning .

"Children who experience stressful events such as a death or illness in the family, divorce or separation, could be three times more likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Swedish scientists analysed more than 10,000 families with children aged two to 14 who did not have the condition, looking at whether there was any family conflict, a change of family structure, interventions from social services or unemployment. Subsequently, 58 children were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The researchers found many were among those badly affected by events in their formative years. Children who experience stressful events such as a death or illness in the family, divorce or separation, could be three times more likely to develop type 1 diabetes (stock image above) The team at Linkoping University said that while the causes of type 1 diabetes are unknown, it is usually preceded by the body’s immune system killing so-called beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. They suggested damaging events in childhood could affect beta cells and raise insulin demands to cope with elevated levels of stress hormones. Other factors include viral infection, dietary habits, birth weight and early weight gain. The study concluded: ‘The experience of a serious life event during the first 14 years of life may be a risk factor. The study suggested damaging events in childhood could affect beta cells and raise insulin demands to cope with elevated levels of stress hormones. Above, a woman tests her blood sugar . 'The current study examined serious life events experienced at any time before diagnosis; further studies are thus needed to determine when in the autoimmune process psychological stress may contribute.' Genetic predisposition remains the most important factor, with a 12-fold increase in the risk of developing type 1 diabetes for a child from a family in which another close family member has it. The majority of people have type 2 diabetes, which is associated with being overweight, but more than 95 per cent of cases of diabetes in children are type 1 and rates have been increasing in recent years.","Swedish scientists analysed more than 10,000 families in the study .

"As the sun sets on the Saharan desert, its colours cast a glow on its vast sand dunes causing rainbow light to dance across the landscape. And Nasa has captured how this stunning show appears from space using its Landsat 7 satellite. It shows 'ribbons' of sand and patterned stripes known as linear dunes in the Erg Chech, a desolate sand sea in southwestern Algeria - but the exact cause of these longitudinal structures is not known. Linear dunes, like these captured by Nasa's Landsat 7 satellite, are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles (160km). This image shows 'ribbons' of sand and patterned stripes in an area known as the Erg Chech, a desolate sand sea in southwestern Algeria - but the exact cause of these longitudinal structures is not known . The image was spotted by io9 and the colours were caused as rays of sunlight hit the sand and were reflected off. Linear dunes are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles (160km). Ridges are categorised as linear when they are significantly longer than they are wide, and they occur on isolated ridges of dunes as well as, more commonly, as sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand and gravel. Linear dunes are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles (160km). Ridges are categorised as linear when they are significantly longer than they are wide, and they occur on isolated ridges of dunes as well as, more commonly, as sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand, gravel. The dunes have also been known to merge and form so-called 'Y-shaped compound dunes', and the formation of these patterns are caused by the wind and movement of sand. But exactly how this wind movement forms the structures is disputed. The dunes have also been known to merge and form so-called 'Y-shaped compound dunes', and the formation of these patterns are caused by the wind and movement of sand. But exactly how this wind movement forms the structures is disputed. One theory, suggested by Steven Hanna in 1969 in his Formation of Longitudinal Sand Dunes by Large Helical Eddies in the Atmosphere paper, is that linear dunes are created by helical roll vortices. These are long rolls of air that spiral, or rotate one way before rotating another. They are commonly seen in clouds, creating what's known as 'cloud streets' that appear as cumulus-type clouds. As the wind moves and switches direction it causes the sand to move accordingly and create grooves and ridges in the sand. 'The dunes are aligned in the direction of the prevailing wind and are spaced 1.2 miles (2km apart)', explained Professor Hanna. 'Observations in the atmosphere and in the laboratory indicate that dominant forms of motion in the boundary layer of the atmosphere are counter-rotating helical roll vortices aligned along the wind. 'The necessary conditions for the formation of these roll vortices are fulfilled over large deserts and their spacings agree with the observed spacings of the dunes.' One theory, suggested by Steven Hanna in 1969, is that the linear dunes are created by helical roll vortices (illustrated left). These are long rolls of air that spiral, or rotate one way before rotating another. They are commonly seen in clouds, creating what's known as 'cloud streets' that appear as cumulus-type clouds align to be parallel to the wind (illustrated right) In his book, Geomorphology of Desert Dunes, Nicholas Lancaster from the Desert Research Institute argues that this theory has its flaws. He said Professor Hanna compared data on the spacing of linear dunes with the expected dimensions of helical roll vortices in subtropical desert areas, concluding their 'probable wavelength was 1.9 miles to 3.7 miles (2km to 6km).' But measured dimensions of roll vortices indicate their wavelength ranges between less than 50 metres and 31 miles (15 km). 'The observed scale of helical roll vortices is in many cases much larger than average dune spacing, suggesting that linear dunes are not the product of such atmospheric motions,' explained Mr Lancaster. 'Evidence for the existence of helical roll vortices in linear dune landscapes is slight. The theory is attractive but there is little empirical data to support it in dune area.' Ridges are categorised as linear when they are significantly longer than they are wide, and they occur on isolated ridges of dunes as well as sets of parallel ridges separated by miles of sand and gravel. Linear dunes in the Namib Naukluft National Park, Namibia are shown. The dunes have also been known to merge and form so-called 'Y-shaped compound dunes', and patterns are caused by the wind and movement of sand . Another theory believes Barchan evolution may play a role. 'Barchans' are crescent-shaped sand dunes (top left) that form in regions where there is almost unidirectional wind. If windblown sand comes from one direction, a dune will be a crescent-shaped barchan but if winds switch direction seasonally they become linear (pictured left centre and in Morocco right) While in the 'Formation of the complex linear dunes in the central Taklimakan sand sea, China' study, Chinese researcher Xunming Wang and his colleagues said that in the case of 'complex' linear dunes - that are a combination of two shapes - the theory of Barchan evolution may play a role. 'Barchans' are crescent-shaped sand dunes that form in regions where there is almost unidirectional wind. The shapes depend on the wind’s direction, and if windblown sand comes from one direction, for example, a dune will be a crescent-shaped barchan but if winds switch direction seasonally - coming from the southwest for half the year and from the southeast for the other half, for instance - this dune will be linear. If wind direction is more varied, star-shaped dunes appear. The Erg Chech features both compound and complex linear, as well as star dunes. Erg' comes from the Arabic word for 'field of sand dunes' Mr Wang said: 'Complex linear dune formation is shown to have five stages. 'Analysis clearly shows that under the control of wind regime, sand supply and other factors, the simple linear dunes move sideways while they evolve. ' The evolutionary processes of complex linear dunes in the region partly support the theory of ‘barchan evolution’ but do not support the ‘roll-vortex’ and ‘bimodal wind regime’ hypotheses.' The researchers continued that after the complex linear dunes develop,  local wind patterns and the amount of sand suggest it is possible for them to maintain their linear shape, rather than evolving into star shapes for example, even as wind direction changes. The Erg Chech features both compound and complex linear, as well as star dunes.","The image of the patterned stripes in the Saharan desert was captured by the Nasa's Landsat 7 satellite .

"This may look like your average wooden wardrobe, but it actually has a hidden purpose. Concealed within its doors is a tiny trapdoor that leads to a secret underground passageway stretching some 500 feet towards the U.S. border. Mexican soldiers uncovered the suspected drugs tunnel  and arrested nine people before they managed to dig under the border and successfully into American territory. Scroll down for video . Does it lead to Narnia? Mexican soldiers uncovered a trapdoor leading to a suspected drugs tunnel hidden inside this wooden wardrobe . A Mexican official prepares to descend the 10 feet long ladder to enter the hidden tunnel in the border town of Tijuana . The sophisticated passageway was wired with lights, ventilation and what appears to be a cart system by the gang of drugs runners . The 66ft deep route, which was still under construction and was being built next to the Tijuana checkpoint, was wired with lights and ventilation. Soldiers who entered the passageway, just west of A.L. Rodriguez International Airport, had to descend a 10 feet ladder to access the muddy path. Officials said the route had not yet crossed the border and only stretched some 500 feet. But officials believe if it had been left undiscovered it would have surfaced somewhere just inside U.S. territory. The site of the tunnel is estimated to be around seven miles by car from the official border crossing at San Ysidro, but is less than a mile as the crow flies from the actual border. The border is just over 22 miles from the city of San Diego, California. When soldiers raided the property they also reportedly seized 44 pounds of marijuana and a truck being used by the racket to move the excavated earth. The tunnel was said to be close to the Mexican air force installation as well as a regional federal police facility . Government officials have said that similar tunnels have also been used to smuggle migrants into the United States. Over the past decade, dozens of illegal tunnels have been found across the roughly 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexico border. A soldier examines the tunnel which already stretched some 500 feet from the property when it was discovered by Mexican soldiers . The route had not yet reached U.S. soil, but if it went undiscovered official believe it would have surfaced a short distance from the border .

"The National Rifle Association gathered on Saturday to condemn Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as 'elitists' who will 'dismantle our freedoms and reshape America into an America that you and I will not even recognize'. In the annual meeting that attracts more than 70,000 people, CEO Wayne LaPierre celebrated the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate as evidence of the group's political clout. But he urged members to stand up against looming gun-control efforts. The motto of the convention in Nashville this weekend is: 'If they can ban one, they can ban them all.' National Rifle Association members hold hands during the opening prayer at the annual meeting of members at the NRA convention Saturday April 11 in Nashville, Tennessee . LaPierre declared that nobody 'should be forced to face evil with bare hands' as he called  Congress to permit handguns licence-carriers to carry their weapon in every state. Alongside Chris Cox, the head of the NRA's lobbying arm, he painted a bleak picture of the state of the country and the dangers to gun rights presented by the last 650 days of Obama's presidency. 'There's no telling how far President Obama will go to dismantle our freedoms and reshape America into an America that you and I will not even recognize,' LaPierre said. 'And when he's finished he intends to go out with a coronation of Hillary Rodham Clinton.' Clinton is expected to announce the launch of her bid for the Democratic nomination for president on Sunday. Cox said Clinton would make Obama 'look like an amateur' when it comes to gun control. 'Think about it: Hillary Clinton as president of the United States until 2025,' Cox said. 'Scared yet?' Meanwhile, a few hundred NRA protesters gathered in a park along the nearby Cumberland River. Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, criticized what she called LaPierre's 'fear-mongering rhetoric.' The NRA's goal, Watts said, is: 'Guns for anyone, anywhere, anytime - no questions asked.' Warning: Wayne LaPierre told the convention people must stand up against gun-control efforts . Chris Cox, executive director of the Institute for Legislative Action, targeted Hillary Clinton's presidential bid as he warned 'elitist' Democrats are trying to 'reshape America' Back at the NRA meeting, the group's president, Jim Porter, criticized politicians and the media on gun rights, a common refrain throughout speeches at the convention. 'They think that they're better and smarter than we are, as if they're more sophisticated and intellectually evolved than we are,' Porter said. 'When it comes to those elitists, looking down their noses and telling us how to live, it's time they got the message loud and clear,' he said. 'You elitists live however your want, but when it comes to us, get your hands off our freedom and leave us the hell alone.' On Friday, the NRA hosted a series of speeches from potential Republican presidential candidates, including former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida; Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana; Sen. Ted Cruz and former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas; former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas; Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; and neurosurgeon Ben Carson. The NRA's Cox told members on Saturday that the group has a multi-pronged approach to opposing gun-control advocates. 'We'll fight you in the courts, we'll fight you in the legislatures and we'll fight you on Election Day,' he said .","70,000 people gathered in Nashville for the annual convention .

"Former couple: Ann Malsbury (right) battered Lee Judson (left) with a saucepan and hair straighteners . An ex-girlfriend has avoided jail despite trying to strangle her former partner with an iPod cable. Ann Malsbury, 22, of Coventry, West Midlands, also battered  Lee Judson, 21, with a saucepan and hair straighteners after she flew into a rage. The chef’s ex-boyfriend had gone round to her home in the city to collect his belongings after the pair broke up following an 18-month relationship, Warwick Crown Court was told. But when Mr Judson bent down to pick up something, Malsbury jumped on his back and wrapped a white iPod lead around his neck before trying to throttle him. After he struggled free Malsbury then armed herself with a large carving knife and stabbed at him several times with the blade. Malsbury was arrested at the property in Coventry last November and charged with attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to cause serious injury. On Friday she was cleared of that charge after her plea of guilty to an alternative offence of affray was accepted by the prosecution . Malsbury was given a community order with 18 months of supervision and was ordered to take part in a women’s emotional wellbeing course. Sentencing, Judge Sylvia de Bertodano told a tearful Malsbury: ‘You were obviously in a state of considerable distress and made threats towards him using, among other things, a knife. No jail: Malsbury (above) was charged with attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to cause serious injury - but was cleared of this after her plea of guilty to an alternative offence of affray was accepted . ‘You fortunately did not injure him in any way, and I take that as a sign that you did not really intend to cause him any real injury. You stopped this of your own accord and called the police.’ Graeme Simpson, prosecuting, told the court Malsbury had been suffering from depression and was upset about the couple’s relationship coming to an end when she launched the attack. Attack: Malsbury (pictured) jabbed at her ex-partner four times - penetrating his clothing but not his skin . He said: ‘The defendant came in after him and had a wire lead which she flung over his neck from behind and tried to strangle him, but he managed to pull it away. ‘When he bent down to pick something up the defendant jumped on his back and put the iPod lead round his neck again, but he managed to get her off.’ The court heard as Mr Judson left the room she kicked him and then rushed downstairs ahead of him and into the kitchen where she armed herself with a big carving knife. She came out of the kitchen and stood in front of him, jabbing towards his arm and saying: ‘Do you want to live?’ Malsbury jabbed at her ex-partner four times - penetrating his clothing but not his skin - before getting a saucepan with which she tried to hit him over the head. She then picked up her hair straighteners and hit him with those before stopping and ‘clearly very distressed’ called the police herself. Mr Simpson added: ‘She had been suffering from depression and was very distressed about the relationship coming to an end. The call to the police could be considered a cry for help.’ William Douglas-Jones, defending, said Malsbury had initially been in custody for around three months before being granted bail. He added: ‘This is a desperately sad case. It involves a vulnerable young woman who has spent the equivalent of almost six months in prison. She faced the loss of her partner, who was her support. But no harm was caused other than some reddening to the neck.’","Lee Judson had gone to Ann Malsbury's home to collect his belongings .

"A high school teenager's romantic prom proposal ended in disaster when his date burst into tears. Daniel Pena had spent hours planning the perfect way to pop the question to his girlfriend Alex. The pair had been driving along a route together where, unbeknownst to his girlfriend, Daniel had erected a series of signs along the road. A teen's attempt to ask his girlfriend to the prom ended in tears when she misunderstood the proposal . Together they read: 'Alex. Will. You. Marry. LOL Jk. Go To. Prom. With Me.' The final question mark was hidden in the car ready for the teen to pull out at the end to ask his girlfriend in person. But sadly his elaborate set-up did not quite go to plan after Alex missed the crucial first sign with her name on. The pair had been driving together when, unknown to his girlfriend, Daniel Pena had erected a series of signs . Girlfriend Alex missed the crucial first sign with her name on but caught the second two which read: Will... you... Marry . She caught the next which read: Will... you... Marry and gasped as she saw the next, LOL JK, which revealed the marriage proposal as a joke. Reading out the final signs - Go To. Prom. With Me - Daniel had prepared to present her with the question mark to ask the question. But the romantic mood quickly turned sour when Alex, who was not aware that her boyfriend was behind the attempt, criticized his carefully planned out proposal. 'That's a really s****y way to ask someone to prom,' she said. She gasped when the next sign revealed the marriage proposal as a joke when she read LOL JK, meaning 'just kidding' The next signs read Go To. Prom. With Me, and Daniel had the final question mark in the car ready to show his girlfriend . Poor Daniel's face drops when she dismisses his proposal but doesn't  let on it was him, simply saying 'well, ok.' Suddenly the penny dropped and a mortified Alex, realizing her embarrassing blunder asked him 'Was that you?' before bursting into guilt-ridden tears. Luckily there was a happy ending to the disastrous proposal as, after wiping away her tears, Alex said yes. Whether Daniel will want to go with her to the prom is another question. Elaborate filmed 'PromPosals' (prom proposals) are on the rise in the States as teens attempt to outdo each other. But things quickly turned sour when Alex dismissed the attempt saying: 'That's a really s****y way to ask someone to prom' Daniel's face drops when Alex criticizes his carefully planned out proposal but he doesn't yet let on it was him . Several teens filmed themselves holding up signs asking their dates to prom, while others got more inventive, writing it on trees, in pretzels or scrawled across a burrito. Devan Cavanaugh even wrote her Harry Potter-style proposal, with train ticket from Platform 9 3/4 to her date Daniel Reyna. While Stephen Pack  organised an afternoon-long scavenger hunt to ask his date Mimi Seel to the prom. Hiding clues in places that were special to the couple, he then gathered an army of friends  to help pull his big ask off. The final destination is where Stephen and Mimi had their first kiss but even his proposal was not perfect - Stephen left the final clue in his car. After a quick fetch, she pieced his question together and said yes. Suddenly the penny drops and she eventually realizes the prom proposal was for her and had come from her boyfriend . With worry across her face, the panic-ridden Alex asks Daniel who has begun to grin 'was that you?' When he confirms it was him, Alex bursts into tears and Daniel is left to console his sobbing girlfriend, but there was a happy ending as once she'd finished crying from guilt, she said yes .","Daniel Pena set up an elaborate proposal to ask his girlfriend to prom .

"The podium girl is the centre of a 'sexism storm' after Lewis Hamilton sprayed champagne in her face said she wasn't offended by his stunt - and was just doing her job. The British Formula 1 racer drew criticism from around the world when he aimed the fizz directly as the face of 23-year-old grid girl Liu Siying, who was pictured looking less than impressed. But the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art graduate, who was a 'podium girl' at the Chinese Grand Prix. said she didn't think much about the incident and wasn't annoyed. Scroll down for video . Liu Siying was pictured grimacing as Lewis Hamilton sprayed champagne at her face after winning the race . Sexism campaigners called Hamilton's behaviour 'selfish' - but Siying said she did not think too much about it . The hostess, who has a degree, said: 'I was told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that's what I did' 'It lasted for only one or two seconds, and I did not think too much about it at all,' Miss Siying told the Shanghai Daily. 'I think some foreign media are more sensitive about the topic compared to local media. 'I was just told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that’s what I did.' Miss Siying had asked to work as a podium model on the stage of the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai because she was a fan of Finnish driver Kimi Raikkonen. After the incident on Sunday Object, a campaign group against sexism, condemned the behaviour of the driver as 'selfish and inconsiderate' and called on Hamilton to apologise to the graduate. Others have called the driving ace an 'embarrassment to the UK', while another said his actions showed that he was an 'ignorant clown'. Scroll down for video . It's not the first time racing ace Lewis Hamilton has sprayed a grid girl with bubbly - he's also done it after winning the Spanish Grand Prix and even at the Austrian Grand Prix, where he lost out on the top spot . After seeing the pictures the chief executive of campaign group Object asked for Hamilton to apologise . Speaking on Monday, Roz Hardie, chief executive of Object said Miss Siying would have had ittle choice but to 'stand there and take it'. She said: 'The photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed, but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face, which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part. 'If this if the case we think Lewis Hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future. For most people, it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it. 'It is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it. That is something of which he should be aware. But instead, he appears to have abused her position. 'It's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour.' Ms Hardie added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world. She said: 'Motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves. We would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women. On Twitter, Hamilton was described as a 'bully' and 'disgusting'. Another user simply said: 'Man please stop spraying Champagne on the Podium Ladies. They don't like it', while one outraged user said he was a 'scumbag - an embarrassment to UK'. Another wrote: 'Have a bit more respect for the ladies please. Spraying Champagne in her face was out of order #child #idiot.' And one tweeted: 'Shame on you F1 and Lewis Hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration#sexism.' It is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move. He celebrated in a similar fashion after winning Spanish Grand Prix last year, which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and the one that finally put him on top of the World Championship table. And although he lost the Austrian Grand Prix to teammate Nico Rosberg, he didn't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess. The 30-year-old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on Graham Norton's talk show in 2013. Hamilton also sprayed a hostess at Montmelo after winning the Spanish Grand Prix at Circuit de Catalunya . But not everyone was offended by his behaviour. Many found his actions amusing, while another said: 'I can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @LewisHamilton.. Lighten up people!' Hamilton controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship yesterday. But it wasn't all smiles at yesterday's race after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg, following a press conference. His Mercedes partner accused him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. With the top three drivers covered by only 3.5 seconds ahead of the final round of pit-stops, Rosberg reported on the radio that ‘Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up.’ Hamilton, seemingly protecting his tyres, was given the hurry-up by Mercedes and both he and Rosberg eventually emerged from their final pit-stop first and second with Vettel third. The world champion, sitting beside his teammate, told the press conference yesterday: 'I wasn't controlling his race, I was controlling my own race. 'My goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico throughout the whole race.' It wasn't all smiles after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg . The Mercedes driver poses with his trophy and champagne bottle on the podium after winning on Sunday . A visibly angry Rosberg replied: 'It's just now interesting to hear from you Lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race. 'Driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant Sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then I had to cover him. 'It was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time because I had to cover him. Then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer, so I'm unhappy about that.' The spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre, and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded. It culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the Belgian Grand Prix, resulting in Rosberg being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team. This proved to be a turning point in the championship as Hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown.

"The suicides of five young sailors who served on the same base over two years has unearthed a shocking culture of ice taking, binge drinking, bullying and depression within the Australian Navy. The sailors were stationed or had been stationed at the West Australian port of HMAS Stirling off the coast of Rockingham, south of Perth. Their families did not learn of their previous attempts to take their own lives and their drug use until after their deaths, according to ABC's 7.30 program. Scroll down for video . Stuart Addison was serving on HMAS Stirling off the coast of Western Australia when he took his own life . Five of the sailors who committed suicide had been serving with the Australian Navy on HMAS Stirling . Stuart Addison hanged himself while he was on-shore leave in 2011 and his father, Mark Addison, was faced with the tough decision to turn off his son's life support after several days in hospital. 'It's a decision that I don't think... any parent should have to make,' Mark told 7.30. Mark was left devastated by his loss and was dealt a further blow when navy records revealed his son had tired to take his own life twice before. Stuart had also been on psychiatric medication, which the family were also unaware about. His father, Mark Addison, was devastated by the blow and had to make the difficult decision to turn his son's life support . Matt Henry, who was friends with Stuart, said there was a drug culture within the Australian Navy . 'They knew and we weren't told about it. We were kept in the dark,' Stuart's sister Jessica Ames said. To make sure this does not happen to other families, Mark has started up a change.org petition asking Prime Minister Tony Abbott to allow the families of military personnel access to their files when there was evidence of self-harm. Brett Dwyer, who was best friends with Stuart, took his own life just months later . He wants to make sure the devastating pain he feels never happens to other families. It was also revealed by Stuart's friend and former sailor Matt Henry, who had also attempted to take his own life on several occasions, that ice use and drinking was rife within the ranks of HMAS Sterling. Mr Henry said ice was the 'drug of choice in Western Australia' because it was so readily available through their sailor friends. He said he believed his friends' use of the drug ruined their lives. Another sailor, Brett Dwyer, who served alongside Stuart took his own life just three months after his best friend. Brett's doctors advised the navy he should not have been sent to sea due to chemical burns on his hands. But he was sent to HMAS Stirling where he was bullied by Navy personnel. His RSL counsellor, Brian O'Neill, said one 'disgusting' incident involved Brett being dangled overboard by his legs by shipmates. In late 2011, Brett was discharged after saying he had used drugs, including ice. Mr O'Neill said the young sailor was not taking the illicit substance and just said he did to break free of the navy. 'We woke up in the morning and he was hanging on our balustrade which is in the middle of the house. His mother and I had to cut him down,' Brett's father, Mark Dwyer, told the national broadcaster. Like the Addisons, Brett's family did not find out about his medical history until after his death. Brett was on psychiatric medication to treat his depression. Stuart's family did not know he was on psychiatric medication and sister Jessica Ames said they were kept in the dark by the navy . RSL counsellor Brian O'Neill said Mr Dwyer told the navy he was taking ice to get out of the service . 'I wouldn't wish that on any family. What they did was wrong,' Mark said. 'They think of him as a number. He wasn’t a number, he was our son.' Three more similar cases of men who took their own lives were revealed in the 7.30 report. Their mental health issues and suicide attempts were kept inside the Navy and their families only became aware after their funerals. This included Jake Casey, Ewen McDonald and Stephen Bebbington. Both Jake Casey (left), who was pallbearer for Brett Dwyer, and Stephen Bebbington (right) took their own lives . 'They're trying to sweep this issue under the carpet,' Ewen's sister Kenna Crichton said. He tried to take his own three times before he shot himself in October 2011, following the death of best friend Stephen who committed suicide six months earlier. While Jake Casey, who was pallbearer for Brett Dwyer, developed an ice habit and hanged himself three days before the first anniversary of his friend's death. He had ice in system when he was found. But one navy wife tried to warn the service about the problem when she found out her husband had a drug habit. The wife of Bradley Livingston said he had a drug problem and took ice, which she tried to warn his commanding officer about . Karley Livingston said her claims were ignored and she was treated by the officer as a 'stupid navy wife' Mr Livingston died of a suspected drug overdose, but it is not clear if he wanted to take his own life . Karley Livingston's husband, Bradley Livingston, died of a suspected drug overdose and had tried to prevent this from happening by going to his commanding officer. She was told by the officer to go to the chaplain and was treated like a 'stupid navy wife'. The Navy said it was now investigating Ms Livingston's claim. The service has reviewed its privacy policy about suicide attempts and will not be making changes, 7.30 reported. 'Defence conducted a review of Health Information Practices in late 2013,' the navy said in a statement. 'The review reaffirmed that it is the member who determines who has access to their personal health information and recommended that there be no change to defence policy or practice in third party disclosure.'","Five sailors took their own lives while serving on WA's HMAS Stirling .

"Unfit driver: According to Houston city codes - Duncan Burton should not have been driving because of a prior drugs conviction . A Houston Uber driver arrested and charged last week with sexually assaulting a female passenger was granted approval to drive for the car service despite being a convicted cocaine dealer. Duncan Burton, 57, was released in November 2012 after 14-years behind bars but was allowed to work for Uber despite city controls prohibiting drug felons driving cabs. Burton was taken into custody on Wednesday on one count of sexual assault and if convicted will face a maximum sentence of 20 years. Uber spokeswoman, Debbee Hancock said on Monday that Burton had passed all the firms background checks before they allowed him to work under their name. However, according to Uber's official background check policy they only review sentences passed down up to seven years ago. That means because Burton was sentence 14-years ago, his drug offense did not register or raise a red flag. Indeed, Burton served 14 years of an 18 year sentence for trying to distribute five kilos or more of cocaine according to the US Bureau of Prisons. That information is readily available online by typing in his name. He was convicted in Houston and served time in Louisana and Georgia before his 2012 release which was commuted because of good behavior. According to Houston regulations someone with a drug conviction is not eligible for a city permit to drive cabs. However, they could appeal and still receive one. Burton did not have a city permit to drive a cab and had never applied for an exemption. Uber has poached Facebook's security chief Joe Sullivan in an attempt to double down on rapidly escalating safety concerns. The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns . These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' Looking forward: The $40 billion firm's CEO Travis Kalanick announced the news in a blog post on Friday . He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.' There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered £20 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. Last week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he allegedly dropped a passenger off at the airport before turning around, driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks.","Duncan Burton, 57,  was charged last week with rape in Houston, Texas .

"Tony Abbott may have thrilled players at an Australian Rules function by skolling a beer but he’s drawn the ire of anti-drinking campaigners who claim he’s glorifying binge drinking and associating being a man with drinking booze. Julie Robert, a cultural studies professor at the University of Technology Sydney, said it was 'problematic' that the Prime Minister, who she believes should be advocating against binge drinking, thought it acceptable to 'showcase his masculinity' by skolling a beer. ‘It sets up a culture that drinking isn’t about socialising with friends, it’s about how quickly and how much you can drink,’ she said. Scroll down for video . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was cheered on by a crowd of about 50 as he skolled a schooner of beer . Mr Abbott came under fire after the incident as anti-drinking campaigners said he was glorifying binge drinking . ‘It sets up a culture that drinking isn’t about socialising with friends, it’s about how quickly and how much you can drink.’ On Saturday night Mr Abbott appeared happy to oblige  when he was asked to have a drink by University of Technology Sydney Bats coach Simon Carradous. It took the Prime Minister about six seconds to down the schooner as players cheered and chanted 'skol' and 'Tony'. Dr Robert warned people can forget their limits when they are wrapped up in the act of demonstrating how much, or how quickly, they can drink. 'It is the whole performance and the display and showing off which is the problematic part,' she told Daily Mail Australia. However, she said it was not just Mr Abbott's skol that was concerning, it was also the way media and other government officials have reacted to the event. In an interview on Sunday, opposition leader Bill Shorten quipped that he was 'just pleased that Tony Abbott’s learning to drink beer without adding lemonade to it'. Mr Abbott was labelled 'un-Australian' for ordering a light beer during his 2010 campaign. Dr Robert said while drinking was a part of the Australian tradition, it was dangerous to make comments that would only  glorify irresponsible drinking practices and perpetuate the stereotype that drinking heavily makes you a true blue Aussie bloke. Critics said he should be setting an example that you don't have to drink heavily to be a 'true blue Aussie bloke' It appeared to take the Prime Minister about six seconds to down the schooner, as players cheered and chanted 'skol' and 'Tony' Health Minister Sussan Ley was quick to jump to Mr Abbott's defence saying there was 'nothing wrong' with the Prime Minister's antics. “If more people got up at 4.30 in the morning and went running and cycling and worked as hard as our Prime Minister to keep fit and demonstrate that there are many ways that you can do this, I think we’d have a healthier country as a result,’’ Ms Ley said. During his night out, Mr Abbott gave a speech to the players, according to Australian Women's Weekly. 'He grabs the microphone and gives a speech, which went along the lines of: 'well isn't this a real treat, I've been a rugby man all my life but now I finally get to hang out with some real footballers' to which of course the crowd went crazy,' coach Carradous said. 'Then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner, dribbling little bits on his shirt... He was proud as punch.' While Mr Abbott is not the first Australian Prime Minister to show off his skolling skills, with former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke a notable example, Dr Roberts said he should have taken into consideration recent shifts in attitudes over heavy drinking. 'I don’t necessarily think it’s a partisan thing but I do think the climate has changed and we didn’t [used to] have the concern over binge drinking that we do now,' she said. Mr Abbott was asked to have a drink by University of Technology Sydney Bats coach Simon Carradous, and the Prime Minister happily obliged . 'He drank the entire schooner, dribbling bits on his shirt... He was proud as punch,' a witness said .","Australian Prime Minister skols a beer with celebrating football players .

"A two-year-old girl was savaged by a Jack Russell as she played in a children's park before the dog's owner ran away. Libby Jane Wilson was enjoying a day out with her father Alex Knight at the Yarrow Valley Country Park in Chorley, Lancashire on Sunday afternoon when she was pounced on by the pet, which bit her face. The toddler had been playing in a tunnel when the Jack Russell - which was not on a lead despite signs saying pets should be under control- attacked her and left her with two puncture marks on her face, narrowly missing her eye. Two-year-old Libby Jane Wilson, who was enjoying a day out at a play park when she was savaged by a Jack Russell, leaving her with puncture marks on her face . Her father, Mr Knight who works as a floor layer, heard his daughter screaming and kicked the dog away from her before the owner called the dog back and fled the scene. Libby's mother Christie Wilson, 21, said: 'Libby was playing in the tunnel and her dad was on top waiting for her to come out when the dog ran over and attacked her. 'Alex heard Libby screaming and went into the tunnel and kicked the dog away from her. He called me straight away, he is distraught. 'The dog wasn’t on a lead and Alex said he shouted ‘Bud’ and called the dog back, then he just ran off. Libby Jane with her mother Christie Wilson. Miss Wilson says that the dog's owner didn't check if her daughter was hurt and fled with his pet . Toddler Libby Jane had been climbing through a tunnel at the Yarrow Valley Country Park in Chorley when the dog entered and attacked her . 'She has been very, very lucky - it could have been a lot worse and the doctors have said she will have scars, but that as she grows they will fade. 'Libby is a real tough cookie, it has affected me and her dad a lot more than her. I think because she is so young she doesn’t really understand what has happened.' Terrified Mr Knight took his daughter home to Miss Wilson who rushed her to Chorley and South Ribble General Hospital. The brave youngster was given a course of antibiotics and sent home with the puncture wounds, one above her lip and one under her eye, left open to heal. The attack happened at the Yarrow Valley Country Park in Chorley, Lancashire while Libby Jane was with her father Alex Knight . Miss Wilson, who runs her own hair extension business, said: 'The owner didn’t even come over to check if Libby was okay, he just ran off. 'He must have seen or heard what happened, she was screaming. It is shocking - I just want him to come forward. 'If the owner had apologised or checked on Libby it would be a whole different ball game but he is obviously not bothered, and more concerned about his dog. 'Libby was traumatised, but she is okay now. She woke up last night shouting ""dogs, dogs"" so I think maybe she was having flashbacks about what happened.' A spokesperson for Lancashire Police said: 'An officer has been out and spoken to the family to get more details and will be doing some follow up in the area. Inquiries are ongoing.'","Libby Jane Wilson was playing in Yarrow Valley Country Park in Chorley .

"A white supremacist who allegedly shot dead his gay boss at a North Carolina community college after he was fired has been found sleeping on a Florida beach. Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, was arrested around 1.30 a.m. on Tuesday when he was seen sleeping in Daytona Beach, Florida, Goldsboro police Captain Dwayne Dean said. Stancil, who had a knife with him, was arrested without incident when Volusia County beach patrol officers found the suspect sleeping on the beach, which is a violation of a local ordinance. The arrest came nearly 24 hours after he allegedly walked into Wayne County Community College in Goldsboro, where he had previously studied, and shot dead the print shop director, Ron Lane. Arrested:  Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, 20, left, was arrested sleeping on a Florida beach early on Tuesday, nearly 24 hours after shooting dead his former work-study supervisor Ron Lane, right . Lane, who had worked at the college for 18 years, had supervised Stancil under a work-study program but is believed to have recently fired him. Stancil's mother, Debbie,confirmed to WNCN that Lane had fired her son without notice and claimed that Lane had 'made inappropriate sexual advances toward' him. According to Lane's Facebook page, he had been in a relationship with a man named Chuck Tobin. Tobin, 28, vanished after leaving home last July and his remains were found in November. Police said on Tuesday that they are investigating the fatal shooting  as a possible hate crime, although they refused to say what hate crime was being investigated. Goldsboro police and the Wayne County district attorney's office said they will work to have Stancil extradited to North Carolina to face an open count of murder. Daytona Beach is about 540 miles south of Goldsboro and it is not yet clear how Stancil traveled the there. Authorities had previously said they believed he was still in North Carolina. Goldsboro city spokeswoman Kim Best said Stancil, a third-year student, had recently left the school but did not say when. Take over: A military style SWAT vehicle from the Johnston County Sheriff's Office arrived at the college after the 8am shooting on Monday. It is believed that Stancil targeted Lane before fleeing the building . Swoop: Authorities enter the home Stancil shares with his mother and two younger brothers on Monday . Search: They look through a vehicle outside the home on Monday as a massive manhunt was launched . According to police, Stancil walked into the building at 8am carrying a long-barreled gun, went up to the third floor - perhaps using a back staircase - and fired one shot, which killed Lane. First-year student Jovaun Williams, 24, told The Associated Press that he was heading up a staircase inside the building when he heard a single muffled pop, which he knew was a gunshot. By the time he reached the ground floor again, he saw police officers running into the building, which houses the cafeteria and library, with their guns drawn. SWAT teams raced to Wayne Community College, the entire campus was evacuated, and the school was placed on lockdown, although it was lifted a few hours later. Authorities at one point thought they had cornered Stancil in a restroom and fired tear gas in a bid to get him out, but found it was not the shooter inside. Killed: Stancil, left, allegedly killed the long-time college employee, right, and faces one count of open murder . By his side: Stancil's mother Debbie, pictured at his graduation, said Lane had fired him with no notice . Claim: Stancil's mother has claimed that Lane, who was gay, had made unwanted sexual advances towards her son. Lane is pictured right with his boyfriend, Chuck Tobin, who was found dead last year . Nearby, the private Wayne County Day School - with about 300 students in prekindergarten through 12th grade - was also put on lockdown. Sheriff's deputies also swarmed the home Stancil shared with his mother and two younger brothers. A next-door neighbor, Barbara Williams, said Stancil's grandparents lived on the other side of the mobile home, where they operated an assisted living home. Williams said Stancil once helped her late husband when he fell out of his bed. 'He came over here and picked him right up and put him back on the bed,' Williams said. 'I've never had no problems with those kids. ... It just surprises me.' On Facebook, he describes his interests as 'white pride' and calls himself the 'White Knight'. Evacuated: Students were seen congregating in the college parking lot on Monday morning . Clearing buildings: A line of about 20 to 30 students were escorted out of the campus with their hands up . Leaving: As the morning progressed students were escorted off the college campus by polic . He also has multiple white supremacist tattoos across his body, including 'Brother Hood'across his neck and '88' beneath his eye. The number eight represents the eighth letter in the alphabet - H - and so is 88 understood to stand for 'Heil Hitler'. He also has a large cross tattooed above his right ear. After Stancil fled, authorities urged the public not to approach him, calling him extremely dangerous. At a press conference late on Monday morning, WCC president Kay Albertson said: 'Our hearts are heavy, but it could have been a lot worse.' Students at the community college planned to return to class on Tuesday. The college is one hour away from Raleigh and has 3,900 students currently enrolled.","Kenneth Morgan Stancil III was arrested sleeping on beach in Daytona Beach early on Tuesday morning .

"Sarah Brady, the wife of a former White House spokesman and a tireless anti-gun violence activist who helped pass major anti-assault weapon legislation, died Friday at the age of 73. Sarah and her husband James crusaded against gun violence after he was shot during an assassination attempt on former US president Ronald Reagan in 1981. The Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, named in their honor, said they were 'heartbroken' at the news of her death, calling Sarah Brady a 'guiding light.' Scroll down for video . Sarah Brady (right) with her husband former White House Press Secretary Jim Brady in Washington, DC in 2011. Mrs Brady died Friday from pneumonia. Mr Brady died last years from injuries sustained in 1981 . Mrs Brady first got involved in gun control advocacy in 1986 (pictured) after seeing her six-year-old son playing with a loaded hand gun that had been left in a car . 'Together with her husband Jim 'Bear' Brady, Sarah was the heart and soul of this organization and the successful movement it has become today,' the group's president Dan Gross said in a statement. 'Our nation has lost a great hero, and I have lost a dear friend. I am certain that she would want nothing more than to know we are carrying on her and Jim's legacy with the same fiery compassion and dedication that made her so remarkable.' The group said the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, named after the couple and passed in 1993, has blocked an estimated two million prohibited gun purchases in the United States to potential buyers such as felons. Following bills prevented the purchase of military-style assault weapons and required background checks were required for handgun purchases at federally-licensed shops. The  ban ended in 2004 and those who do not pass background checks can still buy weapons online or at gun shows. It has not been renewed despite a majority of Americans consistently favoring a prohibition on assault weapons. Mrs Brady, who trained as a school teacher, was the chairperson of the organization's corporation up until her death. Advocacy from Mrs Brady and her husband (left) helped lead to the passage of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1993. The bill expired in 2004 and has not been renewed . Mr Brady was shot in 1981 in Washington with President Reagan (left) by John Hinckley Jr. The press secretary was the most seriously wounded of the victims (right) and died of his injuries in 2014 . Born Sarah Kemp in 1942, her father was an FBI agent and she hoped to follow in his footsteps while growing up in Virginia. She ultimately didn't because of a lack of women agents. In the late 1960s she met Jim Brady while working for the Republican Party in Illinois. She said that she did not get involved in gun control because her husband was shot, and had rejected an offer from a gun-control group in the aftermath of the attack. However, in 1985 she found her six-year-old son playing with a fully loaded pistol that someone had left lying around in a car. The gun was a cheap 'Saturday night special', much like the one that had been used to shoot her husband. Mrs Brady began campaigning against the 1986 McClure-Volkmer bill, which was ultimately signed by Reagan and loosened gun restrictions. The 1993 'Brady Bill' was passed after seven years of opposition from the National Rifle Association. 'Although we disagreed on public policy, Sarah Brady was an honorable American who we always respected,' the NRA said of the advocate's death, according to CNN. Mrs Brady continued her advocacy even after she was diagnosed with cancer in 2000, notably pushing for more background checks after the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 . The former school teacher (right) was honored by a number of organizations for her advocacy. Above, she accepts the USO Woman of the Year award with Elizabeth Taylor (left) Jim Brady died in August 2014 from complications relating to the 1981 shooting by John Hinckley Jr, and a coroner ruled the death a homicide. Hinckley, who had shot the president in an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster, was ruled insane and still remains in a mental hospital. Brady had been gravely wounded and was left wheelchair-bound and with brain damage. The failed assassination also wounded three others, including Reagan. Sarah Brady was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2000 and was told she would likely not survive more than five years, according to the Los Angeles Times. She wrote about her experiences in a 2002 book, A Good Fight, and has received awards from the League of Women Voters, the State Department, the USO and Sara Lee Foundation. The advocate died in Virginia from pneumonia. Mrs Brady is survived by her and Jim's son and her stepdaughter.","Mother became advocate after seeing her son play with loaded pistol .

"Labour leader Ed Miliband read from motivational notes during the leaders’ televised debate (above) He was widely criticised for his robotic performance in last week’s debate as he failed to land a convincing blow on David Cameron. Now it has emerged Ed Miliband was reading from motivational notes during the leaders’ clash – including one reminding him to be a ‘happy warrior’. His cribsheet prompts him to turn a ‘negative’ into a ‘positive’ and reveals he had planned a number of the put-downs he used on David Cameron – such as, on the deficit: ‘Does that sound familiar? Well, it should, because he said it five years ago.’ The Labour leader urges himself to ‘stay calm, never agitated’ and ‘relish the chance to show who I am’. His scrawled notes, found in his dressing room after the ITV debate, give an insight into his mindset before he took to the rostrum with the six other party leaders. Mr Miliband reminds himself to talk to the camera, ‘use the people at home’ and get across his ‘decency, passion, leadership’. The Labour leader reveals his planned ripostes to two possible Tory attacks, accusing him of forgetting the deficit and of telling journalists he wanted to ‘weaponise’ the issue of the NHS. He accuses the Prime Minister of promising to eliminate the deficit and failing, and urges viewers to ‘use their vote as a weapon to fight for the NHS by kicking David Cameron out of Downing Street’. But some of the planned one-liners against his Conservative rival were not used, including: ‘I can take five more weeks of attacks of me, but the British people can’t take five more years of you.’ Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said such ‘marketing speak’ was ‘cringe-worthy’, adding: ‘Ed Miliband is looking increasingly bizarre. 'First he forgets the deficit, then he forgets his notes in the dressing room. Marketing speak like “happy warriors” is very much the tactic of motivational gurus … I think most people will think it’s cringe-worthy.’ Scroll down for video . His notes, found in his dressing room after the ITV debate, give an insight into his mindset before the clash . In his self-motivational notes, Labour leader Mr Miliband (pictured above during the debate as Natalie Bennet speaks)  wrote the words ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ connected by an arrow as well as the term 'Happy Warrior' The publication of the notes in a newspaper yesterday was compared to BBC2 satire The Thick Of It, in which a party leader is mortified when her notes referring to ‘quiet bat-people’ are photographed. A poll by headhunters Korn Ferry yesterday found 70 per cent of FTSE 100 chairmen think Labour would herald an ‘economic catastrophe’. A FTSE 100 boss, who did not wish to be named, said Mr Miliband ‘appears to completely misunderstand business’. It comes after Mr Miliband drew ridicule for declaring ‘hell yeah!’ when asked by Jeremy Paxman in the first TV election clash if he was tough enough to be Prime Minister. ‘Happy warrior’ was coined by William Wordsworth to describe Admiral Lord Nelson. In a 1985 presidential address, Ronald Reagan called on Americans to be ‘happy warriors, out to seize back a country’. Mr Miliband staked the success of his campaign on having a head to head debate with David Cameron, and is understood to have been rehearsing for months. He hired US speech coach Michael Sheehan on a reported £10,000 daily fee to improve his delivery and charisma. So, what does all this psychobabble actually mean? What do all the weird soundbites on Miliband’s crib sheet mean? Here, the Mail analyses them – and reveals the pervasive influence of Red Ed’s American spin doctor. ‘Happy Warrior’ Coined by William Wordsworth, it’s the title of an 1806 poem to mark Lord Nelson’s death. Happy Warrior depicts its subject as a swashbuckling hero who suffers great setbacks and pain, yet proves impossible to defeat. This may make it an odd slogan for a modern election, yet in America, home to Labour’s strategist David Axelrod, the phrase has a long history. First used by Franklin Roosevelt in 1924, presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey plastered it across his campaign jet in 1968. It has since been used by politicians desperate to be seen as trustworthy, hard-working men-of-the-people. In 2012, Barack Obama described his running mate Joe Biden as ‘America’s happy warrior’, in a speech written by Axelrod. ‘Relish the chance to show who I am’ The sort of phrase a bull-necked US Navy Seal might shout while doing press-ups in a muddy puddle, this is old-fashioned motivational psychobabble. Undoubtedly another contribution from Axelrod, who is big on ego-boosting statements of intent. Indeed, he must have been behind Miliband’s decision to puff up his chest and tell Jeremy Paxman last month: ‘Am I tough enough? Hell yes, I’m tough enough!’ As to what sort of a guy Miliband intends to ‘relish’ showing us he is, his notes contain three words: ‘decency, passion, leadership’. Labour Party leader Ed Miliband leaves MediaCityUK in Salford following the televised leaders' election debate . ‘Calm, never agitated’ Axelrod famously labelled Obama ‘no drama Obama’, kitting out staff in T-shirts with the logo ‘Stop the drama, vote Obama’. The reason: although election campaigning can be confrontational, voters prefer candidates who remain above the fray and, well, prime ministerial. Miliband is thus at pains not to lose his cool. ‘Use the people at home’ Ever since 1960, when John F Kennedy faced Richard Nixon in America’s first presidential TV debate, this has been a golden rule. JFK captured hearts and minds by appearing to talk directly to voters. The pale, sweaty Nixon failed to look at the camera and thereby seemed shifty. His campaign never recovered. Miliband has been practising such drills for weeks – with some rehearsals said to have taken place with Tony Blair’s ex-spin doctor Alastair Campbell playing the anchorman. ‘Negative into positive’ This may seem to be yet more transatlantic psychobabble but it is a key tool to try to turn perceived weaknesses to your advantage. Miliband has made self-deprecating jokes – such as one about how he struggled to eat a bacon sandwich – to turn a negative into a positive. Similarly, he has attempted to transform his status as underdog by saying: ‘People have underestimated me at every turn.’ After four opinion polls were released, the average poll of polls put Cameron narrowly ahead on 22 per cent, with 21.5 per cent saying Miliband won, 21 per cent backing Farage and 20 per cent favouring Miss Sturgeon . ‘Me Vs DC: Decency, Principle, Values’ Crucial buzzwords. Interestingly, the word ‘decency’ cropped up in Sherlock actor Martin Freeman’s filmed endorsement of Labour. Also, campaign guru Axelrod’s autobiography is peppered with references to ‘decency and small-town values’. While working for Obama, he told him to say he was ‘led not by polls but by principle’. The note suggests Labour believe ‘decency’, ‘principle’ and ‘values’ are alien concepts to David Cameron. Typed answers . Despite wishing to sound spontaneous, several pre-scripted comments were surreptitiously read out from typed notes. As for his closing statement, ‘let’s bring the change Britain needs’, it seems a rip-off of the slogan used by Barack Obama who, in 2008, talked endlessly about ‘change we can believe in’.","Labour leader Ed Miliband had motivational notes for televised debate .

"The four sisters at the centre of Australia's largest abduction case have come through the ordeal as happy and well-adjusted children. Despite being embroiled in the very public and traumatic feud where the Vinceni girls were dragged kicking and screaming from their mother's home in the middle of the night to go back to live with their father in 2012, the girls have established healthy and happy lives in Italy and speak to their mum every night. 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown interviewed the two eldest girls, Emily and Claire, who she described as elegant, gracious, reserved and studious, at their home near Florence and they expressed their regret for the way they handled the dramatic exit. 'They are really well, really centred and settled,' she said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Flashback to 2012: These were the heartbreaking scenes of a family being torn apart when four young sisters were dragged kicking and screaming from their mother's Sunshine Coast home in the middle of the night and forced onto a plan back to their father in Italy . The four Vincenti sisters, including the two older girls Emil and Claire, had a 'monster' of a father who abused them and their mother,or so the story went after the girls were removed from their home in dramatic circumstances and return to Italy . What had led up to the removal of the four sisters in Australia and their return to Italy was the fact that their mother had taken them from their home in Italy on a 'vacation' and never returned, claiming the girls' father Tomaso was an abuser . Laura Garrett (pictured) has consistently maintained that she was removing her daughters from Italy back to Australia for their own safety . The four Vinceni girls miss Australia and their mother, but they are happy and calm girls in contrast to the dramatic and hysterical scenes in which they were removed from Australia in late 2012 . 'They are really well, really centred and settled. 'They are elegant, gracious, reserved and studious,' 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown told Daily Mail Australia. 'They are very calm.' Tara said the girls were somewhat aware of the hysteria the distressing scenes of their exit caused and 'have a bit of regret about how they handled it ... so public and being so vehement, but they were manipulated'. The girls are living positive and fruitful lives, attending school six days a week, talking about what they will study at university and going out with their Italian boyfriends in Florence. 'They speak with their mother every night and their father believes it is best for them to have both parents in their lives,' Brown said. Despite claims by the girls' mother that they were not happy in Italy, the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with their father Tomaso. 'They are still children who have seen a very bitter custody fight and ultimately they would like to live with both of their parents.' This scene of one of the Tomaso girls in apparent distress outside her father's villa in Florence after the four sisters were taken back from Australia to Italy . Emily and Claire Vincenti (pictured) are now aged 16 and 17 and are living in Italy with their father . The story was that the girls had been taken from their abusive father back in Italy to hide out in Australia and now they were being sent back to the 'monster' against their will. The scenes of the girl's forced return caused widespread outcry, particularly as the girls' mother portrayed the cruelty of the Dad, and the girls -  then aged nine to 14 years old - frightened and distraught. That was in 2012 and it seemed unbelievable to many Australians who watched the scenes play out that the girls were legally being returned to their Italian father as approved under Italian law. What had been lost in the drama was the fact that the four sisters had earlier been taken by their mother from Italy without the knowledge or permission of that father, Tomaso Vincenti, and that the girls had been born in Italy and spent the greater part of their young lives there. Now 60 Minutes has returned to the village near Florence where the girls have been living with their Italian Dad and interview the two elder girls, Emily and Claire Vincenti and talked to them about their lives and the dramatic circumstances in which they were apparently wrenched from their mother, Laura Garrett. Emily and Claire talked about their parents and were filmed going out with their Italian boyfriends in Florence . The four Vinceni girls miss Australia and their mother, but appear happy and calm in contrast to the dramatic and hysterical scenes in which they were removed from Australian in late 2012 . The dramatic turn in the lives of the Vincenti girls began in 2010, when they left Italy ostensibly just for  month's holiday back in Australia, with their mother's family on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. Laura Garrett and Tomaso Vincenti had met when she was a schoolgirl and had gone to Italy as an exchange student. Her host family was Tomaso's parents and Laura and Tomaso fell in love. Laura became pregnant and the pair married. Ms Garrett gave birth to four healthy girls, but in 2007 when the youngest was only around  four years old she split from Tomaso. Under Italian law, both parents were granted equal custody. In 2010, Laura told Tomaso she wanted to take the girls back to Australia for a vacation. Ms Garrett told the Australian embassy in Italian entirely different story, that she was fleeing an abusive husband and father and she needed their assistance. Despite claims by the girls' mother than they were not happy in Italy, the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with father Tomaso . Once back in Australia, Ms Garrett and her daughters settled down to life in Queensland for two years, until the dramatic scenes which saw them returned to Italy. Now aged twelve to 17, the young women behave in complete contrast to the screaming, hysterical girls captured on camera in 2012. Just a day after being taken to their father's villa on the outskirts of Florence, the two older girls were filmed running to the front gates when they saw media camped outside and pleaded for reporters to help them return to Australia. The eldest girl was taken back inside by her father, while her sister clung to the gate as her grandmother urged her to return inside. She held onto the gate for an hour, during which local police and social workers arrived. The girls had not seen their mother since they left Australia, but after 60 Minutes went to Italy to film the story, Laura Garrett  has subsequently turned up for a three-day visit. Ms Garrett has previously said in the years since her daughter's return to Italy that the girls were unhappy. 'They don't seem to be settling,' she said in 2013. 'I keep getting constant requests from them to come home.' Tara Brown said the girls loved Australia and missed it, but they were calmly getting on with their lives and planning their immediate futures in Italy.

"Christian refugees have revealed how they linked arms to form a 'human chain' in a desperate bid to stop Muslim migrants throwing them into the sea after an argument about religion. A group of 15 men were arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate'.last week after 12 Christians from Ghana and Nigeria were allegedly thrown off a rubber dinghy into the Mediterranean Sea. Survivors from the boat, made up of 105 migrants from diverse religions and ethnicities, have now claimed the men tried to throw other Christians off the side of the vessel after an argument about religion - but were prevented because they huddled together to create a human chain. Scroll down for video . A Christian migrant told how he and others formed a 'human chain' to stop Muslim men who were allegedly trying to throw them overboard. Pictured: A migrant looks on after disembarking from a tug boat in Trapani . Fifteen men were arrested on suspicion of 'multiple aggravated murder motivated by religious hate'.last week after 12 Christian men from Ghana and Nigeria were allegedly thrown into the Mediterranean Sea . Yeboah, from Ghana, told police in Palmero that he boarded a dinghy in Libya heading to Sicily last Saturday and said the men threw three of his friends and six others into the water. He said: ‘About a day and a half into the crossing, at a certain point some Muslims started to rail against us Christians just because we practiced a different religion. 'Many said that they should throw us into the sea. After the threats we found ourselves in open sea and not long after they started to throw some Christians in the sea.’ He added: 'They tried to throw me and the other Christians still on board as well but they didn't manage to because we held onto the boat and clung onto each other', according to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. 'We resisted for an hour and only stopped when the rescue boat arrived.’ Another survivor Augustin told the newspaper that one of the alleged killers was bitten on his foot by one of the people he had thrown overboard, which helped police identify him. He said: ‘On Sunday evening spontaneously, the people that spoke French began to rage against the Ghanaians and the Nigerians. The men were allegedly killed more than a day into the journey, when an argument started about religion. Pictured: Migrants are transferred to holding centres after landing in Augusta's port, near Siracusa, Sicily . 'I don’t know why maybe because there were too many of us on board. One of us understood what they were saying that they wanted to throw us into the sea. 'Soon afterwards they threw three Nigerians and six Ghanaians into the sea, after desperate attempts by each one not to be thrown overboard.' Augustin added that each victim was beaten first, and that he saw each one drown because every time someone was thrown overboard the driver stopped the dingy. The 15 migrants arrested over the attack on their arrival in Palermo are from the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau. The police statement said their motive for the attack was that the victims 'professed the Christian faith while the aggressors were Muslim.' The revelation about last week's incident follows news than more than 700 migrants are feared dead after a boat heading for Malta sank in the Mediterranean this weekend. A rescue operation coordinated by the Italian coast guard involving 18 ships is still underway in the hopes of rescuing more people from the midnight sinking off the Libyan coast, 120 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa.","Boat travelling from Libya to Sicily when 12 Christians thrown overboard .

"The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office falsified the training and firearms records of the millionaire reserve deputy who shot dead an unarmed suspect by mistake, claim sources within the department. They allege that at least three of 73-year-old Robert Bates' supervisors were removed from their posts when they refused to sign off on forged field training hours - and that he was not fit to police the streets. The allegations of corruption published in the Tulsa World come after claims the wealthy CEO 'paid to play cop', which ultimately led to the events of April 2 when he fired his handgun instead of his Taser, killing 44-year-old Eric Harris. Scroll Down for Video . Allegations of corruption: Robert Bates, (right), arrives at the Tulsa County Jail with his attorney, Clark Brewster on Tuesday . The shocking claims come in the same week that Bates turned himself to face charges of second-degree manslaughter for Harris' death. Charged: Robert Bates is free on $25,000 bail and is charged with second-degree manslaughter for the death of Eric Harris on April 2 . The sources who spoke to Tulsa World claim that the reserve deputy was not properly trained to be an armed deputy, despite Sheriff Stanley Glanz saying otherwise. Indeed, Sheriff Glanz and Bates' own legal team have repeatedly produced records which they claim prove he was an 'advanced reserve' and had undergone 480 hours training. However, when asked to produced proof that Bates was certified to use three weapons, including the revolver he fired at Harris, the Sheriff's Office say they have been unable to find the paperwork. The office claims that the deputy who certified Bates has now moved on to work for the Secret Service. 'We can't find the records that she supposedly turned in,' said Glanz according to the Tulsa World. 'So we are going to talk to her to find out if for sure he's been qualified with those weapons.' The Tulsa World have said that they heard 'almost immediately' after the shooting that Bates was allegedly not qualified to be a deputy and that his records had been pushed through the office. The Tulsa World claims to have seen a whole list of the courses that Bates got credit for, but the names of his supervisors have been redacted - a practice they said they had never seen for a public official in Oklahoma. Charged: Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot Harris (left, in a previous mug shot) dead, according to Tulsa police. Bates is classified as an advanced deputy . Redacted: These are the official records of Robert Bates' training - which the Tulsa World is claiming have been beefed up . One of the reporters at the paper told CNN that they are demanding the office turn over the names. 'You would think the sheriff's office, if in fact there has been no pressure applied, no falsification of records, that they would be forthcoming with these documents,' she told CNN's 'New Day.' 'We've asked for them. They've said they don't believe they're public records.' Undersheriff Tim Albin has vehemently denied that the records that qualify Bates are false. 'The training record speaks for itself. I have absolutely no knowledge of what you are talking about,' Albin said to Tulsa World. 'There aren't any secrets in law enforcement. Zero. Those types of issues would have come up.' Bates, who shot dead Harris during a botched undercover operation after a brief struggle is currently free on $25,000 bail. Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' Video from the incident reveals that as soon as Bates realized he had shot Harris he dropped his gun and immediately said, 'Oh I shot him! I'm sorry.' Bates is classified by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office as an 'advanced reserve'. This means that he went through 480 hours training of the 'Field Training Officer' or FTO. The Harris family legal team say they believe these traning records are a lie and do not exist. Indeed, already questions have been raised as to the authenticity of Bates' records. The Sheriff's Office have previously said that Bates joined the force in 2008, but when he was asked he said he joined in 2007. In his statement to the Tulsa investigators, Bates said he had previously attended a five-day homicide school in Dallas and also received 'active shooter response training' with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona. He also claims to have been involved in 'at least 100 other' assignments. The corruption allegations come as it emerged that Bates contributed $2,500 to Sheriff Glanz's re-election campaign and that he has donated vehicles and video to the office. However, Glanz has denied that Bates 'paid to play a cop'. 'No matter how you cut it up, Deputy Bates met all the criteria on the Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training to be in the role that he was in,' he said to CNN.","Tulsa County Sheriff's Office falsified Robert Bates' training claim sources within the department .

"An Ohio man who trained with al-Qaeda terrorist tried to play off his time abroad as a harmless holiday when questioned by his friends, authorities said. 'I'm chilling in Istanbul,' Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud wrote a high school friend on Facebook. 'Just a vacation.' But federal prosecutors charging Mohamud with supporting terrorism and making false statements say he was actually being instructed to carry out a terrorist act in the United States. Scroll down for video . Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, 23, faces charges for attempting to provide and providing material support to terrorists, attempting to provide and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and making false statements to the FBI . He pleaded not guilty to the charges Friday in a Columbus . federal court. Mohamud, 23, a naturalized American, had . been instructed by a Muslim cleric to return to the United . States and carry out an act of terrorism, a federal indictment . said. It said Mohamud had told an associate that he wanted to go . to a military base in Texas and 'kill three or four American . soldiers execution-style.' Before traveling from the United States to Syria, Mohamud . had posted material on social media promoting symbols of the . Islamic State militant group, the indictment said. However, a law enforcement official told Reuters that once . in Syria Mohamud and his brother, Aden, trained with the Nusra . Front, the local affiliate of al Qaeda. In Syria he sent videos of himself to an unnamed person, the . indictment said. In one video, he pointed to a gun in a holster . on his hip ,and in another he stood in front of a white house . with a black flag on it. Mohamud's brother, Abdifatah Aden, was killed fighting with the Nusra Front, . according to the indictment. NBC reports that a 17-year-old cousin of Mohamud's in the United Kingdom said that Mohamud's older brother had arrived in Syria 'to help out the oppressed Muslims there.' However neither brother showed any signs of hating their adopted country. '(Mohamud) loved Americans,"" he said. 'He was one of them.' Yet another brother, Abdiqani Aden, has also been arrested and after being accused of making a threatening gesture at a guard while visiting his brother in prison. Such accusations are completely foreign to friend Mohamed Elrayah, who had gotten the 'I'm chilling' years after the two lost touch. 'He did normal things — basketball, go to the park, go to the movies on Fridays,' Elrayah told NBC News. 'Everyone loved being around him. He was a nice person.' Elrayah, three years Mohamud's senior at school, did not recall the accused terrorist-in-training as a particularly religious man when they first met. However in 2011, he says he say his friend growing a long beard. 'I asked him about it and he said, 'Well, I'm kind of religious now,'' Elrayah told reporters, adding that he did not see the new religious interest a sign of being radicalized. In fact, he said he was astonished to hear of the charges. 'I would like to ask him, 'What happened?' I just keep thinking, 'What happened to this kid?'' Elrayah told reporters. Mohamud's friends expressed shock the man they knew as a normal, likable student would want to harm the country they believed he'd embraced as him home . Upon his return to the United States, authorities said, Mohamud told . an unidentified person that while in Syria, he had been trained . in shooting weapons, breaking into houses, using explosives and . engaging in hand-to-hand combat. According to the indictment, Mohamud 'wanted to kill . Americans, and specifically wanted to target armed forces, . police officers or any uniformed individuals.' The indictment . said Mohamud's plan was to attack a U.S. military base but that . he also had a backup plan to attack a prison. Mohamud also waived a detention hearing on Friday, and will . remain in custody, court documents said. His trial is set for . June 22. The three brother's mother was widowed last year, and is struggling to comprehend what has happened in her family. 'It's tragic for her,' said Hassan Omar, director of the Somali Community Association of Ohio. The larger Somali community in the area is also worried about how this will reflect on the nation's second-biggest community of such immigrants outside of Minnesota. Roughly half-a-dozen men there were indicted last week after being accused of working to support ISIS. 'We came barehanded from refugee camps. We created 4,000 businesses in Columbus. We have 3,000 or 4,000 kids who have graduated from high school and college,' Omar told NBC. He added: 'This kind of terrorist, or ISIS or Shabab is destroying our image.'","Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, 23, is charged with supporting terrorism and making false statements by federal prosecutors .

"Shane Dunn, 25, from Tunbridge Wells, stabbed victim Ian Garrod, 55, in the neck after meeting on the gay dating app Grindr . A drug-fuelled thug calling himself 'Gypsy Lad' slashed a middle-aged man around the throat with a kitchen knife after meeting him on the gay dating app Grindr. Shane Dunn, 25, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, carried out the attack after going back to Ian Garrod's home in Medway for sex in September last year. But when the 55-year-old sat on the bed, Dunn - who was said to be 'cool as a cucumber' during the attack - stabbed him  in the throat. Dunn, who was high on Class A Mephedrone, then left Mr Garrod in fear of his life, before fleeing from the property with his victim's wallet, iPhone, iPad and jewellery. The callous attacker even pretended to call an ambulance for his victim, but instead left him for dead with a 6cm-deep wound. He was later caught after police examined two cigarette butts found in Mr Garrod's garden - both of which had DNA linking to the attacker. Luckily, Mr Garrod's housemate returned the the property and called an ambulance. The court heard it was only by the skill of a surgeon at Medway Maritime Hospital that the victim's life was saved. Dunn has now been jailed for 12 years after being found guilty of wounding with intent. He was cleared by a jury of attempted murder. Judge Jeremy Carey told Dunn he had narrowly decided against finding him dangerous, which would have led to an extended sentence. Judge Carey said Dunn was convicted of the wounding charge 'on the clearest evidence'. He said: 'You asserted you effectively were not the person who stabbed Ian Garrod and the jury found on the evidence you were and you intended to cause him really serious harm. 'It was hardly surprising since you cut his throat to a depth of 6cm. Only by the skill of a surgeon at Medway Maritime Hospital the flow of the blood was clipped and stemmed. 'Otherwise, you would have been convicted of murder.' The judge said there were 'inevitable uncertainties' about what happened that night. He continued: 'I am quite sure you did not attend there with the intention of committing acts of violence. I am quite sure something happened that night that caused you to lose it. Maidstone Crown Court heard how Dunn was caught after police examined two cigarette butts found in Mr Garrod's garden - both of which had DNA linking to the attacker . 'You say you don't remember. I don't know if you do or not. You are not a man prone to extreme violence. 'I think by a combination of a Class A drug you used that night and the revelation of something possibly to do with HIV on the part of Mr Garrod you lost it. 'You got a knife from the block and went upstairs and, cool as a cucumber, you slit his throat. Anyone listening to this must realise how serious this offending is. 'You made your position worse. You pretended to call and ambulance and stole items from him. It was a particularly callous thing to do to a man who lying bleeding towards fatality.' Judge Carey added: 'I am not going to make any comment about Grindr - about people who are willing to take in others they hardly know and have relations with them when drugs have been smoked. It doesn't assist anyone but it is a pretty shocking state of affairs.' Dunn, who has now been jailed for 12 years over the attack, called himself Gypsy Boy on the dating app . Dunn, who had previously been to Mr Garrod's home for a sex session, said in evidence he had 'memory blank' after being injected with Mephedrone. During his evidence he told the court he went to see Mr Garrod because he knew he could get drugs and sex. He said: 'At some point I had a glass of water and a couple of cigarettes. He tied my arm with an elastic thing he had and waited for my vein to come up, and he injected. 'I immediately felt really strange, like I wanted to be sick and like I don't know what I was doing. 'The last thing I remember him saying to me was: ""Just sit up straight and don't panic"". The next thing I remember is waking up in my bed at about 4pm. I don't remember how I got home.' Asked if he caused the wound, he replied: 'I can't answer that.' During his trial at Maidstone Crown Court Deborah Charles, prosecuting said Dunn had pretended to call an ambulance after the attack. She said: 'Mr Garrod felt as if someone had slapped him in the neck. 'He put his hand up to his neck and realised it was covered in blood. He never saw the weapon coming towards him. It happened too quickly. 'He just thought the defendant was leaning towards him, perhaps to kiss him or carry on what they were doing. 'Mr Garrod was begging him to call an ambulance. Mr Dunn pretended to do just that. He pretended to make a call and said an ambulance was coming. 'Mr Garrod was left lying on the bed with a wound that was life threatening.' At the time of the alleged attack Mr Garrod was living with a friend with whom he had previously been in a relationship. Miss Charles said Mr Garrod had spent the previous night with another man before meeting Dunn on the dating app. When Dunn arrived at his home he was said to have brought a drug with him which they both took. The court heard Mr Garrod regularly used a drug called Tina, a type of crystal meth, for sexual encounters.","Shane Dunn, 25, from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, attacked Ian Garrod, 55 .

"All Facebook users have them - those friends who are so in love with their newborn baby they clog up your news feed with constant doting updates. But one group of women were so fed up with their friend's 'running commentary' they went to the extreme measure of putting an anonymous letter in her mailbox demanding she give everyone 'a break'. Jade Ruthven, 33, of Perth, Western Australia, was shocked when she found the scathing note claiming to be from ‘a few of the girls’, cruelly criticising her for posting photos of her six-month-old daughter Addison on Facebook. ‘Dear Jade, I have got together with a few of the girls and we are all SO OVER your running commentary on your life and every single thing Addy does,’ the letter begins. ‘We all have kids that we are besotted with ... But we don’t ram it down everyone else’s neck!!!’ Jade Ruthven, 33, of Perth, Western Australia, was shocked when she found a scathing note  criticising her for posting too many photos of her six-month-old daughter Addison on Facebook . Jade Ruthven was devastated when she received the  unsigned letter in her mailbox . As the letter continues, the typos and punctuation become more intense and frequent. ‘She crawls off the mat – we DON”T care!!!!! She’s six months old – BIG DEAL!!!! ‘Stop and think – if every mother posted all that cr*p about their kid – I’m sure you’d get over it pretty quickly.’ The author claims the rant was written on behalf of everyone who views Jade’s Facebook posts. ‘I guess you are just p***ing a lot of people off with all your “Addy this and Addy that”. ‘We all thought it might ease off after the first month but it hasn’t,’ the letter continues. ‘Not everyone is as interested as you are about what Addy does so give us all a break. ‘We’re doing this to let you know what people really think.’ The dental hygienist still doesn’t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can’t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty . Jade and her husband Ryan (pictured with their daughter Addison) were both very angry but chose to try and see the funny side of the ridiculous letter . Jade sent the letter to comedian Em Rusciano, who posted it to her Facebook page and described it as 'next-level mean' in an opinion piece for news.com.au. For Jade the letter came completely out of the blue and was like a slap in the face, particularly as she is a first-time mother trying to find her feet. ‘I was actually excited when I checked the mail and saw a hand written envelope thinking it was an invite. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect what was in it!’ Jade told Daily Mail Australia. ‘At first I was in shock and thought this letter must be a joke. I read it and re-read it about four times. ‘I was shaking with anger and shock to think a so-called friend of mine could be so heartless and gutless to not even sign their name.’ The dental hygienist still doesn’t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can’t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty. ‘To be honest I have no idea why anyone would do this to me. I don’t think I have had an enemy in my whole life,’ she said. ‘My husband Ryan was just as angry as me but we soon decided to laugh it off as a bad joke. Jade and her friends responded by creating the hashtag #Addyspam and cheekily posting a stream of photos of the beautiful bub on Facebook - sending a strong message to the hateful author . Jade was accused of 'p***ing' everybody off by posting too many photos of her baby daughter on Facebook . ‘These people clearly have too much time on their hands to sit and chat about my Facebook usage. It’s quite sad really.’ The cruel nature of the letter spurred Jade to stand up for herself. She refused to bow down to the bullies. ‘To have someone do this to me, in truth, makes me feel sick,’ said Jade. ‘Lucky for me I am a strong, healthy person. Being a first time mum is hard enough to get your head around but for someone who was feeling alone or who was struggling with the challenges of motherhood this could have had terrible consequences. ‘But it takes a lot more to keep me down than a nasty letter!’ Jade wants the coward author to know their nasty act has not brought her down. She has also vowed to continue to post photos of her treasured baby. ‘I have had people contact me saying if this had happened to them at this time in their bub’s life, it would have sent them over the edge. ‘I am glad I was the one that got this letter, not someone in a more vulnerable state.’ Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has ‘backfired’, as she is ‘feeling more loved and supported than ever’ Jade insists that not for one minute did she consider changing her behaviour on Facebook. Instead, she decided to deal with the bullies with a sense of humour. ‘No way did I feel self-conscious or consider changing my online activity,’ she said. 'That’s how I think this person can’t be that close to me. If they were they would know I would never take this lying down, start crying in the corner and then take myself off Facebook. ’In fact my friends and I started a hashtag, #Addyspam and posted pics of Addy on Facebook all night long!’ Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has ‘backfired’, as she is ‘feeling more loved and supported than ever’.

"The inaugural top spots in the album rankings and the two top places in the singles list have been claimed by Noel Gallagher, above . It could be time to dust off the turntables as vinyl records are revealed to be enjoying a startling revival. Last year saw more than one million albums sold on vinyl for the first time in almost two decades after seven years of steady growth. Sales are expected to hit two million this year and, in recognition of this trend, the UK’s first official weekly vinyl chart has been established. The inaugural top spots in the album rankings and the two top places in the singles list have been claimed by Noel Gallagher, 47. Seemingly earning himself a reputation as the most popular artist on vinyl, Gallagher can also claim the most successful album of the last 20 years on the format, with Oasis’s 1995 offering (What’s the Story) Morning Glory?. Perhaps proof that good music is timeless, classic releases by Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and David Bowie have all also landed among the current top tens. The Official Vinyl Charts have been released today by the Official Charts Company to mark Record Store Day, which seeks to celebrate independent record stores, and will be available on their website. Martin Talbot, Official Charts Company chief executive, said: ‘With vinyl album sales up by almost 70 percent already this year, vinyl junkies could well have snapped up two million units by the end of this year – an extraordinary number, if you consider sales were one-tenth of that just six years ago. This growth underlines the continuing resurgence of this much-loved format, whether you’re a fan of Arctic Monkeys, Noel Gallagher, Led Zeppelin or David Bowie.’ Arctic Monkeys took the top spot for the biggest selling vinyl album of the decade with their fifth and most recent album AM (lead singer Alex Turner above) Last year saw almost 1.3million vinyl albums sold, compared to 56million CDs and just under 6,000 cassette tapes. Although this only made up 1.5 percent of all album sales, it is the largest number since 1995, when the figure was slightly over 1.4million compared to less than 40million CDs and 24million tapes. While still a way off the all-time high of 92million vinyl LPs sold in 1975, by breaking through the one million mark, 2014 showed a clear improvement on 2007’ s low point of 205,000. Vinyl was the most popular format for music until 1985, when it was overtaken by cassettes. While the mainstream charts are dominated by contemporary releases, the first vinyl charts see older music also competing for places. In the album chart, Led Zeppelin’s Physical Graffiti, which reached number one when it was released in 1975, claim second place behind Gallagher. Four Symbols, the band’s release from four years earlier also comes in at number ten. The singles chart reveals the same trend, with David Bowie’s 1975 track Young Americans coming in third. The new figures have also revealed the most popular albums and singles of the decade. David Bowie’s Life on Mars, Love Me Do by The Beatles and Lady Gaga’s Telephone take the top three spots in the singles chart, with Paul Weller and Morrissey filling out the top five. In the listing of the biggest selling albums of the decade, Pink Floyd make two appearances in the top five with The Dark Side of the Moon and The Endless River. Arctic Monkeys take the top spot with their fifth and most recent album AM.","First official weekly vinyl chart established as annual sales reach 2 million .

"A 39-year-old man allegedly impregnated his 17-year-old stepdaughter who gave birth alone at home while looking after her three-year-old sister, who then died in her care. Jondrew Lachaux, from Las Vegas, is married to the teenager's mother 38-year-old Kellie Phillips - they have six children together while the teen is from another relationship. Lachaux allegedly sexually assaulted the teenager and she had become pregnant, but she did not know, reports the Review Journal. A 39-year-old man impregnated his 17-year-old stepdaughter who gave birth alone at home while looking after her three-year-old sister, who then died in her care. Jondrew Lachaux (right) is married to the teenager's mother 38-year-old Kellie Phillips, (left) and assaulted her teen daughter . In August, Lachaux and Phillips decided to go on a road trip in California for over six months. They rented a vehicle which did not have enough space for all the family, so they left the teen and her three-year-old sister behind. Police said the pair left the teen, who can not be named, with food and medication for the three-year-old who had breathing problems. But while they were away, the teen gave birth in her mom's bed - she did not have any medical help and did not take the newborn to the hospital. The arrest report states she told police her mother was not aware that she was raped or pregnant. The teen ran out of food and began to suffer from malnutrition along with her baby and her three-year-old sister. She stopped breastfeeding after two months because she was so undernourished and switched to baby formula. It was during this period that the three-year-old died - the cause of the death is under investigation. The teen was left alone at the home in Las Vegas (pictured). She gave birth in her mom's bed - she did not have any medical help and did not take the newborn to the hospital . The teen girl said after the child died she tried to text Lachaux and her mother, but they did not respond for two weeks . The teen girl said she tried to text Lachaux and her mother, but they did not respond for two weeks, reports 8NewsNow. Police said they asked her why she did not call police and she said Lachaux told her not to call 911. She told them that when she told her stepfather that the body smelt, he allegedly told her to put her little sister in a box. She wrapped the toddler in a pink blanket and put her inside a cardboard box designed to hold a stroller. When he returned on March 28, they moved the box inside a broken car in the garage and then piled pizza boxes on top. Lachaux was allegedly desperate to hide the baby's birth from his wife before she returned and gave the teen some baby formula before kicking her and the baby out from the home . She went to a supermarket and wandered around for a few hours before walking four miles to McCarran International Airport. She spent the night there with the infant and the next day Lachaux used a fake name to book his stepdaughter a room at a motel near there - she was now only feeding the baby water because the formula had run out. Upon discovering his step-daughter had given birth, Lachaux kicked her out. She wandered the streets and the next day Lachaux used a fake name to book his stepdaughter a room at a motel (pictured) Lachaux arranged to meet her at McCarran on April 1, but airport staff called 911 when the baby began having problems, the report said. The baby was taken to Sunrise Hospital Medical Center in a critical condition and staff alerted police. The baby is now doing well in the hospital. Lachaux faces three counts of child abuse with substantial bodily harm or death, and one count of destroying or concealing evidence - bail is set at $1 million. Phillips who turned herself in after a police search, faces two counts of child abuse with substantial bodily harm or death. Her five children, aged between one and nine, are now in Child Protective Services. The 17-year-old faces one count of child abuse with substantial bodily harm or death and one count of destroying or concealing evidence. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said: 'She's a juvenile, she's 17 years old. Does she need services? Does she need treatment by the juvenile system? Or should she be punished for her actions?'","Jondrew Lachaux is married to the teenager's mother Kellie Phillips .

"American Apparel, the controversial retailer known for its sexually suggestive advertising strategy, is looking to alter its risqué image by debuting a 'pro-women' ad campaign featuring its female staffers. The first print ad, which shows images of various female American Apparel employees, who are identified by their first names and their start date at the company in small print below their pictures, has the words 'Hello Ladies' emblazoned across the page and appeared in the latest issue of Vice. 'Women have always been in charge at American Apparel,' the ad reads. ‘In fact, women make up 55per cent of our global workforce (sorry, guys) and an even higher percentage of our leadership and executive roles. This structure is incredibly (and unfortunately) rare in the corporate world.' Major rebranding: Controversial retailer American Apparel debuted a new 'pro-women' ad campaign featuring this image of three female employees from the company . New message: The brand also shared images from the campaign on its Instagram account for International Women's Day . The images featured in the ad were also posted on the company's Instagram account last month in celebration of International Women's Day with more than 16,000 people liking the photo collage. American Apparel confirmed to WWD that the ad only has thus far only appeared in Vice, and the outlet noted that it was an interesting choice for the company to make because the magazine 'isn’t exactly known as female friendly'. 'We have had a great relationship with Vice for years and plan on continuing to work closely with them on future campaigns and partnerships,' American Apparel's senior vice president of marketing Cynthia Erland told WWD . Smiling faces: According to the ad, 55per cent of American Apparel's staffers are women . Work appropriate: These female employees were photographed wearing modest button-down shirts, which is a far cry from the brand's more sexually explicit ads . But WWD went on to add that it was 'likely not a coincidence' that the ad ran in first issue helmed by Vice's new female editor-in-chief Ellis Jones. Before the Los Angeles-based company's founder and former CEO Dov Charney was ousted in December following a string of sexual harassment lawsuits, the retailer had a history of using boundary-pushing, sexually provocative ads featuring fresh-faced girls to sell its clothing. Now that Dov has since been replaced by Paula Schneider, the images have been significantly toned down as the brand rethinks its previous marketing strategy. New attitude: The company, which has a history of using sexually proactive ads like this one, is rethinking its marketing strategy under the helm of the American Apparel's new CEO Paula Schneider . American Apparel has also started airbrushing out pubic hair and nipples from lingerie models in attempt to make the brand 'less pornographic'. But controversy continues to follow the company. The brand came under fire again after a leaked email written on March 18 by casting agent Phira Luon said the company would be hiring real models not 'Instagram Hoes' or 'THOTS', which is an acronym meaning 'That ho over there'. Both American Apparel and Phira publicly apologized for the email, and the brand posted an image of 'curvier models' to its Facebook page as a means of proving the sentiment in the email did not reflect the company’s general ethos, writing: 'This is American Apparel, always has been and always will be. We love all of our models, all shapes and sizes. #welovediversity #weloveyouall! [sic]'","The print ad ran in the most recent issue of Vice magazine .

"A convicted murderer who escaped prison by beating a guard unconscious and stealing his uniform, keys and SUV has been captured in Chicago, ending a nearly three-day manhunt. Kamron Taylor was caught in South Side, Chicago, with a loaded gun on Friday night after police received a tip off describing a man with the name 'Gertrude' tattooed to his neck. Officers chased Taylor three blocks before he was apprehended. He is being held on weapons charges until he can be turned over to the Kankakee County Sheriff's Office, Chicago police said. Scroll down for video . Recaptured: Kamron Taylor is in custody after breaking free from jail by beating a guard unconscious and fleeing in his uniform. He had been waiting to be sentenced after a judge convicted him of murder . Fears: It was feared Taylor planned to hunt down the family of his victim, Nelson Williams Jr. In February, he shouted at the family, 'I'm going to get you mother*******'  (pictured) Disguised: He was captured on a surveillance camera fleeing the Kankakee jail dressed in a guard's uniform . 'I think I can speak for ... everyone who's been involved: tired, I guess is the word,' Kankakee County Sheriff Timothy Bukowski told reporters Saturday in summing up the frenzied search. Taylor had been awaiting sentencing at Jerome Combs Detention Center in Kankakee, Illinois, for the murder of Nelson Williams Jr. But on Tuesday he attacked a guard and fled in disguise. It came just days after he shouted at the victim's family in court: 'I'm going to get you mother*******.' 'As I go home every night, I figure he might ambush me like he did my son,' the victim's father, Nelson Williams Sr, told WLS-TV on Thursday. Taylor, who has a history of escape attempts, fled from the Jerome Combs Detention Center in Kankakee at about 3am Wednesday. He somehow escaped from his cell, hid inside the facility, then beat and choked the guard who was making rounds, said Kankakee County Sheriff Timothy Bukowski. Escaped: The 23-year-old Taylor was awaiting sentencing for the June 2013 murder of Nelson Williams Jr, 21 (right), when authorities say he beat a guard unconscious, took his keys and uniform and sped off in his SUV . Taylor, a 23-year-old from Kankakee, is considered armed and dangerous, the sheriff said. He was convicted of first-degree murder in February in the June 2013 death of Nelson Williams Jr, 21, and faces a sentence of 45 years to life in prison. Sheriff's officials believe someone may be helping Taylor hide. They warned the public that harboring a fugitive is a criminal offense that will be prosecuted. A $7,500 reward is now being offered for information leading to Taylor's arrest. Twenty-eight officers have fanned out across the county, searching dozens of residences with the help of dogs and surveillance helicopters above. Analysts from the Illinois State Police have been mapping out lists of Taylor's relatives and associates, examining his past phone conversations and jail visitation records to help lead investigators to probable locations where the fugitive might be hiding out. As of Friday morning, officers armed with rifles have searched about 50 home in eastern Illinois . Bukowski said investigators were also considering the possibility that Taylor could have fled elsewhere. Besides hunting him down, investigators were eager to determine how Taylor got free in what was the first successful escape from the decade-old lockup housing about 450 detainees. 'The speculation on my part is somebody didn't do their job properly,' Bukowski said. After getting free of his two-man cell in a lockdown unit, where he has been awaiting sentencing, Taylor hid out and attacked the guard, a military veteran with 10 years of correctional experience, Bukowski said. By wearing the guard's uniform, Taylor was able to fool other guards in a master control room who opened three sets of doors for him after visual verification by surveillance video, Bukowski said. Wanted: A $1,000 reward is being offered by police for any information that leads to Taylor's capture . Dangerous: A woman rushes to her car in Kankakee, Ill., Wednesday, April 1, 2015, after being told by police that officers were searching in the area for prison escapee Kamron T. Taylor . Following the trail: Police approach a vehicle with guns drawn that convicted murderer Kamron T. Taylor stole during his escape . Once outside, the suspect repeatedly pressed the guard's key fob to locate his Chevrolet Equinox in a parking lot and drive away. Authorities didn't learn of the escape until about 30 minutes later, when jail staff found the wounded officer, who is hospitalized in intensive care with head wounds. 'He was in and out of consciousness, unable to understand the questions that were given to him,' Bukowski said of the guard at a news conference. A few hours after sunrise, officers found the abandoned SUV in a residential area of Kankakee and approached the vehicle with their guns drawn. But Taylor was nowhere to be found and it wasn't clear whether he fled on foot or someone picked him up in another vehicle, the sheriff said. Safe and well: Authorities say they've found a 15-year-old girl, Savannah Bell, who they had thought to be in the company of convicted murderer who escaped from jail. At one point Wednesday, authorities issued an alert for a 15-year-old girl, Savannah Bell, who they believed was with Taylor. Illinois State Police later announced the girl had been found, but did not say where or how officials found her or whether she had been with Taylor. Jail staffing levels and procedures will be re-examined, but Bukowski said Taylor's history of violence and previous escape attempts didn't necessarily single him out for stricter security measures. 'It raises an alert, I guess,' he said. 'But you figure the people that are locked up in our facility aren't altar boys and you take certain precautions for all of them. And you can't become complacent with anybody ... especially a murderer.' Bukowski told reporters that the detention center has lost between 15 and 20 per cent of its staff, forcing guards to work extra hours in a change that he said did not go unnoticed by the 450 inmates. Asked whether he thought staffing at the jail was adequate, Bukowski told reporters he would like to see the levels that pre-dated the budget cuts, acknowledging that guards working overtime 'get tired and they start to make mistakes.' 'The inmates could see them working a double shift and see that they were tired,' he said. 'So all those factors contribute to what's going on.' He said budget cuts also got in the way of planned security enhancements, but he refused to go into specifics on that or precise staffing numbers, saying 'the inmates already know too much.' During his trial in February, Taylor tried to escape from the courthouse minutes after hearing the guilty verdict. Several sheriff's deputies and bailiffs wrestled him to the ground, and Taylor shouted expletives at the gallery as they led him away, according to a report in The (Kankakee) Daily Journal. He also escaped briefly after his arrest in 2013 but was detained several blocks away, the newspaper reported at the time. Taylor was found guilty of the June 2013 shooting death of 21-year-old Nelson Williams Jr. during a botched robbery at Williams' home in Kankakee. Online court records show his sentencing is scheduled for May 11.","Kamron Taylor was waiting to be sentenced for the 2013 murder of Nelson Williams Jr, 21 .

"Help for Heroes has launched a fundraising drive to keep World War II veteran Robert Clark in his own home after a London council refused to pay for his ongoing care. Brent Council said it was no longer able to afford to pay for a live-in carer to stay with the 96-year-old former prisoner of war, despite the fact that Mr Clark spent his £50,000 life savings on contributing to his care. Now, the council want to move Mr Clark from the house he has lived in for the past 50 years into a care home because they claim it is cheaper. Scroll down for video . Help for Heroes has given Robbie Clark, pictured, an emergency grant so he can remain at home in London . The JustGiving paged more than half of the £5,000 target within a couple of hours of it going live this morning . However, Help for Heroes has launched its own JustGiving page to help Mr Clark. The charity has already given Mr Clark and emergency grant to fund his immediate care needs, but they are seeking the public's help to secure his future. They have so far raised £2,736.22 of the £5,000 needed. Any extra money will go towards the care of other former servicemen and women in need of assistance. Linda Walton, head of grants at Help for Heroes, said: 'Help for Heroes is all about supporting those who have been psychologically or physically wounded in service of our country. 'Robbie suffered severe anxiety and distress as a prisoner of war during the Second World War, and it is wrong that he should be subject to these feelings once again. 'We will do everything we can to ensure Robbie gets the support he deserves.' Mr Clark is one of Britain's oldest surviving prisoners of war  - and one of the few British soldiers to survive Hitler's 1,000-mile death march - has been given the emergency grant through the Help for Heroes quick reaction fund. Having spent his savings on home care, Mr Clark, from Brent, north west London, faced being forced out of his home into a residential care home, something he said would 'remind me of being a prisoner of war'. Mr Clark is blind, deaf in one ear and dependent on a wheelchair, suffered 'severe anxiety' when he was a prisoner of war. A total of 165,000 people have signed a petition calling for home help, the charity said. More than £2,500 has been donated on a JustGiving fundraising page. Mr Clark was a gunner in the Durham Light Infantry when he was captured by the Nazis in the North African city of Tobruk in June 1942. He spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Poland, before being forced to join the ‘death march’ in 1945. Hitler ordered thousands of PoWs to march west for four months in extreme winter weather as the Russians advanced from the East. Writing home: Veteran Robert Clark, pictured in 1940, when he was serving with Durham Light Infantry . Robert Clark (front row, second left) pictured on June 21, 1943 at prisoner of war camp Campo PG70 in Italy . After the war, the soldier married his sweetheart Rita and worked as a carpenter. In 1969 the couple moved into the house where he still lives in Burnt Oak, north London. Mrs Clark died in 2010 aged 91. Now a great-great-grandfather and one of Britain’s oldest surviving PoWs, Mr Clark is registered blind, deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair. For the past two years he has used his £50,000 savings to pay towards a £960-a-week live-in carer, while Brent Council contributed £350 a week. But as his money runs out, the council is refusing to increase its funding and Mr Clark may have to go into a care home instead. His son, Mike, who said his home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is not suitable for the pensioner, added: ‘This is causing my father to be very anxious and he is unable to sleep. ‘He’s as good as told me that if he has to move, he’ll just give up on life. Whenever he’s been in hospital, he … pulls the blankets over his head and stops talking. ‘He hates being anywhere which isn’t familiar … going into a care home will be like going back into a prisoner of war camp.’ Despite tens of thousands signing the petition to allow Mr Clark to stay in his own home, Brent Council said they will not increase their funding for a live-in carer. The council’s Phil Porter said: ‘We recognise Mr Clark’s contribution to this country and sincerely empathise with the situation that he and other older people … are in. ‘However … the care package that Mr Clark is choosing is not affordable to council taxpayers given the constraints of local government funding and the need to be consistent for the 2,900 people we support.’ He added: ‘Mr Clark owns his home, so there is absolutely no question of Brent Council evicting him despite what has been suggested in this petition.’ The council said Mr Clark’s needs can be met in a care home for £451 a week. Alternatively, he could choose to receive the same weekly sum and stay at home, but would have to pay the extra amount necessary for a carer. Mr Porter said: ‘We want to find a solution which meets his eligible social care needs, provides value for money for the taxpayer, but also reflects the choices he has made and the additional cost this creates.’ He added that the council had offered ‘a deferred payment which means he doesn’t need to sell his house to pay for his care’. After signatures hit the 127,000 mark this morning, a spokeswoman said: 'Our position hasn't changed since the petition was at 75,000.' Mr Clark’s family reported the case to the Local Government Ombudsman, but the watchdog agreed with the council.","Great-grandfather Robert Clark has lived in the house for 50 years .

"A New Zealand hunter is lucky to be alive after a friend mistook him for a deer and shot him in the back with a .270 rifle.

"Fired: Major General James Post III was fired on Friday after making a treason comment . An Air Force major general has been formally reprimanded and removed from his job for telling a group of officers that talking to Congress in a bid to block retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason,' the Air Force said on Friday. An investigation of remarks by Major General James Post III, who was the vice commander of Air Combat Command, found that his words to some 300 airmen at Nellis Air Force Base on Jan. 10 may have had a 'chilling effect' on some of them, convincing them not to speak with lawmakers. Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said the Air Force action against Post was 'important and correct.' 'Members of Congress must be able to receive unfiltered facts and opinions from service members...,' he said in a statement. 'Attempts to prevent or restrict that communication cannot be allowed.' The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support. The plane has strong supporters among members of Congress who have so far successfully blocked efforts to retire it. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh, himself a former A-10 pilot, has said that given budget and personnel constraints, the Air Force needs to retire the plane to save money and free up people to learn to maintain the new F-35 joint strike fighter. Post made his remarks while fielding questions the airmen. He was asked about the status of the A-10 and began to discuss budget constraints facing the department and the reason for the decision to retire the plane. A-10 retirement: The incident added fuel to a controversy over efforts to retire the A-10,  low-flying, tank-killer aircraft, which is highly regarded by ground troops for its ability to provide close air support . The inspector general's investigation interviewed several witnesses who remembered Post using the word 'treason' to describe efforts to oppose the Air Force leadership's decision to retire the plane, either via a social media campaign or by talking to Congress. In his own written account, Post said he told the group the Air Force didn't want to get rid of the plane but needed to because of budget constraints. He acknowledged using the word 'treason.' General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander. Post issued an apology on Friday and said he did not intend to try to prevent people from talking to lawmakers. Handed in a latter: General Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, gave Post a letter of reprimand due to the findings and removed him from his position as vice commander .","Major General James Post III was fired for saying that the retirement of the A-10 Warthog amounted to 'treason'

Especially dresses,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I might not be going out to an actual work place and interact with people that way but being on a camera - where some days my channel might have over 10,000 channel clicks - I like to look and feel nice. 'But some mornings I might just jump on with a cup of hot tea and a unicorn onesie.' Her love of the video game Call Of Duty has provided her with a new business opportunity . However, not even this can save her from online trolls  and fanatical fans. Bonnie admitted that this was the worst part of the job and has had her computer address and phone number leaked to others.

Unfortunately its everywhere online these days and you can’t bring yourself down by listening to haters. 'I try to focus on the good audience in my streams, they are the ones that make me want to get up in the morning and do what I do.' Bonnie can play the game in the privacy of her own home and still earn some cash . The attractive Bonnie is constantly fending off the attentions of fanatical fans who ask her out on dates .

You start making friends, getting involved with the community and it just became a big part of my life,' she said.

"A popular holiday beach in the north of New South Wales has transformed into something from a horror movie as wild winds and relentless thunderstorms continue to batter the state. Sylvia Freedman, who was enjoying a family trip away at Avoca Beach in the Central Coast, about 95kms north of Sydney, filmed the disturbing scene that stretched out more than 15 metres from the top of the beach pathway to beyond the water's edge. 'It's foam that has been swept off the top of the waves because the water was so churned up and its mixed with sand - it's so bizarre,' Ms Freedman told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Avoca Beach in the Central Coast, about 95kms north of Sydney, resembled something from a horror film on Tuesday . The entire beach, right up tot he top of the walkways, was covered in a grotesque yellow foam . She added: 'Whenever the wind blew, the foam just felt like you were in a snow globe.' Her videos - which were filmed on Tuesday - show a grotesque, yellow, jelly like substance moving around as the wind blows it up and over surrounding scrubland. They are titled 'foam party', 'I feel like Nigel Thornberry' and 'Beach gone. Path gone. No reception. Possibly about to be swept to sea'. Sylvia Freedman (pictured) filmed the disturbing scene that stretched out  for more than 15 metres . 'It's foam that has been swept off the top of the waves because the water was so churned up and its mixed with sand - it's so bizarre,' she said . Ms Freedman and her family were forced to leave the holiday house after their power went out on Tuesday. 'The foam just felt like you were in a snow globe' 'It's hard to say how much was foam and how much had water underneath, but there would have been a good 15 metres or so of that stuff,' Ms Freedman, the co-founder of EndoActive, said. 'It was covering the shrubbery and the whole walk way down to the beach.' Ms Freedman said she and her family were forced to ditch their holiday plans and head back to their Sydney home in Balmain earlier than they'd intended due to the severe storm. 'Avoca doesn't have very much distance between houses and the shore line, so when high tide came up the water was flooding the pathways all down the beach so I was freaking out and thought it would swallow all the houses up,' she said. 'When we went outside we realised it wasn't all water - it was foam.' 'We left yesterday afternoon because all the power went out, there was no electricity, we couldn't use the heaters and the house was freezing, there was no mobile or internet so we couldn't do anything so we just picked a moment in the night and left. 'The wind was just insane. The whole house was howling and it was crazy.' A quick trip to the nearby town of Terrigal, where Ms Freedman and her family tried to find some power, proved fruitless when they found that numerous homes had lost their roofs and the normally flat beach had pounding waves which the Balmain resident described as ‘just mental’. It comes as a second intense low pressure system, centred off the coast of the Hunter region, is predicted to bring heavier rains and more large seas and thunderstorms to large parts of northern Sydney and the Central Coast on Wednesday. The SES has received more than 8000 requests for help and has conducted 90 flood rescues since Monday, while about 200,000 homes and businesses remain without power. More than 260 SES crews and 600 volunteers will be out in the field on Wednesday while the worst storm in a decade continues to batter the state. 'It's hard to say how much was foam and how much had water underneath, but there would have been a good 15 metres or so of that stuff,' Ms Freedman said . She titled her videos 'foam party', 'I feel like Nigel Thornberry' and 'Beach gone. Path gone. No reception. Possibly about to be swept to sea'","Winds swept the ocean foam off lashing waves before mixing it with sand from the shore line .
The result was a bizarre and grotesque yellow, thick, jelly-like foam substance which coated the entire beach .
It stretched more than 15 metres up Avoca Beach in the Central Coast and onto the pathways and shrubbery .
Sylvia Freedman, who was holidaying there when the storm hit, captured the strange phenomenon on her camera ."
