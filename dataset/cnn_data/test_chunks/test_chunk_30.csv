"Nick Cannon has signed and sealed a deal to write a tell-all book about his marriage to Mariah Carey -  and she is furious about him betraying her. Mariah rejected Nick's numerous demands for a $30 million divorce settlement so now he's writing the book — saying he plans get his payday for being married to her one way or another - and there is nothing she can do about it because he already signed the deal last week with major publishing company Simon and Schuster. Simon & Schuster has confirmed to Daily Mail Online that the book is being published by Gallery Books, an imprint of the high-powered publisher. 'Mariah was willing to give Nick $10 million but he said 'hell no' and demanded $30,' a family friend tells the Daily Mail exclusively. 'Mariah says it is what they agreed to in the prenup before they got married. Scroll down for video . Battle of wills: Even though they have a prenup that would pay Nick $10million, Nick wanted more. When Mariah refused he decided to get his payday through a book deal. But Nick insisted he needs and deserves more than what they originally talked about, but Mariah wouldn't budge. Now Nick is being very vengeful, dating other women in public including Nicole Murphy, Michael Strahan's ex, the source says. 'Mariah kept telling Nick she was not going to give him a penny more than $10 million,'  says the friend. 'He told her he could write a book and get $30 million and much more for a movie deal for all of the crap she put him through over the years. 'Mariah told Nick nobody cares what he has to say and told him to take it or leave it because that's it - not a penny more.' The friend believes Nick asked for an outrageous amount from Mariah so when she said 'no' he could use that as an excuse to go to the book publisher. Nick hardly needs Mariah's money- although she is worth more than ten times his value. The actor and host of America's Got Talent has an estimated net worth of $20 million. Mariah is worth about $225 million. The estranged stars have been going back and forth about this since Nick filed for divorce in December. He was finally tired of arguing with her. ''He says she is being unreasonable so he has to do what he has to do. 'Now Mariah is angry, devastated and scared that Nick will reveal her inner most secrets and make her look like a desperate fool.' Mariah was crazy about Nick and trusted him with everything in her life but, now she feels he has turned out like every other man in her life and she is completely crushed, the friend reveals. Mariah, 45, and Nick, 34, have been battling about money and custody of their twins since he filed the divorce papers four months ago and even though there is a prenuptial agreement Nick is willing to air their dirty laundry — for a big fat check. US singer Marih Carey and her husband, US movie maker and actor Nick Cannon, leave the hotel to have a dinner at the Eiffel Tower in 2012 to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary . Battle for the babies: Who gets custody of twins Monoe and Moroccan Cannon is another issue in the divorce battle . Mariah and Nick were married on her private estate in the Bahamas on April 30, 2008 and they welcomed their twins Monroe and Moroccan on April 30, 2011. However, in August 2014, Nick confirmed that he and his wife, Mariah had been separated for a few months and he filed for divorce on December 12, 2014. 'Nick says he is going to tell the world about Mariah's drug use, her strange eating habits, psychosis, what she has said about other artists, her sexual proclivities and her parenting skills. It which will really be hurtful,' the insider continued. 'And Nick is also going to explain why he thinks he should have full custody of the twins. Mariah has admitted she never wanted children and Nick is going to tell the world why she felt that way. 'If Nick was not willing to spill all of their nasty and salacious secrets he would not have gotten a book deal. So obviously, Simon and Schuster feel this is going to be a blockbuster and they signed him up.'","Nick Cannon has demanded $30M to settle his divorce from Mariah - even though their prenup calls for less .

"A female prison guard and the convict she helped escape have been caught after 19 days and 1,700 miles on the run. Rachel Chepulis, 26, was arrested with Wesley E. Brown III in North Bend, Oregon almost three weeks after she helped him break out of Lake Region Correctional Center, also known as Devils Lake, in North Dakota. 35-year-old Brown, who is married with children, was awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm - and is thought to have seduced single Chepulis while behind bars. Fugitive couple: Female prison guard Rachel Chepulis and felon Wesley E. Brown III have been captured in Oregon after she helped him escape from jail in North Dakota 19 days ago . His escape from Devils Lake on March 13., aided by Chepulis, is the second time he has broken out of a secure unit. In June 2013 he escaped from Heart of America Correctional Center, climbing over a fence at the prison's recreation area. On that occasion Brown was recaptured three hours later and transferred to Devils Lake prison, where he spent a considerable amount of time prior his second jail break in March. Dan Orr, chief deputy U.S. marshal for North Dakota, told the Daily News: 'It's clear in the time he was there they developed a relationship. That he was allowed to escape was assisted by the fact there were mistakes made by the jail. Caught: The pair managed to get 1,700 miles from the North Dakota jail before being captured in Oregon . 'He was classified at a lower level than he should have been considering he already escaped from another facility. And he had assistance from the female jailer. 'It was pretty clear the jail didn't realize what she had done. But once we began the investigation, we realized she had a direct involvement in the escape.' The Marshals Service relies on local jails to hold federal prisoners awaiting sentencing in North Dakota and during his time at Devils Lake, the convicted Brown must have befriended the single Chepulis, Mr Orr claimed. The fugitive couple was caught outside a Bi-Mart store in North Bend yesterday with the help of Oregon State Police, who tracked down Chepulis' 2015 Toyota Rav4 with North Dakota plates after a tip off from a nearby hotel. Chepulis, arrested as she returned to the vehicle, was found to have Brown's initials tattooed on her left ring finger. Married felon: Brown, who has a wife and childre, is thought to have befriended single Rachel Chepulis while locked up at Lake Region Correctional Center, also known as Devils Lake, in North Dakota, above . Brown is to face additional escape charges while Chepulis will be hit with instigating or assisting an escape, concealing a person from arrest and conspiracy to commit escape . Each charge carries a five-year prison sentence. The pair will be arraigned in Oregon, likely Thursday, and then held without bond as they face extradition to North Dakota. Mr Orr said he was unable to offer more details of the jail break or the couple's time on the run until the court affidavit is unsealed.","Rachel Chepulis helped Wesley E.

"Sometimes it can feel like your job is an endless cycle of meetings – and you wouldn't be wrong. The average British worker will sit through 6,239 meetings in their career, a survey has found. And with 60 per cent saying they find most meetings 'pretty pointless', it's not surprising that one in five adults admits to catching forty winks during a work meeting. Of the 2000 surveyed by headset manufacturer Sennheiser Communications, 70 per cent said they constantly zone out while in meetings, with the average worker switching off completely after 20 minutes. The average British worker will sit through 6,239 meetings in their career, a survey has found (file picture) But bored staff should be wary of paying too little attention. One in five workers confessed to messing something up due to zoning out in a meeting, with more than a quarter saying they had made more than ten massive mistakes. 'There is nothing worse than being sat in a meeting that doesn't really concern you,' said Charlotte Gaskin, marketing manager at Sennheiser Communications, specialists in premium headsets. 'So it's not surprising then that so many people zone out, nod off or doodle.' 'Of the respondents we polled, many said that often a quick and concise conference call was more effective than a lengthy meeting which often resulted in expensive travel expenses.' The poll showed one in five employees has nodded off in a meeting at some point in their career, with the typical person dozing off for two minutes. For a quarter of those, their colleagues saw the funny side although 18 per cent experienced the wrath of their boss after catching forty winks. One in ten was so relaxed they either dribbled or snored. Of the 2000 employed polled, nearly a quarter said they tend to drift off if the meeting is first thing in the morning. But in contrast a third said they switch-off if the meeting is too late in the day. Two thirds said if the meeting isn't relevant to them they gradually become less interested. In fact, 31 per cent said they often think about what they are having for dinner that night and 16 per cent think about what they're going to watch on TV when they get home. Of the 2000 surveyed, 70 per cent said they constantly zone out while in meetings, with the average worker switching off completely after 20 minutes (file picture) Nearly half spend their time doodling on a notepad, whereas 29 per cent prefer to stare aimlessly out of a window. More than half of the employees surveyed said they think their team members sneakily arrange offsite meetings purely so they can spend time out of the office and skive off. 1. Doodle on a notepad . 2. Daydream about plans for the weekend . 3. Plan what you are having for dinner that night . 4. Stare aimlessly out of the window . 5. Exchange glances with your colleagues . 6. Think about what you're going to watch on telly that night . 7. Think about how much you hate your job . 8. Scroll through your newsfeed on Twitter or Facebook pretending to check your work emails . 9. Text friends or family making out you are texting a colleague . 10. Write a shopping list . And 45 per cent feel that their company wastes money on train tickets and air fares for people to travel to and from meetings. Typically the average worker spends £146.40 every time they attend an offsite meeting, but that is the tip of the iceberg as 37 per cent said they then fiddle their expenses anyway. The furthest the average worker has to travel is 218 miles for meetings, despite the fact that 65 per cent say they often have a 'wasted trip.' More than half said a conference call would often be just as efficient as a face to face meeting. Charlotte Gaskin added: 'Taking time out of your day to attend an offsite meeting when you know your input is not required or ignored is a huge inconvenience. 'Many companies have a number offices around the country and even the world, so internal meetings can be a logistical nightmare. 'It is worth considering the expense of travel, food and drink and overnight stays to determine whether a face to face meeting is really necessary. 'Technology like conference calling, video calling and instant messaging mean clear, concise conversations can take place in a number of different offices anywhere around the world, thus cutting down on big expense bills.' The study of 2000 office workers showed that over the course of a 40 year career the typical employee gets through 10,391 cups of cold coffee, accompanied by 8,257 biscuits - with chocolate digestives being the top choice. The survey revealed a crafty 16 per cent of workers only attend meetings for the chance of getting posh coffee and biscuits.","Average British worker sits through 6,239 meetings in their career .

"A Kansas man was sentenced Monday to four years and two months in prison for beheading another man with a guitar string after a plea deal that prosecutors said they accepted because of problems with the case. James Paul Harris, 30, originally was charged with first-degree murder in the 2011 garroting death of 49-year-old James Gerety, but pleaded no contest in December to involuntary manslaughter. The victim's brother, Tom Gerety, called the justice system 'a joke' after learning how long Harris would serve. Light punishment: James Paul Harris (left), 30, pleaded no contest in December to involuntary manslaughter in the 2011 garroting death of 49-year-old James Gerety (right). On Monday, a judge sentenced Harris to four years and two months . But Osage County Attorney Brandon Jones said pursuing the more serious charge posed challenges because of problems with evidence and key witnesses. A former girlfriend testified a year ago that Harris told her he shot Gerety in the stomach, tortured him for two days, then cut off his head. Prosecutors allege Harris kept Gerety's head for months for some type of religious practice, identified earlier as voodoo. Part of the skull was found in March 2012 in rural Osage County on land where Harris' father lived. 'You can murder somebody and get out in 50 months,' Tom Gerety said, according to The Topeka Capital-Journal. 'What's that tell everybody on the wrong side of the law?' Other than a portion of the victim's skull, prosecutors did not have the victim's body, the murder weapon had not been recovered, not all of the prosecution's witnesses were available, and prosecutors faced 'credibility issues' with a major witness, Jones said. 'It was going to be a tough case to prosecute,' Jones said. Harris declined to say anything during the sentencing. The judge asked if Tom Gerety wanted to say anything. 'It wouldn't do any good,' Mr Gerety replied. Thomas Henderson, an attorney who handled Gerety's Social Security payments, testified at a March 2014 preliminary hearing that he reported Gerety missing in April 2011 after he failed to pick up his payments. Outraged: The victim's brother, Tom Gerety (pictured) said the justice system is 'a joke,' and that the light sentence sends the wrong message . Henderson said Gerety planned to live with James Harris in Carbondale, 18 miles south of Topeka. Bobbie Williams, Harris' former girlfriend, testified in court that the defendant told her he killed Gerety using a guitar string, disposed of the body, but kept the head in a bag for himself. Another witness at that hearing, Topeka police Detective Brian Hill, said that during questioning after his arrest, Harris told him that he kept the victim's head in a canvas bag with a draw string. Hill testified that Harris spoke to the head, and had an active interest in voodoo and practiced it. According to Harris' former girlfriend, Harris told her that he had shot the victim in the stomach and then tortured him for two days at their Topeka house. After he had finished with his brutal treatment of Gerety, Harris then decapitated him with the string, according to Williams' testimony. Then, Harris is said to have put Gerety's torso, arms and legs in a barrel and burried it on land owned by his father, Jeff Harris in Osage County. Gerety's skull was recovered on March 24, 2012, at Jeff Harris' home by his girlfriend, Shirley Johnson. She had been on the hunt for mushrooms when she found a ball barely buried and brought it inside to show Harris' father, who promptly called the police and his son was arrested. Harris was in federal custody on unrelated charges when a warrant was issued in October 2013 and he was placed on hold for Kansas authorities.","James Harris, 30, got four years and two months in prison in 2011 garroting death of 49-year-old James Gerety in Kansas .

"Apple's Watch hits stores this Friday when customers and employees alike will be able to pre-order the timepiece. And boss Tim Cook is rewarding his staff by offering them a 50 per cent discount on the device. Any employee working in the regions where the watch is being launched - including the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong and Japan - will be eligible. Scroll down for video . Any employee working in the regions where the Watch is being launched - including the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong and Japan - will be eligible for a 50% discount on the standard model (centre) and the Sport model (left). It does not apply to the Edition model (right) The plans were in a memo leaked to Apple fansite 9to5Mac in which Mr Cook wrote: 'I know that many of you have been looking forward to choosing an Apple Watch for yourselves, and we want to make it easy for you. 'Starting Friday a special Employee Purchase Plan will offer a 50% discount on any Apple Watch or Apple Watch Sport for your personal use.' Notably, the discount doesn't apply to the expensive Edition model, which starts at $10,000 in the US and £8,000 in the UK. Mr Cook continued that as the Watch is introduced in more countries, this price plan will be extended. Prices for the Sport model start at $349 in the US and £299 in the UK, while the stainless steel Watch starts at $549 (£479). Apple's Watch goes on display around the world on 10 April and people can pre-order it at 12.01 Pacific Time (8am BST) on this day. The Watch will then  go on general sale on 24 April in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong and Japan . Earlier this week, Apple released the first four guided tour videos of its watch, and said more are 'coming soon.' These videos (pictured) include an introduction to the main features, plus how to use the Messages app, customise the face, and use digital touch . This means US employees will only pay $174.50 and $274 respectively, while in the UK the price drops to £149.50 and £239.50. Like many firms, Apple staff already reportedly receive a discount across the product range and this is said to be around 30 per cent. According Piper Jaffray senior analyst Gene Munster, Apple will sell a million watches in its first weekend on sale, three times the first-day sales of Apple's last all-new product, the iPad. It would put the Apple Watch behind Apple's first iPad, which sold 3 million in its first weekend in 2010, but ahead of the first iPhone, which sold 700,000 units when it debuted in 2007. However, it would be a fraction of the 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Pluses sold in the same timespan. The half-price Watch discounts apply from Friday and will last for 90 days. It is not clear whether employees can buy multiple watches under the scheme and Apple has refused to comment. Mr Cook added: 'Congratulations to everyone who has worked to help this product reach our customers. 'And thanks in advance to the thousands of retail employees around the world who will start placing it on people's wrists starting Friday.' Although going on display in stores this weekend, the Apple Watch won't go on sale generally until the 24 April. Although it could be seen as a way to boost sales, Ernest Doku telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, told MailOnline the plans will benefit customers: 'Apple knows it's wading into unchartered territory with a costly, and as yet unproven, device. 'What better way to instill the idea the Watch is a must-have accessory than offer deep discounts for its biggest evangelists? The videos also give an overview of how to see more options by pressing the screen. These options change depending on the app being used. For instance, when working out, it lets a wearer stop the workout . The left-hand image shows how the digital crown can be used to select from a list of emoticons. The right-hand image shows the crown being used to select contacts after the button on the side has been pressed . 'It means those on the front line have actual experience they can draw on when making sales, and a stronger narrative for prospective buyers.'

"A busy mum sits at a table surrounded by crayons, colouring in a child's book, taking care to stay within the printed lines and fully concentrating on the task. There's nothing unusual about that, you might think, except there's not a child in sight...and the mum is simply colouring in because she wants to. Grown ups reaching for the crayons is a new global trend it seems, as adults say they're attracted to the creativity that colouring in affords. Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford has sold more than 1.4million copies of her colouring-in book for grown-ups, Secret Garden. The follow-up, Enchanted Forest, is expected to do just as well . Art and flowers: The book is the most popular in its genre and has now been translated into 22 languages . If you needed any proof, then browsing Amazon's bestseller list offers it. A book called Secret Garden by Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford, which includes 96 pages of black-and-white drawings has sold more than 1.4million copies and is riding high in the bestsellers chart. So far, it's been translated into 22 different languages. The New York Times has even reported on 'colouring-in groups', where grown-ups meet, as if they were in a knitting circle or book club, just to neatly daub colour on the right side of lines together. The arty fad is said to have started in France, where it was promoted as both a therapeutic hobby and a way of rediscovering lost creativity. Adult colouring-in titles are now said to be outselling cook books in the country, no mean feat for a destination that holds gastronomy so close to its heart. The allure is said to be the unadulterated pleasure of doing something for no purpose other than to enjoy the practice of colouring and staying within the lines. According to experts, it's a kickback against the stresses of modern life and technology, where everything, even leisure time has to be in some way useful or aspirational. The images in Basford's book are not particularly adult in theme, they depict scenes of both nature and fantasy. Basford, 31, told The Times: 'Colouring in appeals to people because it’s a chance to do an analogue activity that’s not on a screen. Everyone is creative deep down but as you get older you get less confident in your abilities.' The artist's second book, Enchanted Forest, is showing all signs of eclipsing the success of her first work. Basford says her success is down to people resisting modern technology in their leisure time. She says: 'Colouring in appeals to people because it’s a chance to do an analogue activity that’s not on a screen' In Australia, colouring-in circles have emerged, such is the pursuit's current popularity. One crayon fantatic Jenny Keane told the Sydney Morning Herald that she even enjoys colouring in with her husband: 'During the week some people like to go to the bar to decompress, whereas my husband and I like to sit down together and just colour.' She adds: 'I can't draw but I like to use my hands to get creative. Some people might use yoga or running but colouring for me is my sense of peace.' A study in the US in 2012 found that colouring in reduced anxiety among university students.","Johanna Basford has sold 1.4million copies of her book Secret Garden .

"The little girl who broke millions of hearts after surrendering to a camera she mistook for a gun is now in the clutches of Al Qaeda, the MailOnline can exclusively reveal. Four-year-old Hudea was pictured late last year by photographer Osman Sagirli in Atmeh refugee camp, just 10km from the border with Turkey. She, her mother and three siblings are understood to have been living in the Syrian camp since Hudea's father was killed in the 2012 Hama massacre. But two weeks ago, the family took a fateful decision to move south, towards the city of Idlib - only for it to fall into the hands of Al Qaeda's brutal Syrian affiliate at the weekend. It means, once more, the family are in danger of becoming victims of a battle between the regime and rebels which has killed 220,000 since 2011 - 10,000 of whom were children. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: Taken at the Atmeh refugee camp on Syria's border with Turkey, the image shows four-year-old Hudea frozen in fear with her arms raised and her lips tightly pursed . Hudea and her family left the camp two weeks ago; it is thought they headed for Idlib - now in the control of Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra. Pictured: An Al-Nusra fighter holds his group flag  in front of Idlib's governor building . Sharia law: Al-Nusra have promised to bring in Sharia law in the city, and have already started burning things considered banned under Islam - like these cigarettes . The Nusra Front-led rebels is set impose Sharia law on the city, which is only the second state capital to fall from the grip of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. 'We salute the people of Idlib and their stand with their sons, the Mujahideen, ... and God willing they will enjoy the justice of sharia, which will preserve their religion and their blood,' said Abu Mohamad al-Golani, Nusra Front's leader, in a recording released on Wednesday. This is horrifying news for those living under the Nusra Front. The group group has a reputation for violence which is only rivaled by the horrors seen in ISIS-controlled territory. Charlie Winter, of the Qilliam Foundation, warned: 'Jabhat al-Nusra is an outspoken al-Qaeda affiliate. It espouses a severe interpretation of Islam and sharia law. 'They have been known to execute women who are allegedly running brothels, and stone adulterers. It is a violent interpretation of sharia law.' Indeed, the group appears to be all but following in the footsteps of ISIS, who have terrified the world with an onslaught of violence, including throwing people from the tops of buildings and getting small children to shoot so-called spies dead. Worringly, the Nusra Front - who reiterated their allegiance to Al Qaeda in the last month - have said they want to create their own 'Islamic state'. The group is known for its use of suicide bombers as it tries to achieve its goal, and has claimed responsibility for mass executions, murdered journalists and even priests in the past few years. In the days since they took control of Idlib, there have been reports of two Christian men being executed, while the Vatican - citing local news sources - claimed a Greek Orthodox priest had been kidnapped by jihadists. Fight: The city fell after a four day battle which saw fighters on both sides lose their lives . Flee: It is thought about 15,000 people ran from the city as the Nusra Front approached . Trauma: Save the Children reports many of the children were traumatised by what they had seen . For a child like Hudea, who has clearly already been left horribly traumatised by a war which has been raging her entire life, life under the strict sharia law is likely to be nothing be more terrifying. But life is no better under the Syrian regime: indeed, it is al-Assad's fighters who were said to be behind the Hama massacre in which she lost her father. Pro-government militia killed at least 55 people that day, going from house to house, murdering men, women and children. It was after this the family fled north, to the camp near the border with Turkey, which has grown to become a home to 30,000 refugees. But despite being so close to the safety of Turkey, the family appear to have never made it across. Instead, for reasons unknown to MailOnline's source within the camp, they decided to leave the camp - venturing out into territory which has changed hands between the different rebel factions and the al-Assad regime numerous times over the last four years. The MailOnline's source within the camp said: 'The child does not exist now in the camp. They fled to a village in Idlib about two weeks ago.' Wherever they have gone, it means the family are trapped once more between three violent sides - none of which are prepared to stop until they have wiped the other off the face of the earth. Relative safety: Many of the 15,000 are headed to refugee camps like Atmeh, near the Turkish border - but it is not known where Hudea and her small family are . Civil war: Fighting has been going on Hudea's entire life, killing 10,000 children since 2011. Pictured: Atmeh, her home after he father was killed in 2012 . And living in an area recently won by one side, does not guarantee survival - or peace. A source in the Syrian military force told EA World View: 'We have an obligation to liberate the city... I swear to god the highest we are not scared.' Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at University of Oklahoma, was also certain Damascus would not give up without a fight. He told Bloomberg: 'Assad will likely bomb Idlib so that its captors find little peace in their new prize.' Mr Winter thinks it is unlikely they will have gone to areas controlled by the Syrian government. One suspects the memory of what they did to her husband will mean Hudea's mother will keep her family away from al-Assad's forces. But villages not in the control of the regime have come under attack since Nusra Front's assault on Idlib - which itself sent 15,000 people fleeing for their lives. Ironically, many are making their way to the refugee camps in the north - like Atmeh, the safe haven Hudea has just left. And now there are reports of the regime using chlorine-filled bombs against the towns surrounding Idlib - a new horror for the little girl and her family to contend with. One can only imagine how Hudea, caught in the crossfire in a fight she is too young to understand and so scared already she surrenders to cameras, will respond to any of this.","Hudea and her family are thought to have gone to Idlib two weeks ago .

"Nicolas Sarkozy was being grilled by judges in a criminal court today  two days after being heralded as the politician to save France from Socialism. The 60-year-old is facing charges over the funding of his failed 2012 bid to retain the presidency of the country. Images of Sarkozy arriving at a specialist financial court in Paris today are a huge embarrassment for a politician who still thinks he can return to power. Slinking back into public view: Nicolas Sarkozy is driven to court where he faces charges over the funding of his failed 2012 bid to retain the presidency of the country - two days after being heralded as France's saviour . Thierry Herzog, the lawyer of the former French President and current head of the right-wing UMP opposition party, arrives at the Pole Financier headquarters (the fraud section of the courthouse) in Paris . Not only was he roundly beaten by Francois Hollande, his detested Socialist rival, but he is alleged to have got the UMP party to pay off his personal fine approaching £500,000 for over-spending. Under French electoral law, Sarkozy should have paid the fine himself from his own funds. On Sunday, his party made massive electoral gains against the Socialists in regional elections, and Sarkozy is convinced he can become president again in 2017. After the UMP won 66 out of 101 departments - the French equivalent of counties - Sarkozy announced: 'The French have massively rejected the policies of Francois Hollande and his government. 'Hope has been reborn in France.' Happier outing: On Sunday, Sarkozy's party made massive electoral gains against the Socialists in regional elections and he is convinced he can become president again in 2017 . Under pressure: France's ruling Socialists under Francois Hollande (pictured) suffered a crushing defeat in regional elections at the weekend - as three years of left-wing rule was branded a 'massive failure' But his former lieutenant Jean-François Cope has already been charged in the funding case and Sarkozy could suffer the same fate today. It will add to a long list of corruption scandals, which started for Sarkozy as soon as he lost his presidential immunity from prosecution. Within days of leaving the Elysee Palace in 2012, the Paris home he shares with his third wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni, was raided by police. He is facing criminal charges in numerous cases, including an investigation into more than £15million of false billing by Bygmalion, an events-organising company, during the 2012 campaign. It has also been alleged that Sarkozy's successful 2007 presidential campaign was funded by millions of pounds worth of illegal cash from Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, the late Libyan dictator. Sarkozy denies any wrongdoing in any of the cases against him. He refused to speak to reporters before arriving in court at 8am today and is expected to spend most of the day in a closed sitting with judges.","Sarkozy faces charges over funding of failed 2012 bid to retain presidency .

"As he cuddles his beautiful baby grandson, David Suchet looks every inch the proud grandfather. But behind the smiles, he is battling hard to help the little boy face the future with an incurable genetic disease. Suchet, best known as the star of TV series Poirot, is fighting for better treatment for those with rare diseases and has criticised ‘disorganisation’ in the NHS for slowing down the process. His grandson Todd, who is about to celebrate his first birthday, has the rare condition Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. So close: David Suchet with his grandson Todd, who has the rare genetic illness Tuberous Sclerosis Complex . Those with the disease can live a full life but may develop tumours in organs such as the brain and heart and suffer from epilepsy and learning or behavioural difficulties. Suchet, 68, revealed his grandchild was diagnosed with the condition shortly after birth. He said ‘mismanagement in the admin side’ of the NHS means he is not receiving treatment that could help him. Todd is the son of Suchet’s son Robert, a 33-year-old fitness coach. In February MPs raised concerns that slow NHS decision making was blocking patients with incurable diseases from accessing vital drugs. But now Suchet has taken up the battle to ensure his grandson can receive treatment, and is encouraging Twitter users to voice their support with the hashtag #Fight4Treatment. He explained: ‘The condition was discovered when he was just a few weeks old when he started having fits. He had an MRI and was found to have TSC. Some people don’t discover it until later on in life and it can manifest itself in various different phases.’ Speaking about medication that could help Todd, Suchet added: ‘The drugs are available but we can’t get them. ‘There are many reasons why we don’t have access to them but there seems to be such disorganisation and mismanagement in the admin side that it’s all gone pear-shaped and people are suffering.’ The actor has become involved in fundraising for the Tuberous Sclerosis Association charity and narrated a video for its campaign. He explained: ‘#Fight4Treatment is fighting to get drugs for rare diseases and non-rare diseases available from the NHS, to give to sufferers who would benefit. They’re so expensive, it’s almost immoral.’ Suchet, 68, left, and as Poirot, right, said ‘mismanagement in the admin side’ of the NHS means his grandson is not receiving treatment that could help him . In the video he urges people to contact their local MPs to raise the issue with the Health Secretary. He says the family try to be optimistic about his grandson’s prognosis, adding: ‘It’s incurable, but we remain hopeful that we will find something to manage it for him.’ In 2013 it was announced that after over 20 years of playing the Belgian detective, Suchet had decided to say goodbye to Hercule Poirot. He first took the role in 1989, but said the character would not be reprised as every Agatha Christie book about him had been filmed. However Suchet, who is a devout Christian, will be returning to television screens tomorrow to present a documentary about St Peter. In The Footsteps Of St Peter will be aired on BBC1 on Good Friday.","David Suchet is seeking better treatment for those with genetic diseases .

"Archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of a 17th-century camel that was likely used in the second Ottoman-Habsburg war. They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683. In a country where cows dominate the rural landscape, the discovery in an Austrian cellar shocked scientists. The researchers described it as a 'sunken ship in the desert'. Archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of an 'alien' 17th-century camel that was likely used in the second Ottoman-Habsburg war. They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683 . Genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a Bactrian-dromedary hybrid – a breed popular in the Ottoman army at the time. 'The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle,' said Alfred Galik, a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. 'But one look at the cervical vertebrae, the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel.' The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated. The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated. Along with DNA evidence, the shape of the animal's skull indicated it was a hybrid . The cross-breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. Pictured are various views of the camel's metacarpus, which is part of its legs . The battle that took place on 11 September 1683 after Vienna had been seiged by the Ottoman Empire for two months. It was won by the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation against the invading Ottoman Empire. Historians claim the battle marked the turning-point in the Ottoman–Habsburg wars, a 300-year struggle between the Holy Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire . The loot that fell into the hands of the Holy League troops and the Viennese was large. King John Sobieski vividly described in a letter to his wife a few days after the battle: . 'Ours are treasures unheard of... tents, sheep, cattle and no small number of camels... it is victory as nobody ever knew before.' Galik and his team also said the cross-breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. The remarkable find was made during an archaeological dig that took place amid preparations for a new shopping centre in the town. If modern-day scientists were stumped by the find, it would have been an even greater shock for residents of 17th-century Tulln. 'The animal was certainly exotic for the people of Tulln. They probably didn't know what to feed it or whether one could eat it,' Galik said. While Roman-era camel bones occasionally surface in Austria, Serbia and Belgium, the Tulln discovery was the first complete camel skeleton to emerge in Central Europe. 'This means that the animal was not killed and then butchered. It may have been acquired as part of an exchange,' said Galik .

"A federal judge on Thursday ordered California's corrections department to provide a transsexual convicted murderer with sex change surgery, the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state. According to the spokeswoman for the federal receiver, who controls California prison medical care, the surgery could cost taxpayers as much as $100,000. U.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco ruled that denying sex reassignment surgery to 51-year-old Michelle-Lael Norsworthy violates her constitutional rights. Right to be a woman:  U.S. District Court Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco ruled that denying sex reassignment surgery to  Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, 51,  pictured last year, violates her constitutional rights . Her birth name is Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy. Norsworthy has been in prison since 1987, serving a life sentence for second-degree murder. She has twice delayed her scheduled parole hearings in recent months. The ruling says it would be the second time nationwide that such a surgery has been performed on an inmate, an apparent reference to an inmate who castrated himself in Texas then was given the surgery out of necessity. Norsworthy has lived as a woman since the 1990s and has what Tigar termed severe gender dysphoria. 'The weight of the evidence demonstrates that for Norsworthy, the only adequate medical treatment for her gender dysphoria is SRS,' Tigar wrote, referring to sex reassignment surgery. He found that the decision by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to deny the procedure was medically unacceptable under the circumstances. Corrections officials said they are considering whether to appeal the ruling. Attorneys for Norsworthy did immediately comment. Paid surgery: Michelle-Lael Norsworthy has been living as a woman since the 1990s and her birth name is Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy. 'This would be a first for California, said Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal receiver who controls California prison medical care. The cost to taxpayers for such surgery is uncertain, she said. 'It's several tens of thousands of dollars, possibly close to $100,000, depending on the circumstances. But It's hard to estimate,' Hayhoe said. Corrections officials, in previous court filings, argued that Norsworthy has received proper medical and mental health care for more than 15 years and is in no immediate medical danger if the surgery is not performed. Her care has included counseling, mental health treatment and hormone therapy that the department said 'has changed her physical appearance and voice to that of a woman' while helping her find her gender identity. That care is consistent with what other judges nationwide have found to be appropriate for transgender inmates, the department said. She currently is housed at Mule Creek State Prison, an all-male prison in Ione, 40 miles southeast of Sacramento. The sex change surgery will prompt practical problems, the department said. The department also said keeping Norsworthy in a men's prison could invite violence, including possible assault and rape. But she could also face danger at a women's prison — or pose a threat herself — because she had a history of domestic violence before her murder conviction, the department said. Possible danger of rape: She currently is housed at Mule Creek State Prison, an all-male prison in Ione, 40 miles southeast of Sacramento and there are fears she may be raped when becoming a woman .","Judge  ruled that denying sex reassignment surgery to Michelle-Lael Norsworthy violates her constitutional rights .

"Singer-songwriter Don McLean's original manuscript and notes to 'American Pie' have been sold at auction for $1.2 million. McLean offered the wistful anthem that asks 'Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died?' at Christie's on Tuesday. The name of the buyer was not released. The 16 pages include the original working manuscript and typed drafts of the song, including tantalizing new details about the famous anthem. In an interview published by Christie's auction house New York, where the manuscript was auctioned, McLean says American Pie is about 'heading in the wrong direction'. Scroll down for video . Original song: Christie's curator Tom Lecky holds the 16-page notes and manuscript for singer Don McLean's American Pie at Christie's auction house in New York where it was sold for $1.2million to an unidentified bidder on Tuesday . 'It is becoming less idyllic. I don't know whether you consider that wrong or right but it is a morality song in a sense.' It has long been known that the song about 'the day the music died' refers to February 3, 1959, when rock n' roll icon Buddy Holly and fellow singers Ritchie Valens and J.P. 'Big Bopper' Richardson died in a plane crash. The eight-minute-long song was released in 1971 and was a No. 1 U.S. hit for four weeks in 1972. McLean, 69, a longtime Maine resident, says writing the song was 'a mystical trip into his past.' Legendary singer: The original manuscript also reveals a deleted verse, which was crossed out and never recorded, where McLean, now 69, writes about music being 'reborn'. Loss: American Pie mourns the death of late-50s rock n' roll icon Buddy Holly,  who died in a plane crash on February 3 1959, aged just 22, which is what McLean refers to as 'the day music died' Tragedy: J.P.

The original manuscript also reveals a deleted verse, which was crossed out and never recorded, about music being 'reborn'. It includes the lines 'I dropped to my knees and there I prayed and I promised him everything I could give. 'If only he would make the music live,' according to the Telegraph. American Pie had a  revival in 2000 when Madonna covered the song to promote the soundtrack to her flop film The Next Best Thing. Despite the Queen of Pop describing the cover as 'something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing' in 2001, her version of American Pie became a global chart hit.

"Bans on texting and driving may be preventing deadly car accidents in the United States, says a new study. Researchers from Texas A&M School of Public Health found that hospitalizations from car crashes dropped 7 percent between 2003 and 20010 in the 45 states with texting bans when compared to states with no restrictions. The research report recently published in the American Journal of Public health could 'not prove' that a texting ban is what caused the critcal injury drop, though they said it was a likely cause. Most states: Most of the US has laws that ban drivers from texting while at the wheel to prevent accidents . Dangerous: Drivers between the ages of 25 and 40 are the most likely group of people to get in an accident related to texting and driving . Arizona, Texas, Montana, Missouri, and Oklahoma are the only five states in America that do not have texting at the wheel bans for all drivers. CBS reports that the study's leader Alva Ferdinand said that while it could not be proven that the lowered rate of hospitalization due to car accidents was caused by texting bans, the restrictions are still linked to a decline in crashes. Ferdinand said that the greatest benefit was seen in states where texting bans are strictly enforced and where an officer can stop a car just on suspicion the driver breaking the law. 'Some states have secondary enforcement,' Ferdinand explained. 'In those states, law enforcement has to catch you doing something else first -- like speeding or running a red light -- and then determine that you were texting.' The study also found that older drivers were more likely to make a texting and driving mistake than a younger driver. 'It's adults, too,' Ferdinand said. 'They're constantly checking emails and text messages.' Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA), said that adults between the ages of 25 and 40 were most likely to get in a texting and driving accident. Slow reaction time: Texting at the wheel is dangerous for drivers because it slows down their reaction times . The research group found that texting bans caused a 9 per cent drop in car-crash hospitalizations among Americans aged 22 and older. Even though young people benefited from the texting ban, the drop in hospitalizations was not numerically significant. There is a lack in data on texting and driving but Adkins believes that as more studies show more results in favour of the ban, more states will be likely to implement it. Adkins said that drivers should avoid texting while at the wheel at all costs even if they consider themselves to be good multitaskers. 'It should push those states with weaker laws to strengthen them,' Adkins told CBS. Research shows that texting at the wheel may be dangerous because it slows reactions more than drink or drugs. A study last year found sending a text message delays reaction times by 37 per cent. By comparison, using cannabis slows it by 21 per cent, and drinking to the legal limit by 13 per cent. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that nine Americans are killed every day by doing a distracting activity like texting.","Study found that hospitalizations from car crashes dropped 7 percent between 2003 and 20010 in the 45 states with texting bans .

"The Polish father, who may be suffering from amnesia, does not know how he came to lose his memory or be in the UK, and cannot even recall his own name . A Polish father has wandered into the London Embassy with no memory of who he is except that he has a daughter. The mystery man, who may be suffering from amnesia, does not know how he came to lose his memory or be in the UK, and cannot even recall his own name. All that he could remember was that he was from the Poznan area of Poland and has a daughter called Lenka. He may or may not have come from Denmark within the past few days. The man, who was found without identification, taken to hospital after he arrived at the Polish Consulate in central London yesterday afternoon. Currently, the only clue to his identity is a distinctive tattoo of a flower on his right upper arm. He is being cared for at London's St Thomas' Hospital while police appeal for anyone who recognises him to come forward. Scotland Yard said: 'Police are appealing for help to identify a Polish man who has been taken to St Thomas' Hospital suffering memory loss. 'The man attended the Polish Consulate at around 5pm on Thursday, 2 April. 'Due to his lack of memory, he was taken by London Ambulance Service to the hospital as a precaution. 'The man is able to state that he was born in Poland and may have travelled to London from Denmark within the past few days.

What is retrograde amnesia? Amnesia is the name given to a disturbance in the ability to recall stored memories. It is usually caused by disease or head injury, but in rare cases can occur apparently spontaneously. The memory loss associated with amnesia can include everything from a person's past or just portions of it. In most cases, it is a temporary condition, lasting from a few seconds to a few hours. But in severe cases, it can last months or even years. There are several different types of amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is an inability to remember any events that occurred before the accident or illness. The leading hypotheses are some form of epileptic event, a problem with blood circulation around, to or from the brain, or some kind of migraine-like phenomenon. Usually, the affected person cannot remember events shortly before their accident or illness at all, but their memories of the distant past are intact, and there is a gradient of memory loss between the two extremes. Retrograde amnesia often lasts for a year, before the patient starts to remember things.","Mystery man wandered into Polish Embassy yesterday with no memory .

The pair were pitted against another couple of pandas, Yi Bao and Jin Xin, who only managed one minute and 20 seconds of love-making. The average length of a 'romp' between two pandas is between 30 seconds and five minutes, making Lu Lu's efforts all the more impressive. Breeders said they watch the creatures having sex so they can understand their mating habits, and encourage them to reproduce in the future. A breeder at the Sichuan Giant Panda Research Centre watches close as Lu Lu and Zhen Zhen begin . They use poles made of bamboo to guide the pandas towards each other, when they have tracked when the pandas are in the amorous mood. The female of the species are prone to making loud and strange noises, while male pandas leave traces of their scent to attract the opposite sex. But timing is everything, because the female pandas are in heat once a year, for between two to four days.

"Hillary Clinton imposed a blanket of secrecy on her movements at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and told aides they would be fired if she was seen, it is claimed. Mrs Clinton said that she wanted nobody to know when she was going to the pool apart from one usher who was to guide her there. There she would spend three and a half hours sitting on her own reading looking ‘heartbroken’, according to a new book. A new book has claimed that Hillary Clinton imposed a blanket of secrecy on her movements during the Monica Lewinsky scandal . The vivid account is written by Kate Andersen Brower, a former White House correspondent for Bloomberg News in ‘The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.’ She tells how in the summer of 1998, a few days before Mr Clinton would admit to sex with former White House intern Miss Lewinsky, usher Worthington White was approached by Mrs Clinton. She told him that she wanted to go to the pool but that only he could see her - no other aides and no Secret Service. Mr White said that he told Mrs Clinton’s lead Secret Service agent: ‘If anybody sees her, or she sees anybody, I’m going to get fired, I know it. And you probably will too’. By the pool Mrs Clinton would spend three and a half hours sitting on her own reading looking ‘heartbroken, it is claimed . Mrs Clinton’s wish was granted and she took an elevator to the pool, spent the afternoon there and came back the same way, . Miss Brower writes that Mrs Clinton ‘turned to White, took his hands and squeezed them, looked him in the eye, and thanked him.’ The book also recounts how the Clintons did not trust the old fashioned White House telephone system and felt too many people could listen in - so had it completely rewired . Miss Brower writes: ‘They had all the White House phones changed over to interior circuitry so that if the first lady was in the bedroom and the president was in the study, she could ring him from room to room without going through the operator’. Such upheaval did not go down well with staff and according to James W.F. ‘Skip’ Allen, an usher from 1979 to 2004, the Clintons were ‘about the most paranoid people I’d ever seen in my life’. The disclosure sheds new light on the row over Mrs Clinton’s use of a private email account and her own personal server whilst Secretary of State. It could harm her chances in the race for the Presidency in 2016 - she is expected to announce her candidacy this month. A new poll has found that Mrs Clinton’s approval ratings have slipped since the scandal broke and she is two points behind former Florida governor Jeb Bush, her likely opponent.

"A mother who appeared in the BBC's controversial documentary 'People Like Us' is facing jail after she refused to pay a fine for taking her teenage daughter out of school to go on holiday. Karen Wakefield and her husband Paul Dawson were one of a number of families who featured on the six-part BBC documentary, which aimed to show what life was like in Harpurhey in Manchester. It was criticised by those who starred in it as intentionally painting them in a negative light.

Karen Wakefield and her partner Paul (centre) could face three months in jail for refusing to pay fines for taking her 13-year-old daughter  (right) out of school during term time to go on holiday to Turkey . She has refused to pay two initial £60 fines and subsequent £120 fines, and claims she and her husband have been told they could be jailed for three months or given fines of £1,000 each. The mother-of-two said she 'doesn't like being told by teachers when she can go on holiday' and said she is determined to fight the case all the way. Mrs Wakefield said her daughter's school, the Manchester Communication Academy, refused to give her permission to take her daughter abroad during term last year. The trip, at the end of the six-weeks' holiday, meant the pupil missed six days of lessons at the start of the new school year. She said her child deserved the trip because of alleged bullying at the school. Mrs Wakefield said she doesn't like the school telling her what to do, and took her daughter out of Manchester Communication Academy during term time to go on holiday . Mrs Wakefield claims her daughter  needed a holiday after she was bullied at school . The owner of Wishy Washy was seen showing viewers CCTV from  the launderette of some of her customers . Mrs Wakefield, who has another daughter Amber, 21, added: 'We told the truth and told the school we were going on holiday. We didn't lie and say she was ill or anything. 'But they said we didn't have permission. She deserved to go on holiday - she's been bullied at the school. She's had a hard time of it. 'We refused to pay the fines - it's ridiculous. We don't like being told when you can go on holiday by teachers. The six-part BBC Three documentary was watched by 1million people. Producers said the fly-on-the-wall documentary aimed to show what life was like in Manchester. But locals who featured in the show claimed the show was 'faked' to make them appear drunken, fat and lazy. More than 300 people attended a public meeting to call for the series to be axed, claiming rather than showing how Harpurhey had developed - it illustrated it as a deprived area. They said the show made them look like 'Jeremy Kyle Show-type chavs' - a talk show which frequently features swearing and fighting. Locals claimed they were tricked into taking part and encouraged to drink alcohol and fight on camera by the film crew. This was flatly denied by production company Dragonfly. 'What about when they're on strike or there's a training day? It's no different to her missing a few days on holiday. 'It would be different if her grades were low but she is very clever and doing better than expected despite being bullied.' A spokeswoman for the school said Manchester City Council is pursuing legal action on its behalf. A council spokesman said: 'Local authorities have a statutory obligation to take action on non- attendance in schools, and although schools work very closely with pupils and parents to ensure pupils are in school every day they should be, legal action is sometimes necessary to enforce this.' Mrs Wakefield shot to fame when she appeared on the BBC3 show, which attracted audiences of 1million. After it aired the 'fly on the wall documentary' was criticised as making locals featured in it look like 'Jeremy Kyle Show-type chavs.'  This was denied by programme makers who said they had adhered to all BBC guidelines.","Karen Wakefield and family appeared in BBC People Like Us documentary .

"The majority of people taking antidepressants may not actually have depression, a new study claims. Researchers discovered more than two-thirds (69 per cent) of people taking antidepressants did not meet the criteria for major depressive disorder, which is also known as clinical depression. Antidepressants are also prescribed for other psychiatric disorders. But the researchers found 38 per cent of those taking the drugs did not meet the criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia or generalised anxiety disorder either. Scroll down for video . More than two thirds of people taking antidepressants did not meet the criteria for clinical depression . The U.S. investigators looked at those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), the most commonly prescribed type of anti-depressant. SSRIs are usually the first choice medication for depression and other psychiatric conditions because they generally have fewer side effects than most other types of antidepressant. Writing in the report,  published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, the researchers concluded: ‘Many individuals prescribed antidepressants may not have met the criteria for mental disorders. ‘Our data indicates that antidepressants are commonly used in the absence of clear evidence-based indications.’ Commenting on the study, Dr Howard Forman, medical director of the Addiction Consultation Service at Montefiore Medical Center, said clinical depression is distinct from temporary feelings of sadness. He told Medical Daily: 'We all experience periods of stress, periods of sadness, and periods of self-doubt. 'These don’t make us mentally ill, they define us as human.' In the U.S., official guidelines say clinical depression should be diagnosed if a person has five or more depressive symptoms over a two week period, most of the day, nearly every day. The symptoms include a depressed mood; a loss of interested or pleasure in activities; weight loss, weight gain or changes in appetite; insomnia or increased desire to sleep.

Other symptoms included restlessness or slowed behaviour; fatigue or loss of energy; feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt; difficulty making decisions or trouble concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide. Prescriptions for anti-depressants have more than trebled since 1998 in the world’s richest countries, a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found. The research noted a particular rise in in the use of SSRIs like Prozac and Seroxat. The OECD figures showed Iceland to have the highest prescribing rate, at 106 doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants in 2011, up from 71 a decade earlier. Behind Iceland is Australia, then Canada, Denmark, Sweden and Portugal. The lowest levels were seen in Chile and South Korea. Separate data from the US shows 11 per cent of Americans over 12-years-old use anti-depressants. As part of the new study, doctors used data from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Study Wave 1, which began in 1981, up to Wave 4, which ended in 2005. In total, they used data on 1,071 participants, carrying out four interviews and assessing the use of antidepressants. They found 13 per cent of people in the group reported using antidepressants. The study found 38 per cent of SSRI users did not meet the criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder or clinical depression (file photo) It's thought that SSRIs work by increasing the levels of a chemical called serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It's thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep. After carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as 'reuptake'). SSRIs work by blocking ('inhibiting') reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells. The NHS Choices website while it would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment. Source: NHS Choices . They then assessed whether the people in this group met the criteria for a mental disorder, as laid out in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the U.S. bible for psychiatric conditions. They found that 38 per cent of SSRI users did not meet the criteria for a mental disorder, and 69 per cent did not meet the criteria for major depressive disorder. The news comes after a study found women who take antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with autism. The U.S. study supports previous research which has shown that taking SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy increases a woman’s risk of having a child with the developmental disability. And other American research revealed young adults taking high-dose antidepressants such as Prozac and Seroxat have double the risk of suicidal behaviour. Researchers pointed to previous studies, which found antidepressant drugs are linked with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and thoughts in children and adolescents, particularly in the early stages of treatment.","Study analysed those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

"The Rev. Robert H. Schuller, the Southern California televangelist and author who beamed his upbeat messages on faith and redemption to millions from his landmark Crystal Cathedral only to see his empire crumble in his waning years, has died. He was 88. Schuller died early Thursday at a care facility in Artesia, daughter Carol Schuller Milner said. In 2013, he was diagnosed with a tumor in his esophagus that had spread to his lymph nodes and began treatment. Once a charismatic and well-known presence on the televangelist circuit, Schuller faded from view in recent years after watching his church collapse amid a disastrous leadership transition and sharp declines in viewership and donations that ultimately forced the ministry to file for bankruptcy. The soaring, glass-paned Crystal Cathedral — the touchstone of Schuller's storied ministry — was sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange in 2011, and Schuller lost a legal battle the following year to collect more than $5 million from his former ministry for claims of copyright infringement and breach of contract. Scroll down for video . Minister: Rev. Robert H. Schuller  died early Thursday in California at the age of 88 . Beginnings: . He and his late wife, Arvella (seen together in 1950) started a ministry in 1955 with $500 when he began preaching from the roof of a concession stand at a drive-in movie theater southeast of Los Angeles . Schuller, who preached in a flowing purple robe and outsized aviator glasses, suffered a mild heart attack in 1997 but was quickly back on the pulpit, saying 'the positive person' is not afraid of life's surprises. In July 2013, he was hospitalized for days after a late-night fall at his home in Orange. Schuller's evangelical Protestant ministry, part of the Reformed Church in America, was a product of modern technology. He and his late wife, Arvella, an organist, started a ministry in 1955 with $500 when he began preaching from the roof of a concession stand at a drive-in movie theater southeast of Los Angeles. The church's motto — 'Come as you are in the family car' — tapped into the burgeoning Southern California auto culture and the suburban boom of post-World War II America. By 1961, the church had a brick-and-mortar home — a 'walk-in/drive-in church' — and Schuller began broadcasting the 'Hour of Power' in 1970. In 1980, he built the towering glass-and-steel Crystal Cathedral to house his booming TV ministry, which was broadcast live each week from the cathedral's airy and sunlit 2,800-seat sanctuary. At its peak, in the 1990s, the program had 20 million viewers in about 180 countries. Preaching: The Reverend Robert Schuller is seen here on January 28, 1996, urging John du Pont - whose life story was dramatized in the 2014 film 'Foxcatcher' to give up after killing Dave Schultz . Success: Schuller (seen in 1980) he built the Crystal Cathedral to house his booming TV ministry, which was broadcast live each week from the cathedral's airy and sunlit 2,800-seat sanctuary . Couple: Besides his son, Schuller and his wife, Arvella, had four daughters, Sheila, Jeanne, Carol and Gretchen. Arvella Schuller died Feb. 11, 2014, after a brief illness. The couple is seen together in 1997 . Schuller hailed from Iowa, and according to the Des Moines Register, once said 'To the degree I have been successful, I owe it to integrity. 'Integrity absolutely goes with the territory in Iowa. If you are a farmer in Iowa, you can't be dishonest. You aren't just passing through. You expect to be buried here.' Schuller's message — that 'Possibility Thinking' and love of God overcome hardships — was a uniquely American blend of Bible and psychology. It was inspired by late author Norman Vincent Peale, who wrote 'The Power of Positive Thinking.' Schuller also wrote more than 30 books, including several best-sellers. 'He was a young guy like me, and he was going out there and trying new things,' said his grandson, Bobby Schuller, who pastors his own church that includes some of his grandfather's former congregants. 'He did so many amazing, innovative things.' Unlike other televangelists, the senior Schuller's message lacked fire-and-brimstone condemnations or conservative political baggage. 'The classical error of historical Christianity is that we have never started with the value of the person. Rather, we have started from the 'unworthiness of the sinner,' and that starting point has set the stage for the glorification of human shame in Christian theology,' he wrote in his book 'Self-Esteem: The New Reformation.' Schuller had admirers that ranged from fellow evangelist Billy Graham to Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. He also was among the first foreign religious figures invited to preach on Russian television. Fundamentalists attacked him as a heretic and humanist for statements they believed denied the need for personal repentance of sin and for his tolerance of Jewish, Roman Catholic and other theologies. His friendship with President Bill Clinton raised some eyebrows among the conservative Republicans of his Orange County congregation and prompted a deluge of irate letters and telephone calls. In response, Schuller gave a sermon on tolerance. Family: In this 2010 file photo, Sheila Schuller Coleman, right, stands next to her father, Robert H. Schuller, as she delivers her sermon . Friendship: Schuller's friendship with President Clinton raised some eyebrows among the conservative Republicans of his Orange County congregation and prompted a deluge of irate letters and telephone calls (2006 file photo) 'I do let people know how great their sins and miseries are,' he said in a 1992 radio interview. 'I don't do that by standing in a pulpit and telling them they're sinners. ...The way I do it is ask questions. Are you happy? Do you have problems, what are they? So then I come across as somebody who cares about them.' Schuller sometimes cited the example of his daughter Carol, who lost part of her leg because of a motorcycle accident in 1978 but went on to become a champion skier. 'When tough times come, we need to take tough action, to hold on until the tide turns for the better, to tenaciously dig in and bloom where we are planted,' he wrote. Tough times were in store for Schuller, too. In 2006, Schuller's only son, 51-year-old Robert A. Schuller, was installed as senior pastor, the start of a carefully choreographed leadership transition. Although a father-son succession is rare in the Reformed Church in America, the Schullers considered the church a 'family business' and the move was sanctioned by the national church, officials said. Popular: At its peak, in the 1990s, the 'Hour of Power,' filmed at the Crsytal Cathedral, had 20 million viewers in about 180 countries . Guest: First lady Hillary Clinton stands in the audience before President Clinton's State of the Union Address Tuesday, Feb. 4, 1997, at the Capitol with Schuller . But the organization fell on difficult times after the younger Schuller's installation, and he left amid a bitter family feud in fall 2008. His father had removed him from the 'Hour of Power' broadcasts, and he quit as senior pastor a few weeks later. Sheila Schuller Coleman, one of Schuller's daughters, took over as the church's top administrator, and a stable of preachers, including her and her father, handled preaching duties on the 'Hour of Power.' She, too, ultimately left, taking some congregants with her to start a new ministry. The tumult in the pulpit worsened a pre-existing decline in viewership and donations, and in 2010, Crystal Cathedral ministries filed for bankruptcy, citing debt of more than $43 million. Bankruptcy filings indicated the ministry was paying significant tax-exempt housing allowances to Schuller family members and insiders. The allowances were legal but raised concerns among vendors and other creditors who had gone unpaid for months. In 2012, Schuller and his wife quit the board of directors in a dispute over copyright infringement and breach of contract. That same year, they lost a legal bid to recover more than $5 million from their former ministry. Schuller's grandson, Bobby Schuller, took the remaining congregation and founded a new church. Bobby Schuller also took over the 'Hour of Power,' broadcasting from a new location. Bobby Schuller tweeted Wednesday 'My Grandfather Robert H. Schuller passed this morning into eternal life with Christ.' 'My father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning,' Donna Schuller tweeted. 'He was a great Dad and a great man of God.' She earlier told the Orange County Register 'He was talking normally a couple of months ago. But since the [digestive tract] procedure, he was whispering. And later, he could barely mouth words.' She told the newspaper before his death 'He doesn't seem to be in pain. He's had a wonderful life and he’ll pass gracefully.' Robert Harold Schuller was born in Alton, Iowa, in 1926, and was ordained by the Reformed Church in America in 1950. He was pastor of Ivanhoe Reformed Church in Chicago from 1950 to 1955 before moving to California. Besides his son, Schuller and his wife, Arvella, had four daughters, Sheila, Jeanne, Carol and Gretchen. Arvella Schuller died Feb. 11, 2014, after a brief illness.","The Rev. Robert H.

"The parents of a newborn baby girl have spoken of their heartbreak after  she was born without any eyes. Mother-of-three Danielle Davis, 24, refused a termination when a routine scan showed her baby had a cyst on the brain. But when Daisy was born, Ms Davis and her partner Andrew Smith, 31, were told she had the rare disorder Anophthalmia, meaning she had no eyes. The condition is incurable, and so while Daisy can be fitted with glass eyes as she gets older, she will never be able to see. Danielle Davis, 24, has told of her heartbreak as her daughter Daisy, now eight weeks old, was born without any eyes . Daisy suffers from Anopthalmia, a rare condition which means 'lack of eyes'. Daisy will never be able to see, but some children with the disease have prosthetic eyes fitted for cosmetic reasons . Ms Davis refused a termination when a scan revealed a brain cyst, and says she 'has no regrets'. Daisy is now at home enjoying time with her mother Danielle, father Andrew, 31, and siblings Logan, six, and Tyler, four . Ms Davis, a care worker from Cwmbran, South Wales, said: 'It was a shock - we had never heard of it before and neither had any of our friends or family. 'People didn't really know what to say when we told them. 'But she is our gorgeous baby and we have no regrets about turning down a termination. 'We want to give Daisy as normal a life as possible and give her the same opportunities as other children.' Anophthalmia is a rare disease in which a baby is born with no eyes. It develops during pregnancy, and affects around one in 10,000 births in the UK. There is sadly no cure. Ms Davis said: 'The cyst showed up on the 21-week scan and naturally, we were worried about it. Anophthalmia means an absence of the eye. A child may be born with one, or both eyes, missing from the eye socket. The rare disorder develops during pregnancy and can be associated with other birth defects. The condition may be caused by genetic mutations and abnormal chromosomes. Researchers also believe that environmental factors, such as exposure to X-rays, chemicals, drugs, pesticides, toxins, radiation, or viruses, increase the risk of anophthalmia, but research is not conclusive. Unfortunately, there is no treatment that will restore vision in children affected by Anophthalmia. Children will need to undergo repeated hospital visits and many have prosthetic eyes to ensure that the bone and soft tissue around the eye socket grows properly and to improve appearance. Source: The Micro and Anopthalmic Children's Society . 'But none of the doctors said our baby could be born blind. 'Everyone has been really supportive and I can't thank the doctors and midwives enough for all of their help.' Daisy, now eight weeks old, is settling in at home with her siblings Logan, six, and Tyler, four. She will be admitted to the Great Ormond Street Hospital later this month for an operation to fit glass eyes. They will be replaced when she is 18-months-old with painted eyes that will look more natural. Her parents are now planning a 12,000 ft skydive to raise funds for the charity RNIB that supports people with sight loss. The couple also want to raise awareness of the condition. Ms Davis said: 'I hope that by raising awareness other parents to be won't experience the same shock that we did if their child has the condition.' The news comes after MailOnline reported on the story of baby Richie, who was also born without eyes, in January. Staff at Arizona's Banner Desert Medical Center initially thought  Richie's face was swollen at birth. But they were stunned to discover the reason his eyelids would not open was because he had anolpthalmia. Richie’s mother Kelly Lopez, from Mesa, Arizona, is optimistic that science will progress enough to help Richie see in his lifetime. Baby Richie Lopez was born with Anopthalmia in January.

"Hundreds of explorers, theorists and fantasists have spent their lives searching for the infamous 'big-foot'. But a leading geneticist believes he has found evidence to prove that it - or rather she - could have been more than a myth. Professor Bryan Sykes of the University of Oxford claims a towering woman named Zana who lived in 19th Century Russia - and appeared to be 'half human, half ape' - could have been the fabled yeti. Witnesses described the six-foot, six-inches tall woman discovered in the Caucasus mountains  between Georgia and Russia as having 'all the characteristics of a wild animal' - and covered in thick auburn hair. Scroll down for video . Historic: A leading genetecist claims a towering woman named Zana (artist's representation) who lived in 19th Century Russia - and appeared to be 'half human, half ape' - could have been the fabled yeti . Proof: DNA evidence from Zana's granddaughter (left) and the remains of her son Khwit (right) seemed proved that Zana was of African descent even though she lived in the wild Caucusus . Wild: Zana was discovered and trapped by a local merchant who hired a group of hunters to hunt her down in the region of Ochamchir - and she was eventually tamed by a nobleman on his estate in Tkhina . Treacherous: It is thought Zana roamed the remote Caucusus mountains, where Sykes says her African ancestors lived for many generations . Trapped: A merchant found Zana in the Ochamchir region of western Georgia and after hunters caught her, they placed her in a ditch surrounded by sharp spikes . Mythical: Witnesses described the six-foot, six-inches tall woman  as having 'all the characteristics of a wild animal' (fabled 'big-foot' pictured) Experts believe the wandering 'Wild Woman' was found lurking in the remote region of Ochamchir in the Republic of Abkhazia. She was captured by a local merchant in the 1850s who hired a group of hunters to subdue and shackle her in the mountainous terrain. Professor Sykes claims Zana was kept in a 'ditch surrounded by sharpened spikes' and sold from owner to owner until she came to serve nobleman Edgi Genaba as a servant. Famously known as the ape woman, Zana had at least four children by local men and some of her descendants still live in the region, the Times reported. Sykes made an astonishing discovery when he carried out saliva tests on six of her living relatives and the tooth of her deceased son Khwit. The DNA analysis revealed that they all contained the right amount of African DNA for Zana the ape woman to be '100 per cent African' but remarkably she did not resemble any known group. Discovery: Professor Bryan Sykes of the University of Oxford analysed the DNA of her living relatives in the Caucuses region and found west-African genes . Myth? The first accounts of the Yeti emerged before the 19th century from Buddhists who believed that the creature inhabited the Himalayas . Her resemblance was that of a wild beast - 'the most frightening feature of which was her expression which was pure animal,' one Russian zoologist wrote in 1996. The man who organised various eyewitness accounts of Zana wrote: 'Her athletic power was enormous. Evidence: In his book 'Nature of the Best', Sykes argues that Zana could be the yeti . She would outrun a horse and swim across the Moskva river even when it rose in violent high tide.' Some have argued that she was a runaway Ottoman slave but Professor Sykes says her 'unparalleled DNA' refutes that theory. He believes her ancestors came out of Africa over 100,000 years ago and lived in the remote Caucasus for many generations. Zana was eventually 'tamed' by the nobleman who bought her as a servant and kept her on his estate in Tkhina in the Republic of Abkhazia. Accounts from the time claim she was incredibly muscular, slept outdoors and ran around naked until she died on the estate in 1890. Some of his colleagues doubt his other findings - which include a claim that an unknown species of bear might account for yeti sightings in Bhutan. Despite the lack of hard proof from the analysis of the alleged 'yeti hairs', he says he has developed a strong sense that 'something is out there' after speaking to dozens of witnesses. Professor Sykes could not say if the yeti, bigfoot or the Russian almasty is the best candidate for a surviving race of human 'apemen'. He said: 'Bigfoot has many more people trying to find it. But I suppose either the yeti or the alma / almasty, which live in inaccessible and very thinly populated regions, is the most likely.' The first accounts of Yetis emerged before the 19th century from Buddhists who believed that the creature inhabited the Himalayas. They depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound. In 1832, an explorer who had his account of trekking in Nepal published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal spoke of seeing tall, bipedal creature covered with long dark hair, which seemed to flee in fear. The term Abominable Snowman was developed in 1921 following a book by Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Howard-Bury called Mount Everest The Reconnaissance. Popular interest in creature gathered pace in early 20th century as tourists began making their own trips to the region to try and capture the Yeti. They reported seeing strange markings in the snow. Mystical: Hundreds of explorers, theorists and fantasists have spent their lives searching for the infamous 'big-foot' The Daily Mail led a trip called the the Snowman Expedition in 1954 to Everest. During the trip mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson photographed ancient paintings of Yetis and large footprints in the snow. A number of hair samples were also found that were believed to have come from a Yeti scalp. British mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when scaling Annapurna in 1970. He said that while searching for a campsite he heard some odd cries which his guide attributed to a Yeti's call. That night, he saw a dark shape moving near his camp. In recent times, there have been more reported Yeti sightings and at a conference in Russia in 2011, scientists declared they were 95 per cent certain of the existence of Yetis. In 2013, a scientist claimed that the Yeti was a distant relative of the polar bear, which is thought to have died out more than 40,000 years ago. But researchers have shown that the two hair samples analysed actually originated from a modern polar bear, and a type of rare bear native to the high mountain ranges.","Witnesses said Zana the apewoman had the 'characteristics of a wild animal'

"A young boy enjoyed a rare opportunity to interact with a brown bear when he was befriended by one at a zoo. Wandering over to the protective glass, the youngster named Gabriel is captured on camera standing next to the bear, which sits partially submerged in the water in a North American zoo. Looking to his dad for reassurance, the young boy asks whether he is safe and his dad comically replies: ‘That’s pretty strong glass, hopefully.’ The dad then states: ‘Wow, that’s cool,’ as the bear, which is believed to be called Cheyenne, sits calmly next to the youngster, as if enjoying his company from the other side of the partition. The father then instructs his son to put his hand up against the glass and as he does so the bear moves towards him with its nose rubbing against the glass. The young boy at first doesn't seem too interested in the bear, then starts posing for the camera as the animal begins to interact and appears to try and bite him through the glass . The bear then begins mouthing at the partition, which causes the youngster’s parents to laugh and the father to say: ‘He wants to chew on you.’ Moving back to his original position, Gabriel puts both of his hands up on to the glass window and suddenly the bear springs into action and jumps up to greet him. Helping the bear out, Gabriel moves his hands to be in line with its paws and looks around at the camera to smile. Meanwhile the bear opens its mouth wide and attempts to bite the youngster through the glass. Later in the video the bear rubs up against the partition and shakes the top half of its body dry before following the boy’s hand with its mouth, as if planning to bite it through the glass. The youngster’s dad then states: ‘That sign said they would eat anything, do you think they would eat a Gabriel?’ The boy and bear go on to play together as the boy puts his hands against the glass and the animal mimics his actions . At one point the boy Gabriel tells his family 'he wants me to get in there' Before humorously answering his own question with: ‘probably.’ Becoming more playful, the bear suddenly comes alive and actually appears to dance while rubbing up against the glass once more. Gabriel says: ‘He wants me to get in there,’ before cautiously walking away from the bear  and stating: ‘He better not break through.’ The young boy then starts moving left to right and despite the distractions of a young girl and the video maker, the bear swims after him. The video concludes with the youngster attempting to coax the bear out of the water, before giving up and standing opposite it once more.","The boy named Gabriel holds his hands up to the bear's paws .

"Kate Winslet faces a planning battle with Natural England over plans to build sea defences . Kate Winslet is to face a battle with Natural England over plans to build a 550ft-long wall to protect her £3.25 million beachside home from flooding and erosion. The multi BAFTA-winning actress, 39, wants to install a boulder and gravel seawall along the West Sussex coast to protect her property. But Natural England has recommended the planning application be refused - citing concerns  it may result in the 'direct loss' of natural habitat designated for rare and vulnerable birds, trees and wetlands. The Academy Award-winning actress bought the eight bedroom house in West Sussex in 2013. She lives there with her husband, Richard Branson's nephew Ned Rocknroll, and her three children. But the environmental body has recommended her local District Council reject the application because of concerns over the impact it will have on the natural habitat. It is also unclear what effect the sea wall would have on a public footpath that runs along the bottom of the estate by the seashore. The shoreline is currently unprotected. The actress' Grade II-listed home backs onto a site that is a designated special protection area to safeguard wildlife living along the coast. Wildlife  include waders, geese, ducks, herons, terns and cormorants. It is also in a 'Ramsar site', according to Natural England - which are protected under Government policy as 'proposed or listed wetlands of international importance.' The application is one of a number of requests previously submitted to the council for extensive renovation work at the house including the building of an underground swimming pool, garage and pool house. The planning document states: 'The proposed privately funded sea defences will ensure that the existing vegetation and public footpath will be protected into the future. 'Furthermore it should be considered that the footpath is liable to become dangerous in areas without protection from further erosion of the existing banks.' A spokesman for Natural England said: 'Our objection centres on the fact that the application site falls within land which is protected as a Special Area of Conservation, Special Protection Area, Ramsar and Site of Special Scientific Interest. 'The proposal would result in direct loss of protected habitat and would be likely to have a significant, adverse effect on these designated sites. Winslet wants to build a sea wall along the West Sussex coast to protect her £3.25million beach house . Plans submitted to her local District Council show the proposed sea wall to protect Winslet's property . 'The application did not include any information to address the likely impacts and no mitigation was proposed. 'We will continue to liaise with the applicant about alternatives which would avoid loss of designated habitat.' A local conservation body has also submitted comments on the application and said it is concerned about the impact of a sea wall on the appearance of the area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB). Concerns have also been raised about potential erosion of a coastal path that could be caused by the defence . In a letter it said: 'We remain unconvinced of the need for this sea defence, and that its impacts on the landscape and nature conservation interests of the AONB would be acceptable.' The Conservancy has also recommended the application be refused. This is not the first time the actress has come across problems with planning applications. Winslet previously owned a £2 million home in Treyford, near Chichester. But she sold the 15th century property in 2014 following another planning spat with locals after she proposed to install gates at the entrance. The council has set aside more time for the planning application to be explored further. No date has been set for a decision.","Kate Winslet submitted application for a sea wall along West Sussex coast .

"A disgruntled McDonald's customer has revealed why she allegedly assaulted a 16-year-old worker at the fast food chain over her order of fries. Amy Johnson, from Sydney, said outside court on Thursday: 'We checked our food and all the chips were not even in the cups.' The 38-year-old mother saw red and is now facing serious assault charges after she allegedly grabbed the young woman by the neck and scratched her face. Appearing at Newtown court, in Sydney's inner west, on Thursday, she said she became aggressive because the fries had spilled out of their containers and the McDonald's worker used her hands to put them back in the packet. 'We gave the bag back and said, can you please place them in a cup?,' Ms Johnson told Channel Nine News. 'She put her hands in the bag, no gloves or nothing, picked up the chips and shoved them in the boxes and gave back the bag and that's when we got angry and we threw the bag back and said ""make us new chips"".' Scroll down for video . 38-year-old Amy Johnson faces two assault charges and has faced court today after she grabbed a teenage McDonald's worker around the neck and scratched her face . The Daily Telegraph reported Ms Johnson was a passenger in a BMW when she went through the McDonald's drive-through at Stanmore in Sydney's inner west on March 17 at 6.10pm. The assault allegedly happened after her $60 order went wrong. When she received her food from the 16-year-old girl at the drive-through hatch, the woman allegedly threw it back into the window and demanded a new order. The young female employee asked the driver to pull into the waiting bay while a new order was prepared. But Ms Johnson then allegedly got out of the car and entered the store yelling at the teenager. Police say she grabbed the 16-year-old by the neck and scratched her face before the 21-year-old manager intervened to stop her.

"A 17-year-old boy who was shot dead from behind by a police officer had just stolen a handgun, according to the police department in question. Justus Howell was gunned down from behind by an officer in Zion, Illinois on Saturday afternoon after officers were called to reports of an argument. The chief of the Zion Police Department has now said that the argument was in fact a scuffle over a handgun - during which the firearm went off and Howell allegedly pointed it at another teenager. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon . 'Stole a handgun': Police say that Howell had just taken a weapon from Tramond Peet, 18, who was trying to sell it to him . Steve Dumyahn said Howell was struggling over a gun with Tramond Peet, 18, and started running when police showed up. Peet told officers he met Howell with the intention of selling him the gun - but Howell tried to snatch it without paying. He then claimed the two tussled over the weapon, which was fired into the ground. At one point, he said, Howell was pointing it at him. Peet told investigators that he let go of the gun when he heard sirens. He said Howell ran and that he heard officers shouting instructions, then opening fire. An autopsy on Howell revealed that he was hit by two bullets, both from behind. Aftermath: Investigators are pictured above at the scene of the shooting, which took place around 2pm . One his his left side and penetrated his heart, spleen and liver. The second hit him on the right side of his back. Tests to see whether there were drugs in Howell's body are not finished yet. In the wake of his death, Howell's mother LaToya told Fox News her son 'couldn't have been a threat'. She said: 'Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police'. 'As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn't have been a threat if he was running.' Peet appeared in court Monday on two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He is being held on a $15,000 bond. Dumyahn said the Zion Police Department was releasing the narrative from the shooting because media outlets had linked Peet's case to the shooting. He said the department has 'no desire to defame the deceased'. Courts: Peet appeared in court Monday charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon . Claim: Zion Police chief Steve Dumyahn said the department had 'no desire to defame' Howell, but released the details because media outlets realized his case and Peet's are connected . Dumyahn said the officer who shot Howell is a nine-year veteran, and is now on administrative leave. He did not release the officer's name or any additional information about him, including his race. Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said his relatives have asked her organization to speak on their behalf. Witherspoon said authorities told the NAACP that they have videotape of the scuffle between Peet and Howell but can't yet say what led the officer to shoot Howell. She said Howell's relatives are hoping to find out exactly what happened as quickly as possible. She said: 'Whether it was a mistake on his part or a mistake on the police's part, they want answers to make sure something like this never happens again'. Howell's death is the latest in a series of unarmed black men being killed by police officers - the most high-profile example of which was the death of Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. Witherspoon added: 'Here in America we are seeing this with too many brown and black boys.' Zion is a community of about 24,000 people along Lake Michigan, 45 miles north of Chicago, near Illinois' border with Wisconsin. Howell was a high school junior who transferred from a school in Wisconsin to Waukegan Public School District 60.","Justus Howell was shot dead on Saturday afternoon in Zion, Illinois .

"Winter weary New Yorkers have been given a timely reminder that Spring has finally sprung. Smokey Da Lamb has been turning heads in some of the city's coolest neighborhoods ever since restaurant owner Sandy Dee Hall, 34, and his girlfriend Maxine Cher, 24, adopted him. But now the couple - and Smokey's impressive legion of fans - have been left devastated after city officials demanded he is taken out of the metropolis. Scroll down for video . Happy family: Restaurant owner Sandy Dee Hall, 34 (R), and his girlfriend Maxine Cher, 24 (L), adopted Smokey Da Lamb after he was abandoned by his mother . Lamb and the City: Smokey has made dozens of friends during his month-long stay in New York, however city officials are now demanding that he be sent back to live on the farm . At home: The young lamb has been living with Sandy in his Lower East Side apartment, and the couple have been providing him with round-the-clock care and attention . 'Unfortunately Smokey has got to go back to the farm – we're not allowed to keep a lamb in the city,' Maxine said. 'I'll be sad to see him go because he's so loving but we're officially adopting him which means he will never end up on a dinner plate. 'We'll visit as often as we can – Sandy has even taken lamb off the menu at his restaurant The Black Tree, in tribute to Smokey. 'Smokey has caused a few disasters while he's been here but he's a farmyard animal so it's to be expected. 'We're still going to miss him hugely.' Devotion: Maxine (pictured) and Sandy bottle-feed Smokey three times a day and have to burp him after he has eaten . Friendly face: Smokey has been growing quickly since arriving in the city - and is much more confident than he was when he first moved into Sandy's apartment . Accidents do happen: Maxine admitted that Smokey is a bit like a 'dog which has not been potty trained' She added: 'Everybody should own a lamb – he is great and so loving. 'I guess he's like a dog which has not been potty trained.' Smokey was born at Violet Hill Farm in upstate New York but was abandoned by his mother and would have likely died in the cold. Fortunately Sandy, who runs Manhattan-based restaurant Black Tree, agreed to take him in when contacted by the farmer and Smokey was smuggled into his tiny apartment in the city's Lower East Side . 'Sandy told me that he had adopted a lamb and I said he was crazy – we couldn't look after a lamb,' Maxine explained. Something for everyone: The couple believe that everybody should get the chance to own a lamb . Crazy: When Sandy first told Maxine that he had adopted a lamb from a farm in upstate New York, she admits she thought the idea was ridiculous . Change of heart: 'When I saw him my heart melted,' Maxine admits . Keep clean: In addition to his regular bottle feeds, Maxine and Sandy have to bathe Smokey regularly, ensuring that they only use water so that his fleece doesn't shrink . 'But when I saw him my heart melted - he was so cute. 'He must have been around 3 or 4 pounds and was wearing a little diaper with his tail sticking out. He was so sweet and loving.' Smokey is bottle-fed three times a day and needs to be burped like a baby after he has had his formula. He needs regular baths and can only be washed with water so his fleece does not shrink. Maxine added: 'We take him out for regular walks in the park – he really loves that. Restaurant revolution: Since adopting Smokey, Sandy has removed all lamb dishes from the menu at his Manhattan restaurant, Black Tree . Take a seat: Often Smokey will spend time with restaurant-goers, keeping them entertained while they wait for their food . Fan club: The people of New York have quickly fallen in love with Smokey's charming personality . Let me take a selfie! Smokey has quickly become a social media star; almost everyone who meets him wants to snap a picture with the popular pet . 'Smokey never needs a lead because he just likes to follow us around. 'In many ways he's better than a dog but I've never known a dog that needs to be bottle fed – or who poops and pees so much. 'Whenever I stay at Sandy's apartment I will sleep in the bed and Sandy will sleep in the living room with Smokey. 'We can't let him in the bedroom because he will make a big mess in there. 'People in the city love him, it's hard to get too far when you have Smokey with you. They'll do double takes then run back to stroke him and take pictures – he's so popular.'","Restaurant owner Sandy Dee Hall, 34, and his girlfriend Maxine Cher, 24, adopted Smokey Da Lamb after he was abandoned by his mother .

"A 200-year-old book of poetry gifted to George III and letters from Rear Admiral Sir Samuel Hood written during the American War of Independence are among a treasure trove of documents released by royal archive yesterday. The collection, which was amassed by George III and has been under lock and key for 200 years, has been digitised and the Queen was at Windsor Castle for the launch. Declaring herself 'stunned' by the collection, none of which she had seen before, Her Majesty admired the poems, which were written by the Shah of Persia himself, and quipped: 'You don't get gifts like that any more!' Scroll down for video . Treasure trove: The Queen inspects a 200-year-old book of poetry presented to George III . Incredible: The book (back, beside the Queen), was presented by the Shah of Persia in 1825 . Along with the poems, which were given to the Hanoverian monarch  in 1812, was a collection of scientific instruments, many of which were considered advanced in their day. Other documents shown to the Queen touch on some of the most important events in history, among them the American War of Independence. One particularly significant document was written by Rear-Admira Hood and details naval failings during the battle of Chesapeake Bay. The battle, between British and French fleets, resulted in the last significant British army in the Thirteen Colonies being cut off - and led directly to US independence. Other papers include an essay written by George III on the relationship between the monarch and parliament and notes from Queen Charlotte to her children's governess. Significant: This letter was written by Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood following the Battle of Chesapeake Bay . Royal handiwork: This essay on the relationship between monarch and Parliament was written by George III . The viewing took place in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle and include papers owned and written by George I, II, III and George IV, who ruled as Prince Regent during his father's famous madness. George III was believed to have suffered from porphyria, a hereditary disease that affects the blood and can cause mania. The digitisation of the 350,000 documents, a task that will be undertaken by academics from King's College London, will begin in the next few weeks. While the vast majority of the collection are papers from George III, other documents from reigns of George I, George II, George IV and William IV will also be made available. It is hoped the work will transform the understanding of Georgian Britain and its monarchy, at a time of profound cultural, political, economic and social change. Stunning: The Queen was also shown the 1765 Eardley Norton clock (right) by  Oliver Urquhart Irvine (left) Project: The Queen  greets Lynn Forney Young from the Daughters of the American Revolution organisation . Stunned: The Queen declared herself 'stunned' by the contents of the archive, all previously unseen . Big job: The digitisation of the 350,000 papers will be overseen by academics from King's College London . 'The Queen said she was stunned by the beauty of the gifts and letters, especially the Persian book of poetry that she was looking at earlier,' said Dr Joanna Newman, vice principal of the university, afterwards. 'She talked a great deal about the letters, she said she was extremely interested in them, that they were very impressive and that she is very happy for the collaboration to be with King’s College.' Other letters seen by the Queen include one from John Jay, a merchant who went on to become one of the Founding Fathers of the US, to future president George Washington in 1781. Another, dating from the same period, was sent to George III by a spy named Aristarchus. The project is part of a wider programme of work by the Royal Archives to open up access to its primary source material, following the success of the digitisation of Queen Victoria’s journals in 2012. Professor Edward Byrne, president and principal of King’s College London, said: 'King’s was founded by King George IV - George III’s eldest son and successor - and with Her Majesty the Queen as our present day patron, we are delighted and honoured to have been approached by the Royal Household to work on this prestigious project and to continue our long history of association with the Crown. 'This joint project, to open up over a century of Royal Archives, provides an unprecedented scale of opportunity to discover more about the Georgians.' Royal childhood: This letter is from Queen Charlotte to her children's governess, Lady Charlotte Finch . Involvement: The British Library, which is also involved, was represented by Baroness Blackstone (centre) Along with personal letters written by George I, II and III, and their wives, the newly unveiled archive also includes documents that could shed fresh light on the American War of Independence. Most significant is an epistle written by Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood to General de Budé, George III's aide-de-camp, on the 16th September 1781. Written after the Battle of the Chesapeake (or the Virginia Capes) on 5th September 1781, it offers a critique of the British action and attempts to explain why it ended in a French victory. One of the most significant battles of the American War of Independence, the French win led directly to US independence, cutting off, as it did, the last substantial British army in the Thirteen Colonies and obliging it to surrender. Hood, while attempting to exonerate himself in the letter which was written 11 days after the battle, also includes copies of dispatches and reveals that it could have been a British victory had an earlier opportunity to engage the French been taken. Equally significant is an incomplete essay written by George III which meditates on the relationship between the monarch and Parliament. In it, George, who was keen to re-establish royal authority and patronage, muses on the idea of having 'supreme power' over the Commons while also laying out how the legislative and the executive worked in the 18th century. Further documents include letters from Queen Charlotte to Lady Charlotte Finch, who held the position of governess to the royal children. In the correspondence, the two discuss child-rearing and emphasise the value of routine and regular mealtimes, with Lady Charlotte going on to complain of her 'distress' at things becoming disorganised. The collection also includes 65,000 books from the library amassed by George III which, along with volumes of poetry, also include a number printed in and about the US - testament to the monarch's interest in the colony.","An archive of royal letters and books unseen for 200 years is to be digitised .

"A four-poster bed which was dumped in a hotel car park and sold for £2,200 has been verified as once belonging to King Henry VII – and it could now be worth millions. The intricately-carved ornate bed was left in the car park of the former Redland House Hotel in Hough Green, Chester, by builders who were renovating the property. Oblivious to its true value and historical significance, the construction workers dismantled the piece of oak wood furniture and left it to be picked up by auctioneers. The four-poster oak wood bed (above), which was dumped in the car park of Redland House Hotel in Chester and later sold at auction for £2,200, has now been confirmed by DNA as once belonging to King Henry VII . The intricately-carved bed was left in the car park of the former hotel by builders who were renovating the property and, oblivious to its true value and historical significance,  left it to be picked up by auctioneers . It was snapped up for £2,200 in 2010 by Ian Coulson, a four-poster bed specialist from Northumberland who spotted the item, which was listed as 19th-century gothic revival, on the internet. However, he was shocked when his new 'Victorian' purchase arrived and approached TV historian Jonathan Foyle with a suspicion that the bed was, in fact, the only surviving Tudor bed. Since then, Mr Foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact's historical roots and has now revealed that DNA testing on the bed's timber proved it once belonged to King Henry VII. He said tests confirmed it was European oak and of a sub-species 'typical of the origin of the finest, slow-grown oak imported by the medieval elites', with analysis of the historic paintwork proving its age. 'Under the varnish, traces of late medieval decoration have been found,' he said. He has traced it back to 1495, when Henry VII went to Lathom in Lancashire to see the Stanley family, who had helped him to victory in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Mr Foyle said DNA from the bed's timber proved it once belonged to King Henry VII (pictured) and he traced it back to 1495, when Henry VII went to Lathom in Lancashire.  Henry VIII may have been conceived in the bed . The bed was snapped up by Ian Coulson, a four-poster bed specialist from Northumberland, for £2,200 in 2010 after it was dumped in the car park of the former Redland House Hotel in Hough Green, Chester (above) TV historian Jonathan Foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact's historical roots and has now revealed that DNA testing on the bed's timber proved the medieval furniture once belonged to King Henry VII . He also discovered that the bed features an inscription from the Matthew Bible of 1537 - reading: 'The stinge of death is sinne. The strength of sinne is the lawe' - which was added after 1547, when England had a Protestant monarch. The carving also features biblical scenes of Henry and his wife Elizabeth of York styled as Adam and Eve, and as Jesus Christ and his mother, the Virgin Mary and the figures are accompanied by medieval symbols of fertility, such as acorns, bunches of grapes and strawberries. Meanwhile, scribblings in a Victorian furniture restorer's diary suggested that the bed was at Lathom when it was damaged during a siege in 1644. Mr Foyle said he had proved that the item was not the work of Victorian revivalists by reflecting on the Tudors' belief that they had been chosen by God to save England from civil war. The bed features an inscription from the Matthew Bible of 1537 - reading: 'The stinge of death is sinne. The strength of sinne is the lawe' - which was added after 1547, when England had a Protestant monarch . The bed also features carvings of biblical scenes of Henry and his wife Elizabeth of York styled as Adam and Eve, and as Jesus Christ and his mother, the Virgin Mary and the figures of medieval symbols of fertility . He said the headboard showed Henry VII and his bride as Adam and Eve transmuted into Christ - adding: 'It's arguably the cradle of the English Reformation. Henry VIII may have been conceived in bed . The carved four-poster bed, which has been revealed as Henry VIIs, was reportedly created for the marriage of the first Tudor King and his wife, Elizabeth of York, on January 18, 1486. It is highly likely that the couple's son, Henry, was conceived in the bed - meaning the item may have a physical link to the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. Born at Greenwich Palace in 1491, Henry VIII was the third child and second son of Henry VII and his wife. Only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 April, 1509. Under Henry VIII's reign, England turned in favour of Protestantism and split from Rome, the Royal Navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded France. Jonathan Foyle, chief executive of World Monuments Fund Britain, said: 'This bed belonged to Henry VIII. It has to be the most important piece of furniture [in England' - and arguably, royal artefact.' He added: 'Even the Westminster coronation chair has less to say than this.' Experts believe Henry VII may have taken the bed north while on a royal tour following the birth of his son. 'Look how the king and queen represent themselves as manifestations of Christ and Mary; it's Henry VIII's God complex in a nutshell.' Dr Foyle described the 15th Century artefact, which is considered one of the most valuable pieces of historical furniture in England, as 'a complete national treasure'. He added: 'Evidence suggests the bed was made for the Painted Chamber of Westminster Palace for the marriage ceremony at Westminster Abbey on January 18, 1486.' Mr Foyle is backed by other experts, such as Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at Oxford University, who described the rediscovery as 'exceptionally important'. The medieval bed is now reportedly worth up to £20million, although it is currently not up for sale and is instead on public display. It is part of the 'A Bed of Roses' exhibition at the childhood home of Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII's second wife, at Hever Castle in Kent which also features a portrait of Henry VIII as a young man. The bed is not the only historical royal artefact to have been discovered abandoned or hidden in England. In 2013, the battle-scarred skeleton of Richard III was discovered by archaeologists in a car park in Leicester. Meanwhile, in December of the same year, archaeologists uncovered a site in the Amazonian jungle believed to be the tomb of Atahualpa, the last emporer of the Incas. And last year, explorers found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to Alfred the Great in the grounds of Hyde Abbey in Winchester. Henry VII's four-poster bed will remain on display in the Long Gallery at Hever Castle in Kent until November 22.","Four-poster bed dumped in a hotel car park and sold at auction for £2,200 .

"A couple in Texas allegedly tried to resurrect their two-year-old child at a home church before taking the body across the border to Mexico for burial, police said on Thursday. Police went to a home on March 26 in Balch Springs, Texas, to do a welfare check and were told by residents that a two-year-old child had died and a 'rising ceremony' performed, according to CBS. The ceremony was an attempt to resurrect the child, police claimed, and took place on March 22. Police went to a home on March 26 in Balch Springs, Texas, (pictured) to do a wellness check and were told that a two-year-old child had died and the body returned to Mexico. Police were now investigating . Lt Mark Maret told CBS: 'We don’t know if this was to try and resurrect the spirit of the child and we don’t know if this was to try and resurrect the child themselves or what exactly that service or ceremony encompasses.' The child's parents took the body to Mexico the following day. A phone number for the single-story home had been disconnected. A neighbor told Daily Mail Online on Friday that five children under the age of ten, both boys and girls, were also living at the home and had been taken away by Child Protective Services. Joy Donaldson said that she once complained to the woman who lived at the home about two of the boys, who had been bothering her dogs. The woman, whose name she did not know, told her that the children did not know any better 'because they had been taken off the streets of Mexico'. A second neighbor, Jean Turnipseed, told Daily Mail Online on Friday that she had heard  that church services were taking place at the home on Saturdays and Sunday nights, where people were being charged at the door. Unconfirmed reports have suggested that the two-year-old boy, whose name is unknown and who neighbors had not seen, may have died either of starvation or of a fall from a chair last week. Emergency services do not appear to have called until police received an anonymous tip four days later. Multiple calls to the Balch Springs Sheriff's Department went unanswered on Friday. Police refused to release names but an investigation is underway involving both state and federal authorities. According to public records, a branch of the Iglesia Internacional Jesus Es El Rey Church is associated with the home. Calls to church representatives went unanswered on Friday.","Police went to a home on March 26 in Balch Springs, Texas, to do a welfare check and were told by residents that a two-year-old child had died .

"If you're having trouble sleeping it could be down to the interior design of your bedroom. From red walls to bright white lightbulbs and clutter under the bed, there are many things you may never have considered that are preventing you from getting a good night's rest. A new infographic from London furniture company Made.com shows scientifically proven tactics you can use to change the layout of your room. Sleep experts recommended you arrange your room symmetrically, install heavy curtains and keep pets out . If you're having trouble sleeping it could be down to the interior design of your bedroom . Sleep experts recommended you arrange your room symmetrically, install heavy curtains and keep pets out to get a more restful slumber. You should also dim your light three hours before bedtime and stop using gadgets and hour before you hit the sack. Read on for a detailed breakdown of your step-by-step guide to perfect bedtime feng shui. FURNITURE ARRANGEMENTS . Ninety-one per cent of Britons say their sleep environment impacts their sleep. Though we often don't realise, our surroundings affect us in powerful ways. So arrange your bedroom to comfort your body and relax your mind. According to Made.com's tips below: 1. Install a ceiling fan. The ideal temperature for sleep is 18-21C. 2. Open a window just a crack to let air circulate. 3. Add blinds and thick, dark curtains to keep the light out. 4. Plush rugs and cushions muffle noise. 5. Create symmetry matching pairs. 6. Add plants, art or photos of nature and natural materials. 7. Eliminate clutter by investing in cabinets, drawers and storage. 8. Ditch the TV. Fill your space with something beautiful. We spend nearly a third of our lives sleeping. Yet many people don't realise just how sensitive our bodies are during these vital hours of rest. The space we sleep in has a huge effect on the quantity and quality of our sleep - and therefore the quality of our waking lives. After all, when we're not properly rested, our brainpower, digestion, reflexes and much more suffers. Better interior design really can help you get a better night's sleep. SLEEP EXPERTS SAY... LIGHTING THE PATH TO REST . Our bodies have evolved to respond to ambient light. Warm hued rays from the setting sun signal that it's time to sleep, while blue daylight releases hormones to make us alert. Now that we live much of our lives under artificial light, we must mirror these natural light spectrums to keep our circadian rhythms in harmony. According to the infographic, try shutting off computers, TVs and smartphones before going to bed. Make sure your bedroom is in complete darkness, and us low-wattage bulbs after sundown. Avoid blue lights and use lamps with warm yellow, gold or reddish light. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF COLOUR . Just as bright red signals danger in nature, all colours have an impact on our psychology. So paint and decorate your bedroom in soothing hues for better sleep and deeper relaxation. Blues, greens and greys are said to reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure, and promote better sleep. But reds, yellows and oranges increase heart rate and blood pressure so discourage relaxation. PILLOWS AND MATTRESSES: BETTER BEDDING . From the way it feels on your skin to the way it traps allergens to the way it aligns our spines, bedding has a tremendous impact on sleep. If you're a side sleeper, use a firm pillow to get a good night's rest. But, if you like to lie on your back, a medium-firm pillow will promote the best quality shut-eye - for those snoozing on their fronts, a soft pillow is recommended. According to the infographic, the average person move 40-60 times during the night - and so it's recommended to change a mattress every seven to eight years.","Bad quality sleep could be to do with the layout of your bedroom .

"Two comedians and a Coronation Street actress came out in support of Labour at a party rally. Ben Elton took a swipe at Myleene Klass over her criticism of Ed Miliband's mansion tax plans, at the event also attended by Eddie Izzard, Joey Essex and Sally Lindsay. The comedian told a 1,000-strong crowd at Warrington's Parr Hall the popstar - who claimed the planned levy on homes worth more than £2 million would hit 'little grannies' - had made her money 'showering in a bikini' and should be 'proud to make a contribution'. Elton, who distanced himself from the party under Tony Blair, told supporters he was 'back with Labour'. He said: 'It's no secret that I am now one of that wealthy minority. Me and Myleene Klass. Scroll down for video . Comedian Ben Elton, left, took a swipe at Myleene Klass, right, during a rally for Labour supporters . The Only Way is Essex star Joey Essex posed for a selfie with a fan during rally in Warrington . 'I made my money cracking knob gags, she made her money showering in a bikini. 'We should both be proud to make our contribution.' Elton lashed out at the glitzy Black and White fundraising ball staged annually by the Conservatives to raise funds. 'Apparently we are the ones that sneer. Really? Have you seen the Black and White ball? 'Just a little bit of sneering going on I think.' Long-time Labour supporter Eddie Izzard said the party would offer a 'fair chance for everyone'. Actress Sally Lindsay told the crowd 'it makes me sick' that people are having to turn to foodbanks because they cannot afford to eat. The former Coronation Street star backed Labour's plans to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts and called for a 'decent minimum' wage. Coronation Street actress Sally Lindsay joined Justine Miliband and Eddie Izzard at the campaign event . Joey Essex was among the crowd at the rally where Ed Miliband announced a £5 billion Future Homes Fund . 'That's why I'm voting Labour, that's why I support Ed.' Martin Freeman, one of Britain's most bankable Hollywood stars, was the first celebrity face to back Labour's 2015 General Election campaign. Joey Essex, who posed for selfies with excited fans, was attending the event ahead of interviewing all the party leaders for a TV special. At the rally in Warrington, Ed Miliband told supporters a Labour government would 'get Britain building again'. Announcing a £5 billion Future Homes Fund, he said Labour would build 125,000 new homes. In a speech, he said: 'There's nothing more British than the dream of home ownership. Starting out in a place of your own. But for so many young people today that dream is fading.' He went on: 'Our plan is the first real plan for housebuilding in a generation. 'We will build at least 200,000 homes a year by the end of the Parliament. 'We won't let those large developers just hoard land. 'Waiting for it to go up in value when it could be used to build homes. 'We'll say: either you use the land or you lose the land. 'We will build a new generation of towns, garden cities and suburbs creating over half a million new homes. Ed Miliband, speaking at the rally,  said a Labour government would 'get Britain building again' 'We will make housing the top priority for additional capital investment.' Mr Miliband added: 'The banks will benefit from the taxpayer support we will provide to help people save for their first home. 'In return, we will expect the banks to invest in homes for the next generation. Unlocking £5 billion for 125,000 homes.

"It changed the world with its flat-pack furniture and now Ikea wants to save the planet... with vegetarian meatballs. The dish loved by millions of British customers is to get a meat-free makeover that it is claimed will cut carbon emissions by half. The Swedish firm says producing the new version uses far less energy than making the pork and beef variety. Green scheme: IKEA claims it will 'save the planet' with its new vegetarian meatballs as  far less energy is needed both to produce and cook them than the pork and beef variety . Its veggie balls will be rolled out this month, created from a secret recipe of chickpeas, peas, carrots, peppers, corn, kale and seasoning. Ikea is as famous for its meatballs as its cheap self-assembly furniture and UK customers often spend entire days inside its large warehouses eating and shopping. The company now sells a staggering one billion of its regular meatballs every year. In an interview with the Daily Mail, IKEA chief executive, Peter Agnefjall, said: ‘We are launching a vegetarian meatball. We see a big opportunity. The vegetarian meatball will go global in April and have 50pc less carbon dioxide than a normal meatball. It’s healthier and better for the planet.’ The firm has spent two years developing the veggieball, the first innovation to its meatball since it started selling food to encourage shoppers to stay inside its stores back in 1959. The vegetable-based snack is more environmentally friendly than the meat version, because cows and pigs are responsible for methane emissions. It also takes less energy to cook a veggieball. A spokesman said: ‘At IKEA we want to offer healthy food choices that are delicious, sustainable and affordable for the many, based on our Swedish identity. ‘We are currently developing our food range to provide options that meet the different preferences of our customers. ‘One of the exciting new products is a veggieball which will be launched in our stores from April onwards. ‘The veggie ball does not have any animal content in the ingredients. We will share more information about our new veggieballs nearer the time of the launch.’ Meatballs are one of Sweden’s national dishes and as iconic as Volvo cars or the pop group Abba. Meatballs and Malm beds: Ikea is as famous for its meatballs as its cheap self-assembly furniture and the company sells one billion of its regular meatballs every year . IKEA sells 5million meatballs in the UK annually and estimates it has sold 11.6billion in the UK since 1987. However a spokesman said last night the veggieball will not be available in the UK until May. Food contributed £1 billion to group sales last year. IKEA has 361 stores worldwide which all sell food – its meatball even has its own Facebook page. Meatballs are sold in Ikea’s restaurants for £3.80 and customer can also buy a frozen variety in its Swedish Food Market for £4.35 for 1kg. It has not yet revealed the cost of the veggieball. Ikea was caught up in the international food fraud scandal in 2013 when it emerged there was more than just beef and pork in its meatballs. Tests showed that there was also a significant amount of pony and horse. The business was started by billionaire Ingvar Kamprad, 88, who started selling matches in the 1920s. The IKEA name comes from his initials along with the name of the family farm Elmtaryd which was located in the local village of Agunnaryd. His third store in Stockholm was designed to be round so customers did not cut corners whilst walking around. The flat packed idea came while shipping a table by rail. It had been damaged in transit so the idea to separate the legs was hatched to protect it. Shipping it flat was also cheaper.","IKEA hopes to save the planet with chickpea and kale 'veggie balls'

"Young job seekers are filling in application forms using 'txt spk' - text speak - instead of proper words, prompting one of Britain's biggest companies to hit out at falling standards. Insurance giant Admiral said many youngsters addicted to their mobile phones lose out at the very beginning of looking for work - because they failed to string a normal sentence together. Forms saying: 'U r a gr8 company 2 work 4' and 'Btw am out of work atm' are examples hitting their job chances. Young job seekers fill forms with text speak such as 'U r a gr8 company 2 work 4' and 'Btw am out of work atm' The Cardiff-based insurer with more than 5,000 staff voiced their fears in evidence to the Welsh Assembly's Enterprise and Business Committee that many youngsters failed at the application form stage. An Admiral spokesperson said: 'We do not ask for any formal qualifications, but we expect the spelling and grammar on the application form to be of a certain standard. 'A lot of it is like text-speak, there is no punctuation or upper case. So, that is the first impression that you get.' The committee called on the experience of Admiral, one of the UK's biggest car insurance providers employing more than 5,000 people. Its report concluded too many young people were confused about how to grab hold of job opportunities. It also said youngsters are leaving school without English and Maths skills - and that their inability to manage money led to many of them overestimating the costs involved in taking a job. William Graham (left), Conservative Welsh Assembley member, said young people were facing a number of factors as they enter the workforce.  Cardiff-based car insurer admiral (left) employs over 5,000 people . Monmouthshire Youth service, which also offered its findings, said able students were leaving education with very little idea of how to construct a CV or how to deal with potential employers, WalesOnline reported. The committee’s final report concluded too many school and college leavers were confused about finding and then applying for appropriate jobs on offer. The drift from personal, face to face careers advice to online-based information was also a barrier for some young job seekers the Welsh Assembly committee noted. The report concluded too many young people were confused about how to grab hold of job opportunities . The body also found after consulting with local councils, charities, employers and training providers that academic study was often misdirected given the employment opportunities on offer. In 2014 just 0.3 percent of school leavers in Cardiff went on to vocational training as opposed to 87 percent going on to further education. Where young people were leaving school without essential numeracy and literacy skills, this was leading to a lack of confidence after education, the committee found. William Graham, Conservative AM for South Wales East, said: 'There are a number of factors that young people face as they try to enter the workforce, such as a lack of confidence, lack of qualifications and lack of experience.'

"Sixteen and seventeen year olds should not be allowed to vote in a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union because they have been brainwashed with pro-EU colouring-in books, Ukip has said. The party said schoolchildren were being exposed to ‘propaganda’ from Brussels in a bid to ‘catch them young’. It came as Ukip was accused of performing yet another U-turn on its immigration policy . Ukip campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn accused Brussels of feeding 'propaganda' to young people who could not be trusted to vote in a referendum . David Cameron has promised to claw back powers from Brussels before holding an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. Ukip has called for the vote to be held earlier, and today warned under-18s should not be allowed a say. Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans said: ‘It's everything there from colouring-in books on the Common Agricultural Policy for primary school children right up to research projects at university level. ‘The amount of money that the EU is putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous. Overall the EU has an advertising budget that is larger than Coca-Cola.’ Asked if schoolchildren were being brainwashed, the party’s campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn said: ‘I think it's not a million miles away. ‘It's certainly designed to catch people young and feed them propaganda and a very partial view which you know just speaks up to the EU being an unalloyed good thing that we couldn't possibly do without.’ Pushed further, he added: ‘It is an emotive term but I wouldn't demur from the description of brainwashing. ‘We’ve had many reports from our members of schoolchildren of secondary school age being exposed to overwhelmingly pro-EU views when the matter of the European Union is discussed and not really having the Eurosceptic case put.’ Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans said the amount of money that the EU is 'putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous' Mr O’Flynn said the party was ‘strongly against’ lowering the voting age as under-18s are ‘too young/ to vote. He accused the Lib Dems of trying to ‘gerrymander’ a future in-out referendum after speculation they would demand 16 and 17-year-olds and EU migrants are given a vote as part of a possible post-election Coalition deal. He argued the fairest way of holding a referendum would be to stick to the rules of a general election and said any changes could skew the vote. ‘Let's be frank about it, opinion research shows that 16 and 17-year-olds are much more likely to be in support of Britain's membership of the European Union than is the population in general,’ he said. ‘And the electoral franchise does not allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote and it's no wonder the Liberal Democrats wish to make this change but it's a gerrymandering change which is clearly intended to skew the result.’ Critics of EU waste have previously condemned a colouring and activity book produced by Brussels which promoted the work of bureaucrats and MEPS . At an EU summit in 2013 David Cameron held aloft the book promoting the wastefulness of MEPs . Ukip was today accused of performing yet another U-turn on its immigration policy after it ruled out setting a net migration target hours after Nigel Farage said he would like to see the figure reduced to 30,000. The party leader on Tuesday said cutting annual net migration from 300,000 to 30,000 by 2018 would be a ‘return to normality’. But this morning party deputy chairman Suzanne Evans, who is writing the party’s manifesto, said: ‘There are no migration targets.’ ‘I can tell you that there won’t be any mention of 50,000 or 30,000 in the manifesto and that’s official party policy,’ she added. The party previously promised to cap numbers at 50,000 before Mr Farage earlier this month disowned the cap and said he would not set ‘arbitrary’ targets. Mr O'Flynn called on David Cameron to ‘come clean’ on any discussions he has had with the Lib Dems about the referendum and then guarantee he will not meet any of the party's demands. He said: ‘We would like him to guarantee that none of these demands will be met, that Mr Clegg will not have a hand in the question, the timing, and that there is no question whatsoever of the franchise being changed from the general election franchise. ‘Because in the case of 16 and 17-year-olds they are far more likely to have been exposed recently to very strident pro-EU views and not to have heard the Eurosceptic case at all. ‘And in the case of EU migrants, there is obviously a vested interest potentially in how they will vote. ‘We see this as an attempt by the Liberal Democrats to gerrymander the outcome but we are also worried that David Cameron has a habit of letting the Liberal Democrats take the rap for certain un-Conservative things he might be planning to do.’ In 2013 the European Union unveiled a children's play book that told how it takes four Eurocrats to send a letter and depicted them travelling around town in taxpayer-funded limousines. The 10-page book 'Mr and Mrs MEP and their helpers' was an apparently serious attempt to shed light on the lives of elected officials in Strasbourg, and 15,000 were printed. On page 1, the couple's work day begins at 8am as they arrive at the airport, briefcases in hand, to find their driver 'waiting for them in a limousine'. Safely chauffeured to the office, Mr MEP wants to send a letter to a colleague but does not have an envelope. The book explains - in four European languages with reading, games and colouring in exercises - how this problem is resolved with the help of three other people.","Ukip said schoolchildren brainwashed with pro-EU colouring-in books .

"A young Indonesian man has cheated death after stowing himself away in the wheel housing of a jet which flew for an hour in freezing temperatures. Mario Ambarita, 21, took chances with his life when he clambered into the wheel housing of the Garuda Indonesia flight which took off from the main island of Sumatra and flew at 34,000ft to Jakarta. The desperate reason for his actions was simply that he was ‘looking for work’. Mario Ambarita, pictured, clambered into the wheel housing of the Garuda Indonesia flight which took off from the main island of Sumatra and flew at 34,000ft to Jakarta . He had climbed into the wheel housing when the aircraft stopped at the end of the runway in Pekan Baru, Sumatra, during a scheduled touch down to pick up passengers. The Indonesian news organisation, Kompas, reported that Mr Ambarita was in a dazed state when he crawled out of the wheel housing at Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta airport. Ground staff stared in amazement as the young man started staggering away from the aircraft before he was grabbed by security officials. His immediate whereabouts were unknown this morning. His mother, Tiar Sitanggan, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that she had ‘no idea’ her son was planning to go to Jakarta. The 21-year-old climbed into the wheel housing when Garuda Indonesia plane stopped at the end of the runway in Pekan Baru, Sumatra, during a scheduled touch down to pick up passengers (file picture) She said he had left home in the town of Bagan Batu to look for work in Pekan Baru, which is also on Sumatra island. ‘He left last month and I hadn’t heard from him since,’ she said. She only found about his exploits when she saw him on MetroTV news. Mr Pesman Pujabroto, a spokesman for Garuda, said Mr Ambarita ‘knew the plane would stop’ after it taxied to the end of the runway at Pekan Baru. It was then that he seized the opportunity to smuggle himself into the wheel housing. The air temperature was well below freezing and experts said the stowaway had only managed to survive because of the relatively short flight. An airline spokesman said Mr Ambarita was suffering from the effects of the cold and lack of oxygen when he stumbled out of the wheel well. Mr Ambarita was in a dazed state when he crawled out of the wheel housing at Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta airport (shown in this file picture) ‘He looked lacking of oxygen,’ said the airline’s communication secretary, Pujobroto ,who like many Indonesians uses only one name. ‘His fingers turned blue and his left ear was bleeding.’ Garuda’s ground crew immediately helped him to the airport’s clinic where last night he was received treatment. It was expected he would be transferred to a hospital later. Mr Pujobroto said the maximum cruising altitude of that particular flight was 34,000ft, far above the 16,000ft threshold where the air temperature drops to freezing. The young man’s relatives said that since a child he had dreamed of visiting Jakarta. It was learned that for the past 10 days he had kept the Pekan Baru airport under watch after learning how to sneak into a plane's wheel housing from the Internet. He had also worked out how to reach the aircraft by clambering over a security fence.","Mario Ambarita climbed on to passenger jet flying from island of Sumatra .

"A giant hammerhead shark swims in the shallows off Destin, Florida, chasing after its next meal while two oblivious swimmers bask in the crystal clear water just feet away. 'Get out the water!' cries a man with a group of friends on a penthouse balcony overlooking the beach, and for a long time to no avail, until they finally spot the danger as the shark's chase leads it too close to them for comfort. While the likelihood that serious injury would have been very unlikely should the shark have turned its attentions to them, the swimmers weren't willing to stick around to confirm it. Two swimmers stand oblivious to a hammerhead shark as it hunts a fish in the shallows off Florida . The swimmers were shouted at to get out of the water by a group of men standing on a penthouse balcony . Hammerheads are largely harmless to humans, but the swimmers were willing to stick around to prove it . 'Yeah, now run,' said one of the group of men watching and filming the shark as it displayed the full range of its agility in pursuit of the fish, perhaps a small stingray, one of the species' favourite foods. 'I think they finally figured it out,' said another of the residents at the Silver Beach Towers. 'That is a massive shark, and it came all the way up to knee level.' Destin is a resort town in Okaloosa County, Florida, on the peninsula that separates the Gulf of Mexico from Choctawhatchee Bay. While their hearts may have been racing once they were safely on the beach, the Florida Museum of Natural History's International Shark Attack File lists 17 unprovoked attacks on humans by hammerheads, with none of them fatal. 'Yeah, now run,' said one of the group of men watching as the hammerhead ramped up its chase of the fish . The swimmers are surely relieved once on shore, although serious injury was highly unlikely . Only three of the 11 known species of hammerhead are believed to be hostile to humans, the scalloped, great, and smooth hammerheads. It's a different story with great white, tiger or bull sharks, which are considered the ""Big Three"" when it comes to shark attacks claiming the majority of fatalities for swimmers and surfers.","A video captured a hammerhead shark in the shallows off Destin, Florida .

She had then admitted that the course she had actually paid the equivalent of £3,000, which was probably a fairer reflection of the value of her new assets. A local court ruled in favour of Dr Valcu, accepted that the comments could be regarded as defamatory and ordered her to pay compensation. As well as paying Dr Valcu £1,500, Ms Trasca he will also have to take adverts in the main Romanian newspapers pointing out that her statement was not correct.

Despite a 35-year fight to get the trees cut down to size, the council has ruled they can stay. It is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of Mrs Alexander’s family. It kicked off 35 years ago when Mrs Alexander’s aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii. A row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge (pictured) has finally come to and end after 35 years . The battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour's massive hedge . Then, 23 years ago, single mother Mrs Alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour Jeanette Robinson to trim the hedge. She claims Mrs Robinson refused and declared: ‘I would rather move than touch these trees.’ The dispute rumbled on, with Mrs Alexander, 54, claiming that the trees knocked £20,000 off the value of her property. She sensed an opportunity, however, with the passing of the High Hedge Act in Scotland in 2013 which allows local authorities to take action in such cases. Stirling Council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay, despite claims it has knocked £20,000 off the value of neighbour Audrey Alexander's house (pictured) The situation came to a head in 2008, when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour's garden shed . Audrey Alexander (pictured) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches . But her council has ruled that Mrs Robinson can keep the hedge, although it has to be cut to 20ft. Mrs Alexander said the ruling made ‘no difference’. The High Hedge Act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden. Complainants and the hedge's owner are encouraged to resolve the issue between themselves and councils should only be called in to help as a last resort. Because the effect the hedge has is not always clear, disputes can last for years before an agreement can be reached. The local authority can either issue a high hedge notice, which orders owners to cut the hedge back, or decide not to act. The local authority cannot make any orders about the roots of the hedge. She added: ‘The whole situation is appalling – the legislation is about giving people the right to sunlight. ‘It’s a disgrace and I feel extremely let down.’ The neighbour refused to comment. Mrs Alexander’s only option is the courts which she cannot afford to do. Over the years she had used the mediation services of Stirling District Council to try to resolve the issue. The situation came to a head in 2008, when she claims a 65ft section of hedge fell, demolishing a neighbour’s garden shed. Following the introduction of the High Hedge Act, Stirling Council found in her favour but the neighbour appealed and won the 20ft ruling. Dr Colin Watson, of Scothedge, a group which demands the end of ‘high hedge tyranny’, said that the council’s decision was ‘pretty crazy’. A council spokesman said the decision was made ‘after carrying out a site inspection and considering all the evidence’. Mrs Alexander said her aunt, now 87, had moved to France to enjoy ‘sunshine and gardening’. Ms Alexander called in Stirling District Council to try to solve the quarrel, but no solution could be found and the feud continued . The council ruled that the hedge should be cut to about 20ft, a height which Ms Alexander claims will still block most of her sunlight .","Audrey Alexander wanted her neighbours to chop down their huge hedge .

"A woman suffers from a rare medical condition that leaves her unable to recognise her own face in the mirror. Natalie Whitear, 35, struggles to pick her husband and children out of a crowd - and walks past lifelong friends in the street. The mother-of-two suffers from prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, which means she is able to recognise objects, but not faces. The condition is so severe that Mrs Whitear can't spot her own reflection  or her children when picking them up from school. Natalie Whitear, 35, cannot recognise herself in the mirror as she suffers from prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness . The condition is so severe that Mrs Whitear can't recognise her husband Garrick, 39, or children Mia, eight (left) and Eva, three (right) Although she was born with the condition, she was only formally diagnosed around three years ago. Mrs Whitear, from Fareham, Hampshire, said: 'If you asked me to explain what someone looked like I wouldn't be able to do it. 'I tend to smile at everyone just in case I bump into someone I should recognise. 'I can describe the weight, height, and hair colour of my husband and children, but not their facial features in detail - I remember when my daughter was born I'd try to memorise her features but it was impossible. 'I love to paint but I've never been able to draw my husband's face, I always leave it blank. She continued: 'I was once in a restaurant and for the entire meal I thought the place was twice the size - it was only when I stood up that I realised I'd been sitting in front of a mirror - I had no idea because I didn't realise that all the faces were the same. 'I recognise people by the way that they walk, what they're wearing, or their voices.' Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people's faces. Also known as 'face-blindness', the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers. Some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face, while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, and in more severe cases sufferers cannot distinguish a face as being different from an object. Some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces. The condition is not related to memory loss, impaired vision or learning disabilities. It is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus - a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory. Prosopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases. In some cases the condition is congenital, and present at birth. It appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion. Some degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and Asperger's Syndrome. Treatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies, including relying on voice recognition, clothing, or unique physical attributes. Source: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke . Mrs Whitear, mother to daughters Mia, eight, and Eva, three, first became aware of her condition when her boss noticed she was unable to remember people she'd met before. She said: 'About two or three years ago my boss took me to one side and told me I needed to be more careful with remembering people's names. 'He said that he'd seen me introduce myself to people I'd known for years, and asking who they were. 'I explained to him that I could remember their names, but not their faces - it was only because of his shocked reaction that I suddenly realised that this was not normal. 'I found a test on the internet that asked you to recognise celebrities' faces and I failed. 'I was then contacted by a psychologist at Bournemouth University who diagnosed me with prosopagnosia, and suddenly everything made sense.' Looking back, Mrs Whitear realises that the condition has affected her throughout her life. She said: 'When I look back, there have always been signs of the condition but I never even realised. 'I never had posters of famous people on my bedroom wall because I didn't know what they looked like. 'People would say that they'd stood next to me at a queue in the supermarket but I'd ignored them, or I'd walked past friends in the street. 'I've also always been a nightmare when it comes to watching TV - we watch a lot of box sets but I will get continuously lost and ask over and over who each of the characters is. 'It's even worse on a period drama where they are all wearing similar clothes.' Mrs Whitear uses various coping mechanisms to ensure that her face blindness does not affect her daily life. She said: 'I recognise people by what they're wearing, how they style their hair, or the way they walk. 'The people close to me all look very distinctive - it must have been a subconscious choice. 'My husband is 6ft 4in tall, one of my best friends is Chinese and the other has very long hair, so they're easy to pick out in a crowd. Mrs Whitear can describe the weight, height, and hair colour of her husband and children, but not their facial features . Once Mrs Whitear's eldest daughter Mia (left) wore her hair pigtails so she didn't recognise her. Another time she did not recognise her daughters when picking them up from school . 'But if someone is wearing something different, or out of context, I won't be able to spot them. 'My eldest daughter almost always wears her hair in one long plait, but one morning my mother had dropped her off to school and put her in pigtails - when I came to collect her in the afternoon I didn't know which child she was. 'When Mia was younger she had a full head of brown curly hair, as did one of her friends, so when they were toddlers it was very easy to get them mixed up. 'While I can't describe what my family look like, I know the way that they make me feel. 'When I met my husband, I wasn't attracted to the way he looks, because I didn't know, but I was attracted to the way I felt when I was with him. Mrs Whitear said: 'While I can't describe what my family look like, I know the way that they make me feel' 'If we go to the cinema together and I go off to the toilet or to get a drink halfway through the film, when I come back into the screening, I'll always count the seats back to him, rather than look for his face.' In an attempt to remember faces, Mrs Whitear uses Facebook, and takes lots of pictures of family and friends. She said: 'I use my friends list as a personal database of all of the people I know, in the hope that I can recognise them when I see them in person. 'I take as many pictures as possible to try and remember my children's expressions. 'I know that the condition is unusual, but I use these various coping mechanisms and I never let it bother me - I've never known any different.' Dr Sarah Bate, from the Centre for Face Processing Disorders at Bournemouth University, has carried out research into prosopagnosia. She said: 'It  is a cognitive condition characterised by an impairment in face recognition. 'Very rarely some people acquire the condition following neurological trauma, but we've recently become aware that many more people have a developmental form of prosopagnosia. 'These people have never suffered any neurological damage, and appear to have simply failed to develop the visual mechanisms that are required for face processing. 'Sometimes the condition appears to run in families, and often people report other first-degree relatives who also appear to be poor with faces. 'Recent estimates suggest as many as two per cent of the population (that's one in 50 people) have a degree of face blindness, yet public awareness of the condition remains low.'","Natalie Whitear, 35, suffers from prosopagnosia: facial blindness .

"After Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus announced that it will no longer have elephants in the show starting in 2018, the organization gave a rare tour of the facility where the elephants will retire. Once the animals are done in the ring, they'll be taken to the Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida. Some of the Asian Elephants will live out their post-performance lives in the center, while other will be used for breeding. Scroll down for video . All elephants will be phased out of the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus performance by 2018 . Once they retire from performing, elephants will be taken to the Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida . Ringling spokeswoman Melinda Hartline told FOX Tampa Bay that the center is 'all about preserving the Asian Elephant'. Elephants born in the center can be sold to zoos or other breeding programs. This will hopefully increase genetic diversity in the species and increase its population. The population of animal has decreased to between 25,000 and 32,000 from it's 100,000 population over the last century. Poaching and habitat destruction are among the reasons for the decline. Twenty people work at the center to feed, care for and manage the animals, and over the next three years Ringling will determine if more staff or additional facilities are needed. Despite having what seems to be ideal living conditions, Ringling ties some elephants by the leg overnight, something animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) are disappointed by. Some elephants will live out the rest of their lives in the conservation center, while others will be use for breeding . A spokesman for the center said that the organization's goal is to conserve the Asian Elephant, an animal who has seen massive population decline over the last century . Much of the population decline - which has gone down from 100,000 to between 25,000 and 32,000 - has been caused by poaching and habitat destruction . 'Zoos don't chain elephants and the American Veterinary Medical Association advises against it' Delciana Windners, PETA general counsel, told FOX. The animal-rights organizations also urge the company to take the animals off the road sooner. Just days before announcing that the elephants would be taken out of the ring, PETA prevailed in an open-records request and obtained documents proving that, at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis. TB is highly transmissible from elephants to humans, even without direct contact. A statement from PETA frames Ringling’s announcement as a preemptive move to keep the public in the dark about the health risk posed by moving sick elephants to cities throughout the country. 'These elephants suffer greatly, but now their retirement is vital to everyone’s safety,' the statement read. Animal rights groups, including PETA, have said that Ringling Brothers should take elephants out of their shows before 2018 . PETA released information earlier this year stating that at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis .","Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus announced that it will no longer have elephants in the show starting in 2018 .

"The CEO of Salesforce.com has announced the company is now attempting to transfer any Indiana employee who is 'uncomfortable' with the polarizing new Religious Freedom Restoration Act out of the state. The law, brought in by Indiana Governor Mike Pence, was supposed to satisfy evangelicals but has sparked boycotts of the state, amid fears that it would allow legalized discrimination against lesbians and gays. Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, was one of the first corporate executives to react to the polarizing bill, calling it 'brutal' and 'unjust' and saying he was finding ways to reduce investments in Indiana. He initially canceled all events and suspended employee travel to the state. Speaking out: Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce who was one of the first corporate executives to react to Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, is now trying to relocate state employees who are uncomfortable . However on Wednesday he told CNN Money he was now responding to employee complaints that they no longer want to work and live in the state, and is trying to find ways to help them. It is the most aggressive corporate reaction to the controversial legislation yet. 'I just got an email ... from another employee who said, ''look I don't feel comfortable living in this state anymore, you have to move me out,'' and I gave him a $50,000 relocation package and said, ''great, you're clear to go''.' Benioff was sure to point out that he will not be able to shut down the Salesforce sector in Indiana completely. The San Francisco-based tech company, which offers ‘customer relationship management’ to other companies, has a total 2,000 employees in the state. A number of companies — including Salesforce, EMC and Cloudera — have already withdrawn their sponsorships for Indy Big Data, a tech conference scheduled in May. Change: Benioff tweeted Friday in response to Indiana lawmakers saying Friday morning they had amended the already-in-effect law, clarifying that no one will 'be able to discriminate against anyone at any time' Benioff's announcement follows one made by Apple CEO Tim Cook. On Monday Cook condemned the laws, saying they were 'very dangerous', went against the founding principles of America, and would take the country back to the days of 'Whites Only' signs in shop doorways. He added that, as a Baptist, he supports religious freedom, but said: 'I was never taught, nor do I believe, that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate.' Cook, 54, who came out as gay in October last year, made the comments in an op-ed for the Washington Post. He wrote: 'In total, there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law. 'On behalf of Apple, I'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation. 'These bills under consideration truly will hurt jobs, growth and the economic vibrancy of parts of the country where a 21st-century economy was once welcomed with open arms.' He also addressed legislation in Texas that 'would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.' Taking a stance: Openly-gay Apple CEO Tim Cook criticized new laws that critics say will allow business owners to openly discriminate . Cook said such bills 'rationalize injustice' by 'pretending to defend' religious freedom, which actually eroding the freedoms of others. Cook drew upon his background growing up in the South in the 1960s and 1970s, during and immediately after the Civil Rights movement when blacks were still heavily discriminated against. He says America's 'days of discrimination' must remain 'deep in the past' and said freedom and equality is a value that is at the heart of his company. He added: 'Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love.' Indiana's religious freedom act says that the state and local government 'may not substantially burden a person's right to the exercise of religion' unless that burden is 'essential' to furthering a government interest. It will be up to the courts to decide what counts as 'substantial', but the legislation was largely designed to fend off lawsuits against those who refuse to participate in gay marriage ceremonies. For example a florist who refuses to supply flowers for a same sex ceremony. Supporters say that such provisions already exist in 20 other states, and were actually signed into federal law by Bill Clinton in 1993. But opponents, including Cook, claim these laws form part of a wave of discriminatory powers that threaten to reverse years of progress on equality issue . The Indiana bill forbids the state or local government from 'substantially burdening' a person's religious beliefs unless that burden is 'essential' to further a 'compelling' government interest, and is the 'least restrictive' means of achieving that aim. It allows people or organisations to use the legislation as a defense in court against claims of discrimination against them, and if the court rules in their favor, allows reparations, including compensation payouts. It will be up to the courts and judges to decide what constitutes 'substantial', but critics fear that the broad scope of the law and the tough tests that must be passed to override it, mean that it will allow business owners to openly discriminate in how they operate. Cook is far from the only one opposing the new law in Indiana, with musician Miley Cyrus, and actors Ashton Kutcher, James Van Der Beek and George Takei all speaking out against it. The NBA, WNBA, the Indiana Pacers, and Indiana Fever issued a joint statement Saturday reaffirming their commitment to non-discrimination. Hillary Clinton also messaged to her three million Twitter followers saying that 'we shouldn't discriminate against people because of who they love' following the bill's passing on Thursday. Businesses are also lining up to oppose the legislation, threatening to pull investment or even boycott the state altogether in protest. Fighting back: Demonstrators gathered to protest a controversial religious freedom bill recently signed by Indiana Governor Mike Pence during a rally in Indianapolis on Saturday . Website Angie's List also announced plans to cancel a $40 million expansion to its Indianapolis headquarters because of the new law. 'Angie's List is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents,' the company's CEO Bill Oesterle said in the statement. Thousands gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to rally against the law, waving rainbow coloured flags and chanting slogans such as 'no hate in our state'. Since the law passed, Republican Senator Mike Pence has robustly defended it, saying that it is necessary to help people defend themselves against 'government overreach'. He also ruled out any possibility of repealing the law, which is due to take effect in July, telling This Week with George Stephanopoulos, that 'the law will stick.'

"A young mother will spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair after catching a serious infection from using her best friend's make up brush on a pimple. Jo Gilchrist, 27, was left writhing in pain on Valentine's Day when a staph infection invaded her body and eventually attacked her spine. She has been in Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital ever since and doctors are still desperately trying to rid her body of the bacteria. Jo Gilchrist, 27, will spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair caring for son Tommy after catching a serious infection from using her best friend's make up brush . 'It started as a little ache in my back and I thought it was my bad posture, but it kept getting worse and worse,' Ms Gilchrist told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was in incredible pain and nothing would work. I honestly thought I was going to die - the pain was worse than childbirth.' The mother of one says it took doctors a long time to work out what was wrong and her body started to go numb and she lost feeling in her legs. 'They said (the numbness) would go all the way up my arms and into my chest and when that happened I'd have to be put in an induced coma and learn to breathe again,' she said. Ms Gilchrist was airlifted from her country hometown of Warwick to Brisbane where she underwent emergency surgery. The 27-year-old mother of one was left writhing in pain on Valentine's Day when a staph infection invaded her body and eventually attacked her spine . When she woke she learned she had contracted community-associated MRSA - an antibiotic-resistant form of golden staph. 'The only thing we can put it down to is the make up brush,' Ms Gilchrist said. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (commonly known as staph) are common bacteria. Staph are usually harmless and many healthy people carry these bacteria on their skin or in their nose. However, sometimes it can cause skin and other more serious infections. It can spread from person to person via direct contact, hands, towels and personal grooming items. MRSA can get into the body through broken skin or sores, resulting in redness, pimples, swelling, tenderness or boils. 'My friend did have a staph infection on her face and I was using her brush just before. I had no idea that could even happen, I used to share with my friends all the time. 'My best friend feels horrible, but it's not her fault at all. I just had a low immune system and it was the perfect breeding ground for the bacteria.' Ms Gilchrist was told the infection had damaged her spine so severely she would never walk again and would be confined to a wheelchair. 'They told me at my bedside that I'd never walk again and I just felt numb and I had tears rolling down my cheeks,' she said. 'But I'm fighting this with all I've got and I'm starting to learn to walk again. Two weeks ago they said I might be able to walk for an hour or two a day – like grocery shopping, washing up and hanging the washing out. 'I'm happy with that. I honestly didn't even expect that.' Ms Gilchrist has lost all feeling below her belly button and will never have control over her bowel or bladder. She has been in Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital ever since and doctors are still desperately trying to rid her body of the bacteria . Ms Gilchrist was told the infection had damaged her spine so severely she would never walk again and would be confined to a wheelchair . Doctors are still administering high strength antibiotics to rid her body of the infection and she will spend another three months in hospital before she is cleared to return home. 'I was so lucky it went to my spine... if it went to my brain I would have died and if it went to my limbs they would have been amputated,' she said. 'I feel like I have a second chance at life. Everything happens for a reason, I've definitely got my fight back for life.' She is now being taught how to adapt to life in a wheelchair so she can live independently and care for her two-year-old son Tommy. Doctors are still administering high strength antibiotics to rid her body of the infection and she will spend another three months in hospital before she is cleared to return home to Tommy . 'It's hard for him because he doesn't understand. He is living with my family at the moment, which is two hours away, but he loves coming to visit,' she said. As she focuses on her long recovery, Ms Gilchrist's friends have also been busy with their own project. They have bombarded her favourite musician Seth Sentry with requests to visit her in hospital and even started the hashtag #jolovessethsentry to catch his attention. 'They literally blew up his social media and it worked. He sent a message saying he really felt for my situation but he couldn't visit right away because he's on tour. I'm still holding out hope though.'","Jo Gilchrist left writhing in pain when staph infection attacked her spine .

"A man vying to become the next Kentucky governor has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after a late local celebrity who bid five times for the title but never won enough votes. The 68-year-old Pulaski County resident, who was known as Terrill Wayne Newman until Tuesday, told the Lexington Herald-Leader he doesn't expect to be elected but hopes the gesture will 'warm Galbraith's grave.' His predecessor, who died in 2012 from chronic emphysema, gained a following for his wit, sharp dress sense and support of legalizing marijuana. Terrill Wayne Newman (right), who is vying to become Governor of Kentucky, has legally changed his name to Gatewood Galbraith after the late local celebrity (left) who bid five times for the title but never won . The newly-christened Galbraith filed paperwork on Wednesday to run as an independent for the state's highest office. The Secretary of State's office says independent candidates must obtain 5,000 signatures from registered voters by August 11 to get their names on the general election ballot. Galbraith said he'll run on a similar platform, but will focus on his namesake. 'I mostly will be talking about the great Gatewood Galbraith,' he said. Galbraith says he and the late Galbraith were 'not friends per se,' but they shared mutual friends and knew each other on a first-name basis. Dea Riley, who was the original Galbraith's running mate in 2011, said she thinks he would find the whole name change amusing. 'I can hear him now: ""I'll tell the IRS to send him the tax bill,""' Riley said. But she also said the new Galbraith 'has very big shoes to fill' with his name and she hopes he will honor it. 'To have Gatewood's name and message prostituted, for the sake to garner political office, is a personal affront to me in that I was not only his running mate but equally his friend and confidant,' Riley said.","Terrill Wayne Newman is vying to become the next Kentucky governor .

"The owner of the Mystic Pizza restaurant made famous in a 1988 movie has pleaded guilty to federal tax charges. The U.S. Attorney's Office says 48-year-old John Zelepos of North Stonington faces up to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty Tuesday to tax evasion and financial structuring offenses. The restaurant owner may also be forced to pay a $500,000 fine. Prosecutors said in a release that between 2006 and 2010, Zelepos diverted just over $567,000 from Mystic Pizza's gross receipts into his personal bank accounts and those of family members. They say he then filed false tax returns to hide the income. Owner: Mystic Pizza owner John Zelepos (seen here in 2008) has pleaded guilty to federal tax charges . On the big screen: The 1988 movie 'Mystic Pizza,' starring (from left to right) Annabeth Gish, Lili Taylor and Julia Roberts, focused on three waitresses working at the pizza restaurant . Prosecutors said he's agreed to paying $234,407 in restitution over the tax returns along with interest and penalties. They also said that Zelepos is going to forfeit funds he put in accounts in an attempt to skip currency transaction reports (CTRs), which come to $522,658. 'Federal law requires all financial institutions to file a CTR for currency transactions that exceed $10,000,' the release said. 'To evade the filing of a CTR, individuals will often structure their currency transactions so that no single transaction exceeds $10,000.' Prosecutors said in the release that Zelepos made deposits 'ranging from $3,000 to $9,998 on sequential days or multiple cash deposits on the same day.' They said Zelepos made deposits under $10,000 on purpose to skip the reports. A slice of heaven: The famed 'Mystic Pizza' opened in 1973. Its owner, John Zelepos, has pleaded guilty to tax evasion and financial structuring offenses . Sensation: Mystic Pizza (seen in 2008) has become a tourist attraction since Julia Roberts starred in the movie about the lives of three waitresses working at the small-town pizza parlor . Zelepos will actually forfeit $459,573.51 since the IRS earlier seized $63,084.49, prosecutors said. 'Our voluntary system of self-reported tax liability depends upon people to honestly report their income and pay their taxes,' U.S. Attorney Deirdre M. Daly said in the release. Daly added 'Those who willfully hide their income and purposefully evade paying their taxes steal from the public and damage our nation’s system of taxation. 'Violators will be prosecuted, punished, and obligated to repay their taxes along with applicable penalties and interest.' The Hartford Courant reported the restaurant was previously required to pay $105,000 to 110 workers for failing to pay them mandatory overtime and paying them under minimum wage. The famed pizza restaurant opened in 1973, according to Mystic Pizza's website. Mystic Pizza became a tourist attraction after Julia Roberts starred in the movie about the lives of three waitresses working at the small-town pizza parlor.

"Three people were killed and eight were injured when a van carrying members of two heavy metal bands careened 300 feet off an interstate and down an embankment in northeast Georgia on Monday. The 15-passenger van was carrying 12 people from South Carolina toward Atlanta when it went off Interstate 85 near the town of Commerce about 7 am Monday, the Georgia State Patrol said. Authorities have confirmed three deaths, according to Georgia State Patrol Captain Mark Perry. A van carrying 12 people from South Carolina for a heavy metal show in Atlanta careened off the road Monday morning, killing three and injuring eight . The driver of the 15-passenger van 'apparently fell asleep and allowed the vehicle to leave the roadway, at which time the vehicle struck a tree on the passenger side, Georgia State Patrol Cpl Scott Smith said . Members of the Atlanta-based band Khaotika and the Huntsville, Alabama-based band Wormreich were in the van. Eight others were injured, the Georgia Department of Public Safety said in a statement late Monday morning. Their conditions weren't available. The van's driver 'apparently fell asleep and allowed the vehicle to leave the roadway, at which time the vehicle struck a tree on the passenger side,' Georgia State Patrol Cpl. Scott Smith told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The occupants of the van, from Atlanta-based band Khaotika and Alabama-based Wormreich, were traveling together and pulling a trailer with the musicians' equipment, Smith told the Atlanta newspaper. The three men who died were ejected from the vehicle, according to Fox5. The van's driver was not injured, Young said, adding that families of those involved were still being notified. Wormreich and Khaotika (pictured together) had been to Chicago, St Louis and Spartanburg, South Carolina on tour . The driver of the van was not injured in the crash 65 miles northeast of Atlanta, where Khaotika and Wormreich were scheduled to play Monday night. Above, unidentified people leave the scene . The conditions of those who survived Monday's crash were not immediately available and families were still being notified . Band members had been travelling to a show in Atlanta Monday night, which has been cancelled. Kult ov Azazel, another metal band scheduled to appear at the show, said, 'The van carrying Wormreich and Khaotika was in a horrible accident this morning. We cannot go into details due to respect to the families of the involved'. The Atlanta show was the last stop on a tour for the metal groups that included Chicago, St Louis and Spartanburg, South Carolina. Wormreich is listed as a Black Metal band with lyrical interests in Satanism on a fan site and Khaotika is listed as a Gothic Metal group interested in the occult. Rick Hayes, husband of Khaotika singer Lariyah Hayes, 27, said on Facebook that 'Lariyah's out of surgery and in recovery, docs said it went well' The crash happened about 65 miles northeast of Atlanta. It caused traffic to back up in the area along the interstate, a key route between Georgia and the Carolinas, said Teri Pope, a spokeswoman with the Georgia Department of Transportation. Lariya Hayes (center) had surgery and was recovering after surviving the crash, according to her husband . The van and trailer traveled 300 feet off of the road before crashing into trees on the side of the highway .","Southern metal bands Khaotika and Wormreich were in 15-person van .

"The Cheyenne Mountain Complex is one of the icons of the Cold War - a self-contained and sufficient town buried under the Rockies meant to be impervious to a Soviet nuclear barrage. It was home to the North American Aerospace Command (NORAD), scanning the skies for Russian missiles and the military command and control center of the United States in the event of World War Three. The high tech base entered popular culture with appearances in the 1983 Cold War thriller War Games and 1994's Stargate - which imagined the complex as a clandestine home for intergalactic travel. Scroll down for video . Secret: The Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado was built for NORAD to direct the American response to a nuclear war with the USSR during the Cold War . Protection: There are 15 three story building inside the military complex and each is buffered by a 25-ton blast door . Small town: The Cheyenne Mountain Complex is home to more than 1,000 personnel and is able to operate as an underground town for months with fresh water and food . It shut down nearly ten years ago as the threat from Russia seemed to subside, but this week the Pentagon announced that Cheyenne Mountain will once again be home to the most advanced tracking and communications equipment in the United States military. The shift to the Cheyenne Mountain base in Colorado is designed to safeguard the command's sensitive sensors and servers from a potential electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, military officers said. The Pentagon last week announced a $700 million contract with Raytheon Corporation to oversee the work for North American Aerospace Command (NORAD) and US Northern Command. Admiral William Gortney, head of NORAD and Northern Command, said that 'because of the very nature of the way that Cheyenne Mountain's built, it's EMP-hardened.' Power: At its height Cheyenne was home to NORAD who watched 7,000 aircraft per day as part of their surveillance operations . Headquarters: The US and Canadian military jointly operated NORAD from within Cheyenne and soldiers from north of the border made up 15 percent of the personnel at the base . Around-the-clock crews monitor U.S. skies from the command center of the Northern Command  located deep within Cheyenne Mountain at the foot of the Rocky Mountains near Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2002 . 'And so, there's a lot of movement to put capability into Cheyenne Mountain and to be able to communicate in there,' Gortney told reporters. 'My primary concern was... are we going to have the space inside the mountain for everybody who wants to move in there, and I'm not at liberty to discuss who's moving in there,' he said. The Cheyenne mountain bunker is a half-acre cavern carved into a mountain in the 1960s that was designed to withstand a Soviet nuclear attack. From inside the massive complex, airmen were poised to send warnings that could trigger the launch of nuclear missiles. But in 2006, officials decided to move the headquarters of NORAD and US Northern Command from Cheyenne to Petersen Air Force base in Colorado Springs. The Cheyenne bunker was designated as an alternative command center if needed. Almost 10 years ago, the military closed the secretive defense complex carved into Cheyenne Mountain that for decades monitored American skies for threats. The North American Aerospace Defense Command operations center was moved to nearby Peterson Air Force Base, which is home to the U.S. Northern Command created after the Sept. 11 attacks. Cheyenne Mountain Complex is 2,000 feet below the granite rocks and made up of 15 three-story buildings protected from nuclear blasts and seismic movement by a system of 1,000 giant springs. The entire complex is designed to withstand a direct hit by a 30 megaton nuclear explosion and has 25-ton blast doors surrounding the complex. NORAD, a joint U.S. and Canadian command, was set up in the 1960s to monitor the skies for threats like missiles, aircraft and space objects. In 2006, Adm. Tim Keating, who commanded both NORAD and the U.S. Northern Command, said the government's best intelligence 'led them to believe a missile attack from China or Russia was very unlikely.' Cold War heroes: The Cheyenne mountain bunker is a half-acre cavern carved into a mountain in the 1960s that was designed to withstand a Soviet nuclear attack . That, along with the emergence of varied terrorist threats such as suicide bombers, 'was why we recommended that we don't need to maintain Cheyenne Mountain in a 24/7 status. We can put it on `warm standby,' said Keating. About 1,100 people work in the mountain, long a symbol of the Cold War. Buildings inside it are mounted on springs to absorb the shock from a nuclear blast, while the entrance is guarded by a vault-like door several feet thick. The complex includes banks of batteries and its own water supply. Excavation on the site began in 1961. Canadian crews stationed at Cheyenne Mountain will also made the move to Peterson, Keating said. Hollywood: Sci-fi movie Stargate (1994) was set inside the Cheyenne Mountain Complex while 1983's War Games also imagine a nuclear standoff operated from inside the nuclear bunker . That move was touted a more efficient use of resources but had followed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of modernization work at Cheyenne carried out after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Now the Pentagon is looking at shifting communications gear to the Cheyenne bunker, officials said. 'A lot of the back office communications is being moved there,' said one defense official. Officials said the military's dependence on computer networks and digital communications makes it much more vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse, which can occur naturally or result from a high-altitude nuclear explosion. Under the 10-year contract, Raytheon is supposed to deliver 'sustainment' services to help the military perform 'accurate, timely and unambiguous warning and attack assessment of air, missile and space threats' at the Cheyenne and Petersen bases. Raytheon's contract also involves unspecified work at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.","Cheyenne Mountain Complex being refurbished by Pengaton .

There are only about 250 Philippine crocodiles left in the wild, making them the most endangered crocodile species in the world. The reptiles were conceived and hatched at the Melbourne Zoo, the first and only Australian zoo to breed them. After the breeding program has been concluded, the crocodiles will be released into the wild, where they could grow to be up to three metres long. Chris Banks, Manager for Zoo Victoria's International Conservation Programs, explained to ABC why the crocodiles are facing extinction. 'What you've got in the Philippines is a large human population, widespread poverty, a government strapped for resources to protect their own species, and civil disturbance in the south - so you can't really go and monitor crocodiles,' he said. After the breeding program has been concluded, the crocodiles will be released into the wild, where they could grow to be up to three metres long . The reptiles were conceived and hatched at the Melbourne Zoo, the first and only Australian zoo to breed the species . Melbourne Zoo Director Kevin Tanner has visited the Philippines and participated in the release to the wild of young crocodiles bred there.

"It has been at the root of division and persecution for centuries, but it seems that the white skin of most modern Europeans did not evolve in Europe at all. Now genetic research has revealed that ancient European populations were dark skinned for far longer than had originally been thought. Rather than lightening as early humans migrated north from Africa  around 40,000 years ago due to lower levels of sunlight, these first Homo sapiens retained their dark skin colour. Scroll down for video . This graphic above shows the influx of genes to Europe that brought lighter skin colour and taller body shapes, according to the new research on ancient human remains conducted by geneticists at Harvard University . Genetic analysis has shown that hunter gatherers living in Spain up to 8,500 years ago still had dark skin. It was not until 7,800 years ago, when the first farmers migrated from the Near East through Turkey that two key genes that provide lighter skin appeared. DNA analysis obtained from ancient human remains has shown that as these farmers bred with the dark skinned hunter gatherers, one of these genes became prevalent in the European population and European's skin colour began to lighten. Around 5,800 years ago the second gene, which makes skin colour lighter still, also began to spread though the European population. The first Europeans looked dramatically different to most of the fair skinned people that live there today. New research suggests Caucasians were a recent addition to the area, arriving on the continent 8,000 years ago . Europeans had dark skin for far longer than previously though. Photographed are two participants in the BBC's Trading Races where members of the British public spent several days dressed with a different skin colour . The research, which was presented at the 84th annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, shows that populations in Europe were still evolving until relatively recently. It also shows that a population of hunter gatherers living on the site of Motala, southern Sweden, had already developed both skin-lightening genes around 7,700 years ago together with a third that gave them blue eyes. Dr Iain Mathieson, a geneticist at Harvard University in Massachusetts who led the work, said: 'Ancient DNA makes it possible to examine populations as they were before, during and after adaptation events, and thus to reveal the tempo and mode of selection. A study of ancient human bones has revealed how Early Europeans had difficulties digesting milk around 5,000 years after the introduction of farming. It took at least that long for their genes to evolve until they were no longer intolerant to lactose, the natural sugar in mammalian milk, scientists suggests. Researchers looked at ancient DNA extracted from 13 individuals buried at archaeological sites in the Great Hungarian Plain - a region known to have been at the crossroads of cultural change in European prehistory. the samples were dated from 5,700 BC to 800 BC, ranging across the Stone, Copper, Bronze and Iron Ages. 'Our findings show progression towards lighter skin pigmentation as hunter and gatherers and non-local farmers intermarried, but surprisingly no presence of increased lactose persistence or tolerance to lactose,' said Professor Ron Pinhasi, from University College Dublin's Earth Institute. 'This means that these ancient Europeans would have had domesticated animals like cows, goats and sheep, but they would not yet have genetically developed a tolerance for drinking large quantities of milk from mammals.' 'We find a surprise in seven Scandinavian hunter-gatherers from the Motala site in southern Sweden who lived around 7,700 years before present. 'While the western hunter-gatherers of central and southern Europe largely have the ancestral allele at the two major European skin pigmentation loci, the closely related Scandinavian hunter-gatherers have both the derived alleles contributing to light skin pigmentation at high frequency.' The study, which is also published on the open access site BioRxiv, compared the genomes obtained from the remains of 83 people found at archaeological sites across Europe along with the genomes of modern Europeans. The researchers found five genes associated with changes in diet, body size and skin pigmentation that underwent natural selection in the past 8,000 years. Studies suggest that Europe was first reshaped during the Neolithic Revolution 8,500 years ago. Farmers at this time travelled north, bringing new technology and language into Europe. Pictured is an early Neolithic 35-40 year old male from, Czech Republic, who was part of the first mass migration to Europe . Two of the genes were associated with producing light skin - SLC24A5 and SLC45A2. They found that the remains of early hunter gatherers who lived in Spain, Luxembourg and Hungary around 8,500 years ago, they lacked these key gene variants. However, in the remains of hunter gatherers that had lived in Motala 7,700 years ago, they carried both variants of SLC24A5 and SLC45A2 that produced lighter skin. They also carried another gene known to produce blue eyes in Europeans. Surprisingly they found a fourth set of genes in the DNA from these people suggests these people may actually have been related to people living in East Asia at the time. Dr Mathieson and his colleagues also found that when the first farmers from the Near East arrived in Europe, they carried with them genes for light skin. At this time the SLC24A5 gene quickly became prevalent in southern and central European populations and then around 5,800 years ago. Previous research has identified a mass migration of Kurgan populations (Yamna culture) which went from the Russian steppes to the centre of Europe 4,500 years ago. Previously, researchers had believed it spread 8,500 years ago, when the first farmers from the Near East, now modern day Turkey, brought it to Europe . These gene is known to account for between 25-40 per cent of the skin tone lightening in Europeans. Around 5,800 years ago the gene variant for SLC45A1 then becomes prevalent, lightening skin colour further. The results contradict the traditional view that lower sunlight levels in Europe would have favoured lighter skin. The study also showed that around around 4,800 years ago a group of herders known as the Yamnaya migrated from the stepps between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, carried with them genes for tallness to northern and central Europe. Professor Chris Stringer, a leading anthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London, said: 'This research adds yet more surprises to the remarkable complexity of population relationships in prehistoric Europe being uncovered through ancient DNA. 'Archaeologists had thought that Europe showed a relatively simple succession from hunter-gatherers in the Mesolithic to early farmers in the Neolithic, with the basic assumption that the arrival of farming significantly altered the biology of those first farmers, after which they gradually developed into the Europeans of today. 'But from ancient DNA it now looks like the first farmers in mainland Europe were still relatively dark-skinned and dark-eyed, and lacked the ability to digest milk properly until only about 4,000 years ago, while contemporary hunter-gatherers in Scandinavia may have been lighter-skinned but with a surprising frequency of a gene found in oriental populations today, suggesting they would have resembled them in hair form and the distinctive morphology of their front teeth. 'Ongoing selection, for poorly understood reasons, seems to have maintained large stature in northern Europe after the arrival of farming, while progressively reducing it in southern Europe, especially Iberia.' Dr Nina Jablonski, a paleoanthropologist at Pennsylvania State University who was not involved in the research, told the journal Science:  'What we thought was a fairly simple picture of the emergence of de-pigmented skin in Europe is an exciting patchwork of selection as populations disperse into northern latitudes. 'This data is fun because it shows how much recent evolution has taken place.'","The original migrants to Europe from Africa arrived 40,000 years ago .

"Nine Britons – four of them children – were seized by Turkish security forces last night as they tried to slip across the border to an Islamic State stronghold in Syria. The jihadists were caught as they made the final leg of their journey. The three men, two women and four children were detained by soldiers at a checkpoint in Ogulpinar. It is believed the youngest of the four children is two and the eldest is 11. Arrested: Nine British nationals, three men, two women and four children, have been arrested trying to enter Syria illegally, and are now in the custody of Turkish officials (file picture) Fleeing to Syria: Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana and Shamina Begum at Gatwick in February . Turkey is a key staging ground for foreign fighters attempting to reach IS-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq. Over the past three months more than a dozen Britons, including three teenage schoolgirls, have made the journey. The arrests came as Scotland Yard revealed counter terrorism officers detained a 19-year-old at Luton Airport on Tuesday as he returned from Istanbul. Yahya Rashid is suspected of acting as an Islamic State smuggler, paying for four men and a woman to join the terrorist group in Syria. He is accused of accompanying the group as they travelled to Morocco and then on to Turkey in November. hey are believed to have slipped across the border into Syria before Rashid flew home. He was remanded in custody by Westminster magistrates yesterday to appear at the Old Bailey accused of preparing to commit an act of terror and assisting others in preparing to commit acts of terror. More than 22,000 foreign fighters are now believed to have joined Islamic State from around 100 countries. Yesterday a senior prosecutor revealed that British headteachers fear children may use the Easter break to try to flee to Syria to join IS. Nazir Afzal said two heads had told him of more than a dozen teenage boys and girls thought to have been ‘groomed and seduced’ by jihadists. Joining the jihad: Around 600 Britons, many of them teenagers or young adults, are believed to have joined ISIS since 2013 (file picture) Police had not been told because the unnamed secondary schools – one in East London and one in West London – did not want them placed under investigation, said Mr Afzal, former chief prosecutor for the North West. Several schoolchildren have already gone to Syria. They include four from Bethnal Green Academy in East London – Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-olds Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Sharmeena Begum – who fled to become jihadi brides after being radicalised online. Last week it was revealed that four girls from the academy had their passports confiscated by judges to prevent them joining IS. Mr Afzal, who spearheaded the prosecutions of Muslim gangs who groomed underage girls in Rochdale, said: ‘[IS] terrorists are deluded, narcissistic, glory-hunting inadequates who call themselves soldiers, but they’re selling themselves with professionally made videos that make them seem glamorous and sexy. ‘Isn’t that what groomers do? They make these kids feel wanted and loved, they tell them they understand them and they distance them from their friends and family.’ n Islamic State militants have infiltrated a Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus and clashed with a Palestinian group in the jihadis’ deepest foray yet into the Syrian capital, according to a human rights group. IS fighters took over large areas of the Yarmouk camp. If they gain full control, they could threaten the heart of President Bashar al-Assad’s power base.","Brits arrested on Turkey-Syria border and are now in custody .

"Lightning, floods and a deluge of hailstones descended on St Louis Tuesday as powerful storms pummeled the mid-United States. Roads around the Missouri city were flooded in the intense downpour, with one town recording more than two inches of rain in half an hour. Several crashes followed the atrocious driving weather, though no injuries were immediately reported.

The storms, accompanied by thunder and lightning, also hit further north, barreling into parts of Indiana and knocking down trees and power lines. The severe weather in Missouri produced reports of more than 3 inches of rainfall near Augusta west of St. Louis, National Weather Service meteorologist Laura Kanofsky said. Areas of flash flooding were commonplace throughout St. Louis County before the band of severe weather crept out of the region before noon Tuesday, she added. KMOV-TV reported that a lightning strike caused a Mississippi River traffic signal on the Eads Bridge linking Missouri and Illinois to malfunction. Crews notified the Coast Guard to inform any barge traffic of the issue. Later in the day, storms in southwestern Indiana toppled trees and downed power lines. Indiana State Police reported that strong winds caused a semitrailer to overturn on Interstate 69 near Evansville. Wind gusts measuring 70 mph were recorded in Spencer. Wet n wild: Flash flooding tore through St Louis county after hours of storms. In some palces, two inches of rain hit in just half an hour . More storms were possible elsewhere in the central U.S. Spring warming and changes in where the jet stream carves a path in the upper atmosphere were combining to increase the chances of severe weather across the Plains on Wednesday and Thursday, the Storm Prediction Center said. Particularly strong storms were possible in Kansas and Oklahoma on Wednesday and across Illinois on Thursday, with large hail, high wind gusts and a few tornadoes possible. Other severe storms could form from Michigan to Texas both days. The various contributors to severe weather — instability, heat, frontal passages — won't time out perfectly Wednesday but still will cause problems, said Greg Carbin, the warning coordination meteorologist at the Norman, Oklahoma-based center.

"When Asma Fahmi took her ill mother to a matinee screening of Les Miserables in Sydney, the last thing she expected was a violent racial attack on her and her family in broad daylight. This 34-year-old has spoken about the horrific attack by three men who pelted hard boiled eggs at them as they walked to their car in the late afternoon last Saturday. 'They were basically throwing missiles at us,' Asma told Daily Mail Australia. Asma Fahmi was walking to her car with her family when they were attacked by three men from a balcony . The 34-year-old was with her sister and ill mother when they had hard boiled eggs pelted at their heads . Her mother suffers from Bells Palsy, among other health ailments and finds it difficult to leave the house due to her condition. 'She is also a full time carer for my grandma who has been in hospital for the past month,' Asma said. 'She's always looking after everyone else and is extremely selfless.' Due to this, Asma and her sister believed that a day out at the theatre was exactly what their mother needed. After a seeing a matinee screening of Les Miserables in Haymarket and having a late Thai lunch, Asma and her family were walking to their car on the corner of Castlereagh and Goulburn street in the CBD when they heard yelling from an apartment overhead. 'There were three men and they were saying, 'You f***ing Pakis, you f***ing Pakis' over and over,' Asma said. She noticed that the men all had British accents and thought they must be British backpackers as the term 'Paki' tends to be used as an insult in the United Kingdom. This was the second time that Asma has been attacked in Sydney in four years . Asma believes that many  victims of racial attack have no faith in the legal system and therefore many incidents go unreported . 'They were so ignorant they couldn't even get their racism correct,' Asma said. 'My sister and I started to cheekily dance to their chanting to show that it doesn't really bother us.' It wasn't until hard boiled eggs began to rain down on their heads that she became seriously concerned. Asma's immediate worry was for her sister's brand new car, however that quickly changed when an egg flew centimetres from her head and she had to dive behind another car. 'They threw something else -it could have been a glass bottle - and it smashed into the car next to us and knocked off the side mirror,' she said. 'We were certain these people were insane.' Asma attempted to take a photo of the men but became too fearful of her safety and jumped in the car. 'This is downtown Sydney in broad daylight and it feels like a war zone,' she said. Asma's mother cried in the car on their way home as she believed she had brought bad luck by leaving the house. This is not the first racially based attack that Asma has experienced in Sydney. In 2012 on her way to work, a man put his leg between hers and forced her to the ground, spitting abuse at her while she lay on the pavement. Asma is pictured here with refugees in Jordan, she also volunteers at the Islamophobia Register Australia . Asma came to Australia  when she was just four-years-old from Syria, and has lived here for most of her life .

Asma walked into the state government building where she worked after the attack, with some of the witnesses even getting into the elevator with her while remaining silent. She came to Australia from Syria with her family when she was just four years old and has resided in Sydney for most of her life. She now volunteers at the Islamophobia Register Australia typing up incident reports and has found that a lot of the victims of racial abuse are women. She said that many of the victims have no faith in the legal system. 'People don't really know what to do an what the next step is,' she said. Although Asma had memorised the apartment the men were in and their general appearance, she has not yet heard back from the police. 'Unfortunately I had to go through a terrible experience but the well-wishers have reminded me there are more good people in the world than bad,' she said.","Asma Fahmi and her family had hard boiled Easter eggs pelted at them .

"Long the domain of web sites and memes, the animated gif may soon be coming to a message near you. A new app makes creating the images simple on a smartphone - and lets you send them using Facebook Messenger. Camoji is one of the first apps to take advantage of Facebook's decision to open up Messenger, revealed at its recent f8 conference in San Francisco. Camoji allows people to add Instagram style filters to their images before sharing them. The GIFs are created in the Camoji app. Once downloaded, users simply tap on the shutter icon to record an animated gif that is up to 2 seconds long. They can then add filters and other effects - similar to Instagram. Camoji lets you record a GIF with unique filters and text and share it to your friends on Messenger, where GIFs animate inline in the conversation. The GIFs are created in the Camoji app. People that have Camoji installed see a Reply button that launches Camoji right from the Messenger conversation so they can quickly record and send a GIF of their own. This type of back and forth is exactly what makes the entire experience beautiful and seamless. 'App discovery is a major challenge for developers,' said Carlos Whitt, Camoji CEO. 'Messenger is opening the door for developers to create innovative new ways for people to connect and express themselves without having to reinvent the social plumbing. 'This is a monumental development.' 'We're excited to have worked with the Messenger team to help people share by easily capturing moments and sharing them seamlessly within Messenger,' said Austin Broyles, Camoji co-founder. 'We feel our integration is truly unique and innovative.' This is the first time the world's biggest social network has opened their Messenger app to seamless integration with third parties, and this level of integration does not exist on other messenger apps. Camoji had previously integrated with iMessage and WhatsApp, but those integrations lacked a way for recipients to easily download Camoji or launch it from a conversation to reply with another GIF. Camoji lets you record a GIF with unique filters and text and share it to your friends on Messenger . Earlier this month Facebook opened up its Messenger service for developers to create apps and for consumers to communicate directly with retailers, in the social media network's latest effort to expand its reach. The firm hopes to transform Facebook's messaging service into one that operates independently of the company's social media network, effectively pitting it against traditional email. It even revealed it will allow smart devices such as doors and home appliances to use the platform. It comes as it faces intensifying competition from Twitter and Google, as well as from fast-growing messaging apps such as Snapchat and WeChat. Facebook unveiled the new features at its annual developer conference in San Francisco, for the first time allowing developers to create apps that function inside the Messenger app, which has more than 600 million users. Forty different apps will be available on Messenger in the coming days, allowing users of the service to send each other sports clips and animations, Facebook said. Users can add text and other effects to their gifs before posting them . Another feature will allow consumers to use Messenger to send a text message to make a restaurant reservation or to receive a notification that a product purchased online has shipped. 'One of the fastest growing and most important members of our family is Messenger,' said Mr Zuckerberg. 'Facebook used to be this single blue app and it did a lot of different things, now Facebook is a family of apps,' he said. 'Moving from being a single service to a family of apps is the biggest shift we've made in our strategy in helping connect people.' The Messenger Platform was also launched, allowing developers to build new services into the app, which is used by 600 million users each month. Mr Zuckerberg said it would give users 'more tools for expression'.","One of first apps to take advantage of Facebook's new open approach .

"Jenna Bush Hager is pregnant with her second child and revealed the news live on this morning's Today show. The 33-year-old and her husband Henry Hager already have a daughter, Mila, who turns two later this month, and the youngster was on-hand to help her mother announce the family's exciting news. During a segment in which 'adventure correspondent' Jenna was discussing what her 'next adventure' for the show would be, she cut away to a clip of herself pointing to her tummy, asking Mila who was in there, before the toddler told the world that it was her 'baby sissy'. Congrats! Jenna Bush Hager revealed that she is expecting her second daughter with husband Henry Hager live on this morning's Today show . Happy family: The Today correspondent, pictured with husband Henry and their daughter Mila, described parenthood as 'the biggest roller coaster ride there is' 'This is the biggest roller coaster ride there is, having children,' Jenna said of her pregnancy. She added about her daughter's reaction to the news: 'She's excited, she's so cute. She keeps saying baby sissy, baby sissy!' Wearing a fitted purple dress which showed just the tiniest hint of a bump, the Today show correspondent confessed that she is already 20 weeks into her pregnancy, revealing that her second daughter is due in August. Jenna admitted in an interview with People that she has known about the pregnancy for some time, revealing that she and Henry broke the news to her parents, former President George Bush, and former First Lady Laura, the day after Christmas. Luckily it has been an incredibly smooth pregnancy for Jenna, who admitted to the publication that her husband has, on occasion, forgotten that she is carrying a child. 'My husband even said, ""I keep forgetting you’re pregnant!""' she joked. 'Baby sissy': The 33-year-old asked her one-year-old daughter Mila to help make the announcement to the world . Special role: Jenna revealed that her daughter Mila was thrilled about the idea of becoming a big sister . Surprise: Jenna's fellow Today show hosts were thrilled about her news, and were quick to congratulate the soon-to-be mother-of-two . Jenna's Today co-hosts were thrilled for the soon-to-be mother-of-two, with fellow mother Savannah Guthrie leaping up from her desk to give her congratulatory hug, before the team presented her with a bunch of flowers and some baby clothes. Jenna and Henry, who married in May 2008, welcomed their first daughter, whose full name is Margaret Laura Hager, on April 13, 2012 - and the TV presenter revealed to People that the couple had actually been expecting a boy. 'We didn't find out with Mila and we were convinced she was a boy, to the point that we painted the nursery a pale blue,' she explained. 'And it was a girl! We were thrilled, but shocked. So with the second, we decided to find out.' And it seems as though Jenna is already preparing for the challenges of parenting two young children at once; after Today show executive producer Don Nash tweeted his congratulations to the star, she replied joking that she needed some parenting tips. 'Congrats to @JennaBushHager and Henry on another baby girl on the way! Double the trouble, double the fun! #trustmeiknow (sic)' Don tweeted, prompting Jenna to reply: '@Studio1ADon thanks!! I need parenting tips. Ha. (sic)' Proud mother: The Today show's official 'adventure correspondent' was incredibly excited to reveal her happy news . The big reveal: Shortly after making the announcement, Jenna was showered with hugs and gifts from the Today show team . Grandparents: Jenna and Henry told her parents, former US President George Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush (pictured), about the pregnancy during the Christmas vacation . Jenna's second pregnancy may mean that she has to put her role as the Today show's official adventure correspondent, a position which has seen her take on all manner of weird and wonderful challenges during the past few months, on hold however. And unfortunately for Jenna's adventure-focused fans, that means the expectant mother won't be able to complete any of the four potential viewer-chosen challenges which she was due to face in the next few weeks. More than 50,000 people voted for what daring feat Jenna would complete next, with an incredibly speedy roller coaster ride and parachuting off a bridge taking the lead. 'Some people will do anything to get out of a roller coaster ride,' Matt Lauer joked after hearing the news. Shortly after appearing on the Today show, Jenna took to her Instagram account to once again express her joy at the family's happy news. Alongside a picture of herself posing with husband Henry and Mila, the doting mother commented: 'Feel so lucky that we're adding another precious, precocious little girl to our family. My heart is full.'","The 33-year-old made the announcement on Monday morning's show .

"Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood ordered an inquiry into claims that a leaked memo shows SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would prefer a Tory General Election victory . Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood last night ordered an inquiry into claims that a leaked memo shows SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon wants David Cameron to win the Election. The investigation came after Ms Sturgeon claimed she was the victim of Whitehall ‘dirty tricks’. The row followed an allegation she told French ambassador Sylvie Bermann she would prefer a Tory General Election victory – partly because Labour leader Ed Miliband is not ‘PM material’. The leaked memo, drafted by a British civil servant, reported Ms Sturgeon had privately told the diplomat ‘she wouldn’t want a formal coalition with Labour; that the SNP would almost certainly have a large number of seats... she’d rather see David Cameron remain as PM’. The Scottish First Minister yesterday branded the report as ‘100 per cent untrue’ and stressed French officials had also denied the account. She added ‘the real issue is how a second-hand and inaccurate account of this meeting came to be written by a UK Government civil servant, then leaked’. However, her opponents claimed the memo showed the SNP secretly thinks a Tory-led Government in London would make it easier to stoke nationalist resentments and increase the likelihood of a future independent Scotland. It came as sources revealed that the SNP leader is planning to ambush Mr Miliband during the next televised debate. Ms Sturgeon has been plotting with Plaid Cymru’s Leanne Wood to portray Mr Miliband as part of the ‘discredited Westminster establishment’ in a joint ‘Kill Mil’ nationalist pincer movement. Senior Labour figures fear Mr Miliband has made a disastrous misjudgment by taking part in the next debate on April 16. The row follows an allegation Sturgeon (left) told French ambassador Sylvie Bermann she wants David Cameron (right) to win – partly because Labour leader Ed Miliband is not ‘PM material’ Sturgeon denied claims that she secretly hoped Cameron would win the election on her Twitter account (above) Neither David Cameron nor Nick Clegg will take part, leaving the Labour leader to fight it out with the nationalists, Ukip’s Nigel Farage and Green Party leader Natalie Bennett. A Labour source said: ‘If the girls gang up on him then Ed will be toast. ‘He doesn’t know how to handle that sort of thing.’ A Tory Party source said: ‘Miliband is heading towards a giant elephant trap.’","Nicola Sturgeon alleged to have made comments to French ambassador .

"The scream factor of rides at a Cornwall fun park are being measured over the Easter holiday period to see if the noise will impact the residents of a new 480-home development nearby. A reading on the 'fright' decibels of the rollercoaster at Flambards theme park in Helston will be recorded as a row develops over a new housing estate that could bring in 1,000 new residents. Ian Cunningham, who has recently taken ownership of the tourist attraction, said he was 'amazed' to discover no-one had realised the homes will be built right alongside his rollercoaster. Noise levels are being tested on the rollercoaster at Flambards in Cornwall over the Easter period . 'There will be music and screams from the roller coaster ... a theme park without noise is not a theme park,' he told a meeting of the Helston town council planning committee. Cunningham is worried people would buy the new houses and then later complain about the noise, leading to potential restrictions being imposed on his business. 'Residential housing close to a go-kart track, which we also have, seems a little short-sighted,' he added. Developer David Martin has applied for outline planning permission for up to 480 houses and access road on a series of fields. The readings from the fun park will go into a report as local planning council considers a 480-house project . Cunningham said when he bought Flambards, he was made aware of the Helston strategic framework, which had earmarked HX2 (the name given by council planners) as the preferred area for residential development in town. This was also agreed by Helston Town Council last year. But he said the framework document makes no mention of Flambards. The 1,000-resident development is proposed for next door to the popular Cornwall theme park . Nick Jackson, the planning agent on behalf of Mr Martin, said the plans were only outlined at this stage and the position of houses on the land could be agreed later. He said noise experts would be monitoring Flambards over the Easter holidays to assess the level of screaming. The committee is awaiting further information from the developers, including an environmental impact report and the noise report, before their next meeting on April 16.Their decision will be passed onto the Cornwall Council, who will have the final say.","A 480-house development is proposed for next to a popular theme park .

"With every new milestone, many may find themselves nostalgically looking back upon their life and career choices. As expected, not everyone will feel satisfied with the decisions they've made  that they have made the right decisions. But this affects women more so than men, a new survey has revealed. A new survey has revealed that women regret their career choices more than men. With 47% compared to only 40% of men . According to specialist travel agency Planet Cruise, women regret their career choices more so than men. Just under half (47 per cent) of women aged over 55 expressed disappointment over their decisions, compared to just 40 per cent of men. More alarming is the fact that nearly half of women (47 per cent) surveyed admitted that they have suffered from a mental illness or negative feelings towards their roles. For men, the figure was even higher, with 52 per cent having suffered from mental issues. Furthermore, one in five over-55s surveyed admitted to feelings of depression due to a missed opportunity at work. Similar ranking figures showed that people had also dealt with isolation, or unsociable and distant feelings as a result. The survey, from specialist travel agency, Planet Cruise, was conducted on people age over 55 and exposed widespread career disappointments among both men and women . More than a quarter surveyed also revealed that they wished that they had thrown caution to the wind and taken more risks in their careers. Specifically, one in ten admitted that they regretted not being more tenacious with pursuing promotions and being more ambitious in general. Women were also more likely to feel like their relationships had held them back in their careers. And 17 per cent of women felt some sort of resentment towards their partners - indicating that they held them responsible for a career regret or missed opportunity. 10% of women surveyed admitted that they regretted not having more children, compared with only 6% men . But only ten per cent of men admitted to feeling the same way. These regrets didn't only stem from people's careers, but sadly extended to personal choices too. More men than women (22 per cent compared to just 11 per cent) wished they hadn't worked so much, and had spent more time with their children. Just ten per cent of females regretted not having more children - indicating that career pressures had limited the amount of time they had available - compared to only six per cent of men. More men than women (15% compared to 10%) regretted not dating more before they settled down. More men regretted not dating more before they settled down - with 15 per cent admitting this, compared to just 10 per cent of women. From 6 April onward, the UK's new pension reforms allow over-55s to have more freedom with their pension. The  survey exposed widespread regrets within that specific age group. A spokesperson for Planet Cruise commented: 'Work can consume our entire lives. As we get older, we reflect upon opportunities in life which may have passed us by. 'Everyone has regrets in life and, in this case, women admit to this more than men.'","Research conducted by Planet Cruise surveyed people aged 55 and over .

"Nasa could afford to send  US astronauts to Mars orbit by 2033 and onto the Red Planet's surface by 2039, a new report has claimed. The Planetary Society analysed the feasibility and cost of a crewed mission to orbit the Martian moon Phobos in 2033, leading up to a crewed landing on the Red Planet in 2039. It concluded that such a plan could indeed fit within NASA's human space exploration budget - but that politics is holding the decision back. Scroll down for video . The Planetary Society says Nasa can afford a crewed mission to orbit the Martian moon Phobos in 2033, leading up to a crewed landing on the Red Planet in 2039 . The Phobos orbital mission would last approximately 30 months, with nine months of travel each way and 12 months in orbit, the panelists said. Crewmembers would be able to study Phobos and Deimos, Mars' other moon, and potentially teleoperate rovers on the Martian surface. The panel said the current plan would use an Orion spacecraft to move crewmembers from Earth into orbit and back down. 'We believe we now have an example of a long-term, cost-constrained, executable humans-to-Mars program,' Scott Hubbard, a professor in the Stanford University Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and a member of The Planetary Society's board of directors, said. 'This workshop was an important step in community-building among the many groups interested in Mars science and exploration.' The Society's CEO (and former TV 'Science Guy') Bill Nye, said: 'Getting humans to Mars is far more complex than getting to Earth's Moon,' said Nye. 'But space exploration brings out the best in us. 'By reaching consensus on the right set of missions, we can send humans to Mars without breaking the bank.' The workshop's 70 attendees discussed the technical feasibility, affordability and benefits of a proposed schedule to get humans into orbit around Mars and eventually onto the planet's surface, using a detailed plan was not created by The Planetary Society, but was proposed in a separate report co-created by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Phobos is the larger and inner of the two natural satellites of Mars, the other being Deimos. Both moons were discovered in 1877. The workshop 'reached a consensus' on a series of key points, including that an orbital mission would be required prior to a crewed mission to the surface of Mars, and an independent cost estimate showed that the program would fit into the NASA budget, assuming the agency 'ends its lead role in the International Space Station.' The 2033 orbital mission was identified as the crucial first step of the plan, comparing it to NASA's Apollo 8 mission, which took astronauts into orbit around the moon before humans landed on the satellite's surface. The Phobos orbital mission would last approximately 30 months, with nine months of travel each way and 12 months in orbit, the panelists said. Crewmembers would be able to study Phobos and Deimos, Mars' other moon, and potentially teleoperate rovers on the Martian surface. The panel said the current plan would use an Orion spacecraft to move crewmembers from Earth into orbit and back down. 'While the conditions for another Apollo-era Kennedy moment don't exist, we have a highly skilled scientific engineering and policy community that is eager to get going on sending humans to Mars,' said Dr. John Logsdon, workshop co-chair and professor emeritus, Space Policy Institute, Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University. 'We believe the consensus points achieved during this workshop can get us moving down the path to the Red Planet.' The 'Humans Orbiting Mars' workshop took place in Washington, D.C. Various forms of propulsion have been touted for a mission to Mars, including chemical, ion (electric) and nuclear. But while nuclear is often said to be the 'holy grail', the team found it did not noticeably shorten the mission over other versions. Shown is an illustration of a concept Mars Transfer Vehicle . Logsdon said he thinks a decision on whether to adopt the plan is 'an issue for the next president.' Hubbard said that, in the past, Mars missions may have been limited by technological or scientific challenges, but that no longer appears to be the case. 'In the past, when the question of humans to Mars came up, I would typically cite a number of major hurdles: biomedical, launch systems and so forth,' he said. 'And as of today, I think that those risks have either been reduced or you know how to minimize them, and so I am at the same place that John [Logsdon] and Bill [Nye] [are], that I think the issue now is […] political will.' Shown is a graph of the different types of propulsion for a mission to Mars, how much they would weigh and their travel time. CECE is a type of chemical propulsion, Nerva is nuclear propulsion, RIT-XT is ion (electric) propulsion and PEMT is Pure Electro-Magnetic Thrust . Owing to the orbits of Earth and Mars there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place. Our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles (54.6 million km), but can be as distant as 250 million miles (400 million km). For this reason spacecraft to Mars, such as the Curiosity rover, have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned. The next window is open from January 2016 to April 2016, and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet. For a future manned mission, they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in one, which will take two years in total. Just getting there will take up to nine months. The astronauts will be there waiting for a year until they can come back - a total of around three years.","Planetary Society analysed the feasibility and cost of missions .

"State Education Minister Adrian Piccoli has called the Scot's College university shortcut 'unfair,' after it was released that school students could buy their way into university without completing their HSC. Tuition, sporting and curricula fees for Scot's College, one of Sydney's most prestigious schools, reportedly top $30,000 . The University of Sydney have been running a 17-week diploma for Year 11 students at Scot's College to skip their year 12 exams and 'buy' their entry into the sandstone university. 'Access to university should be fair and equitable,' Mr Piccoli told Fairfax Media. 'Any scheme that gives some students an unfair advantage is unacceptable and I will be discussing this with the federal government, which is responsible for universities.' Eight Scot's students gained 'direct entry' to the university after completing the program in 2014, according to a letter sent to parents by principal Dr Ian Lambert, while 166 students completed the HSC. The program was devised by the university's commercial arm, Sydney Learning, and students who completed the course successfully were guaranteed places in a number of undergraduate level courses, including bachelor degrees in health sciences, liberal arts and science, animal and veterinary bioscience, visual arts, music and oral health, or in a diploma of law. Opposition leader Luke Foley is concerned over how this alternative would impact the HSC. 'We have a federal Coalition government intent on linking university admission to wealth, more and more, and these are the sorts of arrangements that flow from the Abbott government's reform of our higher education sector,' he said. The Sydney Morning Herald have reported that concern within the University of Sydney staff has led to its academic board shutting down this alternative pathway for school students. Sandstone halls: The University of Sydney's commercial arm, Sydney Learning, has run the pilot program with Scot's College. Pictured above is the university's clocktower and the eastern range of its main building precinct . However, at the time it was shutdown, the board was unaware that Scot's College were planning the pilot with another 11 boys this year. My Foley is worried that this pathway will be picked up by other universities and elite high schools. Scot's College does not advertise their fees for tuition, sport and other curriculum activities, but in 2013 they were reported to be $30,900 per year with an extra $24,121 for boarders. Scot's College: Dr Lambert, the college's chief, was quoted telling the Sydney Morning Herald that the diploma was designed with students 'in the middle rank of learners' in mind . Rose Steele, the president of the National Union of Students, told Daily Mail Australia that while it was important there were alternative pathways available for students to gain entry to university, it was 'really concerning' if this program was only open to students who could afford it. 'NUS really believes education should be open to all and not just those who can afford it,' Ms Steele said. Daily Mail Australia approached the University of Sydney and Scot's College for comment on Monday morning. Principal Ian Lambert has rejected the notion that it was an exclusive deal for Scot's College. He agrees that the current HSC grading system works for the top 20 percent of students, but not for middle-ranking students. Do you know more?

"David Bowie, who performed an alien in the cult classic film The Man Who Fell To Earth, has composed music for a new stage version in New York. The British musician long known for his experimentalism has written new songs and arranged older music for the production late this year at the New York Theatre Workshop. Based on the novel by Walter Tevis, the 1976 film starred Bowie as a humanoid who lands on Earth in search of water for his parched planet and becomes enamored with alcohol and television. Flashback: David Bowie is returning to The Man Who Fell To Earth by penning a new stage version and original songs for a production on New York's Broadway later this year. The 1976 cult film marked his debut in movies . Cult classic: Bowie played an alien who was in search of water on Earth but fell in love with television . Bowie, 68, is not expected to perform in the production, titled Lazarus, which he has written with award-winning playwright Enda Walsh, who wrote the hit Broadway musical Once. According to sources connected to the adaptation, it has been in the works for years. The show will be spearheaded by Dutch Ivo van Hove, who used Bowie's music in one of his own productions last year. But the production team has cryptically refused to define it. 'It's going to be a play with characters and songs - I'm calling it music theater, but I don't really know what it's going to be like, I just have incredible trust in their creative vision,' James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theater Workshop, told the New York Times. 'I'm really excited about it. These are three very different sensibilities to be colliding.' The Man Who Fell to Earth was the first movie for Bowie but he did not write the music amid contractual disputes, instead leaving the task to singer-songwriter John Phillips from The Mamas And The Papas. Adaptation: The movie was an adaptation of the Walter Tevis novel of the same name, published in 1963 . Tweaks: It is not clear what changes will be made in the stage version, Lazarus, by Bowie and Enda Walsh . It has been in the works for years, according to New York Theater Workshop artistic director James Nicola . New direction? The team has refused to categorize the new production as either a play or a musical . Bowie has long been fascinated by space and science fiction, emerging on the scene in 1969 with his astronaut anthem Space Oddity and later writing the probing Life On Mars? Bowie studied acting and is known for his portrayal on Broadway in 1980-81 of severely deformed Englishman Joseph Merrick in The Elephant Man. Bowie, 68, kept quiet for a decade before releasing the album The Next Day in 2013. He last year released the career-spanning collection Nothing Has Changed with new material.","Bowie, 68, starred as an alien enamored by TV and alcohol in the 1976 film .

"A Sicilian Mafia fugitive dubbed the Godfather of Uxbridge who was set to be extradited to Italy will be allowed to remain in the UK after his sentence was dropped. Domenico Rancadore, who has lived in Britain for more than 20 years, was given a seven-year sentence by an Italian court in 1999 for being a member of the Cosa Nostra. In February he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to Italy to serve his sentence. But today it emerged that the 65-year-old's case expired last October and his European Arrest Warrant is to be withdrawn. Sentence dropped: Domenico Rancadore (right and left) fled to Britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in Italy for his role as a 'man of honour' Although his conviction remains intact, Italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed. The case will still have to be heard by the Italian Supreme Court, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Rancadore's solicitor, Karen Todner said: 'Yesterday the Italian Court of Appeal agreed to extinguish the conviction of Domenico Rancadore on the basis that the conviction is too old to sustain a prison sentence. 'I am therefore confident that the Italian government will now withdraw their application for a European Arrest Warrant and that Mr Rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings. 'There has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and I am delighted Mr Rancadore will now be able to live in peace in England with his wife and family.' Ms Todner said she was waiting for the CPS to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge Rancadore. Once the paperwork is in order, the matter will be listed at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London and a judge will then have to approve it. The Italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court. Domenico Rancadore, pictured with hiswife Ann last year, will be allowed to remain in the UK after his sentence dropped . Rancadore was first arrested on a European arrest warrant at his semi-detached London home in August 2013. Although he was never convicted of murder, the Italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995. Known as the Professor, Rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his 'Mafia association'. He was convicted for his role as a 'man of honour', taking bribes from builders in Palermo. During protracted extradition proceedings at Westminster Magistrates' Court, District Judge Howard Riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that Italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition. In his judgment, Judge Riddle said: 'I am satisfied that, even without the assurance, there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to Italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment.' Before his arrest in 2013, the Mafia don spent two decades living under the name of Marc Skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge, obscured from view. He claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father, Giuseppe. Rancadore's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 Mafiosi indicted. Before his arrest in 2013, Rancadore spent two decades living under the name of Marc Skinner with his family in a house in Uxbridge . There was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into Rancadore's case. Extradition expert Edward Grange tweeted: 'What a waste of time and money. After two sets of proceedings, Italy no longer seeks extradition of Rancadore.' Mr Grange, who is vice-chair of the Extradition Lawyers' Association, said: 'The purpose of the extradition request was for Rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment. 'It transpires that as of October last year the Italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence. 'So certainly from October onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the Italian authorities saying: ""Hang on, we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request"". 'Courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition, that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and European arrest warrant scheme. 'It is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying. 'Had the Italians said in October we cannot legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the European arrest warrant, I'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible.' Domenico Rancadore, who has lived in Britain for more than 20 years, was given a seven-year sentence by an Italian court in 1999 for being a member of the Cosa Nostra . Asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process, Mr Grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic'. Barrister Philip Marshall QC said: 'Yet more incompetence by the CPS in the Rancadore case (allegedly): his seven-year prison sentence expired in October 2014.' There was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of Rancadore's home in Manor Way, Uxbridge, London today. Curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a Mercedes car was parked on the driveway. One neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because 'you never know who will move in'. She went on: 'He seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago.' The neighbour said she last saw Rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health. A court sketch of  Domenico Rancadore. Today it emerged that the 65-year-old's case expired last October and his European Arrest Warrant is to be withdrawn . Sharon Walker, who also lives nearby, said: 'They were a normal couple before and I'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple. 'They are very quiet. I would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street. Also known as Cosa Nostra, which translates as 'Our Thing', the Mafia emerged in Sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct. Groups, often known as families or clans, will claim leadership of an area, usually a town or village, and operate rackets within it, using violence to punish those causing problems to their 'clients' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection. Most of the clans are led by a 'boss' (capofamiglia or rappresentante), who is aided by an underboss (capo bastone or sotto capo) and supervised by one or more advisers (consigliere). Only men are allowed to join the clans, and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges. It has been estimated that the Sicilian Mafia costs the region's economy more than €10 billion a year, and that roughly 70 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money. Politicians have also been accused of using the Mafia to buy votes during elections. The American Mafia arose from offshoots of the Cosa Nostra that emerged in the United States during the late nineteenth century, following waves of emigration from Italy. 'He's very quiet. He always has been, even before it all blew up. They are a very quiet family.' Federico Bianchi, head of press at the Italian Embassy, said: 'When, in March 2014, the District Judge denied the extradition of Mr Rancadore to Italy, the Crown Prosecution Service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms, for which they issued a formal excuse. 'That is key to the release of Mr Rancadore because that loss of time, which obliged Italy to start the procedures afresh, issuing a new European Arrest Warrant, because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire. 'It gave the possibility to Mr Rancadore's lawyers, who are clever and know the penal code very well, to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired.' Mr Bianchi also denied that the hearing in February had been 'useless' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in Palermo on March 25. A CPS spokesman said: 'The Italian Ministry of Justice has confirmed that the decision by the Court of Appeal in Palermo is appealable to the Italian Supreme Court. 'It is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today's outcome. 'Until the European arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today, the CPS acted on behalf of the Italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary.' The CPS admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to Rancadore's lawyers on time in March last year. At the time, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders acknowledged that, as a result of the error, it was possible Rancadore would never be extradited to Italy.","Domenico Rancadore given a seven-year sentence by Italian court in 1999 .

"There's always that one friend who with the swirl of a wine glass  will leave you in awe of their sophisticated wine skills. Yet unless you grew up on a vineyard or had a wise wino whisper the secrets of their connoisseuring ways, it's likely you don't know the distinct differences between a Cabernet Sauvignon and a Merlot and tend to swallow more than you spit it out at a wine tasting. Dr Alex Russell, a Sydney-based University lecturer who has worked in the wine retail industry for over 10 years (with a claim to fame  selling the last $26,000 bottle of Glenfiddich in the world) and whose completed a PhD on 'the taste and smell perception of wine', shares his advice for wowing  winos with your knowledge. Top tips: Dr Alex Russell shares his tips for mastering wine tasting in four hours . 1.SET ASIDE AT LEAST FOUR HOURS . As part of his research study, Russell would have people come into the lab every day to smell and taste lots of wines. 'In most cases, they would be in the lab for an hour and wouldn't learn much,' he said. 'However when participants stayed 30 minutes longer they showed signs of improvement and after four hours, they were doing  well and got the hang of tasting.' 2. TRY DIFFERENT TYPES . 'No expert has become an expert by only drinking their favourite wine,' says Russell. 'Branch out, be willing to try wine by the glass rather than buying a whole bottle and try wines made from different grapes, regions or countries.' Name that note: The main skill wine experts have believes Russell, is an ability to put a name to the odour or scent . 3.TASTE THEM SIDE-BY-SIDE . While we have a distinct memory for smell, just like other types of memory, we can often be prone to forgetting too, according to Russell. 'Instead of relying on your memory to compare the wine you’re drinking now verse the the one you tried last week, open up a few different bottles at the same time so you can  compare them directly.' 4. SHUT YOUR EYES . The main skill wine experts have believes Russell, is an ability to put a name to the odour or scent. 'Wines that smell like blackcurrant might not actually be made from or with blackcurrant and don’t look like blackcurrant so it can be hard to identify a smell when you can’t visually associate it with the  source,' he said. 'In fact these wines contain chemicals that, when isolated, smell very much like blackcurrant.' So Russell suggests going through your pantry with a friend and picking out various herbs and fruits. 'Smell and taste the ingredients with your eyes closed and try to identify them. Then learn from feedback - it might be hard at first but you’ll improve over time.' 5. IF IN DOUBT, ADD YOUR OWN FLAVOURS AND SMELLS . 'If you're not sure what peach tastes like in a Chardonnay, then add a little bit of syrup from a can of peaches to your next glass to  gain an idea of what the flavour tastes like in wine,' suggests Russell. 'Gradually reduce the amount you put in until you can identify that flavour without any additive.' Russell says there are now hundreds of possible odours and flavours that can come in a glass of wine, such as chocolate, green olive, eucalyptus and coffee. 6. KNOW THE LINGO . Even if you're are a food or perfume expert, learning wine and its lingo is a whole other thing, according to Russell. 'Wine expertise is all about linking an odour or flavour with its recognised name. Experts will share information using similar terms whereas novices generally can’t describe wines very well and don’t know  the experts’ tasting terms.' 7. DON'T WORRY ABOUT HAVING A 'SUPERNOSE' OR MOUTH . In examining a range of studies, Russell says there is no apparent difference between the smelling sensitivity of every day people verse seasoned pros. 'Essentially wine experts smell and taste the same  but they’re better at processing the information,' he said. 'Similarly, chess experts can look at the same board as their less experienced counterparts but can determine which pieces are immediately relevant more quickly – it’s all about having a processing advantage.' Forget about having a 'supernose': 'Essentially wine experts smell and taste the same but they’re better at processing the information,' says Dr Russell . 8. START WITH CHEAP WINE, BUT DON'T STICK TO IT . While price isn't the only indicator of quality, Russell believes that it is often the case that the more expensive wines  reflect better where they come from. 'Plus learning about wine regions is part of being an expert,' he adds. 9.READ AND TASTE . 'Wine experts aren’t just good at tasting wines, they also know a lot about how it’s made, where it’s made and all the other important details you would find in a wine book,' said Russell. Cheers: 'As long as you have a working nose and mouth, you can become a wine expert' 10. DON'T GIVE UP IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE . 'A lot of people avoid wine-tasting games because they are afraid to fail,' said Russell. But it’s okay to make mistakes. According to Russell, a famous French experiment in which white wine was artificially coloured red with odourless dye was once able to undermine a series of seasoned experts. 'This study highlighted the impact our thoughts and expectations have on what we taste in a wine – it’s almost like they ""drank the wine with their eyes,;"" he said. 'As long as you have a working nose and mouth, you can become a wine expert,' assures Russell. 'Just begin - you’ll start to see improvements after a few hours. And even if you don't want to become a serious expert, being able to describe a wine or understand a description of a wine is  handy. And besides, it’s a lot of fun!,' he adds.","University lecturer Dr Alex Russell shares his expert advice .

"When Gareth Silk let his five friends plan a stag do, he might have imagined it would involve pranks, costumes and drinking - but denim hotpants and heels were far from his thoughts. Little did he realise his friends from Cwmbran, south Wales, were inspired by the hilarious Money Supermarket advert, featuring  a man dressed in shirt and jacket from the waist up and tight booty shorts and stilettos from the waist down. When the men in their matching outfits walked down the street in Benidorm, Spain, they earned cheers, clapping and even policemen driving past waved and laughed. David Rowles snaps the gang, from left to right: Steve Harvey Taylor, Gareth Edwards, Michael Groves, groom Gareth Silk and his father Andrew Silk . David Rowles, 38, who filmed the stag stunt, said: ‘We were in our local pub planning the stag weekend. ‘We decided that whatever the first advert was that came on the TV, that was what we were going to do.’ The Money Supermarket advert featuring 'Dave's epic strut' came on. David said: 'Everyone thought it would be a head-turner.’ The next step for the group was to buy some high heels, and David admitted the men asked their other halves for help in purchasing the right shoes. Each of the men dress in high heels and the video maker noted that some of them were walking 'too well' Michael Groves channels Dave's 'epic strut' from the original ad that quickly went viral . He added: ‘A couple of them were walking a bit too well in their high heels. It looked like they had been practising.’ Wearing heels earned them blisters along with laughs and attention from the crowds . The group of six - which included the groom-to-be Gareth Silk and his stags Gareth Edwards, Steven Harvey Taylor, Michael Groves, dad Andrew Silk and David Rowles - descended on the promenade of the Spanish resort on March 29. David captured them strutting their stuff on his camera phone. They each wear suits from the waist up with braces over their shirts and denim hot pants and high heels from the waist down. In the video, the men mimic the advert, walking towards the camera in a line of five, with groom Gareth in the middle,  pulling a variety of humorous poses from the TV commercial. Later in the video the stag do can be seen garnering much attention from locals, holiday goers and even the police. Mr Rowles said: ‘The whole promenade was at a standstill. People were cheering and clapping and all different nationalities stood around to watch and take photos. ‘A police car went past and I was trying to get them to beep their sirens. They waved and laughed – they were fine. ‘I’ve been on many stag weekends and this was probably one of the best. We couldn’t believe the attention.' The stag do garnered a lot of attention from locals, other holiday goers and even the police . Unfortunately for the group however, who wore their outfits from 1pm until 7pm, there were repercussions and the men each had sore feet to contend with for the rest of the trip. ‘We joked before we left saying that someone was bound to break their ankle. Luckily no one did, but they all got blisters,’ said David. According to the filmmaker, the group have already made plans to go on a fishing trip to Ireland in the near future. The original ad stars American Michael Van Schoick, who has been forced to deny he's had buttock implants, insisting his bottom is all natural. In the ad he struts and twerks to the Pussycat Dolls' hit Don't Cha.","New video shows stag do strutting in denim hotpants and heels .

"The owners of an Indiana pizza shop who refused to cater a gay wedding have gone into hiding - but plan to re-open soon after raising $500,000. Memories Pizza in Walkerton faced criticism this week after co-owner Crystal O'Connor expressed support for a new Indiana religious objections law. Despite 'keeping a low profile' Crystal O'Connor and her father Kevin O'Connor went on Fox News on Thursday to discuss their comments and and the backlash they've received. It was revealed on Thursday that the pizza shop has never catered a wedding before. Scroll down for videos . In hiding: Crystal O'Connor and her father Kevin O'Connor said they'll re-open soon but were forced to close the doors to their pizza shop because the phones kept ringing and they didn't know if orders were fake or real . 'Anger. Bitterness. It's something I never expected or imagined when the comments were made. It's just unimaginable to me,' said Kevin when asked about the reaction to his daughter saying she would deny gay couples pizza on their wedding day. When asked if they'll ever re-open their pizza place Kevin said he initially shut down because he 'couldn't tell if they were getting real orders or fake orders' and said that the phone rang all day and all night. 'We plan to re-open soon we just don't know when,' Crystal said. A contributor from Glenn Beck's The Blaze set up the fundraising page on GoFundMe for the pizzeria, with a goal of helping 'the family stave off the burdensome cost of having the media parked out front, activists tearing them down, and no customers coming in'. Controversy: The O'Connors made their comments a week after the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed, forbidding state or local government from 'substantially 'burdening' a person's right to their beliefs . up in arms: Demonstrators  gather outside the City County Building on March 30 in Indianapolis to protest the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act . A new Indiana law passed yesterday states that no one has the legal right to 'refuse to offer or provide' goods, services, facilities or employment to anyone in previously protected classes or based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The news comes a little after a week  Indiana passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics say would allow businesses to openly discriminate against gays, and just a few days after his daughter told a local news station they would refuse to serve a gay marriage ceremony. Speaking to ABC57 on Tuesday, Crystal O'Connor said: 'If a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding, we would have to say no.’ According to TMZ, O'Connor tried to clarify his views, saying he would never refuse to serve gay customers, but as a Christian he disagrees with gay marriage, and so would refuse to serve a same-sex wedding. The pizza joint has been in operation for nine years. The interior of the old-fashioned eatery is adorned with crosses and bible quotes. Just outside the pizzeria, a signs states that the staff begin each morning with a prayer. 'We are a Christian establishment,' Crystal O’Connor confirmed, but pointed out that their business practices are not biased. Shuttered: Memories Pizza in Indiana, whose owners Crystal and Kevin O'Connor (pictured) said they would refuse to cater a gay wedding, closed its doors after being abused over the phone and online . ‘We're not discriminating against anyone, that's just our belief and anyone has the right to believe in anything,’ insisted O'Connor. When Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a Republican, signed the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law last week, the O’Connor family in Walkerton applauded his decision. The measure prohibits state and local government from ‘substantially burdening’ the ability of people — including businesses — to follow their religious beliefs. Pence said in a statement last Thursday that the bill ensures ‘religious liberty is fully protected under Indiana law.’ Critics of the legislation said it could allow discrimination against gay people, but its supporters claimed the bill merely seeks to prevent the government from compelling people to provide such things as catering or photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds. Several reviewers invoked Adolf Hitler and the KKK in their eviscerating assessments of the pizzeria but they have since been taken down . Crystal O’Connor, of Memories Pizza, dismissed discrimination concerns, saying the law is not targeting gays - it merely helps people that have strong religious beliefs. She added that as a devout Christian, she does not support same-sex marriage – a conviction shared by her father. He said: ‘That lifestyle is something they choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual. Why should I be beat over the head to go along with something they choose?’ The Facebook and Yelp pages for the restaurant about 20 miles southwest of South Bend were bombarded with over 300 mixed reviews and their pizza place has currently just 2.5 stars following the family's controversial statements. A coach of a high school golf program was suspended after a Twitter post he wrote mentioned going to Walkerton and burning down the restaurant. The picture section of the review page has was swamped with images, some of which contain explicit content, supporting homosexuality and gay rights. It appears as though those images have since been taken down. One five-star review, written from the point of view of 'Adolf. H' no longer on the page stated: ‘Memories Pizza had been recommended to me by my buddy Herman years ago - and his praise was well deserved. ‘The largely Aryan ownership manages their subhuman staff quite well. No y*** or q****s to speak of and the tomato sauce was pretty decent for canned.’ No longer on yelp: The pizzeria's Yelp page was targeted by those who disagreed with the O'Connors' statements, attracting hundreds of one star reviews, some of which were removed . User Marco V. wrote in his review in part: 'You don't want sinners coming into your business? guess what? We are all sinners.' The review was accompanied by a meme of Crystal O'Connor with a speech bubble that read: 'Jesus said bigotry is great for sales!' Many Yelpers mocked Ms O’Connor’s suggestion that anyone would want to order pizza for their wedding reception. 'As a pizza loving lesbian - I would NEVER serve pizza at my wedding. Morons,' fumed Laura D from Long Beach, New York. Another critic of the Walkerton establishment joked that their discriminatory practices did not go far enough. ‘I’m ANGRY and will never order pizza from these people again because they're simply not discriminatory enough! I mean, just ""gays""? What about anyone who works on Sundays (Leviticus 23:3)? People who wear makeup (Jeremiah 4:30)? Hungry people (Proverbs 23:2)? Men without beards (Leviticus 19:27)? Tattooed people (Leviticus 19:28)? People who eat shellfish (Leviticus 11:10)? People with messy hair (Leviticus 10:6)? New mothers (Leviticus 12:4-5)? Psychics or mediums (Leviticus 20:27)?’ A small number of people have come to the O’Connors' defense amid an avalanche of negative comments. Lori Childers wrote on the eatery’s Facebook page: ‘God Bless you for standing up for your rights, its YOUR business and you should run it however you see fit. Sick of LBGT denying me of my God given rights. Go find another store to shop at or hey open your own store.......’ Governor Pence addressed the backlash against the bill in a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece published Monday, writing that he abhors discrimination. 'If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn’t eat there anymore,' he said.","Despite 'keeping a low profile' Crystal O'Connor and her father Kevin O'Connor went on Fox News to discuss their controversial comments .

"An Oxford college and a retired architect are embroiled in an absurd row over a stretch of scrubby bushes which are quickly becoming 'the most expensive hedge in Warwickshire'. In a court case likely to cost £150,000, St John's College and a 74-year-old businessman have been locked in a battle over an unkempt hedgerow between their properties in Warwickshire. The bizarre dispute began when Anthony Bethell decided he would pay for work to restore the ancient 180-yard hedge, which marks the boundary between his home and the college's land. Hedge row: Anthony Bethell and St John's College, Oxford are embroiled in a row over a stretch of scrubby bushes, with a court case likely to cost £150,000 . The bizarre dispute began when Anthony Bethell decided he would pay for work to restore the ancient 180-yard hedge, which marks the boundary between his home and the college's land . Before starting the work, Mr Bethell thought it best to consult with the college - which is one of the largest landowners in the country - on where exactly he should replant the hedge, so to avoid any costly complications further down the line. But he claims St John's has refused to agree with him on the matter and says he has been forced to take the college to court, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The hedge, which dates back to 1686, divides Mr Bethell's one-acre plot from 1,200 acres of farmland owned by the college. Mr Bethell said: 'As it stands this ancient hedge is in a poor state of repair and is an eyesore. I'm more than happy to pay for the work to restore the hedge and improve and safeguard the rural environment around me, but I need St John's to agree the boundary line – and they just won't sit down and discuss the issue face to face. They've ignored all my approaches and left me with no choice but to go to court. 'I want to do this properly. If I went ahead and did the work without establishing where precisely the boundary lies I could end up creating all sort of problems which would see the college coming after me in future.' A crown court judge said the bushes were quickly becoming 'the most expensive hedge in Warwickshire' Mr Bethell claims St John's College (pictured) has refused to agree with him on the matter and says he has been forced to take the college to court . The retired businessman, who lives with his wife Eileen, 75, commissioned a report on the scrubby bushes, with experts recommending repairing the 'neglected, sparse' hedge. The report stated that fixing the hedgerow would encourage birds to nest, as well as providing habitats for other wildlife. Both Mr Bethell and St John's College have spent £80,000 in legal fees in total, with the cost of a full trial likely to set the parties back £150,000. The huge sum led the judge overseeing the pre-trial hearing at Coventry Crown Court to suggest the bushes are quickly becoming 'the most expensive hedge in Warwickshire'. He reportedly said that both sides may as well 'pile up £30,000 each in a field and light a huge bonfire'. Expensive: Both Mr Bethell and St John's College have spent £80,000 in legal fees in total so far . Mr Bethell, who runs a charitable foundation for deprived children, is wary of the spiralling cost of the case, adding that the college could use the money to fund places for students. 'We could all save ourselves a lot of time if they would just sit down and talk about this simple matter of the boundary,' he said. The hedge is believed to have been planted in 1686 to divide two estates, which merged almost a century later when St John's bought the land. The college now owns more than 9,000 acres of land in England. Professor Andrew Parker, the bursar of St John's College, Oxford, said: 'The legal action and court proceedings have been initiated by Mr Bethell. 'Despite attempts to settle the matter by meetings between professional advisers and by mediation, the College regrets that it is necessary to have the matter resolved by the courts.'","Anthony Bethell has taken St John's College, Oxford to court over a hedge .

"While throwing in the nine-to-five life is a dream for many, one young couple decided to make it a reality, experiencing the world as they spent a year filming one mini documentary a day. Sydney couple Epiphany Morgan and Carl Mason produced 365 documentaries in as many days, visiting 35 countries and 70 cities, as part of their project 365 Docobites, an idea which even the couple originally doubted would actually work. 'The idea only popped into my head about seven months before we hopped on the plane. When I first told one of my friends what we were thinking of doing, she asked whether I was sure it was a good idea,' Epiphany told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Epiphany Morgan and Carl Mason produced 365 documentaries in 365 days while travelling to 35 countries . With only seven months to organise everything, Epiphany, 23, left her job at a film production company to freelance and work towards their dream, while Carl, 27, continued to work as a senior editor at an advertising agency. 'When we told our friends and family what we were planning on doing, they didn't really believe us. They kept asking, 'are you sure you're going to be able to do that?',' Carl said. 'Honestly, I didn't even believe we were going until about month before we left when Epiphany told me that everything was in order for us to leave,' he said. With a strict budget of $40 a day, the couple set off to their first destination- the US- and landed in New York to begin their very long journey across the globe. 'I can remember the first day, we were in Times Square with all our camera gear and  we didn't get up the courage to ask a single person to be involved,' Carl said. 'It was a bit rainy, and when it stopped raining we told ourselves it was too dark, and then it was, 'oh, we haven't eaten', so we kept finding an out,' he said. The couple began their filming journey in New York and visited 70 cities in their year of filming . Both Epiphany and Carl have a background in film: Carl worked as a senior editor at an advertising agency and Epiphany worked at a production company before going freelance . The pair, from Sydney, set themselves a goal of releasing one mini documentary each day for a year . 'But we realised that we just have to get out there and do it, and then next day we went back out again and found a busker. As soon as we put ourselves out there we found that people were so willing to get involved.' Over the course of the year, Epiphany and Carl visited 70 cities in 35 countries to capture moments and people on camera- and on a strict production schedule and budget, found themselves stretched to the limits. 'We ended up starting out with three months of funding, and managed to stretch it out to six months by living very cheaply,' Epiphany said. 'There were a few times when we actually did run out of money, but we managed to build enough of a following that we were able to get sponsorship from tourism boards to stay in their city, as well as hotels and hostels,' she said. 'But even then $40 between the two of us wasn't much. Sometimes it came to dinner and we would have a can of pineapple, a packet of chips, and some chocolate left, and that would be what we ate.' Moniek travels the world playing her violin, and met Epiphany and Carl when she was playing at the New Orleans French Quarter Festival . Alisha and seven of her friends moved to California from Minnesota. She works for Pin Up Girl Clothing and is passionate about women being comfortable with their bodies . As well as their tight budget, the pair set themselves a goal of releasing one mini documentary each day, a plan they managed to stick to despite a few setbacks. 'We left three weeks before we planned on releasing our first one, so we thought we'd always be three weeks ahead of schedule, but things always go wrong when you're travelling,' Carl said. 'But we always managed to get them out. There were a couple of funny moments where we would be madly dashing around trying to upload a film,' he said. 'There was this one moment where we were in New Orleans and the film was in the middle of uploading on the free wifi of a cafe, and they kicked us out because they were closing. We had to run down the street as it was raining with the laptop open underneath a poncho trying to find another cafe with internet.' The couple said that the stress and pressure was worth it to experience so much of the world and to meet so many people who were willing to share their stories. 'We learnt millions of lessons, and every week there was at least one life lesson. Overall the biggest thing for me was that we are all human and we share the same basic needs and wants,' Epiphany said. Galen the dog is eight years old and has a talent for 'playing dead'. His owner Nolan uses his ability to busk in the streets . Titus  Mario are ambulance drivers, or 'EMT's', who work 13-hour days in New Orleans . Justin, Devon and Bailey (left to right) are homeless and have banded together as a 'family' of their own making, decided to live on the streets after being kicked out of the Scientologist church . The pair said they learnt to not just observe but also engage with people's lives, to be vulnerable themselves if they were asking the same of others. 'There was this one guy in Ireland we interviewed, he was with a group in a park who were doing this improvisational dance where they connected by touching each other,' Epiphany said. 'We did a documentary on one of the guys and I ended up giving the dancing a go because you can't just ask others to be vulnerable, you have to be willing to do it yourself,' she said. 'If they feel you're nervous they'll be nervous, but as soon as you let down your guard people open right up and are willing to give so much,' Carl said. In Botswana, Epiphany and Carl arrived to be told that the night beforehand a tourist had been eaten by a lion, and interviewed their local tour guide who spent the whole night sitting outside camp shooting his gun into the air to keep the predators away. 'The next morning we found fresh lion prints 100 metres away,' Epiphany said. The couple also met the woman who has the most piercings on her body in the world, and had the chance to stay with locals in Cambodia and Slovenia, which they describe as 'very tortured places'. This couple from Iceland were born four hours apart on the same day and went to school together before they started dating . Unur (above) is a tour guide for the Golden Circle of Iceland with Icelandic Excursions . Elaine has 9,800 piercings on her body and is a Guinness World Record holder. She told Epiphany and Carl that she moved to Scotland because she 'likes the men in the kilts' After a year away, Epiphany and Carl headed home from their last stop in Singapore, and touched down in Sydney in an emotional last leg to their journey. 'As we were flying in over Sydney it was cloudy and then all of a sudden you could see the Harbour Bridge. Epiphany burst into tears immediately,' Carl said. 'It was very surreal to come home and see all our family at the airport after so long, it was hard to take in,' he said. After one night celebrating their homecoming with family and friends, the couple got back to business, finishing off their last seven 'docobites' in their hometown. 'The second day home we got right back into it, and kept going until we reached our last one, which was a doco on us,' Carl said. The last docobite came out on Tuesday, giving the couple time to breathe for the first time in a year. 'The project isn't over though. We want other people to contribute their videos, and start watching the ones we already have up,' Epiphany said. Glyn (above) is an IT specialist who spends his weekends playing his bagpipes to the masses . 'This is not the end of the project, it's actually just the beginning of what we want to achieve. It's exciting that it's going beyond us and inviting people into the experience of storytelling,' she said. After a year on the road interviewing a cross section of the world, Epiphany and Carl said their experience taught them so much about how to relate to other people. 'Once we realised that we are all essentially the same in so many ways, the world became a much friendlier place. Looking at the ways we are the same rather than the ways that we are different means there are so many ways of problem solving and helping one another,' Epiphany said. 'It was something we had a sense of at the beginning of the trip and was reinforced as we connected with 365 different people all over the world,' she said. 'The big message we want to share is compassion over hate.'","Epiphany Morgan and Carl Mason produced 365 documentaries in a year .

"The musical toast a bride received from her brother in place of a speech by their father was also a way of remembering their dad, who died of motor neuron disease 10 years ago. Amanda Beringer asked her brother Brad Fraser to make a toast at her wedding at Eagle Bay, south of Perth. Far from a conventional toast, Mr Fraser performed a song which poked fun at marriage. The performance was also a tribute to their father, Peter, who lost his battle with the debilitating motor neuron disease 10 years previously, and a celebration of his zest for life. Scroll down for video . Amanda Beringer (left) asked her brother Brad Fraser (right) to make a toast at her wedding . The toast that Brad made at the wedding at Eagle Bay, south of Perth, was a musical one . 'It took the focus off the fact that Dad wasn’t here on my wedding day,' Mrs Beringer told Daily Mail Australia. 'My father wasn’t there to do my wedding speech, while my husband’s father was.' 'He (Mr Fraser) turned it around and and made it light-hearted which was great. It made me laugh instead of being upset because my Dad wasn’t there.' Mrs Beringer, 33, said it's what her father would have wanted. During the last stages of his disease he lost the ability to talk, but he never lost his love of life and his sense of fun. Brad sung heartily about the highs and lows of marriage . 'He had a computer where he could type in the words and it would read it out,' Mrs Beringer said. 'Even then he’d be making you laugh. He was still in good spirits even though he couldn’t talk.' 'Despite his disease he was there always up for a laugh until the very end. Brad’s speech was a kind of celebration of that.' She agreed some of the song's lyrics were not the kind most newly married women might like to hear. 'Well it's done now, you can't turn back. You're legally binded by the wedding trap,' Mr Fraser sang. 'For better for worse, it's only a curse, so open your wallet…and fill up her purse.' Everyone in attendance at the wedding couldn't get enough of Brad's ditty . The crowd, who in a video of the performance posted online can be heard bursting out in laughter, erupt into a standing ovation at the end. 'It was very funny – although maybe not the best advice to be giving my husband from my perspective!' Mrs Beringer said. 'But it was very touching. It brought a tear to my eye and pulled a lot of heartstrings.' Mr Fraser said he regularly works as a master of ceremonies at social functions, but always gives 10 per cent of his fee to the Motor Neuron Association. Far from a conventional toast, Mr Fraser's song poked fun at some of the burdens of marriage . The song was also a tribute to Brad and Amanda's father, Peter, who passed away of Motor Neuron Disease 10 years earlier . 'Motor Nueron Disease doesn’t affect your brain – it affects everything else,' Mr Fraser told Daily Mail Australia. 'My Dad would be sitting there not saying anything or just moaning, but you knew he was getting the joke. 'They’re laughing inside and you know that. So to give everyone a laugh at the wedding was important. It’s what my Dad would have wanted.'

"English essential: This laminated document announces the new ISIS nursing school and lists the language entry requirements for would-be nurses . Militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in Syria have announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English - something the NHS still hasn't introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age, must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists, and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place, with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates. Details of the first nursing school to be opened in ISIS-held territory were revealed by on Twitter by Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently - an activist group based in the Syrian city that uses a network of brave informers to document the daily atrocities carried out by the Islamic extremists. RIBSS shared a photograph of a laminated document written in Arabic  giving details of the new medical school and listing the entry requirements for would-be nurses. It states that all candidates be aged between 18 and 25, pass an entry exam, impress during an interview, graduated from secondary school with science qualifications, be willing to travel to any ISIS-held area, and willing work for ISIS institutions for at least two years after graduating. The document also states the importance of English - saying candidates will not be accepted without knowing how to speak and understand the language. This is in stark contrast with Britain where English language checks for all nurses are still not being enforced, despite legislation being passed last month making them a legal requirement. Jihadis: ISIS has English language rules for all nurses. The NHS does not have the same level of checks . Although the law has changed, the Nursing and Midwifery Council must engage in a lengthy consultation process, draft new legislation and seek council approval before it can test the English language skills of nurses who trained within the EU. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating. However the announcement in Raqqa promised that graduate nurses who achieved top grades and showed the most promise at the school will be considered for places as ISIS' medical school, where they can train for better paid jobs such as doctors and surgeons. ISIS' English language rules have been put in place long before the NHS has been able to bring in similar checks. Militants: Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating . ISIS has launched English-language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and 'martyrdom operations'. The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. Last year the law was changed to make it legal for all foreign nurses, midwives and dentists from outside the European Union to be forced to take an IELTS language exam if it was felt their English made them unsafe in a medical environment. Since then 429 doctors from outside the EU have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch. Similar rules were passed last month extending those rules to prospective medical who trained inside the EU, a rule quickly adopted by doctors and dentists. The rule is still not being by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, however, as the regulator requires a lengthy public consultation process before it can amend its rules. Even then the law will only apply to candidates who medical authorities judge could be a danger due to poor English language skills. In such an instance the nurse would first be required to prove sufficient English language experience - such as from a GCSE-style qualification - or they will be forced to take the British Council's IELTS qualification, to access whether they have reached a suitable level for their job.","ISIS has announced that all nurses working for them must speak English .

"President Barack Obama declared the threat of cyber attacks by foreign agents a 'national emergency' as he unveiled plans to impose sanctions on hackers in the wake of an epidemic of attacks against American networks. Obama took aim at Russia, China and Iran as he revealed an executive order which will allow the U.S. Treasury  to freeze or block assets of those involved in attacks on 'critical' American computer networks. The announcement followed a series of high profile incidents, including a devastating attack against Sony Pictures, and data breaches that stole credit card or health data on tens of millions of Americans. 'National emergency': Obama unveiled plans to impose sanctions on hackers after an epidemic of attacks . 'It’s one of the great paradoxes of our Information Age — the very technologies that empower us to do great good can also be used by adversaries to inflict great harm,' he wrote in a blog post on Medium. Obama said cyber attacks - many which originate from overseas - 'pose one of the most serious economic and national security challenges to the United States'. He added it required more than 'diplomacy, law enforcement, and cooperation with other nations and the private sector' to tackle. He wrote: 'It's often hard to go after bad actors, in part because of weak or poorly enforced foreign laws, or because some governments are either unwilling or unable to crack down on those responsible.' Obama said hackers working in China and Russia target America's defense contractors and the systems designed to support the country's troops, while hackers in Iran were targeting banks and North Korea went after Sony. Michael Daniel, special assistant to the president and cyber security co-ordinator, said the new sanctions would 'go after the worst of the worst of malicious cyber actors', while Obama assured people they would 'in no way target the unwitting victims of cyberattacks,' such as people whose computers are hijacked. However, they did not reveal any specific targets, but officials told the Financial Times it could be used against individual hackers hired by companies or countries. Threat: The attacks included last year's Sony pictures hack - allegedly carried out by North Korea. Pictured: The secretive state's leader, Kim Jong-un . Anger: It is said the country was unhappy about the film The Interview (poster, right), which depicted an assassination attempt against the North Korean leader, portrayed by Randall Park (left) They would also not curb the freedom of the internet, Obama stated. But some privacy activists questioned the broad language in the order, saying it could have unforeseen impacts. The order could be interpreted to target investigative reporters, said Marcy Wheeler on the privacy blog Empty Wheel. 'Does WikiLeaks' publication of secret Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations qualify? Does Guardian's publication of contractors' involvement in NSA hacking?' she wrote. 'I'm generally concerned about this (order) because of the way national emergencies have served as the justification for a lot of secret spying decisions,' Wheeler added. But Paul Rosenzweig of the Chertoff Group, a security consulting firm, said the national emergency language is appropriate. 'The use of ""national emergency'"" is reflective, I think, of the seriousness with which the administration views the problem — and that's a good thing,' Rosenzweig said on the Lawfare blog. 'What is most notable about the order is how strongly the US is flexing its economic muscle. If access to US markets is of value, the administration is signalling, strongly, that continued access may be conditioned on good cyber behavior. Concern: Some privacy activists questioned the broad language in the order and its unforeseen impacts . However, Obama's advisers were keen to stress how important the new measures were. Lisa Monaco, the President's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, wrote in a blog: 'In just the past year, we have seen a significant increase in the frequency, scale, and sophistication of cyber incidents targeting the American people, including everything from large data breaches and significant intrusions to destructive and coercive cyber attacks intended to influence the way ordinary Americans exercise their constitutional rights. 'In many cases, these threats stem from actors overseas using malicious cyber activities to inflict harm on Americans without ever leaving their desks.' Ms Monaco warned 'no one connected to the internet is immune' to the threat, buyt added the sanctions  are 'not a tool that we will use every day' and 'law-abiding companies have absolutely nothing to worry about'.","Barack Obama made announcement following high profile cyber attacks .

"Yoko Ono has led the tributes to John Lennon's first wife Cynthia calling her a 'wonderful mother' with a 'strong zest for life' after she died at the age of 75 following a short battle with cancer. The second wife of the Beatles singer said she was 'very saddened' by the news, adding that she was 'proud' how she and Cynthia had 'stood firm in the Beatles family'. Cynthia, who married Lennon after meeting him in college, died yesterday at her home in Spain. A message on her son Julian's website said he was at her beside throughout, and the family 'are thankful for your prayers'. Scroll down for video . Yoko Ono has led the tributes to John Lennon's first wife Cynthia, posting this photo of the two women with their sons Sean and Julian. She wrote underneath: 'When we were very happy together' Cynthia Lennon, who died at her home in Spain yesterday, later penned memoirs of her time with her famous husband, who eventually left her for Yoko Ono . This memorial website set up for her by her family carried an image of her surrounded by a love heart and a brief statement explaining she had died after a 'short but brave' battle with cancer . In the statement, Yoko said: 'I'm very saddened by Cynthia's death. She was a great person and a wonderful mother to Julian. 'She had such a strong zest for life and I felt proud how we two women stood firm in the Beatles family. Please join me in sending love and support to Julian at this very sad time.' Yoko also posted a picture which had been taken in 2010 of the two women with their sons, Julian and Sean. She captioned the picture: 'When we were very happy together.' Cynthia Lennon, nee Powell, married Lennon in 1962 and stayed with him as he rose to global stardom with The Beatles until the couple divorced in 1968. But the pair divorced in 1968 after Cynthia discovered her husband's relationship with the Japanese artist. Former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr added their condolences. Writing on his website, McCartney, 72, said: 'She was a lovely lady who I've known since our early days together in Liverpool. She was a good mother to Julian and will be missed by us all, but I will always have great memories of our times together.'

John Lennon and Cynthia board a flight from Heathrow to New York in 1964 before thousands of adoring fans . Starr, 74, tweeted: 'Peace and love to Julian Lennon God bless Cynthia love Ringo and Barbara xx.' John Lennon and Cynthia met at college and married just as Lennon's career with The Beatles propelled him to fame. Julian also tweeted a picture of his mother, who was 75, inside a heart with the message 'In Loving Memory'. He also posted a moving video tribute to his late mother with a song he had written in her honor. 'You gave your life for me, you gave your life for love,' it begins, showing footage of him as a young boy with his parents. It also shows footage of Cynthia with John during the early days of Beatlemania. 'The love you left behind will carry on,' Julian sings in a style influenced by his late father. It concludes with the words: 'I know you're safe above.' Cynthia met Lennon at art school in Liverpool in 1957 and the couple married just before Beatlemania transformed her husband from a jobbing musician into one of the most famous men in the world. At the height of the Beatles' early success, she was kept so far in the background that many of Lennon's female fans were not even aware of her existence, and she stayed at home bringing up Julian while the Fab Four toured the world and topped the charts. Cynthia Lennon pictured with The Beatles in 1964 during their rose to global stardom . The couple (pictured together left and right in 1964) divorced in 1968 after Cynthia discovered her husband's relationship with Yoko Ono . Cynthia Lennon grew up in a middle-class community on the Wirral, met John Lennon while they were both students at the Liverpool College of Art. The pair married in 1962, when Cynthia was just 22, after she became pregnant with their son Julian. Beatles' members George Harrison, Paul McCartney, and The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein - who was best man - all attended. The Lennons bought Kenwood, then a 22-bedroom home, in Weybridge, Surrey, for £20,000 in 1964. Kenwood became the place to visit for the other Beatles, various American musicians and total strangers that Lennon had met the previous night in London nightclubs. While she had suspicions of Lennon's infidelity over the years, with friends telling her that Lennon had had numerous affairs as far back as their time together at art college in Liverpool, Cynthia ignored the warnings. The Lennons' marriage troubles came to a head in February 1968 when Lennon drunkenly confessed to sleeping with other women during their marriage. Lennon suggested Cynthia take a holiday with friends. She returned to find her husband sitting across from Yoko Ono on the floor - staring into each other's eyes. In one of her book's she wrote that she then found Yoko's slippers outside their bedroom door - shocked and upset she left the house to stay with friends. The couple share a laugh together in 1964. Cynthia later described her role in their relationship as like a 'walk on part' In later years, Cynthia wrote in her book of how she was mistreated by Lennon as he soared to fame . The Beatles' only authorised biographer, Hunter Davies, said the couple's friends at art school never thought the relationship would last because they were such different characters . Cynthia Lennon, pictured in 1968, divorced from the hit songwriter after he met Yoko Ono . After years of trouble, the marriage finally ended in August 1968 when Yoko Ono discovered she was pregnant. Fearing a lengthy divorce process, the couple settled outside of court, with Lennon agreeing to pay Cynthia £100,000 and give her custody of Julian. The divorce prompted Paul McCartney to pen the Beatles' classic Hey Jude to help Julian cope with his parents' separation. He changed the name Julian to Jude in the song. The line 'take a sad song and make it better,' is about the Lennons' broken marriage and its impact on their son. Cynthia learned of Lennon's death on 8 December 1980, while she was staying with friends in London. She married Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini in 1970, divorcing him in 1973. In 1976, she married John Twist, an engineer from Lancashire, but divorced him in 1983. In an interview to publicise one of her books, 2005's John, she told Good Morning America: 'I have read so many books and seen so many films, and it's like we don't really exist. We are like walk-on parts in his life. We did spend 10 years together.' Recalling their early days, she said: 'You couldn't resist being around him. You couldn't resist watching what he was up to. I mean, he was a total rebel. Everybody was amazed by him.' Author Hunter Davies, who wrote the only authorized Beatles biography in 1968, described Cynthia as a 'lovely woman'. He said that unlike John, she was 'quiet and reserved and calm' and 'not a hippy at all.' He said their friends at art school never thought the relationship would last because they were so different. In her book, Cynthia described being mistreated by John. Julian was their only child together. He said: 'When I was writing the book I spent two years with them, visiting her home and spending time with her. 'I think it was the attraction of opposites between them. When they got together at art school everyone was amazed - she was seen as refined and reserved and nobody thought they would last. A never-before-seen dossier detailing the bitter breakdown of John Lennon's marriage to his first wife Cynthia was uncovered in February after nearly 50 years. The five-page document, drafted by the solicitors dealing with the Beatle's divorce in 1968, reveals details of his increasing drug use and his affair with Yoko Ono. It centres on claims made by Dorothy Jarlett, Lennon's housekeeper of four years, on what she saw while working at the Lennon family home Kenwood in Weybridge, Surrey. The papers detail his mood swings, aggressive behaviour towards his young son Julian and heated arguments between him and Cynthia. Mrs Jarlett describes how Yoko Ono would visit the country pile while Cynthia was out of the country, and how she once found the pair in bed together. She reveals how Lennon became nonchalant towards his wife around 1967 - five years after they tied the knot - when the Beatles were at the height of their fame. She said Lennon was uninterested in playing the father figure role and that he would smack Julian if he misbehaved. The statement was made to Herbert Oppenheimer, Nathan and Vandyk - a firm of solicitors in London employed by Cynthia following the breakdown of the marriage. The document has never been seen before because Lennon and Cynthia settled out of court, with Lennon agreeing to pay her £100,000 and give her custody of Julian.

"A cat has laid a claim to having the loudest purr in the world because she makes noises as loud as a Tube train. 12-year-old Bluey has a growl which is louder than most cats can miaow, and has reached a maximum of 93 decibels - more than the official world record holder. Despite her fearsome sound, Bluey is said to be gentle and loving, and is currently in a rehoming centre in Cambridge looking for a new owner. Scroll down for video . Noisy: Bluey the cat could have the loudest purr in the world, according to staff at a rehoming centre . Claire Thomas, from the Blue Cross charity, said: 'We've never had a cat in our care with a purr as loud as Bluey's. 'We thought it would be fun to see just how loud it is so we recorded it and it reached 93 decibels at its loudest, which is very impressive. 'Though she's surprisingly loud she's a lovely cat and we'd hate for it to stop her being rehomed.' Bluey went to the centre after her elderly owner had to go into care, and staff were shocked when they stroked her and she started growling like a dog. Measurement: The loud cat has been clocked at more than 90 decibels using a sound meter app . Homeless: Bluey is looking for a new owner and is currently living at a centre in Cambridge . Her purr, which is almost four time louder than the average cat, has been keeping other animals awake at night. Mis Thomas added: 'Bluey purrs all the time. She just has to see someone and she starts purring. She purrs when she's playing and she purrs when she's eating. 'We think Bluey is a little deaf but that doesn't stop her enjoying life. She's such a happy, friendly cat and she will make such a loving companion.' The noisy cat is well above the official world record holder Smokey, who was recorded at 67.7 decibels in March 2011, but her purr has not yet been officially certified. Contender: Bluey must now register with Guinness if she is to win the official world record . A spokesman for Guinness World Records said: 'We're intrigued by Bluey's talent and we would welcome an application from his owners so we can look into their claim. 'We would love to hear from them and strongly suggest they make an application for this record via our website.' However, Bluey's new owner may have to take precautions, as scientists say noise levels over 90 decibels can cause hearing loss over a prolonged period.","Bluey's purr has been measured at 93 decibels, which is louder than the official world record .

"A British university student has been ordered out of Russia amid claims she is a spy. History postgraduate Laura Sumner, 24, was given ten days to leave the country after being fined £23.50 for an alleged visa violation. But Russian media reports have branded her ‘Agent Sumner’ and linked her to a bizarre claim of a revolutionary plot. Laura Mary Sumner, pictured, has been ordered to leave Russia within ten days after being branded a 'spy' A pro-Kremlin website claimed she was one of a number of students carrying out research in Russia by British historian, Professor Sarah Badcock. The report claimed the Nottingham University academic’s work was ‘important for the plans of the West to create a “colour revolution” in Russia’. The term describes the overthrow of governments in former Soviet states, such as the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine. Professor Badcock, 40, is supervising Miss Sumner’s PhD thesis on early Soviet Russia but there has been no suggestion outside Russian media that either woman is involved in espionage or plans to foment revolution. Russian authorities accused her of conducting research in the country without the appropriate visa . Ms Sumner, left, was researching Soviet rule from 1917 to 1921 as part of her PhD under Professor Sarah Badcock of Nottingham University, right, who is acknowledged as one of Britain's leading Russian experts . Questions have been raised over whether Miss Sumner has fallen victim to a tit-for-tat punishment by Russia. It came on the day that it emerged Britain had granted political asylum to a wealthy supporter of a prominent Russian opposition leader called Vladimir Ashurkov, who has been accused of embezzlement. And diplomatic relations have remained tense following Britain’s decision to launch a public inquiry into the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko in London. Action was taken against Miss Sumner by the Federal Migration Service but sources claimed officers from the FSB, the successor to the feared KGB, were in the courtroom. Federal Judge Ilya Varlamov, pictured, ordered that Ms Sumner must leave the country within 10 days . Ms Sumner, left, appeared in court along with an interpreter, right, and was ordered to pay a £23.50 fine . A migration service spokesman said the hearing on Wednesday April 1 in the city of Nizhny Novgorod was ‘not an April Fool joke’. Nottingham University said Miss Sumner appeared to have fallen foul of a ‘minor infringement in visa regulations’ but did not respond to the spying claims. She has been offered consular support by the British Embassy. Miss Sumner, from Solihull, describes herself as a feminist and dog lover on Twitter, and has been working on her thesis for more than a year. She has been to Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod at least twice to carry out research. She was unavailable for comment and her Twitter account had been deleted yesterday. Professor Badcock was also unavailable and was said to be on holiday with her family.","Laura Mary Sumner has been ordered to leave Russia within ten days .

"8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer . Noreen Spendlove was reassured when the results of her latest mammogram were normal. Noreen, then 68, had the scan as part of the NHS breast cancer screening programme, and as she says: 'As always, getting the all-clear was a big relief.' But 18 months later, shortly before her 70th birthday, the mother-of-three from Derbyshire developed intermittent pain in her left side, just below her breast. And although Noreen, a former administrator, wasn't concerned, her daughter, a radiographer, insisted she see a GP. Despite finding nothing abnormal, the GP referred Noreen for a mammogram. This revealed three lumps on her left breast, which were all tumours. Noreen is adamant: 'That GP appointment saved my life.' Breast cancer screening was introduced in 1988, with women aged 50 to 64 invited for a mammogram every three years. In 2000, the upper limit was extended to 70. 'I didn't realise it at the time, but at 68 I'd already had my last official mammogram,' says Noreen. 'It's all the more scary knowing that, because even though I check my breasts regularly, I definitely hadn't felt any lumps. Without my daughter, I wouldn't have gone to my GP.' Noreen was one of the lucky ones. MPs are warning that women will die as a result of the screening age limit. In a report published two weeks ago, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer pointed out that 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. And while more are diagnosed at a younger age - 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s - more than half of the 12,000 women who die from breast cancer every year are over 70. So, extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis for those over 70 and more lives saved, the MPs said. In fact, the upper age limit is due to change. From the end of 2016, all women up to 73 will be invited for screening. But critics argue this is not high enough. Nat Lievesley, a researcher at the Centre for Policy on Ageing, says this cut-off point 'seems arbitrary', adding: 'It feels like a decision based on cost rather than what's best for women.' And the parliamentary group is concerned at the 'slow pace of change'. In 2013, they called for the age limit to be raised to at least 76, and possibly to 79. 'Extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis and more lives saved' 'While some progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care, treatment and support most appropriate to them,' says Steve Brine, the Conservative MP for Winchester and co-chair of the parliamentary group. And this ageism is not limited to access to mammograms. There's evidence older women are less likely to get certain treatment for breast cancer than younger women. In 2013, researchers at the University of Sussex said women over 70 in the UK who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one-in-seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is standard treatment for younger patients. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, published in the British Journal of Cancer, reported that women over 70 are 12 per cent less likely to survive breast cancer after three years than women of the same age in Sweden, where screening in most of the country continues to 74. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, last year warned: 'Around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer in older women could be avoided each year in England if survival rates matched the best in Europe.' It is ‘shameful’ to write off people as too old for screening and treatment, adds Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support. ‘People should be judged on their health as an individual not just their age.’ Ending screening at 73 ‘doesn’t take account of the fact that ageing is changing’, adds Nat Lievesley. ‘It’s no longer a strong indicator of frailty. Just look at the role models for women in their 70s.’ Yet the benefits of extending screening are not clear-cut, for there is a risk of women undergoing unnecessary treatment. A Dutch study, published in the BMJ in August 2014, suggested that inviting all women over the age of 70 for screening could result in 'over- diagnosis and overtreatment'. Researchers monitored 25,500 women aged 70 to 75 diagnosed with the disease after 1995, when breast cancer screening in the Netherlands was extended from 69 to 75. They found this had led to only a small increase in the discovery of advanced breast cancer, while the number of early-stage tumours detected increased considerably. For every woman found to have advanced cancer, another 20 would be diagnosed with small, slow-growing tumours that might not affect their life expectancy but would lead to major surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Lead researcher Dr Gerrit Jan-Liefers, of Leiden University Medical Centre, said: 'The chances of older women recovering from such severe treatment is far less than for younger women.' Older women are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems alongside cancer, he pointed out. 'So it may take them a year, a year and a half before they function normally.' For Noreen Spendlove, however, there is no question in her mind that screening should be extended. After her second mammogram in March 2011, she had a needle biopsy the same day, and two weeks later a mastectomy. The cancer had spread to her neck, so she was given six sessions of chemotherapy followed by a five-week course of radiotherapy. 'The treatment was murderous,' says Noreen. But as she prepares to receive the all-clear next year, she has no regrets about having this treatment. Indeed, her worry is that, once five years since her treatment have passed, she'll no longer be automatically invited back for screening as younger cancer survivors would be. In fact, women are entitled to request mammograms at any age - it's just the invitations that stop. Cancer charities warn that this gives the message that women no longer need to worry about breast cancer. Women are entitled to request mammograms at any age . An added complication is that older women are likely to be less 'breast aware' and more cautious about bothering their GP, the All-Party Parliamentary Group pointed out previously. Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, says: 'It's clear from calls to our helpline many older women believe that because they aren't being invited, they are no longer at risk.' Jackie Woods, 57, a local government officer from Forest Hill, South London, agrees this can be a problem. Her mother, Betty, celebrated her 88th birthday last month after undergoing treatment for breast cancer four years ago. Betty had diligently booked herself in for regular mammograms, despite no longer being invited for screening - but she was rare among her peers in doing so. During November 2011, Jackie was diagnosed with breast cancer after her regular mammogram. The diagnosis reminded Betty to request another scan for herself, and in June 2012 she was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer and had a mastectomy. Rather than simply ending screening, the Dutch researchers who suggested that extending the programme to all older women could do more harm than good, say the decision whether to continue scans should be personalised to each woman. This should be 'based on remaining life expectancy, breast cancer risk, functional status and patients' preferences', says Dr Jan-Liefers. Another way forward, says Jane Murphy, is for women to be reminded at their last screening that they are entitled to further ones. 'They should be given a card that informs them that they can continue to take advantage of regular screening. But it doesn't always happen.' Noreen Spendlove was given no such card. 'It's terrifying to think that the cancer might not have been picked up,' she says. Breast Cancer Care helpline: 0808 800 6000 or breastcancercare.org.uk.

"Messy homes can understandably be a huge source of embarrassment for home owners. But it's fair to say that everyone can admit to getting lazy with the cleaning every now and again. It turns out old mugs of tea, toothpaste-encrusted bathrooms and mouldy food are among the top 'cleaning sins' committed by busy Brits. A study by Kärcher has revealed six in ten Brits are too busy to clean their homes . A study of 2,000 people by cleaning equipment company, Kärcher, revealed that a whopping six in ten full-time working Brits are too busy to clean their homes each week. Even more shocking is that now, three months into the new year, many have avoided certain cleaning jobs all together. One in eight haven't vacuumed at all this year so far; a fifth never polish or dust their home and a quarter have never cleaned their windows before. Some of the top 'cleaning sins' committed by Brits include old mugs of tea and mouldy food left to fester . Other top ranking 'cleaning sins' include leaving hair in the plug hole, only changing bed sheets once a month and letting exploded food in the microwave fester. According to research, it seems that more than a quarter (25%) only do housework if they absolutely have to. And when it came to those in relationships? Women were less likely to feel that their partner pulled their weight around the house. UK Home and Garden Marketing Manager of Kärcher, Phil Springall, has said: 'For many people, workloads are increasing and weekly routines are often hectic. 1. Food stains from splattering . 2. Finger marks on the mirror . 3. Leaving dust on the skirting board and on the bannister . 4. Toothpaste stains on the sink . 5. Leaving expired food in the fridge . 6.

It also turns out that messy homes aren't the only source of embarrassment for Brit home owners. A study, commissioned by mouldable glue company,Sugru, has revealed that a huge six in ten Brits are embarrassed of their houses. Other reasons that Brits are embarrassed by their houses are unfinished DIY jobs, mouldy patches, cigarette odour and even antisocial neighbours. It also came down to the actual house itself, with many citing bad location, dated kitchen units and the actual size as embarrassing components. So it seems only natural that many peoople would make comparisons to cleaner, fictional on-screen abodes. The research also revealed the top ten houses that Brits would most like to recreate.

"An Alabama inmate who spent nearly 30 years on death row will go free on Friday after prosecutors told a court there is not enough evidence to link him to the 1985 murders he was convicted of committing. Jefferson County Circuit Judge Laura Petro on Thursday dismissed the case against Anthony Ray Hinton. The district attorney's office told the judge Wednesday that their forensic experts couldn't determine if six crime scene bullets — which were the crux of the evidence against Hinton at an expected retrial — came from a gun investigators took from his home. Hinton was convicted of two 1985 murders that occurred during robberies of fast-food restaurants near Birmingham. Prosecutors linked Hinton to the killings through a .38-caliber revolver found at his house. Couldn't match the bullets: Anthony Ray Hinton, pictured this week, spent nearly 30 years on Alabama's death row but will be freed Friday morning after prosecutors told a judge they won't re-try him for two slayings . All smiles: Anthony Ray Hinton hugs his family members  after learning he will walk free after spending 30 years behind bars . The U.S. Supreme Court last year sent Hinton's case back for a potential new trial, which prompted a re-examination of the evidence. 'We've been hoping for this. We've believed that this should have happened,' said Bryan Stevenson, Hinton's attorney and director of the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative. The Jefferson County District attorney's office could not immediately be reached for comment. Stevenson has been arguing for 16 years that Hinton was innocent and that he was at his job at a warehouse when the crimes were committed. Hinton wept Wednesday night after learning the news that he would finally go free, Stevenson said. A spokesman for the Alabama Department of Corrections said Hinton is expected to be released from the Jefferson County Jail on Friday morning. 'Every day, every month, every year that the state took from him, they took something that they don't have the power to give back. While this moment is quite joyous and is quite wonderful, this case is quite tragic,' Stevenson said. At his initial trial, state experts testified that the four bullets fired during the robberies, and another two from a similar robbery-shooting at a Quincy's restaurant in Bessemer, had all been fired from a revolver found at Hinton's home. Going free: Former death row inmate Anthony Ray Hinton, pictured in an undated older mugshot and an undated more recent mugshot, will go free on Friday after being imprisoned for 30 years . The Supreme Court last year ruled that Hinton had 'constitutionally deficient' representation at his initial trial. Hinton's defense lawyer wrongly thought he had only $1,000 to hire a ballistics expert to try to rebut the prosecution evidence, according the court opinion. Hinton's lawyer hired the only person willing to take the job at that price, even though he had concerns about the expert's credentials. 'He was a poor person who was convicted because he didn't have the money to prove his innocence at trial. He was unable to get the legal help he needed for years. He was convicted based on bad science,' Stevenson said. Chief Deputy Jefferson County District Attorney John Bowers met with the families of the victims of the shooting and they were angered by the news. 'Understandably they were upset and frustrated by the news. But ultimately they understood why we couldn't proceed with the prosecution of these cases,' Bowers said. 'There's no closure one way or the other,' he added. 'The experts did not say it did come from the pistol or that it didn't come from the pistol.' 'It's never happened in all my years of prosecution,' Bowers said told AL.com of releasing a death row inmate. New beginning: Anthony Ray Hinton, pictured this week, had improper representation 30 years ago because he was poor, said his attorney . The experts were unable to tie Hinton's gun to the bullets used at the crime scene. 'Three highly-qualified and experienced ADFS forensic scientists, who are experts in the field of firearms and tool mark identification, each performed independent forensic examinations of the submitted bullets and firearm,' the motion to dismiss charges said. 'Utilizing comparison microscopy, each expert inter-compared all six bullets recovered during the investigations of the three crimes to each other and to bullets test fired through the barrel of the firearm taken from (Hinton's) home.' Bowers said that the experts who examined the gun did not find enough evidence to prove Hinton's involvement. 'Due to insufficient corresponding individual microscopic characteristics, all three experts found that they could not conclusively determine that any of the six bullets were or were not fired through the same firearm or that they were fired through the firearm recovered from (Hinton's home),'  the motion continues. 'The only potential evidence that has ever been available to the State to prove that the Defendant committed the murders of John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason depends upon an absolute, conclusive determination that the bullets recovered from their bodies were in fact fired through the barrel of the firearm taken from the (Hinton's) home,' the motionsays. 'Based on the microscopic comparisons and conclusions of all three of the ADFS firearms and tool mark identification experts, the State does not have sufficient evidence to warrant further prosecution of these cases.'","Anthony Ray Hinton released 30 years after being in prison on death row .

"President Barack Obama this morning put a human face on the harmful effects climate change can have on public health  - his daughter Malia. While making the case that higher temperatures lead to increases in wildfires, which send allergy-causing particulates into the air that can lead to greater and more serious incidents of asthma, the president recalled his own child's run-in with the disease as a toddler. 'Well you know, Malia had asthma when she was four, and because we had good health insurance, we were able to knock it out early,' the president told ABC News’ chief health correspondent, Dr. Richard Besser, in an interview that aired on Good Morning America. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama this morning put a human face on the harmful effects climate change can have on public health - his daughter Malia . 'Well you know Malia had asthma when she was four, and because we had good health insurance, we were able to knock it out early,' the president told ABC News’ chief health correspondent, Dr. Richard Besser, in an interview that aired on Good Morning America . Then an Illinois U.S. Senate candidate, Obama is pictured here in 2004 with his wife Michelle and their daughters Malia, right, age 6, and and Sasha, left, age 3. Obama today said he can 'relate to... the fear a parent has when your four-year-old daughter comes up to you and says, ""Daddy, I'm having trouble breathing."" ' The president said he can 'relate to... the fear a parent has when your four-year-old daughter comes up to you and says, ""Daddy, I'm having trouble breathing."" ' 'The fright you feel is terrible.' Obama said the health scare resulted in a single trip to the emergency room for his daughter - who at the age of 16 now lives a full and an active life, inhaler free - but other children aren't so fortunate. They they find themselves in and out the emergency room several times a year. And those episodes end up costing taxpayers. So it's an all-around benefit to society if they can be prevented, he argued. The president told a similar version of the story to CBS News' Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jonathan LaPook during an interview that ran this morning. 'I'm a dad like everybody else,' the president told LaPook as he recounted the terrifying emergency room visit. In putting front and center the personal cost of inaction, Obama is attempting to galvanize support for his climate change initiatives. 'While most Americans see climate change hitting their communities through extreme weather events – from more severe droughts and wildfires to more powerful hurricanes and record heat waves – there are other threats climate change poses to the American people,' the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new public health campaign. The percentage of Americans with asthma has 'more than doubled' in the last three decades, the fact sheet stated, 'and climate change is putting these individuals and many other vulnerable populations at greater risk of landing in the hospital.' Most at risk for climate change related health problems are children, the elderly, the poor, people who are already sick 'and some communities of color,' the White House said. 'Rising temperatures can lead to more smog, longer allergy seasons, and an increased incidence of extreme-weather-related injuries.' Malia Obama, now 16, is pictured here in 2012 playing tennis, one of her favorite sports. The president said her health scare resulted in a single asthma-related trip to the emergency room but she now lives a full and an active life, inhaler free . At a Washington, D.C. college yesterday, Obama put a finer point on the argument and contended that 'all of our families are going to be vulnerable' to global warming induced health risks because 'you can’t cordon yourself off from air or from climate.' The president said that as part of his administration's effort to engage the public on the topic it would make available data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other government agencies showing the link between rising temperatures and human health. That data will be used by tech companies, including Microsoft and Google, to create applications Americans can use to 'educate and protect' themselves, Obama said. His administration will also convene a White House Climate Change and Health Summit this spring, led by Attorney General Vivek Murthy, that will bring medial professionals and academics together for a discussion on how to reduce the impacts of climate change on the public's health. 'So the bottom line is we all need to do our part,' Obama told participants of a Howard University roundtable focused on the issue yesterday. President Barack Obama, center left, participates in a roundtable discussion on the impacts of climate change on public health with Vivek Murthy, U.S. surgeon general, left, Gina McCarthy, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), second from right, and Charlotte Wallace, sustainability coordinator at Anne Arundel Medical Center, third from right, at Howard University in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday . Obama said 'all of our families are going to be vulnerable' to global warming induced health risks because 'you can’t cordon yourself off from air or from climate.' Murthy said, 'This is a personal issue for me because when I was young one of my favorite uncles...he died from a severe asthma attack' 'Obviously, this administration has been aggressive in using the administrative authorities that we currently' to put a dent in pollution, he continued. By raising fuel efficiency standards and working to reduce carbon emissions,' Obama said. 'But we’ve got a lot more work to do if we’re going to deal with this problem in an effective way and make sure that our families and our kids are safe.' Speaking after Obama, Murthy asserted that hotter weather 'can mean worse air in cities, and more smog and more ozone,' in addition to more wildfire smoke. 'Earlier springs and longer summers mean longer allergy seasons,' he said. 'And more asthma attacks mean more days of school missed. They mean more days of work missed. They mean more costly trips to the doctor. 'And they most importantly mean more scary moments for parents and for children.' Murthy said asthma is a disease that has taken a toll on his family, as well. 'This is a personal issue for me because when I was young one of my favorite uncles -- actually he was very dear to me as a child -- he died from a severe asthma attack,' Murthy explained. 'And it’s also personal to me because I’ve cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath...And the impacts of climate change could make this situation worse.'","Said he can relate to 'fear a parent has when your four-year-old daughter comes up to you and says, ""Daddy, I'm having trouble breathing"" '

"As a young girl, Chelsea Clinton learned to keep secrets. But she also learned to call the Secret Service 'pigs.' That's a claim from former White House florist Ronn Payne, retold in a new book based on interviews with more than 100 members of the presidential mansion's domestic staff. As he walked into the second-floor kitchen one day, he saw Chelsea talking on the phone. A member of her Secret Service protective detail came in behind him to take the Clintons' only child to school. 'Oh, I’ve got to go. The pigs are here,' she told her phone pal, according to Payne – using a 1960s-era epithet for law enforcement. 'Faced with an angry agent who reminded her in no uncertain terms that it was his job to protect her, Chelsea replied: 'Well, that’s what my mother and father call you.' Scroll down for video . 'PIGS': Chelsea Clinton (right, in 1995) allegedly referred to the Secret Service with an offensive counter-culture epithet, and said she learned it from her parents . SHAME: Chelsea (center) accompanied her parents and their dog to the Marine One chopper in 1998, just a day after the president admitted to marital infidelities . Chelsea now shares leadership of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, which wouldn't respond to questions about the 'pigs' episode . While the political world was focused Tuesday on Republican Rand Paul's presidential coming-out party, Politico published an excerpt of 'The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.' The book that could prove problematic for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state. The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation did not respond to a request for comment about whether Payne's recollection is accurate. Chelsea now runs the family philanthropy along with her parents. But that snippet from America's hidden history is just the tip of the iceberg. Skip Allen, a Clinton-era White House 'usher' – a high-ranking butler – said in the book that Bill and Hillary were 'about the most paranoid people I'd ever seen in my life.' 'PITCHED BATTLES': Hillary (left, with the former president in August), once threw a 'heavy' object – believed by staff to have been a table lamp – across the room, Kate Andersen Brower writes in her new book (right) Allen, who served under multiple presidents, told author Kate Anderson Brower that he preferred to work for first families he genuinely liked, rather than pretending he had warm feeligns for his employers. 'But we pretend very well,' he added. Another usher, Chris Emery, found himself uncerimoniously fired for helping former first lady Barbara Bush with technical computer questions. He had taught her how to use a PC during President George H. W. Bush's one term in office. When the Clintons saw a log of his calls, they feared he was leaking their secrets to the Bush clan – something he insists he never did. 'I was out of work for a year,' Emery says in the book. 'They ripped the rug right out from under me. You wonder what they'd do to someone who's really powerful.' At the height of the sex scandal that saw Bill Clinton admitting he frolicked with intern Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office, one White House maid was astonished to find the first couple's marital bed drenched in blood, according to  Brower. Explaining an injury, the president claimed publicly that he had 'hurt himself running into the bathroom door in the middle of the night.' But one White House domestic told Brower that 'we’re pretty sure' Hillary 'clocked him with a book.' DISPUTES: White House domestic employees said they heard Hillary 'clock him with a book' during the Monica Lewinsky scandal . 'There were at least 20 books on the bedside table for his betrayed wife to choose from,” she writes, 'including the Bible.' For at least three months in 1998, according to 'The Residence,' the leader of the free world 'slept on a sofa in a private study attached to their bedroom.' 'Most of the women on the residence staff thought he got what he deserved.' And Brower;s research surfaced White House residence staffers who described how the first couple sometimes got into 'pitched battles' during their eight years in Washington, 'shocking staff with their vicious cursing.' Payne once came upon two butlers listening to a particularly aggressive dispute through a doorway. He heard Mrs Clinton yell: 'g*ddamn b*stard,' he told Brower. Hillary subsequently threw a 'heavy' object at him, in Brower's telling. 'The first lady's temper was notoriously short' during the early months of the scandal, according to the book. When Butler James Hall was serving tea and coffee during a reception for a foreign leader and another employee forgot to clear the china, she snapped . 'You must have been staring into space!' he recalled Mrs. Clinton saying. 'I had to take the prime minister’s wife’s cup. … She was finished and looking for some place to put it.' AFFAIR: Former White House staff revealed their secrets about daily life inside the presidential mansion, including how they knew Bill Clinton and intern Monica Lewinsky (seen together) were sexually involved . HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MR. PRESIDENT: When Jackie Kennedy was away, a White House worker stumbled across her husband, John F. Kennedy (pictured, right, speaking to Marilyn Monroe in 1962), swimming naked in the pool with other women . Hall sais he wasn't asked back to perform his duties for a month. Other presidents figure in Brower's book, including John F. Kennedy. When then-first lady Jackie Kennedy was away at the couple's farm in Virginia, a White House worker apparently stumbled across her husband swimming naked in the mansion's pool. And JFK was not alone: He was apparently joined by several female White House secretaries. Naked women were also sighted on the second floor of the building when Mrs. Kennedy was away. Other revelations in the book include Jimmy Carter's sons' passion for bongs – their rooms were constantly filled with smoke – and their father's 'uncontrollable sobbing' after losing the election. And White House domestic employees told Brower how Lyndon Johnson adored washing in a specially-built, powerful shower, while Nancy Reagan rejected White House chefs' meals and gave them seemingly impossible deadlines.","Stunning tale came from White House domestic help who tended to the Clintons' every need during the 1990s .

"A German former police officer who dismembered a willing victim he met on a website for cannibal fetishists was today sentenced to eight years and six months in prison. Detlef Guenzel chopped Polish-born Wojciech Stempniewicz into small pieces while listening to pop music before burying them in the garden of his home in Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau in 2013. 'He was found guilty of murder and disturbing the peace of the dead,' said presiding judge Birgit Wiegand at the regional court in the eastern city of Dresden. State attorneys had sought 10 and a half years in prison for the defendant, a trim, soft-spoken father of three whom neighbours described as friendly, generous and unfailingly polite. Lawyers representing the family of Stempniewicz, 59, had requested a 15-year sentence, usually the maximum in a murder case. But prosecutors said they stopped short of this demand because Stempniewicz said he wanted to die. Macabre: Former German police officer Detlev Guenzel smirks in court before being sentenced to eight years and six months in jail for killing a willing victim he met on a website for cannibalism fetishists . Deranged: Guenzel, 57, went on trial in August over the killing of Polish-born business consultant Wojciech Stempniewicz whose body he had cut into small pieces and buried them in his garden . The defendant sat impassively with arms folded as the verdict was read out. The men came across each other in October 2013 on a website for slaughter and cannibalism fantasies billed as the '#1 site for exotic meat' and boasting more than 3,000 registered members. The two kept in contact via email, text message and telephone before finally arranging the fatal date for November 4 that year. Gunezel picked Stempniewicz up at Dresden's main railway station and drove him back to his house in Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau which he ran as a bed and breakfast with his male partner. Prosecutors said Gunezel then took his victim to the basement where he strangled him using a rope tied to a pulley before chopping the corpse up into small pieces. A video reportedly shows Guenzel in his underwear slicing the naked body of his victim into pieces while it hangs from a hook. The back garden of Guenzel's home in Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau where the body parts were buried in 2013 . Described as 'absolutely horrific' and 'beyond belief' by lawyers, the 50-minute tape features Guenzel dismembering the corpse while pop music plays. At one point he stops to listen for a heartbeat before continuing. However the defence team argue that the video shows Stempniewicz had his feet in constant contact with the ground, meaning he could have stopped the strangulation if he had wanted to. They claimed the video, which was shown to judges behind closed doors, proves the victim hanged himself. Gunezel then spent a total of four hours cutting the body up with a knife and saw, before burying it in shallow holes the garden. Policemen search for evidences in the area where body parts were found in Reichenau near Dresden in 2013 . Officers traced him via computer messages and telephone calls and he was arrested at the police HQ where he worked as a handwriting specialist. When police arrived at the property he showed them where the pieces were buried, but officers say the victim's penis has never been found. The case mirrors that of Armin Meiwes, a man found guilty of killing, dismembering and eating computer technician Bernd Brandes at his remote farmhouse home near Kassel. Meiwes, now serving life imprisonment, packaged the flesh of his 16-stone victim into neat parcels which he froze and ate portions of over a ten month period. When police finally arrived to arrest him there was less than 40lbs of Brandes remaining.","Detlef Guenzel sliced Polish-born Wojciech Stempniewicz into small pieces .

"The attorney for an Arizona city where 19 firefighters died  while battling a massive woodland blaze says he was told it was an order from the group's supervisor led to their deaths in June 2013. Prescott City Attorney Jon Paladini claims the fire's sole survivor, lookout Brendan McDonough, heard the leader of the Granite Mountain Hotshots order the crew to leave a safe spot where the fire had already burned. Paladini tells the Arizona Republic that he was told the order came just before winds whipped Yarnell Hill into a deadly, all encompassing firestorm. Fatal orders? The Yarnell Hill Fire killed 19 firefighters in 2013, the worst disaster of its kind since 1933. New revelations now claim their deaths came after their supervisor gave orders for the crew to leave a safe zone . But first, Paladini claims McDonough heard crew supervisor Eric Marsh and his top deputy arguing over making the dangerous move. Marsh ordered it, Paladini says, while his deputy Jesse Steed warned against it. Whether or not Paladini's claim is true, neither man is alive to verify it. What's more, Paladini's claim is based on what he says he was told by Darrell Willis, former chief of woodland fires for the city. Paladini says McDonough told Willis about the deadly decision. But neither Willis nor McDonough will verify that account. McDonough told the Arizona Republic when asked about the radio interaction he allegedly heard between Marsh and Steed: 'I think you're being misinformed.' Prescott, Arizona City Attorney Jon Paladini (left) claims that the lone surviving Granite Mountain Hotshot Brendan McDonough overheard an argument between the crew leader and his deputy over the move, which would prove deadly . Former Prescott Fire Division Chief Darrell Willis, seen here speaking during a memorial service honoring the 19 fallen firefighters, says McDonough came to him to get something 'off his shoulders.' Willis won't say what that was, but both he and McDonough have denied it was a recounting of any argument between crew chief Eric Marsh and his deputy Jesse Steed . And when the paper asked Willis about the argument, Willis said: 'That was not part of the detail that I knew — that he told me.' Paladini says that's a departure from what Willis previously told him. Paladini told the Arizona Republic, in part: . 'McDonough allegedly overheard radio traffic between Marsh and Steed... 'Marsh told Steed to leave the 'black,' which was safe... 'Steed protested, saying the move would be dangerous... 'That is what Darrell (Willis) told me,' Paladini said. Despite his claim that Paladini got the facts of their conversation wrong, Willis does not deny speaking to the attorney. Willis says he did so after McDonough came to him because he 'wanted to get something off his shoulders.' Willis, evidently, just isn't saying what that something was. The members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots (pictured) were engulfed by wind-whipped flames on the third day of a lightning-sparked blaze that destroyed scores of homes and charred 8,400 acres in and around the tiny town of Yarnell, northwest of Phoenix . The June 30 disaster marked the greatest loss of life from a U.S. wildfire since 1933, when more than two dozen firefighters were killed battling the Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles . Nonetheless, the Arizona Republic writes, 'when Willis reported the conversation to Paladini and others, it set off a chain reaction of legal actions beginning with reports to the Arizona State Forestry Division, the Prescott City Council and the Arizona Attorney General's Office. It also led authorities to interview other potential witnesses, and prompted an unsuccessful effort to subpoena McDonough.' The purported revelation may change the outcome of a wrongful death suit filed by the families of a dozen on the hotshots last June accusing the state of negligence. It could also change the outcome of suits filed by dozens more area property owners suing the state for alleged mismanagement that led to the destruction of their property. The Forestry Division's liability might be reduced if it turns out Marsh overruled Steed's concerns over moving out of the 'black' safe zone.

"Under pressure: Tony Cocker, the chief executive of E.ON, which has been forced to pay £7.75million to Citizens Advice after the regulator found the energy giant had overcharged customers after price rises . Power giant E.on has been ordered to pay a £7.75million penalty after it ripped off customers who were switching to rivals. The money will go to Citizens Advice to fund the organisation’s work helping those trying to cut their energy bills. E.on effectively overcharged thousands who decided to move to other suppliers after it announced price rises in January 2013 and again in early 2014. Industry rules state that energy companies must give customers 30 days’ notice of any price rise. Once a customer states they intend to move, the firm is not allowed to impose an exit fee or apply the new higher tariff even if the move takes place after the date of the increase. However, industry regulator Ofgem found that E.on broke the rules by hitting tens of thousands of departing customers with a higher tariff in the days before their account was switched. The firm admitted the mistake as far as customers who paid by direct debit or cheque were concerned. However, it failed to notify Ofgem that it also affected people with meters until late in the investigation. It has refunded £8 to £12 to 40,000 customers who paid by cash or cheque and is now trying to find another 7,000 meter customers to pay them an average of £3.42. While the sums involved are relatively low, Ofgem imposed a high penalty because E.on did the same thing in January 2012. At that time, it was ordered to refund £1.4million to customers and pay £300,000 in lieu of a penalty to Age UK. The firm claimed it had implemented new procedures to stop it happening again, but was guilty of the same mistake in both 2013 and 2014. 'Absolutely unacceptable': Regulator Ofgem said the penalty reflected E.ON's 'repeated failings' on billing rules after the company incorrectly imposed exit fees and overcharged customers . Ofgem’s enforcement chief, Sarah Harrison, said: ‘Our rules give customers a chance to avoid exit fees and higher costs when suppliers put up prices. These are important customer protections and it is vital suppliers play by the rules. The energy regulator has imposed fines on energy companies totalling £168 million since 2010. Britain's Big Six energy suppliers are responsible for £99million of the payments, with British Gas the worst offender among them with their figure totalling £34.6million. E.ON has been fined £24.8million in total. The payments are as follows: . November 2012: E.ON agrees to pay out £1.7million to customers and charities after customers were incorrectly charged exit fees or overcharged following price rises. July 2013: The company agrees a £3million package of fines and money for customers after it misreported the number of energy-saving light bulbs it had distributed under an energy efficiency scheme. May 2014: E.ON agrees to pay £12million to vulnerable customers for mis-selling. April 2015: The company agrees to pay £7.75million to Citizens Advice to help vulnerable customers in addition to £400,000 already paid to those affected, after it was found to have overcharged in the wake of price rises. ‘It is important that E.on has repaid potentially affected customers and co-operated with the investigation. However it’s absolutely unacceptable that it failed to provide these vital customer protections yet again and this persistent failure is the reason for the high penalty.’ Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said the ruling should send a warning to other firms. ‘Consumer rights cannot be ignored,’ she said. ‘Customers shouldn’t be trapped in higher bills. With prices up a third since 2010 people must have the freedom to shop around for a better deal. ‘Consumers must be confident that the regulator will take strong action when companies fail so this judgment is welcome news. ‘It is positive that the Ofgem penalty will go towards helping people who are struggling to heat and light their homes.’ E.on apologised and has agreed to fund an independent external audit into what went wrong. A spokesman said: ‘We have been open and transparent about this failure to Ofgem and have agreed to make a payment to Citizens Advice which will be used to support its Energy Best Deal Extra engagement programme, which provides face to face energy advice. ‘E.on is committed to ensuring that no one will lose out financially and is pleased that the payment is going to a worthwhile cause that will provide support to those in need.’","Firm to pay Citizens Advice £7.75m after incorrectly imposing exit fees .

"This is the unfortunate moment a twelve tonne double decker bus broke down - and was pushed to safety by the driver and a group of helpful passengers. The massive bus broke down en route to the Stagecoach depot in Dover, Kent, so the unlucky driver was forced to ask passengers, colleagues and locals to give him a helping hand.

"More people in Britain back fracking than are opposed to it, a Greenpeace survey has found. Some 42 per cent of those polled said they supported shale gas extraction, while 35 per cent disagreed with using the controversial technique. The anti-fracking environmental campaign group was accused of trying to bury the inconvenient survey result. More people in Britain back fracking than are opposed to it, a Greenpeace survey has found . The finding – hidden in a footnote to a Greenpeace press release – shows greater backing for the shale gas industry than other recent polls. Only 24 per cent of people said they supported fracking in a Department of Energy and Climate Change public attitudes survey published in February. A similar poll by YouGov in January put approval for extracting shale gas at 35 per cent and opposition at 41 per cent. The Greenpeace survey, carried out by ComRes, found greatest support among men (56 per cent) and the over-65s (58 per cent). By contrast only 29 per cent of women backed fracking. The finding – hidden in a footnote to a Greenpeace press release – shows greater backing for the shale gas industry than other recent polls. Above, a drilling site in Balcombe, West Sussex . Greenpeace activists 'frack' David Cameron's countryside home last year. Above, a man puts up a sign on green barriers . Over 2,000 people marched and surrounded a drill rig by forming a human chain in West Sussex in 2013 . Other results of the study suggest the issue could help to swing the result in marginal constituencies at next month's General Election, the campaign group claimed. Nearly a third of people would be less likely to vote for a candidate who supports fracking in their area, the polling found. Only 13 per cent would be more inclined to support them, although 44 per cent said it would have no impact on how they cast their vote. At least 35 of the seats being targeted in the Tories' election strategy are in areas licensed for fracking, as are 11 Labour and eight Lib Dem seats held with a swing of two per cent or less. One in ten Conservative voters, nearly a quarter of Lib-Dem supporters and a fifth of Labour backers said they were 'much less likely' to vote for a candidate in favour of fracking in their constituency. More than 800 people standing to be MPs next month have signed a pledge declaring their opposition to shale gas organised by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. Environmental activists locked themselves together at the main entrance to the Cuadrilla exploratory drilling site in Balcombe . A camp in Balcombe was set up to protest against plans to drill  for methane gas on a site just outside the village . They include 100 Labour candidates, 105 Lib Dems, 403 Greens, 23 Plaid Cymru, seven SNP and seven Ukip candidates. No Conservatives have added their names so far. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a method of extracting natural gas from rock deep underground by blasting it with a mixture of water, sand and chemicals. The industry claims it is a safe way of solving the energy crisis and produces fewer greenhouse gases than other fuel-production methods. But campaigners claim the technique poisons water supplies, industrialises the countryside and increases the risk of earthquakes. Ken Cronin, chief executive of fracking industry body UK Onshore Oil and Gas, said: 'This poll – ironically commissioned by people who oppose fracking – shows that when presented with the real facts about the safety and low environmental impact of shale gas operations, British people will support onshore oil and gas exploration. 'The poll also shows that 57 per cent people say that a candidate's support for fracking either makes them more likely to vote in their favour or no difference. Greenpeace's own facts simply do not support their rhetoric on fracking.' A Greenpeace spokesman said: 'It's odd for the fracking industry to be welcoming these latest figures. Compared to a similar survey from a year ago, public support for fracking has actually fallen. 'Even Tory voters say they are more likely to vote for a candidate opposing fracking in their constituencies than for someone who's in favour of it. 'The government and the fracking lobby have thrown the kitchen sink at propping up dwindling public backing for this risky industry, and they have very little to show for it.'","42 per cent of those polled said they support shale gas extraction .

"These rusting 'ghost' ships are the last remnants of what was once the United States' National Defense Reserve Fleet, set to protect and serve in the hour of need. The NDRF was set up in the wake of the Second World War, and at its peak in the 1950s, the fleet consisted of nearly 2,280 ships moored across the United States. But as the need for the fleet has diminished, so has the number of vessels, and today, just over 120 ships remain, posing a risk to the environment in the bays where they are moored. Scroll down for video . Ghost ships: A number of the remaining ships in the United States' National Defense Reserve Fleet lay moored in James River, Virginia . Helping hand: The United States' National Defense Reserve Fleet was set up after the Second World War in 1945, in order to provide back-up in case of war or national emergencies . Diminished: At its height in 1950, the NDRF consisted of 2,277 ships, reduced to 230 by 2007, and 122 in April last year . The ships, jokily known as the 'Mothball Fleet', is so rarely used that many of the ships are falling apart, creating naval graveyards rather than emergency fleets. At its height in 1950, the NDRF consisted of 2,277 ships at eight anchorage sites: James River, Virginia; Beaumont, Texas; Suisun Bay, California; Stony Point, New York; Wilmington, North Carolina; Mobile, Alabama; Astoria, Oregon; and Olympia, Washington. Out of these eight, only James River, Beaumont and Suisun Bay exist today. Long years of neglect and disuse have turned these ships into near wrecks, with flaking paint polluting the waters with heavy metals and hazardous chemicals. The worst affected is the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, where less than 50 ships remain. At its peak, in 1952, the bay had 340 ships anchored. Today, less than 50 ships remain, slowly polluting the bay, which is a critical environmental area for fish and wildlife. The federal Maritime Administration has pledged to dismantle the fleet at Suisun Bay, with 25 ships in the worst condition taken out within two years and the remainder to be scrapped by the end of 2017.

The federal Maritime Administration has pledged to dismantle the fleet at Suisun Bay, with 25 ships in the worst condition taken out within two years and the remainder to be scrapped by the end of 2017 . The NDRF was established to serve as a reserve of mainly merchant vessels to be activated for national defense and national emergency purposes. The vessels can be activated within 20 days to four months, in order to provide shipping during national emergencies, either military or non-military, such as commercial shipping crises. Throughout its first thirty years, the National Defense Reserve Fleet vessels were activated to help transporting coal and grains in times of shortage, and ships were brought in during the Korean War, the 1961 Berlin crisis and the Vietnam War. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, the National Defense Reserve Fleet was augmented by the Ready Reserve Fleet (RFF) to provide for military emergencies. Since then, ships have been activated to support U.S. troops and transport cargo in the Gulf War in 1990 and aided in several humanitarian disasters in the new millennium. In 2005, four National Defense Reserve Fleet ships were used for relief operations in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and five years later, six were used in the wake of the devastating earthquake  in Haiti. Its most recent operation took place in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, when two National Defense Reserve Fleet training vessels were called in. As of April 30, 2014, only 122 vessels are left in the NDRF, and their numbers are reducing still.

"Reptile: The 6ft-long albino northern pine snake was found curled up on top of a bath mat on a radiator . A teenage girl was shocked to discover a huge albino snake curled up on top of the radiator in her bathroom. Hannah Brierley, 16, thought her mother was playing a prank when she spotted the six foot-long northern pine snake on a bath mat which was hung up to dry at her home in Rochdale, Manchester. She stared at the reptile for a few minutes until it moved and quickly called for her 40-year-old mother, Karen Marriott, to come upstairs. Mrs Marriott attempted to call the RSCPA at 7am yesterday morning but after she was unable to get through she panicked and dialled 999. She said: 'Hannah was calm at first. She can't even deal with spiders, but I don't think she thought it was real. 'She'd been looking at it for a few minutes until it moved. She thought I was having a joke. 'I felt like a wally dialling 999 but I didn't know what to do. I'm frightened because I don't know how it got in. 'It was like something out of a film. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Everybody needed a wee, but we couldn't go.' Craig Wallace, a detective based at Rochdale police station, overheard the control room call and although it's not a police matter, he offered to help as he has experience with keeping snakes. Det Con Wallace used a pillowcase to capture the white snake and took it back to the station, before being transferred into the care of the RSPCA. The officer added: 'I keep snakes so I know a lot about them. It was a northern pine snake. They can give a nasty bite, but they're not venomous. 'If it did bite you, you would struggle to get it off. I put my hand through a pillow slip then got the back of it's head and wrapped it up.' He believes the reptile may be a family pet which has either escaped or been set free and slithered into the house on during the recent warm weather. Scroll down for video .

He added: 'I wanted to keep it as a station pet, but no-one would sit near me.' The RSPCA later attended Rochdale police station and the snake is now being cared for by the animal charity. Escape: The officer believes the snake may be a family pet that has escaped or been discarded and could have got into the house through an open door or window in the recent warm weather . A regular pine snake, of which the northern pine is a subspecies, in the wild. They vary in colouring . The northern pine snake, or pituophis melanoleucus - a subspecies of the common pine snake - are endemic to south eastern states in the United States, including Alabama and Kentucky. In the wild, colours can vary from to deep-brick to a wine red. Captive varieties tend to be amelanistic or 'albino', which are descendants of a specimen hatched from a wild-collected clutch of eggs. The find occurred near the eastern edge of the Pine Barrens in Ocean County, New Jersey, in the early to mid-1980s. They generally prefer to live in areas with pine flatwoods, sandy pine-oak woodlands or cultivated fields. Pine snakes are carnivorous animals and mainly feed on mice, rats, moles and other small animals. Captive-bred specimens docile behaviour makes them perfect pets and their voracious appetite and rapid growth are some of the reasons for their popularity. Most hatchlings, which are around 12 to 16 inches, will feed immediately and though they may strike and hiss at first, with frequent handling they usually calm down. Adults, which grow between 4ft and 6ft, can be more difficult to calm down if the animal was not handled frequently as a hatchling or juvenile.","Hannah Brierley, 16, initially thought 6ft-long snake was a prank by mother .

"Over the past couple of weeks it hasn't just been Zayn Malik's departure from One Direction that has been making the headlines, it's been his personal life too. For Zayn's relationship with Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards as come under scrutiny as the 22-year-old was once again accused of cheating on his fiance. At the weekend Swedish model Martina Olsson claimed that she had slept with Zayn while he was holidaying in Thailand recently. Scroll down for video . Zayn and Perrie pictured in happier times, the young couple have this week jetted off on what was thought to be a make or break holiday following accusations of him cheating . The 24-year-old told The Sun On Sunday's James Beale: 'Perrie should not stay with Zayn any longer because he has cheated on her and continues to lie about it. It is not the first time either, so maybe she will walk away.' And Martina is right, this isn't the first time Zayn has been accused of cheating. In fact, the pair's union could be compared to that of Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Ashley Cole. The similarities are certainly there. Like Cheryl and Ashley both Zayn and Perrie, 21, have enjoyed a huge amount of fame. And like Cheryl and Ashley their romance has been dogged with cheating allegations, almost from the start. Cheryl and Ashley were happily married until she discovered that he had cheated on her on several occasions . The X Factor alumni twosome first got together in August 2011 but by August 2012 it was being reported that Zayn had been filmed through the keyhole of a hotel room with another woman. Then in February 2013 the couple were hit by a kiss and tell when Australian waitress Courtney Webb told The Sun newspaper than she had bedded the then 20-year-old. Courtney - who took photos of Zayn while he was asleep - said at the time: 'He's an absolute s**t. How dare he - not only to me but to Perrie?' She also added: 'I definitely don't think it's the first time he's done this. I feel sorry for Perrie - she doesn't know this is going on. It's wrong and it has to stop.' Then at the beginning of March Zayn was pictured with his arm around a girl named Lauren Richardson in Thailand, a second shot showed the pair holding hands. Zayn has been accused of cheating on four occasions, the first was by Courtney Webb (left), the most recent was Swedish model Martina Olsson . When Courtney claimed she had bedded Zayn she claimed took these photographs of him apparently sleeping in her bed . After this picture of Zayn with Lauren Richardson was released he Tweeted saying that he loved Perrie . This photograph enraged One Direction fans as it appears that Zayn is holding Lauren's hand in the picture . That was, in fact, the only time that Zayn, who left One Direction last week after five years in the band, has made any comment on the stories of his betrayal. He took to Twitter to say: 'I'm 22 years old... I love a girl named Perrie Edwards. And there's a lot of jealous f*** in this world I'm sorry for what it looks like x' But just a week or so later Martina's claims came out. She alleged that Zayn had asked her to share a shower with him before taking her to the bedroom of the apartment where he was staying. For Cheryl, who is now re-married, the cheating rumours eventually became too much and she ended her marriage to Ashley in 2010. At the time the footballer had been accused of cheating her two years. The first was hairdresser Aimee Walton who claimed to have slept with him. By February 2010, just a month before Cheryl announced their split, four more women had come forward to say the same. Zayn and Perrie got engaged in 2013 but he has since been accused of cheating on her on several occasions . Tracey Cox says that Zayn's level of fame will be difficult for someone so young . But Perrie, who accepted Zayn's marriage proposal in August 2013,  is currently sticking by her man - who has yet to comment on the latest allegations. She and Zayn were pictured boarding a private jet earlier this week and are thought to be on a 'make or break' holiday. For the most part though, despite the on-going accusations of infidelity, Zayn has remained relatively high in public favour - unlike Ashley. We spoke to relationship expert Tracey Cox who told us that this could be because he is younger. She said: 'I think at this point the public are more lenient on him because he is a young guy in a boy band rather than a footballer, who are known for excessive behaviour and thinking the rules don't apply to them. 'But the main difference between his behaviour and that of Ashley Cole is that he's young. 'His fame might seem appealing but the reality of coping with that much money and fame at such a young age is going to have consequences. 'Of course, he's going to make some mistakes along the way. I believe him when he says he's stressed. Will Perrie and Zayn's relationship ended up like Cheryl and Ashley's? Tracey continued: 'Ashley is older and, as an adult, should have the maturity to go beyond instant gratification to be able to think through the consequences. 'The other difference of course is that Ashley was married to Cheryl while Zayn is dating. There's a different level of commitment there. 'But, even having said all that, I would join others in cautioning Perrie about trusting him again. 'The evidence appears clear that some type of infidelity is happening on a regular basis and by taking him back after each incident, Perrie is effectively saying it's OK to cheat.' MailOnline has contacted Zayn's representative for comment.","Zayn and Perrie's relationship has been dogged with cheating rumours .

"The world’s leading gold mining company has paid compensation to 11 women in remote Papua New Guinea after they were raped by the firm’s security guards and police, it was revealed today. The US-based Barrick Gold, which boasts that it is the world’s leading gold mining company, reached the out-of-court settlement when the women threatened to file a lawsuit in the US. One of the women was just a 14-year-old girl attending school in the northern Enga province when she was raped in 2010, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported today. An American gold mining company has paid what is beleived to be a six-figure compensation to 11 women after they were raped by the firm’s security guards and police patrolling Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea . She and her classmates had made string bags for police officers who had been moved into the area to increase security around the company’s Porgera gold mine. Several police officers offered to pay her for her bags and offered to take her to an ATM to draw out the money. But she was taken, instead, to the mine site where she claims one of the armed policemen raped her. Barrick Gold, which boasts that it is the world’s leading gold mining company, reached the out-of-court settlement when the women threatened to file a lawsuit in the US . She told the ABC’s Pacific Beat programme before the settlement was reached that as a result of the rape ‘I am now suffering - I would have been somebody if I completed my education. ‘I was the best student in my class. Because of the rape my future is ruined.’ A second woman, identified as Jane Doe 4, has revealed how she was collecting firewood when she was surrounded by security guards from the mine. Victims include a 14-year-old schoolgirl who was raped by police patrolling mine in 2010 . ‘They hit me. They pushed me and I fell on some of the sharp rocks. ‘Two of the guards, they took turns in raping me. I suffered very badly.’ The ABC said allegations of brutality had surrounded the mine even before Barrick Gold took it over in 2006. In 2011 the allegations were exposed when a Human Rights Watch report documented six alleges cases of gang rape by the mine’s security guards. Responding to the report, Barrick set up a ‘remedial framework’ to provide compensation to victims of brutality and more than 130 women accepted payments of around $10,000, as long as they agreed not to take any future legal action. But 11 women rejected the offer as being grossly inadequate and planned a lawsuit in Nevada, where Barrick Gold has a number of mining operations. Now, after mediation, the mining company and the women have reached a confidential settlement and are said by Earth Rights International to be ‘pleased with the results they are getting at this point.’ In a joint statement between Barrick Gold and Earth Rights International, it was announced that ‘the women will receive compensation under the Porgera remedy framework and a payment in connection with their participation in the mediation process.’","Barrick Gold reached an out-of-court settlement with the 11 rape victims .

"John Mayer, Russell Brand - there are certain types of men women know are bad bets but fall for anyway and even bright women like Katy Perry and Jennifer Aniston aren't immune. But while no one's perfect and some troubled souls are worth saving, others are just trouble. All of the behavioural traits below are danger signs, offering six crucial clues to spot the dysfunctional people most likely to break your heart. Scroll down for video . Tracey Cox provides advice on whether he loves you or will break your heart . 1. How 'in touch' with themselves are they? Are they aware of their character and personality faults? Do they know their strengths? They don't have to have spent the last decade on a therapist's couch to have done some soul-searching. Have they sorted out the emotional baggage from childhood and past relationships or are they trailing it along behind them? Find out: Ask questions. What are your family like? Are you close to them? Are you friends with your exes? Why did you split up? Did it hurt? How do you stay positive? 2. Are they affectionate and able to express their feelings? Yes, yes, we all know men like to disappear into their caves. But the person who knows what they're feeling and shares their feelings with you is going to be a lot easier to share a bathroom with than the person who locks themselves in it. Find out: Ask them anything to see if they will open up. You seem a bit distant tonight, anything bothering you? Do they grab your arm, kiss you spontaneously, say nice things – or does hugging them feel like you're cuddling an ironing board? 3. Are they honest? Are they a 'good' person? Can you count on them to do the right thing by you and others? Do they treat their friends and family well? Do the right thing in business? Whatever your partner does to other people, they're more than capable of doing to you. Find out: Do they have lots of friends, or have much contact with their family? Are they generally popular, or do people seem a little distrustful of them and stand-offish? Are they well liked at work? 4. Are they an adult? Sounds like a stupid question but some people simply don't grow up. Does this person know how to cook, clean, look after themselves, pay bills on time and manage their money? Are they mature enough to know they can't afford a Lamborghini when they're barely covering the rent? Tracey says that if he doesn't like himself then it will be difficult to form a happy relationship . Find out: Does their home look like a bomb's hit it? Is there lots of unopened mail (unpaid bills) stacked up on the side? Do they seem to be living beyond their means for the job they have? Do they ever ask you to lend them cash or bail them out? 5. Do they like themselves? The more they like who they are, the healthier your relationship will be. The more hang-ups they have, the more you'll be used as their therapist. Find out: Do all your conversations centre around them? Do you spend a great deal of time solving their problems and boosting their self-confidence? Do you feel exhausted after you've seen them? 6. Are they positive and happy most of the time? Do they look for problems or solutions? Are they a doer or a procrastinator? I once went out with a guy who was constantly depressed because of all the starving children in the world. He thought he was holier-than-thou because they were never far from his mind. I thought he was a hypocritical son of a b****. His permanent hangdog expression didn't help one iota – but a big fat cheque from his very healthy bank account might have. Find out: If they're unhappy or depressed, do they have a good reason for it? Do they often seem overwhelmed by life itself? Are they moody – up one minute, down the next?

"A puppy tends to be a beloved addition to any family, but for a family supporting a child with autism an Assistance Dog can make a crucial difference to their happiness and stability. April 2 is Autism Awareness Day and Autism Assistance Dogs are a little known but hugely beneficial form of 'animal therapy'. It turns out man's best friend are actually 'kid's best friend', with pups changing the lives of many children with autism who may otherwise struggle to talk, communicate, walk or socialise. An 'Autism Assistance Dog' is used to keep a child with autism safe and are an incredible tool to help them develop social skills and positive relationships. The term 'Autism Spectrum Disorders' (ASD) is an umbrella term that includes Autistic disorder; Asperger's and Atypical Autism. April 2 is Autism Awareness Day and people may be oblivious that man's best friend are actually 'kid's best friend', with pups changing the lives of many children with autism (stock picture) Children with autism often have difficulty with social interactions and their verbal and non-verbal communication skills may be badly affected. They can struggle to cope with change and unfamiliar environments and routines. 'The Autism Assistance Dog (AAD) Program is designed to improve the quality of life for both the child with autism and his or her family through three key areas: safety, independence and inclusion,' according to GuideDogs SA. Every child is unique meaning matching the right dog to their need's and their family is crucial. The dog can provide companionship for the child, as well as social and emotional support for the parent to bring joy and 'brightness' to the household. It has been reported by families participating in the Austism Assistance Dog Program that the companion can also foster positive interactions between siblings, encouraging play. The highly trained, specialised working dogs are licenced to accompany the child in essentially any location. 'An Austism Assistance Dog (AAD) has the same legal rights of access as a Guide or Hearing Dog. It is clearly identified by a coat which has securing points and a handle that the child can hold if appropriate or required,' according to GuideDogs SA. 'The purpose of the coat is to bring awareness to the special circumstances regarding the dog. This also increases the ease of access to public places by differentiating the status of an AAD from that of a pet.' The dog can provide companionship for the child, as well as social and emotional support for the parent to bring joy and 'brightness' to the household (stock picture) It can make family outings or even a quick trip to the shops possible where a child with autism may have struggled before. It can also give parents peace of mind as they know their child is being looked out for by a dog which has been specially trained to help their master avoid harm's way. The comfort of having their furry pooch by their side can offer a sense of stability for the child and be a calming presence on all members of the family. Children with autism 'have a high tendency to 'bolt' when they feel anxious or stressed. This is made even more alarming as they are often far less aware of danger and may not respond to direction. This can be a great challenge, requiring constant observance from their carer to ensure the child remains safe. 'On outings, the child's safety is enhanced by being connected to a coat on the dog's body, through a safety belt around the child's waist,' explained Guide Dogs SA. 'The parent has control of the dog through their own lead and will apply vocal commands to the dog. The child is encouraged to walk beside the dog but if they do choose to run off on their own, the dog is specially trained to quickly and calmly take control of the situation. 'The dog is trained to resist by sitting or lying down, acting as an ""anchor"",' GuideDogs SA explains. 'This gives the parent time to intervene and diffuse the situation.' However, the importance of this lesson is that, through the repetition, children's attempts to bolt are often reduced or completely eradicated. 'These dogs are a friend when you need one any hour of the day, every day of the year. 'They are also skilled for a few select tasks if you happen to need a hand… or a paw!'","Assistance Dogs are a little known but crucial tool for children with autism .

"The hunt for proof of the Loch Ness monster's existence may be over - and it doesn't lie in a blurry photograph. Fossils of a creature bearing a 'striking' similarity to depictions of Nessie have been found in a 19th century collection. Originally belonging to Cromarty writer and geologist, Hugh Miller, the specimens now sit in Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. Scroll down for video . Vital clue? Scientists have revealed that the rediscovered fossil dubbed 'Pessie' (pictured) may have lived at the bottom of the freshwater lakes that would later become Loch Ness . The intriguing fossils were rediscovered when the president of the Official Loch Ness Fan Club, Gary Campbell, was invited to the museum and spotted them. He saw the resemblance and called for scientists to investigate the ancient creature. As part of research for the upcoming Inverness Science Festival, museum and festival teams went hunting for the origins of the fossil, belonging to a species known as Pterichthyoides milleri - or 'Pessie' as it has been christened. Now researchers have revealed that 'Pessie' may have lived at the bottom of the lakes that would later become Loch Ness. The fish ancestor roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago. The creatures were some of the earliest known vertebrates to possess jaws, though they had grinding plates rather than teeth. Great-great grandma? Pterichthyoides milleri (illustration pictured) roamed Earth's freshwater lakes during the Paleozoic Era, between 542 million and 251 million years ago . The  name 'Pterichthyodes' refers to the creatures' odd wing-like appendages - 'pterichthys' coming from the Ancient Greek for 'wing-fish'. It is believed that the 'wings' led to the pectoral fins seen in modern fish. Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum said: 'If you think of the picture that most people have in their heads of the Loch Ness Monster, our fossils pretty much meet what they would expect. 'Pterichthyoides milleri lived at the bottom of freshwater lochs and had flippers to help it move around. 'Its head and back were covered in an armoured shell, showing that it was well-protected from predator attacks; ready for anything.' In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app. The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is ‘likely’ to be the elusive beast. Elusive: A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch . During preparation work for the Festival, Dr Evelyn Gray, an orthopaedic researcher and imaging specialist who is part of the Science Festival team worked with Cait on the history of 'Pessie'. The investigations were undertaken as part of research into possible scientific explanations for the origins of the Loch Ness Monster . 'It became clear that what we have here could be Nessie's great granny,' explained Dr Gray. 'It fits all the criteria that people around the world associate with lake monsters, albeit a little smaller than popular images would suggest. 'However, if we assume that this form of Nessie would evolve in a normal fashion, then we can project how biological changes over the millennia might make it similar to the larger Nessie we think of today'. Tantalising: Many hunters have claimed to have spotted the elusive Loch ness beast - such this photo of its 'head taken in November 2014 - but concrete evidence has been lacking until now . Gary Campbell, President of the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club said: 'This is fantastic news for all Nessie fans. 'We always said that the first sighting of the monster was by St Columba 1450 years ago - now we can say her family has been living in the area for 360 million years.' 'For the first time, visitors to Loch Ness can be guaranteed to see a real Nessie, notwithstanding that it's one that's a few years older than her relative that lives in the loch today. 'No one is sure of what Nessie actually is and the popular view is that she's some sort of dinosaur - maybe she's actually Pessie after all' 'Pessie' is available to view in the museum in Inverness but visitors will have the chance to actually hold her during a lecture on the origins of the Loch Ness Monster on 7th May 2015. An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com . Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathan's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.' Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged.

"The stray dog was hit by a car, clubbed in the head and left for dead in a ditch in Washington state. Days later, the one-year-old bully breed mix showed up sickly and covered in dirt at a nearby farm. Now, the dog that defied death is recovering with the help of good Samaritans and veterinarians at Washington State University. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Ryann Simmons sits with the dog his girlfriend is fostering at their home in Moses Lake, Wash. The dog, Theia, survived being run over, beaten with a hammer and buried, and now needs surgery . Heroic: Theia, a 1-year-old bully breed mix was hit by a car and then struck in the head with a hammer and buried, but she managed to dig herself out . Hanging on: A driver hit the dog with a car -- and that person proceeded to strike the dog. The dog appeared to be hit with hammer in a mercy killing. The dog used to roam the streets getting scraps of food from people in Moses Lake, a farm town about 100 miles west of Spokane. About a month ago, she was struck by a car. Then things got worse: Someone cracked her in the head with a hammer and placed her in a box in a farm field. But the dog somehow survived and was discovered at a nearby farm with a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity. The wounds helped veterinarians piece together what happened, including the hammer blow. 'I'm assuming that the person who did this meant to put her out of her misery,' said Sara Mellado, who learned about the dog's plight on Facebook and took the animal into her Moses Lake home. She named the dog Theia. Recover: Theia is scheduled to go into surgery in a few weeks time after raising money through crowdfunding . New lease of life: Theia, who truly rose from the grave, rarely stops wagging her tail . Back on all fours! Theia's injuries include a dislocated jaw and multiple bone fractures around her nasal cavity, which makes it difficult for her to eat and breathe but it looks as though she is truly on the mend . 'Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,' Mellado told The Associated Press. 'She's a true miracle dog, and she deserves a good life.' Theia is receiving care at WSU's Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Pullman. A CT scan of her skull revealed a condition that constricts the nasal passages, restricting air flow into the lungs, said veterinary resident Andrea Sundholm, who's assisting with Theia's treatment. It was caused by multiple nasal bone fractures. When Theia tries to draw air in through her nose, she's forced to open her mouth to breathe instead. But with a dislocated jaw, that is challenging as well. Theia's jaw is healing on its own, but the nasal-bone fractures have caused lasting problems, Sundholm said. Fixing that will require surgery to insert a stent, she said. Help out: Mellado has raised more than $12,000 towards the dog's surgery using the crowdfunding website GoFundMe. So far, contributions have come from Moses Lake, Washington State University and elsewhere . Ouch! X-rays of Theia's skull show the damage that was caused by everything she went through . The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund awarded $700 to help pay for Theia's early treatment. Mellado has raised another $10,000 for the surgery through a crowdfunding website, and is planning to call WSU to schedule the procedure. The university said despite her injuries, Theia is friendly and likes to kiss people's cheeks. Mellado said she has been deluged with calls from people seeking to help. Theia is staying with Mellado's family until they find her a permanent home. 'She's a puppy,' Mellado said. 'She's outgoing, lovable, up for meeting new people.'","A beloved dog was believed to be killed by a driver, but days later, she showed up .

"Eating fast food after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements, a study has claimed. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ‘fuel’ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn’t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. ‘These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,’ the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.","University of Montana student studied recoveries after a workout .

"Apple offers a range of ways to unlock its devices from PINs to passwords and fingerprints. But you could soon use a selfie to gain access to your apps and messages thanks to Apple's latest patent. The filing details a system of scanning a user's face with the front-facing camera when the handset is moved into a certain position, and automatically unlocking the device if the image matches one on file. The patent (illustrated) was filed by the California-based firm in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. It details a method of scanning a user's face using the front-facing camera each time the phone is moved into a certain position. If the scanned face matches a previously taken photo, the phone unlocks automatically . The patent was filed by the Californian tech giant in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. Called 'Locking and unlocking a mobile device using facial recognition', the patent explains that current methods of unlocking a device are 'inconvenient and time consuming'. Apple's patent details a method for automatically unlocking a mobile device using a system comprising of 'capturing an initial image  while the device is locked, monitoring a motion state of the mobile device to determine whether the device is moving or is motionless;  analysing the images to detect a user's face and unlocking the device.' Android Lollipop users already have an almost identical feature known as Trusted face in the Smart Lock menu. It is an extension of Face Unlock that launched on Android Ice Cream Sandwich. Once the screen is enabled and the camera is held in front of the face, the screen automatically unlocks. This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen. By comparison it appears that Apple's proposed system would track the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table.

It will only unlock if the angle of the face matches, or is similar to, the one that was initially taken to avoid the phone unlocking simply when the phone is near a face. As Apple explained: 'In one embodiment, the image is analysed for a facial profile of a human face, without regard to a specific user. Apple's proposed system tracks the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table (flow chart shown). The screen wouldn't need to be enabled. Instead, once the phone is moved and positioned in front of the face the camera would begin scanning for a face . Android Lollipop users already have an almost identical feature known as 'Trusted face' (left) in the Smart Lock menu. Once the screen is enabled and the camera is held in front of the face, the screen automatically unlocks. The face icon between the Whatsapp and Chrome logo (right) shows the feature is enabled . 'In this case, the device will only need to determine that a human facial profile is present.' It continued that once an allotted period of time has elapsed and a user's face is not detected in any of the images, the device stays locked. 'In another embodiment, detecting the user's face may also include verifying that the user is an authorised user of the device,' the files continued. 'Trusted face' and Smart Lock are extensions of the Face Unlock feature that was launched on Android Ice Cream Sandwich (pictured). This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen . 'The predetermined facial profile may be determined from an image that was previously captured by the device's camera and stored in a storage of images of authorised users.' Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology. It uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges, sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch ID sensors seen on the likes of Apple and Samsung devices. This not only makes it more accurate than other sensors, but it will also work even if the user’s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it, for example. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with. The patent also suggests this feature could be used by multiple users, in the way that multiple fingerprints can be added to its current Touch ID system. 'In this case, the database of images of authorised users would contain an image for each  user,' it added. 'To match a facial profile in the subsequent image, the device would have to compare the subsequent image to each image in the database. 'Furthermore, each authorised user may have an associated unlocking profile in the database that indicates what functions or applications of the device are enabled when the device is unlocked.' Phone makers are looking for alternative ways to secure devices while making them faster and more convenient to open. For example, Fujitsu recently demonstrated its iris scanning prototype that lets people access phones, apps and online accounts by staring at an infrared sensor. This would work in a similar way to facial recognition, but is more secure and unique to an individual user.

Miss Lubamba was wanted by Italian authorities for some time but they were unable to trace her until she reported some luggage stolen from a car in Milan last July. They rang her claiming that her baggage had been found and she was arrested when she came to the police station, according to Corriere della Sera. On Thursday she was tearful as Francis knelt to pour water over her feet before drying them with a cloth, and planting a kiss on one foot. According to the Gospel of John, Jesus washed his apostles' feet at the Last Supper (13: 2-17).

In what has become an annual Maundy Thursday tradition, Francis washed the feet of 12 prisoners detained at Rome's Rebibbia prison, including a transsexual . The Catholic church has imposed a ban on 'salutes' paying respect to mafia bosses during Easter Sunday's religious processions. In many Catholic countries, floats bearing statues of religious icons are carried round villages during Holy Week. In the south of Italy, the mafia exhibit their power through the approval of bishops and priests which allow them to gain influence and portray their members as close to the church. Last year processions were suspended in several southern towns after religious parade of worshippers bearing a statue of the Madonna in the town of Oppido Mamertina stopped to perform a 'bow' of homage at the house of a mafia godfather serving life imprisonment under house arrest for murder. Pope Francis has said that mafiosi are 'excommunicated' from the Church, and has called on them to convert or else go to hell. He ordered priests to be bolder in openly condemning the mob. One of Italy's southern bishops have issued a decree that those chosen to carry a statue of the Madonna 'should be chosen, under the direct responsibility of the parish, from among the faithful who regularly go to Sunday Mass and who are of proven Christian faith'. Bishop Francesco Milito, who presides over Oppido Mamertina, among other mafia-afflicted towns, said that the route taken by the appointed bearers must be vetted adding. 'We are determined to claim back, and indeed purify, this form of popular devotion, which is particularly connected to Holy Week.' Bishop Luigi Renzo, of the nearby diocese of Mileto-Tropea-Nicotera, said there needed to be 'definitive signs of a break with certain improper events of the past'. Icons and religious relics should only be carried by 'those known in the parish who are truly committed to walking the path of faith'. Anyone 'who is on trial for mafia association or who has a conviction' is automatically banned, unless they have publicly repented and expressed regret'. Mafia prosecutors have warned that Francis' life could be at risk from criminal organisations who are troubled by his clean up of corruption in the Curia and reform of the Vatican bank.","Pope is presiding over torchlight procession in front of the Colosseum .

"Archaeologists have discovered a previously unknown stretch of the Great Wall of China in the northwestern of the country, thought to date back more than 2,000 years. Experts say the new 6.2 mile-stretch (10 kilometres) means the full range of the Qin Dynasty Great Wall can be traced for the first time. Nine sections of the Wall have been found over the last two months along the inner coast of the Yellow River in Gansu province and the Ningxia region, reported the People's Daily online. Still standing: New sections of the Great Wall discovered by a team of experts in northwestern China . Historic: This stretch, measuring more than 6 miles long, is thought to date back more than 2,000 years . Remote: The ruins range along the inner coast of the Yellow River in Gansu province and the Ningxia region . The new stretch, ranging between Jingyuan County and Nanchangtan village, was discovered by a team led by Zhou Xinghua, renowned Great Wall researcher and the former head of Ningxia Museum. Historical documents had suggested that the Emperor Qin ordered for the Great Wall to start in Gansu province and run east into the Ningxia region and Inner Mongolia, but physical evidence in this particular area has never been found until now. Mr Zhou said China's first emperor ordered for the stretch to be built along the Yellow River to stop invaders crossing it when it was frozen. While parts of the Great Wall date back to about 700 BC, the first complete Wall was built during the reign of China's first emperor, Qin Shihuang, from about 220 BC after the country had been unified for the first time. The newly discovered section of the wall was constructed using stones and rammed earth, with some parts built on top of the mountain ranges and others running along valleys. Some of the ruins are only three feet high due to natural degradation, but originally the wall could have been as tall as 20 feet. Other sections: Archive photos of the Qin Dynasty Great Wall which is thought to be built around 215 AD . Landmark: A monument is placed near the ruins of the Qin Dynasty Great Wall, which was built by the first emperor to have unified China . There are no surviving records of the exact length of the Qin Wall, and much of the original wall has eroded away leaving few sections behind. The Great Wall is actually made up of many different structures built across northern China and southern Mongolia over a number of dynasties. The best known and most visible section today is the Ming Wall, constructed from 1368 to 1644. The formidable fortress covers approximately 5,500 miles from the Jiayu Pass in Gansu province and the Shanhai Pass in Hebei province. However, it was revealed in 2012 that the Wall is actually 13,170 miles  long – more than double the previous estimate. A Chinese university is spending nearly £450,000 on building their very own Great Wall of China. Wuhan Institute of Bioengineering is currently constructing the replica as a patriotic educational tool that will also get students doing more exercise, according to the People's Daily Online. The 'Campus Great Wall' will act as a walkway that connects the university's two sites, covering a distance of 1.6 kilometres – more than 13,000 times shorter than the original. Replica: Students at the Wuhan Institute of Bioengineering are climbing their own Great Wall on campus . The university said the project, which is yet to be completed, is 'not a cheap replica' and the wall looks to copy the original as closely as possible. The project aims to provide students with an opportunity to get to grips with the country's rich cultural history through copies of carvings from the original, as well as famous paintings and poems. A spokesman for the university said in a statement: 'It fulfils a patriotic educational purpose as the Great Wall is a historic achievement by the Chinese people'.","Discovery means Qin Dynasty Great Wall can finally be fully traced .

Police remain hopeful they will find the boy who went missing from the campsite on Friday. An increased number of police and other emergency crews continue to scour the thick bushland areas around Lake Eildon. On Sunday, search co-ordinator Acting Senior Sergeant Andrew Walker said Luke had a 'very high pain tolerance', a factor that would work in his favour given he has now been missing for days. 'Hence the reason why we’re out searching. We’re still hopeful that we can find him,' Sgt Walker said. The 11-year-old, who is autistic, was reportedly seen walking near the Devils River on Sunday, four kilometres south of his campsite where he was last seen. Search crews have rushed to the location and police remain comfortable that the young boy is still alive. A Victorian Police spokeswoman told AAP late on Sunday a family saw a young boy matching Luke's description while they were driving in the Devils River vicinity.

Having met Luke's family during a push to open a special school in Melbourne's south-east, Opposition emergency services spokesman Brad Battin says it is devastating to hear the 11-year-old is missing. He said Luke's parents Tim and Rachel had been updating him on the search and appreciated the efforts of all those out looking for their little boy.

"The mother who crashed a car into a lake near Melbourne has been released from custody after being interviewed by police. Officers say Akon Guode was interviewed as part of the ongoing investigation into the deaths of three children.

"The son of a well known nightclub owner who bragged about taking a girl's virginity in an alley is appealing his rape conviction. Luke Lazarus, a 23-year-old former private school boy, was jailed for at least three years on March 27 for raping an 18-year-old virgin in an alleyway outside his father's SOHO nightclub in Kings Cross, inner Sydney in May 2013. Lazarus hired Back Schwartz Vaughan - a liquor licensing specialist law firm, who lodged the appeal five days after the conviction, also contested the five year-maximum sentence he received, Fairfax Media reported. Scroll down for video . Luke Lazarus was sentenced on March 27 for raping an 18-year-old at his father's SOHO nightclub on May 12, 2013 . In the victim's impact statement, which was read out at court on her behalf, the woman said she will never be the same following the brutal attack. 'I thought that once I left the alleyway the pain would go away ... but it didn't,' the statement said. 'Everything that made me who I was stayed in that alleyway.' Lazarus said he thought the sex was consensual and that fact that it wasn't made him: 'absolutely sick to my stomach'. When sentencing him, Judge Sarah Huggett found the offence was not premeditated but said he was reckless. 'I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt he must have realised there was a possibility she wasn't consenting,' she told Sydney's District Court. But she said he was 'not caring in one way or another whether she was consenting'. During Luke Lazarus's rape trial, the jury were told he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at the SOHO, before he ushered her into an alleyway . This comes as Eastern Sydney's Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a glowing reference for Lazarus 'out of loyalty to the family' after he raped an 18-year-old woman in an alleyway outside his father's SOHO nightclub, in Sydney. Now the controversial councillor is developing 'a new risky behaviour education program to try and help young women understand and better deal with being in vulnerable situations'. In an interview with the Wentworth Courier she referenced the behaviour of Lazarus's victim. The Mayor of three years said: 'By the sheer fact of (the assault) happening at a nightclub and alcohol is involved, (means people are) open to the possibility of risky behaviour, so I'm saying let's try and close that loophole.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Cr Betts for comment. Cr Betts is reportedly developing the program for school girls alongside Waverley Action for Youth Services (WAYS) and the police. During Lazarus's trial, the jury was told that he boasted to the victim he could introduce her to the DJ at his father's club, the SOHO, before he ushered her into the alleyway. The court heard that during the assault he pulled her stockings down, ignored a second request by her to leave and said in an authoritative tone 'put your f***ing hands on the wall, get on the floor and arch your back'. Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a reference for convicted rapist Luke Lazarus and is now developing 'a new risky behaviour education program' for young women . When it was over Lazarus told her to add her name to a list of conquests in his phone that he had. In a text message to a friend the afternoon after the attack, in the early hours of May 12, 2013, Lazarus said: 'I honestly have zero recollection of calling you ... Was a sick night – took a chick's virginity.' His friend replied: 'bahahahaha nice popping does cherries ... ' Lazarus replied: '... it's a pretty gross story tell ya later'. Cr Betts said in the character reference she wrote for Lazarus that his conviction was 'inconsistent with the gentle well-mannered and respectful young man that I know'. She also said she had no hesitation supporting Lazarus and his family. In a recent interview with the Wentworth Courier she said she wrote the reference in support of Lazarus's grandparents whom she has been friends with for 30 years. 'They are shocked and devastated and I wrote in support of them,' she said. Sally Betts has been the Mayor of Waverley for three years in Sydney's eastern suburbs . Australia's first Minister for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pru Goward slammed the public figures in the local community who supported Lazarus. Along with Cr Betts, the honorary secretary of the Honorary Consulate-General of Greece in Brisbane, Tsambico K Athanasas, South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league club chairman Nick Pappas and the parish priest at the Greek Orthodox Christian Church of St George, Rose Bay, Father Gerasimos Koutsouras, spoke out to support him. 'Not only does this diminish their standing, it can shatter the confidence of the victim and often discourages them from seeking justice,' she said. On Thursday, Federal Member for Wentworth and Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull, whose electorate takes in Betts' council area, refused to endorse her to continue in her position. Turnbull's office declined to respond when probed by the Guardian over whether he would support her as mayor. A council investigation is currently underway to determine whether she broke the code of conduct. On Facebook a campaign page with over 200 likes has begun calling for her removal from office. 'As a community we must stand against our elected leaders supporting convicted rapists. Sally Betts Mayor of Waverley needs to know that she must go,' the page says. Luke Lazarus will spend a minimum of three years behind bars. He told the court that attending his father's clubs gave him an 'inflated sense of power and entitlement' A photo of a drunken looking young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub's Facebook page on April 3 by an 'external promoter' Last week, nightclub promoters apologised after a photo of a young woman sprawled out on a tiled-floor was used to advertise their Easter weekend event - just a week after Lazarus was convicted of raping a teenage girl at the venue. A photo of a 'drunken' young woman, lying with her legs apart on the ground, was posted on SOHO nightclub's Facebook page on April 3. The photo's caption said: 'We're throwing an extra special Yeezter event Tonight. Free entry till 10pm and $5 drinks till midnight – get amongst it!'

"Ed Miliband was last night accused of snubbing Britain’s army of self-employed workers – for refusing to send them a special Election message. The Labour leader prompted claims that he was worried about upsetting his party’s ‘union paymasters’. In a special Election edition, the magazine of the respected Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) carries tributes from nearly every major party leader to people who work for themselves. Scroll down for video . No message: Ed Miliband was last night accused of snubbing Britain’s army of self-employed workers – for refusing to send them a special Election message in the IPSE magazine . But while David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage and Nicola Sturgeon all feature, there is no message from Mr Miliband. Instead, the magazine has pointedly published a blank page where his contribution would have been – with a sharp rebuke. It reads: ‘Despite repeated requests, Labour leader Ed Miliband decided not to take up IPSE’s offer to outline his views on the UK’s 4.5 million self-employed.’ Last night, IPSE chief executive Chris Bryce said: ‘We were disappointed that Mr Miliband didn’t take up our offer to engage with this vibrant community.’ Refused to contribute: While David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage and Nicola Sturgeon all feature, there is no message from Mr Miliband in the magazine . But one leading self-employed businessman said: ‘Labour depends on union subscriptions for funding and in reality, few of the self-employed are union members. This is not so much a slap in the face to the self-employed as a left hook.’ Labour last night denied it had delivered a snub. A party spokesman said: ‘We want to do all we can to ensure a better deal for self-employed people.’ But the Conservatives and Lib Dems seized on the row. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Some of our greatest success stories started with a self-employed person and an idea. 'Ed Miliband’s approach is to snub enterprising people and tax them into the ground.’ Lib Dem Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said: ‘This is another Labour slap in the face for the millions of self-employed who bring energy and dynamism to our economy. This is a vital sector that deserves respect and admiration. ‘Every time figures show this sector is growing, Labour sneer.’","The magazine usually carries tributes from nearly every major party leader .

"Having fathered 40 children by 20 different women, Mike Holpin has enjoyed his fair share of intimacy. But seemingly unsatisfied with his gaggle of offspring, scorned former lovers and being engaged for the fourth time, the 56-year-old is showing no signs of settling down soon. For despite being set to marry, the alcoholic benefits claimant still has a live profile on the site where he met his bride-to-be. Despite being engaged for the fourth time and having already fathered 40 children by 20 different women, Mike Holpin still has an active online dating profile . Offering a half-grin to the camera with his signature pony-tail tucked away from view, Holpin tells prospective conquests: 'I love my kids,' in a brief biography on his Plenty of Fish account. Listed among his hobbies is watching TV and playing computer games - a luxury indulged by the taxpayer who footed the bill for his three 48in widescreen television sets, as revealed earlier this week. But while Holpin paints himself as a doting father, one of his many children has spoken out to confirm the feeling is not mutual. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, two of his sons have revealed they wish they'd never even come into contact with him. Fearful that any girl he meets during a night out may be his sister, care worker Mike Holpin Junior, 22, said dramatically: 'I wish I'd never met my dad. I'd rather be related to Hitler than to him.' Younger brother Luke, 21, said so bad was his father's womanising, his mother once tried to stab him with a butter knife after being duped out of money to buy new motorbikes. 'As soon as the money dried up he moved on. It devastated her. 'She caught him snogging another woman in the garden and tried to stab him with a butter knife.' 'I won't stop': Father of 40 Mike Holpin, left and right with his fiancée Diane, is said to have cost taxpayers £4.3million in benefits and other costs because of his huge family . Family: Holpin says that he loves sex and won't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care . The brothers also claimed their father spent the majority of his benefits payouts on alcohol and new bikes. Earlier this week it was revealed Holpin had cost the taxpayer an estimated £4million in benefits and care costs by fathering so many children. At least 16 have been taken off him and their mothers and placed into care. CARE COSTS: Mike Holpin says 16 of his children were taken into care. A placement in local authority care costs an average of £150,000 a year. If they each spent just a year in care, the bill would be £2.4million. CHILD BENEFIT: £1,000 per annum for the eldest child, plus £700 per year for each additional child, which would be claimed by the person looking after the child. Assuming half his children are now adults and half are still entitled to child benefit, the bill would be at least £500,000. Child tax credits would have been worth an average of £2,000 per year, per child if the parents were not working. That’s £800,000. HIS BENEFITS: Mr Holpin claims he has received up to £27,000 a year in benefits, totalling £675,000. TOTAL BILL: £4,375,000 . Despite not being able to recognise all of his children in the street, Holpin is in no rush to stop reproducing. Leaping to his defence, fiancee Diane Morris, 46, told The Sun: 'He's a good guy. He's been unfaithful but that's all in the past'. One of his youngest children, a three-year-old girl, was born after he agreed to help a childless couple have a baby. He said: 'I helped them by having sex with her. For all my sins I have done one or two things right'. One of his children, Hayley, 25, who is also unemployed, said: 'He was a p***head but he's done well. I'm proud,' she told The Sun. But Mr Holpin’s brother, David, 59, said the former fairground worker’s ‘shocking’ behaviour had brought ‘shame’ on the family. David Holpin, from Erith, Kent, added: ‘I lost touch with Mike when I moved to Kent 18 years ago – he didn’t have a phone so we couldn’t keep in touch. ‘It wouldn’t surprise me if he had 40 children, the way he carries on. His behaviour is shocking. 'I’m not ashamed of Michael, but I’m upset about the way our family name has been tarnished. ‘He has brought shame on us, and we are a good family.’ His relationships have broken down because of his drinking and womanising, and the recovering alcoholic says 16 of his children have been taken into care at some stage in their lives. Addicted: Holpin plays on his three £450 PS4 consoles for up to 20 hours a day - all paid for by benefits . Keeping track: Mr Holpin, from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, shows off his family tree tattoo - which includes his children and grandchildren . If they had completed just one year in care each, it would leave the taxpayer with a bill for £2.4million. Mr Holpin or the children’s mothers would also have been able to claim at least £500,000 in child benefit and a further £800,000 in child tax credits. On top of this, he has claimed at least £675,000 in benefits himself. Yet the feckless dad, of Ebbw Vale in South Wales, said: ‘I’ll never stop [having children]. Never stop. In the Bible, God says go forth and multiply. I’m doing what God wants. 'I’m as fertile as sin. I don’t believe in contraception and I love sex'. He was the subject of a Channel 5 documentary this week, but last night former friends said Holpin’s claim to 40 children – aged between three and 37 – was nonsense. And as 40 Kids By 20 Women aired, his ex-wife Petrina told of her embarrassment on Facebook, writing: ‘Feeling Asshamed’ (sic). Mr Holpin, who lives in a council house and claims benefits, said he was a changed man who no longer drank alcohol. But he still wants more children. ‘Most of my kids have gone through the care system. 'It makes me feel like s*** because they’ve suffered. They [social services] took them from me because I’m an alcoholic. I’m still an alcoholic – I just don’t practise it.’ TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: ‘It is the lack of shame that really sticks in the throat and taxpayers will be furious. Offspring: Holpin admits his lifestyle led to 16 of his children being taken into care but says he wants to make it up to them . 'It is sheer arrogance to keep having children as if they were hot dinners and expect other people to pick up the bill.’ But former friends say Mr Holpin’s boasts are off the mark, and that he has fathered as few as 16 children with three women. One said he had ‘padded’ his numbers by including his ex-partner’s stepchildren. He added: ‘He’s no angel after a drink but he isn’t the big ladies’ man that he likes to think he is. 'He’s definitely had a football team’s worth of little ’uns – maybe 16 – just because he’s not fussy and not careful. But no way has he got two rugby teams and all the subs to make it up to 40.’ Mr Holpin and his family are infamous in the former mining town of Ebbw Vale, where locals have launched petitions to stop him moving into their street. He now lives with his fiancee Diane Morris, ten years his junior, in a council house in the village of Cwm. Mr Holpin’s daughter Rhiannon, 19, said on Facebook yesterday: ‘You can all hate but it doesn’t matter, there’s plenty of us to stick up for each other and we can take on the lot of you. ‘I feel like I can’t even leave my house without people judging. Get off my back, I didn’t ask my dad to do what he’s done with his life.’ Dream: Mr Holpin says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect .

"Aside from making a fighter jet lightweight, agile and astonishingly fast, engineers of one the world's most advanced aircraft have another, more surprising issue to contend with: the moon. BAE System's Typhoon is so accurate that even the movements of the tide can disrupt the jet fighter's positioning and accuracy. To counteract even the slightest shifts in gravitational pull, experts must build the jet on 'floating' concrete rafts that move in sync with the moon. The Typhoon (pictured) is powered by two Eurojet EJ200 engines. It is 49ft (15 metres) long from tip to tip and the material is 'no more than the thickness of a match stick.' This helps its ‘fly by wire’ computer system to accurately control the aircraft, designed to be unstable but hugely agile . These rafts measure 59ft (18 metres) long and 9.8ft (3 metres) thick and are used to house the measuring equipment. Two laser trackers and nine jacks are positioned on a single surface, to make sure all movement is relative, and they control the alignment of the barges by cancelling out the subtle effects of the moon and the tides it creates. This means the jet will be in 'near perfect alignment whatever the moon may be doing,' said Martin Topping, Head of Typhoon Maintenance and Upgrade.

For example, a radar in the nose of the Typhoon detects enemy aircraft hidden from the pilot's view. As the pilot looks towards the position of the enemy aircraft, its image is projected on the visor. They can then lock-on to the aircraft by voice command, which means the enemy is also tracked by the aircraft's weapons systems. Sensors on the helmet 'talk' to the fixed sensors on the aircraft so the Typhoon always knows exactly where the pilot is looking.

"Children may be drawn to greasy fries and burgers, but fatty foods can reduce the speed at which their brains work, according to a new study. It found that children who ate a diet higher in saturated fats and cholesterol had slower reaction times and a poorer working memory. Children who ate the fatty diet performed worse when they were given a task-switching game to complete, the researchers said. A new study has found that children who ate a diet higher in saturated fats and cholesterol had slower reaction times and a poorer working memory. A stock image is pictured . For the study, scientists at the University of Illinois recruited 150 children aged between seven and 10 and gave them a game which involved learning a pattern between a set of shapes and colours. The game was designed to test cognitive flexibility, which is our ability to shift attention, select information and alter our response strategy to fit the changing demands of a task. Their performance was then compared with a food diary that the children had completed with the help of their parents, and which was overseen by a dietician. 'Children consuming diets higher in saturated fats exhibited longer reaction time during the task condition requiring greater amounts of cognitive flexibility,' the study says. A stock image of neurons is shown . Researchers at Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences claim that eating fatty food for just five days can change the body's metaboilsm for the worse. This is because it disrupts the way muscles break down sugar in the blood and potentially lead to long-term problems such as weight gain, obsesity and other health problems. 'Most people think they can indulge in high-fat foods for a few days and get away with it,' said Matt Hulver, an associate professor at the college. 'But all it takes is five days for your body's muscle to start to protest. 'This research shows that our bodies can respond dramatically to changes in diet in a shorter time frame than we have previously thought. Students were given a diet containing 55 per cent fat and after five days muscle samples were collected to see how they metablised sugar. Dr Hulver and his team found that after five days of eating lots of fat, the muscles' ability to oxidise glucose was disrupted, meaning that it wasn't broken down into energy as easily. Writing in the journal Appetite, the researchers said: ‘Cognitive flexibility is important because it comprises the ability to switch perspectives in daily life – for example, viewing a problem from the point of view of others or from a different direction, and involves being flexible enough to adjust to changing demands or priorities. ‘Following adjustment of confounding variables - age, sex, socioeconomic status, IQ, VO2max (the rate at which the body can use oxygen during exercise) and BMI, children consuming diets higher in saturated fats exhibited longer reaction time during the task condition requiring greater amounts of cognitive flexibility. ‘Further, increasing saturated fat intake and dietary cholesterol were correlated with greater switch costs (such as the difference in performance and accuracy between repeating a task and switching a task), reflecting impaired ability to maintain multiple task sets in working memory and poorer efficiency of cognitive control processes involved in task switching. ‘These data are among the first to indicate that children consuming diets higher in saturated fats and cholesterol exhibit compromised ability to flexibly modulate their cognitive operations, particularly when faced with greater cognitive challenge.’ Previous studies have found that aerobic fitness and obesity can also affect a child’s cognitive flexibility.","University of Illinois researchers gave 150 children a pattern game .

A primary school teaching assistant who forgot to take his keys on a night out died after trying to climb through an upstairs window. Phil Smith, 25, scaled a fence to try to get in his flat in Cottingham, Hull, but fell and hit his head. The 25-year-old, who worked at a school for disabled children, fractured his skull and suffered a  bleed on the brain and a blood clot in the fall. He was placed in a medically induced coma at Hull Royal Infirmary, but died five days later on April 9.

"Householders who moved in to newly-built ‘dream homes’ claimed today they were ‘more like hell’ after suffering months of problems including flooding, 2ft holes and damp. The owners in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, began to experience problems when heavy rain started falling last autumn - and are now calling on Harron Homes to resolve their 11-month ordeal. Neighbours have also reported issues with drains, streetlights, cracks in front doors, gaps between interior doors and the architrave, loose fence panels and a collapsed pipe under the street. Property problems: Liz Brindley, 31, is pictured with her nine-month-old daughter Cora in her sandbagged garage at one of the new homes facing issues such as damp and flooding in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire . Issues: Neighbours in Huddersfield have reported issues with drains, street-lights, cracks in front doors, gaps between interior doors and the architrave, loose fence panels and a collapsed pipe under the street . The family homes in the Lindley area of Huddersfield have four or five bedrooms and cost in the region of £250,000 - in an area where the average property value is just over £150,000. Liz Brindley, 31, who was one of the first people to move into a property in May last year, said: ‘This was meant to be our first dream home, but it has turned into more like hell. It is unbelievable. ‘With a new build you expect some snagging problems - but this has become much more than that. When it rains, we have to put buckets up against the windows as it comes running through. ‘Our bathroom was uneven when we first moved in - and, as Harron Homes were still on site, we asked the site manager to have a look. He could not believe it and said the structural beam may have bowed.’ Married Mrs Brindley, who has a nine-month-old daughter Cora, is unsure if her home is structurally safe, after workers’ attempts to correct the problem saw the floor pulled up and cemented over. She added: ‘We were originally told that they would have to remove part of the house in order to fix the issue with the structural beam, but they just came back and cemented over it. ‘They have also had to redo [this] since. Now I have to step up to get into the bathroom as they raised the floor. They have been three times to try and rectify the situation. Photographed by residents: These pictures show leaking coming from the homes' garages and windows . Flooding inside: The owners began to experience problems when heavy rain started falling last autumn . ‘However, it has still not resolved. I still wonder whether or not there is still a problem with the beam and how safe it is. There is also cracks in my house and I’m wondering if it is all connected.’ Another resident David Netherwood, 37, says he feels ‘robbed’ by the whole situation with his ‘dream home’. He said: ‘When you buy the house, you expect it to be like the showroom. You expect snags here or there but it’s been 11 months of this. 'We were delighted to move in to our home - a property that we felt we could spend the rest of our lives in. You don’t expect to have rain coming through your front door, down the hallway and through windows. ‘Our garage door I feel is not fit for purpose as it has gaps which you notice when it rains because it almost feels like you’re in a shower.’ A 2ft hole caused by a collapsed drain has also sparked great concern with residents after repeated calls allegedly failed to prompt a response. Alan Cadman, construction director for Harron Homes, said: ‘We are aware of the frustrations experienced by some of our valued purchasers and would like to take this opportunity to reassure them that we are committed to rectifying their issues. 'Hell': Mrs Brindley with nine-month-old Cora outside their home in the Lindley area of Huddersfield . Leaking: Harron Homes said it was 'genuinely sorry for the inconvenience caused' and admitted the 'current level of customer care is simply not acceptable' Loose tiles: As well as problems with the roofs (above), a 2ft hole caused by a collapsed drain has sparked great concern with residents after repeated calls failed to prompt a response . ‘Many of the issues have been fixed previously but given months of bad weather and the notoriously exposed location of many of the properties, some problems have unfortunately, reoccurred. ‘In line with the construction industry as a whole we have experienced significant delays in securing trades to undertake the remedial work, especially on developments where there is no longer any active construction present. ‘ . He added that a new customer care manager will soon be visiting the new homes, insisting that an emergency meeting with subcontractors will establish time scales for work to be done. Mr Cadman said: ‘As Yorkshire’s premier homebuilder we remain confident in the quality of the homes we build but realise the current level of customer care is simply not acceptable. We are genuinely sorry for the inconvenience caused and are taking a robust and direct approach to resolving them as soon as possible.’","Huddersfield residents began to have problems after heavy rain last year .

Just three months after Silver himself was arrested on corruption charges, his son-in-law Marcello Trebitsch, 37, was accused of running a $7million Ponzi scheme. The Brooklyn resident was in court on Monday as prosecutors accused him of lying to investors about stock losses and pocketing most of the money entrusted to him for trading. Trebitsch is married to Silver's daughter Michelle. Despite being a co-owner of their mutual fund, Allese Capital LLC, and a certified public accountant who 'kept the books', Michelle has not been charged in the scheme. The son-in-law of Sheldon Silver was charged Monday with allegedly running a $7million Ponzi scheme. Silver, the former Speaker of the New York State Assembly, was charged in January for allegedly taking $4million in brides and kickbacks since 200. Silver pictured above entering court for his arraignment on February 24 . The criminal complaint was filed by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bhahara, the same prosecutor who led the investigation into Silver's alleged corruption.  But sources told the New York Daily News that the investigations are unrelated. 'Investing in securities entails certain risks, but should not include the risk of being defrauded by one’s investment manager,' Bhahara said. According to the complaint, Trebitsch took millions from investors, promising to invest their money in large-cap stocks through his mutual fund. However, prosecutors say he only invested a fraction of the money and used the rest to finance his family and pay back other clients. Meanwhile, he allegedly lied to investors about what money he did invest, sending them fake account statements and tax forms that showed them posting positive returns along the lines of his promised 14 to 16 per cent - keeping 'enormous trading losses' secret. Trebitsch ran the scheme from 2009 through December 2014, according to the complaint. Trebitsch has been charged with securities and wire fraud and is currently free on $500,000 bond. If convicted he faces the possibility of 40 years in prison and fines of up to $5.25million. Father-in-law Silver was arrested in January, on charges he took $4million in brides and kickbacks since at least 2000. Following his arrest, Silver was forced to give up his leadership position as Speaker of the New York State Assembly. Silver has viciously denied the charges, and has said he is 'confident' he will be 'vindicated in the courtroom'. If convicted, the 71-year-old faces the possibility of 60 years in prison.","Marcello Trebitsch, 37, was indicted Monday on securities and wire fraud charges .

"It was set as a maths problem, aimed at testing the logical reasoning skills of 14-year-olds in Singapore. But the question went viral after people across the world were left completely baffled. The problem, which tests logical reasoning, has been shared thousands of times online as people have tried to pose their best explanations of what at first appears to be an impossible question. A maths question set for 14-year-olds has left people across the world baffled as they try to solve the puzzle . The test was set for 14-year-olds in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad. The Olympiad often features logical reasoning questions and are set to test top achievers. Katie Chrystler tweeted: ‘If Cheryl makes it this hard to find out when her birthday is, she’s NOT going to get many gifts.’ David Leong joked: ‘Cheryl obviously didn’t want Albert and Bernard at her party. Should have taken the hint when Cheryl decided to play this little game.’ One man in London said: ‘I did not have a bleeding clue! I wish I were as clever to answer something like this. But my brain just doesn’t work like that.’ The test asked: . Albert and Bernard just became friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates. May 15, May 16,  May 19 . June 17, June 18 . July 14, July 16 . August 14, August 15, August 17 . Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively. Albert: I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know too. Bernard: At first I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know now. Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl’s birthday is. So when is Cheryl’s birthday? Organisers of SASMO said the question was set to filter out the most intelligent of participants . At first the question appears impossible to answer without a bit of extra information, but we know Cheryl has already told Albert the month of her birthday, and Bernard the day. Each of the men does not know what the other has been told. This allows reasoning to be used to begin to whittle down the number of options. So, firstly, for Albert to be 'certain' that Bernard cannot know the answer - as suggested in the first statement he makes - we can deduct that the birthday is not in May or June. This is because in the months of May and June there are numbers (dates) that only occur once across the four months - namely May 19 and June 18. If Albert had been given May or June as the month, there is no way he could be certain that Bernard doesn't know the birthday. Bernard, after all, might have been the number 18 or 19. For Albert to be 'certain' that Bernard doesn't know, Albert must have been given a month that does not contain one of these 'unique' dates - i.e. July or August. Albert's disclosure now gives Bernard the clue he needs, and says he now knows the birthday. Bernard only knows the number of Cheryl’s birthday, but from Albert’s statement he has now also ruled out both May and June. This is because he realises Albert has ruled out May and June because of the 'single number' aspect above. So there are now just five remaining dates - July 14, July 16, Aug 14, Aug 15, Aug 17 - and Bernard says he knows which is the birthday. Because he now knows the date, we can whittle it down further to three dates by ruling out the numbers that appear in duplicate. At first, the question appears impossible top answer without more information, but here's how to work it out . If Cheryl had told Bernard that her birthday fell on the 14th of the month, then he could not have worked out the date at this stage. However, as he states that he now knows the date, we can rule out July 14 or August 14. This leaves just three dates to chose from - July 16, Aug 15 and Aug 17. Following Bernard's statement, Albert is then apparently able to deduce the date of Cheryl's birthday. This means her birthday must be the only remaining date in the month he was originally told. Given that there are two dates left in August and one in July, it has to be the July date. So the answer is July 16. The problem was posted on Facebook by ‘Hello Singapore’ television presenter Kenneth Kong, and went viral as people posted their various solutions to the problem. It was set for 14-year-olds in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiads (SASMO), which were held on April 8. This year around 28,000 students from countries across the world including Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, China and the UK took the test. Henry Ong, executive director of SASMO, told Mothership.sg: 'Being Q24 out of 25 questions, this is a difficult question meant to sift out the better students. SASMO contests target the top 40% of the student population and the standards of most questions are just high enough to stretch the students.' Of course, perhaps the more important question is whether Cheryl deserves a birthday gift at all after putting us through all of this.","A maths problem for 14-year-olds has baffled people across the world .

"Sainsbury's is set to revolutionise how we do our weekly shop by letting us scan items in our home as they run out. Its latest app lets homeowners gradually build up a list of items they need over the course of a week or fortnight, for example. And when that shopper enters a local store, a map will appear on the phone showing the customer where their groceries are to save them time trawling the aisles. The Sainsbury's app is in development and will be trialled in Wandsworth later this year. As customers scan their household items, a live pricing tool will show their list with current store prices. These prices will update automatically if an item goes on sale. The current Scan-and-Go app is pictured . The app is currently in development and will be trialled at a store in Wandsworth later this year. As customers scan their household items, a live pricing tool will show their list with current store prices. These prices will update automatically if an item goes on sale, or becomes part of a multi-buy deal for example. The map appears on the app when the registered phone joins a store's Wi-Fi network. It will help shoppers plot the best route to take through the store to get all of the items they need, and will highlight any that are out of stock where appropriate. And for any additional items that the shopper doesn't have at home, they can use the app to scan barcodes while in the store. The app is an extension of Sainsbury's current Scan-and-Go scheme (pictured), which lets customers scan items on their phone as they journey around the store. Card details are stored securely on the app and payments can be made as soon as they have finished shopping and want to leave the store . Sensors embedded in the wheels of shopping trolleys could tell retailers a shopper’s location in real-time. This data could be used to manage queues and guide people to special offers. The device fits invisibly into the wheel of a trolley and is fitted with with sensors and Bluetooth connection. It was invented by product design firm Cambridge Consultants. It tells retailers a shopper’s location to within 3ft (one metre) and doesn’t need batteries because it harvests energy from the rotation of the wheel to power the technology. Data is transmitted via Bluetooth to a shop’s server, meaning the system would be relatively cheap to put in place. The technology may spell the end of queues because it could be used to alert staff when customers are nearing checkouts, allowing shops to automatically allocate assistants when they are needed most. It could also point consumers in the right direction to find special offers. The app is an extension of Sainsbury's current Scan-and-Go scheme, which lets customers scan items on their phone as they journey around the store. Card details are stored securely on the app and payments can be made as soon as they have finished shopping and want to leave the store. A receipt is generated automatically. To avoid shoplifting, Sainsbury's said it will set up so-called 'payment zones' that will ask customers to scan a QR code, ensuring shoppers pay for their goods. The phone will also potentially be able to tell when a customer has left the store and hasn't paid using beacons. Scan-and-Go is being trialled at the London Colney, Tadley and Leicester North stores and is only open to Nectar card holders. If the Wandsworth trial of the new app is successful, the app is expected to be rolled out next year. Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe told Retail Week: 'The mobile scan and go technology will end up being adopted across the industry. 'I think where we can win is with our customer interaction, offering them alternative products because they suit their lifestyle for example. Over time we can do a better job of that.'","App is in development and will be trialled in Wandsworth later this year .

"Accused: Officer Aaron Stringer, from Bakersfield, California, allegedly pulled on the toes and 'tickled' the feet of a man whom police had recently killed . A police officer who allegedly 'loves playing with dead bodies' has been accused of 'tickling' the feet and yanking on the head and toes of a dead man who had been recently shot killed by cops. Aaron Stringer, of the Bakersfield, California, Police Department, reportedly said 'tickle tickle' as he ran his fingers along the soles of the feet of Ramiro James Villegas, a 22-year-old whom officers killed the same day. A trainee police officer who was with him at the time told how Stringer then pulled on the corpse's toes, and pulled his head back and forth while discussing rigor mortis after the shooting on November 13. According to the Bakersfield Californian, he then said that he 'loves playing with dead bodies' and later told her to lie about what she'd seen. Stringer has been on paid administrative leave from the department since it started investigating the chilling accusations in November. Villegas was shot dead by police after crashing his car in a high-speed chase, ABC23 reported. Officers say they gunned him down after he got out of the car and reached for his waistband, raising fears that he had a gun. It later became clear that he wasn't armed. Stringer, who filed a police report about the day's activities, mentioned interviewing witnesses alongside trainee Lindy DeGeare, who eventually blew the whistle on the alleged corpse manipulation. Shot dead: Ramiro James Villegas, 22, had been shot dead on November 13 by Bakersfield Police after a car chase. Stringer allegedly 'played' with his body as it lay under a bloodied sheet . Let in: Stringer was allowed to see the body by a nurse at the Kern Medical Center, above . She said Stringer volunteered them to head to the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield to help identify the body. It was there that a nurse gave them the passcode to the morgue where Villegas was being held. She said that when Stringer suggested she take a look at the body, she presumed it was part of legitimate training. Under California law, police officers are allowed to look at dead bodies to assess wounds, but are not supposed to handle them. According to the Bakersfield California, local prosecutors considered charging Stringer but dropped the case due to insufficient evidence. He is currently being investigated internally by the police department. A lawyer for the Villegas family said they are also 'very close' to filing a suit of their own.

"A mother-of-three has told of how a boob job saved her life – as she discovered she had cancer after knocking one of her newly-enlarged breasts. Leza Davies, from Telford, Shropshire, believed breast feeding had left her chest saggy and thought implants would boost her confidence. The 33-year-old saved up £4,000 to go from a 34A to a 34D and was pleased with her new look. Then, in April 2012, she was sorting out some washing and knocked her right breast on a door frame because of its increased size. Scroll down for video . Leza Davies, 33, says her boob job saved her life, after she discovered a cancerous lump when she knocked her breast implant on a door frame . Mrs Davies  was told her cancer treatment would leave her infertile. But remarkably, she soon found out she was pregnant after finishing treatment. She is pictured with daughter Araya, now nine months . She found a pea-sized lump, which hospital tests revealed was cancerous. She began six months of chemotherapy, followed by radiotherapy and surgery and is now in remission. She says her implants saved her life, because as she didn't regularly check for lumps, without knocking her breast she might not have discovered the tumour until it was too late. It was after breastfeeding her first baby Brayden, who is now 12, that Mrs Davies first decided she wanted a boob job. 'I was left with saggy breasts after feeding,' she said. 'There was just no tissue left, so I decided to get implants to restore my confidence. 'I thought they would improve how I felt about myself. I didn't know they would save my life too.' Mrs Davies, a semi-permanent makeup technician, said she was happy with her new breasts after having the procedure, and settled down to life as a new mother. She went on to have her daughter, Macy-Rayn, in 2010. But, three years ago she was sorting through some laundry when she caught her breast on the door frame. Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK. In 2011, just under 50,000 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Most women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men, can also get breast cancer. Most breast lumps aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by a doctor. A person should  see a GP if they notice any of the following symptoms: . * an area of thickened tissue . * nipple discharge, which may contain blood . * a change in the size or shape of your breasts . * dimpling on the skin of your breasts . * a rash on or around your nipples . * a change in your nipple's appearance – for example, becoming sunken into your breast . * persistent pain in your breasts or armpits . * a lump or swelling in your armpits . Source: NHS Choices . Rubbing the sore area, she felt a pea-sized lump and her husband Tristan, 36, urged her to visit her GP. Mrs Davies said: 'I was only 30 and didn't think it would be anything to worry about. 'I just went to put my mind at ease. 'The doctor referred me to hospital for further tests. I was told it was very unlikely to be anything sinister, but they wanted to be cautious.' A few weeks later doctors advised her to have a lumpectomy test, and this confirmed she had cancer, which is extremely unusual in someone her age. While breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK, 8 out of ten women who get it are over 50 years old. Mrs Davies describes the pure terror of being given such a diagnosis. She said: 'I was devastated. I just kept crying thinking I was going to die and imagining my children growing up without me.' That July, she began six months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but the cancer had spread to the lymph nodes surrounding her breast. She then had an operation to remove five lymph nodes containing cancerous cells, and afterwards doctors were confident she was in remission. However, they said the treatment would probably leave her unable to have more children. She explained: 'Afterwards, they told me they'd got all the cancer but that I wouldn't have anymore children as a result of the treatment. 'I would have liked more, but I was already lucky enough to have one of each and was just so happy to be alive. 'All thanks to my boob job.' Mrs Davies only went to her GP about the lump she had found because husband Tristan, 36 (pictured here with her on their wedding day) begged her to go . Mrs Davies says her implants saved her life and will allow her to see her children, including her youngest baby Araya (pictured) grow up. Now, she urges all women to check their breasts for lumps . However, she soon suspected she might be pregnant and took a test, which revealed she was, in fact expecting. Her daughter Araya-Maye, is now nine months old, sister to Brayden, 12 and Macy-Rayn, five. She describes Araya-Maye as her 'second miracle'. 'The first is discovering the lump. It was less than a centimetre in size, so if I hadn't knocked my breast, I would never have felt it.' 'Who knows what would have happened? I never checked my breasts. I wouldn't in a million years have thought it was necessary at my age. 'I thought breast cancer was something that affected older women. 'Having implants was a confidence thing. I wanted to be able to wear a bikini and feel good about myself. 'But if they'd stayed the same size I would never have knocked them. 'My implants saved my life. I'd ask all women – however young – to check their breasts.' One in five women later diagnosed with breast cancer had originally put off making a GP appointment for at least four weeks . Thousands of women are risking their lives by waiting more than a month before seeing their GP after spotting breast cancer symptoms. One in five diagnosed with the disease had put off making an appointment for at least four weeks, allowing the cancer time to spread and potentially reducing their chance of survival. And one in 20 had delayed seeing the doctor for more than six months, according to a survey of patients. Some said they were scared about what they might be told, while others were worried they would be seen as a nuisance. Women in their fifties and sixties were among the worst culprits, the poll by the charity Breast Cancer Care found, because they wrongly assumed they were in the clear after they had been through menopause. Britain has one of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe and this has been blamed on the disease being detected too late. Breast cancer patients in the UK have a five-year survival rate of 81 per cent, lagging behind many European countries, with France, Italy and Sweden boasting an 83 per cent survival rate back in the mid-1990s.","Leza Davies had a boob job as her chest sagged after breast feeding .

"A Long Island mother and daughter who went missing last month have been found safe and well in New York City's Upper West Side neighborhood. Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily were recognized by the front desk manager of the hotel they were staying at on Sunday, it was reported. They were found at 3am by NYPD officers and are in good health, officials said. Police said they now consider the case to be closed. It came after more details emerged of the colorful background of Mrs Costello's late husband's family, who were in dispute with her over the contents of Mr Costello's will. Scroll down for video . Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily were visiting Manhattan when they disappeared. They have now been found safe and well . Iona Costello's husband George, the co-owner of Costello Marine in Greenport, died from a heart attack in 2012 . It was revealed that the mother's stepson has a long criminal record and was jailed again just days after she disappeared, a report suggests. George Costello Jr is currently in jail in Florida on apparently unrelated charges and has been described by relatives as a 'mixed-up' kid.' British-born Mrs Costello and Emily were visiting Manhattan when they went missing on March 30 near their home in the the wealthy seaside village of Greenport. Their car was found in a parking garage on 42nd street in Manhattan, but the pair, who often went into the city for theater and art museums, left no other trace of their whereabouts. Iona's husband died in 2012 from a heart attack, and she is believed to have been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. The New York Daily News reported Iona's stepson Costello Jr, 45, was visiting Hamptons Bay, New York, at the time, and relatives said he has never got on with the family. He has a long history of drug arrests and is currently in Palm Beach Detention Center following an arrest for a 'domestic dispute' when he returned to Florida. Police reportedly told Iona's mother there is surveillance video of them leaving a parking garage laughing . Iona's brother-in-law John Costello (right), is facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. Costello's stepson, George Costello Jr (left), 45,  has a long history of drug arrests (mugshot from April) His fiance, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the Daily News  it was a 'weird coincidence', but insists she was with him the whole time. Speaking from the prison, he told the newspaper he was visiting his Hampton Bay home at the time and flew home on April 1, two days after the pair went missing. George Jr, who has at least 10 arrests to his name, according to court records, says he didn't have a close relationship with Iona. He said the last time the pair spoke was at his father and her husband's funeral. 'She's a hardworking lady who loves her horses and takes care of them really well. She's a good mother,' he told the Daily News. Iona's mother, Diana Malcomson, had also insisted George Jr wouldn't want to harm the pair, but said he was a 'mixed-up kid'. Her brother-in-law is also facing a criminal case. John Costello is  facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. They were reported missing by relatives of the 'quiet Irish family', who own a horse farm on Long Island's North Fork. Iona, who was her late husband George's third wife and inherited his entire estate along with her daughter, had been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. 'She can't sell anything. She can't do anything because everything is in court,' an unidentified relative told the New York Daily News. 'I don't know if she's having a nervous breakdown. I don't know if somebody has kidnapped them,' the unidentified family member said of the Costellos' long absence from their home and farm. Costello's adult children have argued that the will granting the estate to Iona was improperly executed, according to Novick Law Group. A Long Island court sided with the adult children last year, and Iona Costello is appealing. Amanda Hurwitz, one of George's daughters who now lives in Connecticut, refused to comment to Daily Mail Online on the report or her stepmother's disappearance. The widow's trip into New York was originally only supposed to last for several days. 'She said she was going to Manhattan for Easter,' Iona's mother Diana Malcolmson, 80, told Daily Mail Online. The grandmother, who lives in nearby Shelter Island, New York, said police told her that surveillance footage from the parking garage showed Mrs Costello and Emily walking away from their car on March 30, holding suitcases and laughing. She said that she spoke regularly with her daughter, but had not heard about any plans for extended vacations. While trips into New York were fairly normal, Emily being out of school is not. The ninth grader had been scheduled to return to Ross School in East Hampton from her Spring Break this past Tuesday. The mother had told workers at her farm that she would be 'back on Tuesday' but did not return on March 31st, April 7th or April 14th. Workers at the horse farm said earlier it was strange for Mrs Costello not to be in contact with them about raising the animals. Southold police Chief of Police Martin Flatley told Daily Mail Online  his force did not suspect foul play. Relative Jane Costello said that calls to both Iona's and Emily's phones had gone straight to voicemail. Mrs Costello’s family have lived in both the UK and the US, but she is British by birth. Her mother Diana and late father Euan, a stockbroker, lived in Stow in the Wold, Gloucestershire before setting sail for North America in 1958 aboard the Liberte cruise ship. Their plan was to live in Canada but they instead move to Long Island. The couple returned to the UK at some point and records indicate that Mrs Costello was born in Marylebone in Central London, as was her brother Andrew. Mrs Costello’s aunt Gwendoline Preston married Lord William Wynne-Jones, a renowned chemist and former vice-chancellor of Newcastle University.","Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily went missing on March 30 .

"Conviction: Amy Wilkinson, 28, left, the granddaughter of former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty,  has admitted falsely claiming almost £18,000 in benefits . The granddaughter of former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty has admitted falsely claiming almost £18,000 in benefits. Amy Wilkinson, 28, claimed housing benefit and council tax benefit even though she was living in a home owned by her mother and her partner, who was also working. Wilkinson, who was a British Airways cabin crew attendant, was ordered to pay back a total of £17,604 that she claimed over two years when she appeared at South and East Cheshire Magistrates Court last week. She admitted two charges of dishonestly making false representations in order to claim housing benefit, Council Tax benefit and income support. Magistrates sentenced her to 24 weeks' imprisonment suspended for 24 months and ordered her to pay costs of £675 and a victim surcharge of £50. Her grandfather, Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977. He was sacked over his affair with the wife of the team's physio in 1977. Steph Cordon, Cheshire East Council's head of communities, said: 'It is a big mistake for fraudsters to think they can get away with claiming benefits they are not entitled to. 'They risk ending up with a criminal conviction for a serious offence of dishonesty and being ordered to repay the money they have falsely claimed. 'We have a zero-tolerance policy towards benefit fraud because we are determined to ensure that the benefits system works for people who really need help.' Wilkinson of  Knutsford, applied for housing benefit and Council Tax benefit in April 2011, saying that she was on a low income, was living in a privately-rented property and needed assistance with her rent and council tax, a court heard, . Football star: Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977, pictured here after winning the FA Cup in his final year at the club . She also made a claim for income support to help her and her daughter as she had no other income. Fundraising: A pregnant Amy Wilkinson outside Downing Street in 2011 after she raised £10,000 for charity after the death of her son . However, investigators from Cheshire East Council's benefit fraud investigation team and the Department for Work and Pensions found she had failed to declare that her mother owned the property for which she was claiming housing benefit. They also discovered that Wilkinson's partner had joined her household in January 2012 and had been supporting her and the family financially. Over a two-year period, she received a total of £17,604 in state benefits that she was not entitled to. She will have to repay in full the benefits that she fraudulently obtained. In 2011 she raised more than £10,000 for baby charity Tommy's and was thanked by the Chancellor George Osborne, who is also her local MP. She spent 18 months fundraising after she went into labour at 29 weeks and lost her son, Billy John, who tragically only lived for three minutes. Describing why she raised the money she said at the time: 'I was 29 weeks pregnant when I went into labour but they don't know why, there's just no answer for it. I needed something to focus on. 'Tommy's has been fabulous with us and on their website, they have a forum where you can talk to other people about it. I never realised how many people have been through what we have been through because at times I thought I was the only one.'","Amy Wilkinson, 28, falsely claimed housing benefit and Council Tax benefit .

"A movie enthusiast has built his very own Iron Man suit for a heroic price of just £55. Chinese engineering graduate Cheng Chen, 27, was inspired to make the iconic body armour after watching the  hit film with his younger brother. He spent six months painstakingly researching and building the replica to the movie's exact measurements, it was reported by People's Daily Online. The finished product is two metres high, weighs just 4kg and comes complete with helmet, laser gloves and a power backpack. But Cheng said he was was too  'chubby' to fit into it and had to ask his nephew to model it for him. Heroic effort: Cheng Chen poses with the Iron Man suit he built after six months of painstaking research. It is being modelled here by his nephew because he found he was 'too chubby' to fit into it himself . The finished product is two metres high, weighs just 4kg and comes with helmet, gloves and backpack . Cheng, from Jiangsu Province in eastern China, said: 'I studied electronic engineering at university. 'Because I have always been single, I have a lot of time in my hands. The idea of constructing an Iron Man armour then came to mind. 'I love the movie. Even my brother, now in Year 6, loves it. My initial idea was to make one for my little brother.' He was driven to start his research when his younger brother begged him to build one after they watched the latest installment of the series in the cinema last year. Construction was harder than Cheng expected. He started looking for a blueprint for the armour  last autumn.

"It's been almost a fortnight since Jeremy Clarkson was sacked from Top Gear, but the news hasn't stopped his estranged wife from enjoying herself after she jetted off on holiday to Barbados. The 53-year-old spent the Easter weekend with friends and family on the Caribbean island where she sunbathed and drove a jet ski. She has previously holidayed in the area with the 54-year-old broadcaster but the pair, who have two daughters and a son, are said to have lived apart for  years. Scroll down for video . Holiday: Frances Clarkson, 53, spent the Easter Bank Holiday weekend with family and friends in Barbados . The BBC announced last month they were dropping Clarkson from the hit motoring show after a 'fracas' involving a Top Gear producer. Clarkson left Oisin Tymon needing hospital treatment after punching him at a hotel in Hawes, North Yorkshire, after staff wouldn't serve him a hot meal following a day of filming. He has repeatedly apologised to Mr Tymon both in public and privately and it was announced today that he will not face any criminal charges for the attack. Rushing to his side to comfort him throughout the ordeal has been events organiser Phillipa Sage, 45, who became a feature in his life in 2010 when he was still in a relationship with Frances. It was claimed last year that his marriage had been under strain after reports he had engaged in extra-martial affairs. Last summer he told the MailOnline's Piers Morgan he was 'going through a difficult divorce'. In April 2011 Clarkson was accused of having an affair with Miss Sage while touring Australia, South Africa and Norway with his Top Gear co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May. Sunshine: Frances was spotted in a black bikini as she drove a jet ski and caught some rays in the sun . Relax: The 53-year-old has previously holidayed on the island with her estranged husband Jeremy Clarkson . He was alleged to have spent several nights with Miss Sage and kissed her on the lips in full view of observers on one occasion. Clarkson shrugged off the claims at the time, saying that he and Miss Sage had been simply 'colleagues fooling around'. But shortly afterwards it was revealed that he was spending time during the week living in a bachelor pad in London. He denied that he had moved out of the family home in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, saying he used the London flat when he was editing Top Gear. Clarkson was photographed kissing Miss Sage while on holiday with her in Greece in 2013, and they also visited Australia again. In October 2011 Clarkson lifted a High Court gagging order preventing his first wife, Alex Hall, from claiming that he had had an affair with her after he married Frances. Split: Frances has two daughters and a son with the 54-year-old broadcaster, but the pair are said to have been living apart for years . Distant: The BBC announced last month they were dropping her estranged husband from the hit motoring show after a 'fracas' involving a Top Gear producer . Break: Frances walks along the beach with an unidentified man during the Easter holiday to the Caribbean . Mrs Hall, who married him in 1989 but separated from him after less than two years, alleged that they rekindled their relationship from 1999 onwards – something he denied. Clarkson married Frances in 1993 and she encouraged him to cultivate a more aggressive on-screen persona to make Top Gear more controversial, say friends. In recent years he has been caught up in other controversies, including being accused of racism after he called an Asian man a 'slope' when he joked about the construction of a bridge in Thailand during an episode of Top Gear. Estranged: Jeremy and Frances Clarkson married in 1993 but the pair have not lived together for years. Friends claim that it was Frances who pushed him to cultivate a more aggressive on-screen persona . In April 2011 Clarkson was accused of having an affair with Phillipa Sage (pictured kissing) while touring Australia, South Africa and Norway with his Top Gear co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May . There was outcry when Clarkson used the word, a derogatory term for people of Asian descent, during the show's two-part Burma special, screened in March last year. In 2013 he came under fire after he allegedly used the n-word in leaked footage while reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'. But he escaped disciplinary action by the BBC with the Complaints and Appeals Board agreeing that the 'incident did not engage editorial standards as the material had not been broadcast'.","Frances Clarkson, 53, spend Easter Bank Holiday weekend in Caribbean .

"Two black candidates were among three people elected to the Ferguson City Council Tuesday, tripling African-American representation in the St. Louis suburb where poor race relations have been a focal point since the August shooting death of an 18-year-old black by a white police officer. The election means that half of the six-member city council in Ferguson, a town where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black, will now be African-American. This just over one month after the Department of Justice released a report on the shocking culture of racism and abuse in the city. The lone black incumbent councilman, Dwayne James, was not up for re-election. Scroll down for video . Wesley Bell Jr., 18, left, casts his vote alongside his father Wesley Bell who claimed victory in the race for Ferguson City Council Ward 3 seat . The election came just over a month after a Justice Department report detailed a culture of racism and abuse among city officials, employees and police . Voter turnout increased substantially from the previous election following a strong get-out-the-vote effort from labor unions and other national organizations. The town that drew only 12.3 percent of registered voters last April had 29.4 percent turnout Tuesday, according to the St. Louis County Board of Elections. That was about double the overall turnout in St. Louis County, where Ferguson is located. Unofficial results showed that Wesley Bell defeated another black candidate to win in the 3rd Ward; Ella Jones defeated another black candidate and two white candidates in the 1st Ward; and Brian Fletcher, a former mayor who is white, won a 2nd Ward race against another white candidate. 'This community came out in record numbers to make sure our voices were heard,' said councilman-elect Bell. 'When you have a community engaged, the sky is the limit.' He described it as part of a healing and rebuilding process. It was the first municipal election in Ferguson since officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, on Aug. 9. The shooting sparked sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis area, and spawned a national Black Lives Matter movement to press for change in how police deal with local minorities. It also prompted a review by the U.S. Justice Department, which decided not to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November. But the federal department released a scathing report blasting the city for racial bias and profiling in the police department and a profit-driven municipal court system. Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge. The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails. The new city council will be tasked with approving hiring of the replacements. The scrutiny in the wake of the shooting also found that the city had a mostly white police force and city leadership - the mayor also is white. Ferguson City Council ward three candidates Lee Smith (R) and Wesley Bell (L) hand out election information . In the race for the 3rd Ward, which includes the apartment complex where Brown was killed, Bell, 40, easily defeated 76-year-old retiree Lee Smith. Bell is a lawyer and a criminology professor who had to defend himself because of a third job - municipal judge in a neighboring town of Velda City that, like Ferguson, derives a large percentage of its budget from municipal court fines. Smith had support of several national organizations whose volunteers went door-to-door on his behalf. Jones had support of a labor union and won easily in her four-person race. Fletcher, the former mayor who started the I Love Ferguson campaign after the unrest that ravaged the community, also won easily in the 2nd Ward. A strong push was made after the shooting to register more black voters last year, but just 562 new voters were added to the rolls. In recent weeks, the focus has been on getting those who are registered to vote. The high turnout came despite brutal weather. Strong storms, including lightning and heavy rain, tore through the region for several hours before noon. But the weather didn't deter Marty Einig, who has participated in Ferguson protests since August. She was voting in the 3rd Ward, which includes the Canfield Green apartment complex where Brown was fatally shot. 'I see there is raw material within this community to demonstrate hope,' Einig said. 'I see a glass that's half full, and I feel that the people have the will to force change.' Charrolynn Washington agreed, saying the election is where real change will occur. 'As much change is needed here in Ferguson, this is where we begin - not out there in the streets, doing what they were doing - but, right here,' Washington said. 'They need to be voting and putting people in position to make the change and make the decisions that need to be made.'","Ferguson, Missouri elected three black officials to city council seats on Tuesday, up from one last term .

In a performance you would expect from a boxing kangaroo, the wallaby turned around and gave the wombat a little crack on the nose after it seemingly got a little too close for comfort. Onlookers were shocked by the actions of the wallaby but it looks like there's no bad blood between the two native Australian's as they both continued happily grazing in the area straight after the encounter. The wombat had no idea what he was in for as he approached the unsuspecting wallaby . Unlike this encounter, wallabies typically use their strong hind legs to deliver a powerful kick when they are feeling threatened. Wilsons Promontory National Park is home to a range of wildlife including kangaroos, emus, echidnas and numerous other smaller marsupials. The wildlife there has become quite accustomed to human presence and animals will often approach people or enter tents looking for food.

"Attack: Sam Barton, who has had £55,000 of cosmetic surgery to look like Joey Essex, was egged on Easter Monday (pictured) 'Britain's vainest man' who had taxpayer-funded plastic surgery  to look like reality star Joey Essex said today he is being bullied online by a gang who have now  thrown eggs in his face. Sam Barton, who has had £55,000 of cosmetic surgery  - including two operations on the NHS - believes the culprits tracked him down using his Facebook posts and then attacked him in the street. The 22-year-old says abuse online about his appearance also forced him to move house. On Easter Monday he was attacked by a group of men who pelted him with eggs from a car. Sam had been enjoying a drink in the Green House pub in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, when a group of men shouted abuse at him as he left. The yobs then hurled six eggs at him before speeding off - leaving him with yolk and shell running down his face on the pavement. Sam said he believed he had been targeted because he had 'checked in' at the pub on Facebook minutes earlier. He said: 'It was quite a shock at first. I had just left the pub with two friends when I was suddenly pelted in eggs. 'There was shell in my hair and yolk dripping down my face. 'They shouted my name and swore at me as they drove past and threw eggs at me. 'They clearly didn't like me. It was not the kind of egg I was hoping to receive over the Easter holiday but after the shock had worn off I did have a laugh about it.' Scroll down for video . Sam had been taking part in filming with Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison on Saturday April 4 - just two days before he was attacked. Spending: Barton has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. Two nose jobs have cost £10,400, although one was free on the NHS . Pursuit of celebrity: Sam Barton has gone bankrupt financing plastic surgery and a champagne lifestyle to match his TOWIE heroes Joey Essex, together left, and Harry Derbidge, right . The pair spent the day being pampered at a beauty salon and then enjoying drinks in Birmingham for a reality show which will be aired on MTV. Debts: Barton admits he had debts of £100,000 on 15 credit cards and store cards trying to make it as a celeb . He also recently appeared on popular ITV show Judge Rinder to resolve a wrangle with a lapdancer friend over a Botox treatment row. Sam, who has spent £55,000 on perfecting his look, revealed in January he was going bankrupt after racking up debts of £35,000 on his Champagne lifestyle. Sam is the grandson of Aston Villa's European Cup winning boss Tony Barton and is best friends with Benefits Street star White Dee. Fame-hungry Sam previously revealed he had spent £55,000 on reconstructive surgery and beauty treatments to turn himself into the 'perfect man.' And he has amassed credit card debts of £25,000 in four years in search of the Joey Essex look that he hopes will make him a star. He has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. Two nose jobs have cost £10,400, although one was free on the NHS. He admitted spending an astonishing £100,000 in just four years, blowing up to £2,000 a night on £300 bottles of expensive fizz. Sam, who lives with mum Jackie, dad Chris and brother Ed in Sutton Coldfield, plunged into the red after spending a fortune on plastic surgery. He added: 'I've spent around £55,000 trying to improve my looks and get the perfect image. 'The rest I've spent on designer clothes, jewellery, holidays, spa treatment and champagne. 'In total, I have spent around £100,000. At one point I counted 15 credit cards and store cards. 'I really do not regret it, I have had the time of my life over the last few years. 'My manager says this bankruptcy thing will clear my debts, so it's basically free money isn't it?'

"The hometown of Stephanie Scott has paid tribute to the much-loved teacher who who was allegedly murdered on Easter Sunday . The hometown of Stephanie Scott has paid tribute to the much-loved teacher by filling the sky with brightly coloured hot-air balloons in a spectacular display. As the balloons hovered above the small community of Canowindra in the central west region of NSW, hundreds gathered on Sunday morning to mark the tragic death of the bride-to-be. More than a dozen hot-air balloons took to the skies as hundreds of yellow helium balloons were released in the town where the 26-year-old grew up and met her fiance Aaron Leeson Woolley. ‘When we heard about Stephanie we decided to have a tribute. We had people here from France, Russia and Canada - they joined in because they could see our pain,’ event organiser Jan Kerr said. ‘It was magic to see.’ Orange resident Mark Andrew, who travelled to Canowindra on Sunday to pay his respects to the murdered teacher said it was a beautiful opportunity to honour Ms Scott. 'It was a surreal start to a sad and poignant day,' Mr Andrew told Daily Mail Australia. 'The only sounds were those of the burners on the balloons as they prepared to take off. The moment of take off was quite profoundly emotional. 'The silent gathering was akin to that at the ANZAC dawn service which is topical.' Scroll down for video . More than a dozen hot-air balloons took to the skies in Stephanie Scott's hometown Canowindra on Sunday morning . The town paid tribute to the much-loved teacher by filling the sky with brightly coloured hot-air balloons and smaller yellow balloons . The latest tribute comes just one week after Ms Scott was murdered and dumped in bushland six days before she was due to walk down the aisle to marry her partner of five years. Family and friends of the pair had flown from around the world to attend their big day, but are now bracing themselves to attend her funeral. Efforts to find out exactly what happened to Stephanie are continuing with forensic specialists expected to carry out a post-mortem on the body on Monday. The burned remains were found by police just five metres from a road in the Cocoparra National Park in the NSW Riverina region at about 5pm on Friday.

"A lost iPhone was reunited with its owner after police  posted a series of bizarre photos on the woman's Facebook page in a bid to track her down. The phone, which belonged to Bella Crooke from Melbourne, was handed in to Albury Police Station on the NSW-Victoria border on Sunday morning. Police officers on duty realised the phone was unlocked and used it to post selfies and photos of the phone in various locations around the police station on Bella's Facebook page. Officers from Albury Police Station on the NSW-Victoria border posted selfies on a woman's Facebook page saying she could come and collect her phone after it was handed in on Sunday morning . 'You should probably put a password on your phone,' a status post read alongside a selfie of a police officer. 'When you are ready to pick it up it will be at Albury police station.' Bella lost her phone at a friend's birthday party the night before and dialled her number as soon as she realised. 'A security guard picked up and said he'd leave it at the police station. I didn't get there until 1pm and had no idea what had been going on,' she told Daily Mail Australia. By the time Bella made it to the police station, the original post had already garnered a humorous response from her friends and officers. The phone belonged to Bella Crooke who lost it at a friend's birthday party on Saturday night . Police officers on duty realised the phone was unlocked and used it to post selfies and puns on the woman's Facebook page, including this photo of the phone in a holding 'cell' While waiting for Bella to collect her phone, police had used the time to post a picture of the handset in a holding cell and to reassure the owner that it was in safe hands. ""If your worried about the battery going flat, don't. By the time you pick it up it will be fully 'charged',' the post read. 'It is a great 'cell' phone,"" another post read. A few hours later police added: 'The phone is still here. Ready to be released early for good behaviour. Just waiting on Bella to post bail.' Bella said she didn't even have to give her name when she eventually reclaimed her phone. The post was quickly shared by the woman's friends who labelled police 'legends' for their unusual approach to tracking down the phone's owner . Bella said she didn't even have to give her name when she eventually reclaimed her phone because officers recognised her from her Facebook page . 'They just recognised me.

"The leading critic of Conservative Party plans to give housing association tenants a right to buy herself lives in a £1million house. As director of policy and external affairs at the National Housing Federation, Ruth Davison has been leading the campaign to prevent millions of people getting a real chance of owning their own homes. But just as she did not advertise the fact that she is a member of her local Labour party in Islington, North London, neither has she revealed just how comfortable her own house is. Hypocrite? Ruth Davison, leading critic of David Cameron's plan to extent the right to buy scheme is a Labour party member and the owner of a £1million house in Islington, London . In reality she has been one of the country’s biggest gainers from the private property boom. She also earned hefty salaries in public bodies for years when Labour was in power. Miss Davison, 44, and husband Chris Bailey, 47, who describes himself as an ‘urban regenerator, non-profit board member and social entrepreneur’, bought a large terrace house in Islington for £440,000 ten years ago. It has now rocketed to more than £1million in value. Promise: David Cameron and the Conservatives plan to extend ‘right to buy’ from council houses to housing association properties if they win . Yet on behalf of the fat-cat housing association bosses she speaks for, Miss Davison has been across the newspapers and broadcasters this week fighting to stop the Conservative election campaign proposal to extend ‘right to buy’ legislation from council house tenants to the 2.7million people living in housing association properties. Under the scheme, housing association tenants would receive discounts of tens of thousands of pounds on the market value of their homes. Miss Davison told the BBC in response to the Tory right-to-buy plans on Tuesday that it was wrong to effectively give money to ‘some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents’. She added: ‘We are independent organisations and charities – you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they’re worth than you can force Tesco, or even Cancer Research. ' So housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale. There will be a cost to the taxpayer.’ Miss Davison’s first major taxpayer-funded role under Labour was at the Audit Commission, with other senior roles at Bedford and Hertfordshire Strategic Health Authority and the National Patient Safety Agency. Last night Miss Davison said: ‘The price of a family house is now beyond the reach of many – I couldn’t afford to buy my home now. ‘We need to build more homes of all types to make housing more affordable for everyone, not just give money away to the lucky few.’","Ruth Davison, of the National Housing Federation, is a critic of Tory plan .

"The world’s first cloned camel is pregnant, scientists claim. The mother-to-be, whose name is Injaz, was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born from a  surrogate mother. Injaz was six years old this week and is said to have conceived naturally. The world’s first cloned camel is pregnant, scientists claim. The mother-to-be, whose name is Injaz, was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born by surrogate mother. Injaz is pictured here when she was just six days old . Dr Nisar Wani, scientific director of the Reproductive Biotechnology Centre in Nad Al Sheba, Dubai, told The National: ‘We are very excited because Injaz is now pregnant and we expect to have a calf from her late this year. ‘She has conceived in a natural way. This will prove cloned camels are fertile and can reproduce the same as naturally produced camels.’ The birth of Injaz, whose name means 'achievement' in Arabic, caused great excitement in 2009 and scientists said that cloning would help to preserve the genetics of the camel population. Camels are a valuable commodity in the desert sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf, and are used for racing and transport. They can also produce low-fat milk and can make owners millions of dollars at camel beauty contests. Since Injaz was born, many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning, including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner. It's 19 years since the first mammal was cloned. Dolly the sheep (pictured) was born in Edinburgh using DNA from an adult cell . Since Injaz was born, many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning, including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner, the BBC reported. It took five years of work before Injaz was cloned. She was born on April 8, 2009 weighing 66lbs (30kg), after an uncomplicated gestation of 378 days. The calf was created from cells harvested from the ovary of an adult camel. The cells were then planted into the egg of a surrogate mother. Injaz was confirmed as genetically identical to the camel the cells were taken from, according to United Arab Emirates newspapers at the time. The world's first mammal was cloned 19 years ago. Dolly the sheep was born in Edinburgh using DNA from an adult cell. Dolly was put down in 2003, after being diagnosed with lung disease, but since then, scientists have successfully cloned mice, cows, pigs and dogs as well as camels. Human embryos have been genetically modified so that any changes made will be carried on into future generations for the first time, according to scientists. Researchers around the world are bracing themselves for the results of a study by scientists in China that has introduced DNA changes to reproductive cells. Many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea, for fear it could be misused to allow parents to 'select' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren. Human embryos, like the one above, may have been genetically modified with new gene editing techniques . They say that even embryos created in this way for research purposes only could have serious ethical and safety implications. They have described it as 'dangerous and ethically unacceptable'. However, others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers. Until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells - non-reproductive cells like those found in skin, muscle, nerves, bone and liver for example - to help them study diseases. Modifying the DNA of human embryos so that DNA changes are preserved in the germline - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations. Such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the UK, but is permitted in the US and China. A number of groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos.","Cloned camel was born in 2009 and called Inzaz, which means achievement .

This single bikini-clad woman stretches her curvaceous body while silhouetted against a spectacular Hawaiian sunset . Faced with the rapid destruction of habitats through pollution and overpopulation, the photographer hopes his images will inspire the viewer with awe at the intricate and diverse world we live in and encourage them to protect the planet. He writes on his website: 'I have a desire to experience the natural world and to let those feelings inspire me. Life on this planet is older than any of us can comprehend, and there is a beauty in that history and power. However, these days our natural spaces are being encroached upon by human development. A man gazes upon a whirl of stars in the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, where the salt-covered land cracks into spectacular patterns . Last year Hawiian-born photographer Dustin Wong, 31, abandoned his job as an engineer to travel the world with only his camera for company . 'Through my images I try to convey a sense of awe of the incredibly intricate and diverse world we share. I want to encourage people to interact and experience nature for themselves. I think this way more people will care about protecting and preserving natural environments.' He started taking photographs 15 years ago before taking it up full time last year. He traveled all over the west coast of the US living out of a van for five months and visited as many national parks as he could. In Queensland Australia, he follows a woman as she ventures into the dark depths of a natural cavern . His journeying in America took in the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, where the land cracks into spectacular patterns, the Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the third largest hot spring in the world whose bright colours are caused by bacteria, to the Burning Man Festival in Nevada, which culminates in the burning of a wooden effigy. Other pictures show a spectacular Hawaiian sunset reflected in the sand in improbable bright oranges and reds, or a single solitary figure dwarfed by the waterfall surging above him at at Latourell Falls in Oregan. Revellers climb on top of a massive sculpture of the words 'Believe' at the Burning Man Festival in Nevada . For these photographs he also ventured to Australia, following a woman as she explores a cavern in Queensland, and to Norway, where he captures the stunning greens of the Northern Lights, or a firework exploding against a frosty night-time pine forest. Mr Wong takes his photographs using a DSLR camera before transforming them into High Dynamic Range to bring out colour and detail. He then blends the HDR image with the original exposures, creating an image that is 'slightly fantastical yet still rooted in reality'. The Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, is the third largest hot spring in the world. Its bright colours are caused by pigmented bacteria . His images depict people interacting with the environment and enjoying themselves in the outdoors. At first he shunned using people in his images, which he wanted to capture nature at its pristine best, but he later realised a single figure - either a stranger or himself - provides a sense of scale and helps viewers relate more viscerally to the image in front of them. Although he now lives in Seattle in the USA, he credits his Hawaiian upbringing as the driving force behind his vision of the world. A single figure on a Norwegian beach is bathed in green light as he admires the spectacular Northern Light . He adds: 'Born and raised in Hawaii, I learned about the Hawaiian culture, specifically the way the Ancient Hawaiians held the land in reverence. Those teachings instilled in me an understanding that human beings have an intrinsic relationship with the land that should be held in high respect. 'I aim to create a sense of wonder in each of my pieces. I want to recapture the sense of awe and childhood imagination that often gets abandoned along the way to adulthood. I create art where the viewer is free to wallow in the mysteries and unknown of a beautiful landscape.' Standing in the middle of a snow-covered Norwegian pine forest, a couple release a firework, sending orange blazing into the sky . He uses a single figure like this man dwarfed by the water at Latourell Falls, Oregan, USA, to engourage a visceral response in viewers .","Photographer Dustin Wong, 31, travels the world with no company but his camera .

"Tiny babies are more sensitive to pain than adults, according to a study of infants’ brains which overturns the medical consensus. Until now doctors have assumed that the brains of very young babies are not developed enough to feel pain. It means that newborns often go without painkillers, even during invasive procedures. But the new findings, revealed by Oxford University doctors, suggest that not only do babies feel pain, but their pain thresholds are even lower than those of adults. Scroll down for video . Research on infants’ brains by doctors from Oxford University has found that young babies are more sensitive to pain than adults. It overturns the medical consensus that newborns have a high pain threshold (file picture) In the first study of its kind, the researchers showed in brain scans that infants’ brains react in much the same way as adults when given even mild pain. Dr Rebeccah  Slater, of Oxford’s department of Paediatrics, said: ‘Obviously babies can’t tell us about their experience of pain and it is difficult to infer pain from visual observations. ‘In fact some people have argued that babies’ brains are not developed enough for them to really “feel” pain, any reaction being just a reflex – our study provides the first really strong evidence that this is not the case.’ The results, published in the journal eLife, suggest that it is possible to see pain ‘happening’ inside the infant brain - and it looks a lot like pain in adults. Up until the 1980s it was common practice for babies to go without pain relief during surgery - they were given neuromuscular blocks to stop them moving, but otherwise were given no pain medication. A landmark study in 1987 suggested for the first time that doctors may have been wrong in their assumptions, and anaesthetics were introduced for major operations. But injections are still given and intravenous drips still inserted without pain relief, and far more serious procedures carried out anything to take away the child’s pain. Even this year, NHS guidelines are still being written that advise doctors to carry out seemingly painful procedures without anything more than ‘a cuddle’. Guidelines for a procedure to treat tongue-tie - a common problem in which the bottom of an infant’s tongue is attached to the mouth - still suggest that no pain relief is needed. The research, which was carried out by doctors from Oxford University (pictured) overturns the medical consensus that very young babies do not feel pain and do not need painkillers, even for invasive procedures . The NHS guidelines, updated in January 2015, advise that when the tongue is sliced from the mouth’s floor, infants do not need medication. Older babies who have already teethed should be given a general anaesthetic, doctors are told. But the guidelines say: ‘In small babies, being cuddled and fed is more important than painkillers.’ Dr Slater called for a review of the way tiny babies are treated. ‘Thousands of babies across the UK undergo painful procedures every day but there are often no local pain management guidelines to help clinicians,’ she said. ‘Our study suggests that not only do babies experience pain but they may be more sensitive to it than adults. ‘We have to think that if we would provide pain relief for an older child undergoing a procedure then we should look at giving pain relief to an infant undergoing a similar procedure.’ Her team scanned the brains of ten healthy infants aged between one and six days old, and compared them to the brains of ten adults aged 23 to 36 years. MRI scans were taken of the babies’ brains as they were poked on the bottom of their feet with a special retracting rod creating a sensation like being poked with a pencil – mild enough that it did not wake them up. The researchers found that 18 of the 20 pain regions in adults’ brains also ‘lit up’ in babies’ brains. Scans also showed that babies’ brains had the same response to a weak poke as adults did to a stimulus four times as strong - suggesting their pain thresholds are lower. Dr Slater said it is not clear which types of painkiller would be best used for babies. There are fears that local anaesthetics can be easily absorbed into the blood stream, with unknown consequences. ‘Finding the optimum pain relief for babies is clearly required,’ she said.","Young babies are more sensitive to pain than adults, according to study .

"Sometimes a shrill alarm tone isn't enough to get you out of bed. And for one lazy dog, even a constant head-pounding couldn't rouse her from sleep. Lori Smith filmed her pooch Boomer being repeatedly hit as she lay with her head resting on the ledge of her electronic dog door. With the door jammed, it is seen constantly moving up and down hitting her skull each time. 'She just sits here all day and doesn't even care,' Smith is heard saying as she watches the scene play out. 'That's awful!' a man  in the background adds. However, he can't help but giggle as he observes Boomer refusing to budge. After more than 20 seconds and numerous head taps, Boomer appears resting in the same position. One viewer said that perhaps the canine saw it as a type of head massage.

"Between getting children dresses, breakfast on the table, lunches packed and the school run, mornings can be one of the least relaxing times of day. And more specifically, a study of 2.3 million has revealed that 7.35am is the most hectic, frenzied time of the morning routine for Australian families. Sophie Falkiner, Australian TV presenter, model and mother of two, can testify to that. 'It’s crazy, in the mornings there is a million and one things to do - uniforms to be found, spelling tests to get done,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Crazy o'clock: A study of 2.3 million parents has pinpointed 7.35am as the most hectic, frenzied time of day in Australian households . Out the door: Getting breakfast, kids dressed and the school run is the cause of much mayhem . Mum of two: Sophie Falkiner has told Daily Mail Australia that she has a 'million and one' things to do in the mornings to get her children out the door . 'The kids get up at 7am so I have to get up at 6.30 to give myself time to have a coffee and get exercise in before starting the day,' the 41-year-old former Great Outdoors and Wheel of Fortune presenter added. According to the study, conducted by Kraft, breakfast is the top priority for parents - with an average of 140 hours spent making breakfast each year (equivalent to 25 minutes a day). 'We're out the door by 8am, so when we all have time to sit together and have breakfast it's the only zen time we have,' said Falkiner. Time it: Australian parents spend an average 140 hours per year getting children breakfast . 'It will only be 15-20 minutes together (and I wish it could be longer!) but these days people are time poor and its hard to get everything done and  be nutritious,' she said. 'My daughter’s not a breakfast person, so getting a quick nut spread and toast in is quick and easy before we head out the door.' The study also found that nut spreads are a popular choice for breakfast loving kids, with Aussie kids eating  spreads 6.7 times a week. Mum knows best:  Sophie Falkner, mum of two, believes nuts are high in protein and good for fussy eaters . Falkiner, who also has a certificate in nutrition says that nuts are a big part of her children's diet and are packed full of nutritional benefits. 'Nuts are packed with good protein. So the spreads are good for fussy eaters, they give your kids important brain food and energy, protein and it helps keep them full until lunch time.' Falkiner's tip is to mix up how you serve nut spreads to make it both fun and varied for kids. 'I will do peanut butter in celery sticks for the kids then on weekend as a treat they will get pancakes and hazelnut spread,' she said. Spread it around: Falkiner says mix up nut spreads during the week adding to celery sticks or pancakes . 'They'd eat the whole container in one go if they could, they ask all weekend and will look forward to having pancakes as special treat.' As for juggling a balance of work, life and kids, Falkiner says the being organised is key. 'I am one of those nerdy list makers and schedulers who uses  a list on the fridge to know where the whole family is each week,' she said. 'We have so much on our plates,  being a mum, taxi, organising play dates, after school parties, groceries, it's tough getting it all done, so being organised is the only way to it.'","New study reveals that Aussie parents spend 140 hours making breakfast .

"Increasing opposition to a £175 million ‘garden bridge’ championed by Boris Johnson could scupper the mayor’s plans for a new green space spanning the Thames. Local campaigners vigorously opposed to the bridge are calling for a parliamentary inquiry into the scheme ahead of a crucial judicial review next month, the Observer reported. They want lawmakers to look into the misuse of public funds. When the project first began it was promised it would be paid for in its entirety through private funds. £60 million of public money has been pledged by Boris Johnson and George Osborne - £30 million each – for the project. Local campaigners vigorously opposed to the bridge are calling for a parliamentary inquiry into the scheme ahead of a judicial review . The promises were made against a tide of criticism likening the scheme more to a privately managed tourist landmark than a bridge. The particulars of how the garden will actually operate indicate limited group sizes and perhaps even a ticketing system. The bridge will close for private, corporate events once a month and shut between the hours of midnight and 6 am. There will also be no provision for a cycle path across the bridge as previously outlined. Those opposed to the bridge garden have accused the Mayor and the Chancellor of disregarding guidelines while using money meant for public transport which would not normally benefit such a small group of people. The Director of the Waterloo Community Development group, Michael Ball, has said the £175 million could fund 30 million new London parks or the equivalent of 30 times the area of open space the bridge would give. Calling the bridge a ‘vanity project’ Ball was quoted as saying money should be available for the bridge through the Heritage Lottery Fund as is common practice. It has been claimed the garden could not be classified as transport structure as it would have no public right of way . He claimed the garden could not be classified as transport structure as it would have no public right of way. Ball asked how the scheme could be approved of through ‘normal processes’. The chair of the London Assembley’s budget and performance committee, John Biggs, accused Mr Johnson of sophistry. He highlighted the mayor’s previous statements that public money would not be used for the bridge only to reveal last month that public funds would be needed in perpetuity to underwrite the bridge’s yearly £3.5 million maintenance bill. George Osborne (left) and Boris Johnson (centre) have promised £30 million each for the scheme which Michael Ball (right) has called a vanity project . It was recently put forward by the London Assembly that the public have free access to the proposed bridge, considering how much taxpayers’ money was being used for it. In May a judicial review will consider Lambeth council’s handling of approval for the scheme. The bridge increasingly seems to be losing support of environmentalists who are sceptical of the garden. Grahame Madge, from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: 'Our view is very clear. It is an extremely expensive project for limited wildlife gain. 'Helping people get access to London's wildlife is a big priority for us - but the money could be spent elsewhere. 'We were quite interested in the project in the beginning but we realised it had limited benefits.' The bridge increasingly seems to be losing support of environmentalists who are sceptical of the garden .","Opposition to garden spanning the Thames, favoured by Boris Johnson, gathers speed as use of funds criticised .

"When it comes to singing lullabies, Audrey Hepburn's classic Moon River tops the chart for British parents, but you might be surprised by some of the other entries. In a survey conducted by BT, a third of parents polled said they belt out hip hop songs to soothe their little ones to sleep, while ten per cent opt for pop tunes. Eurythmics' There Must be an Angel came second on the top ten, followed by Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby, while more current hits from Pitbull, Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith also made the cut. Baby soother: When it comes to lullabies, the classic Moon River, which Audrey Hepburn famously sang in Breakfast at Tiffany's (pictured), tops the chart for British parents . Aside from Moon River - made famous from Audrey Hepburn's 1961 movie hit Breakfast At Tiffany's - Frank Sinatra's My Way also proved popular with parents, as did Dolly Parton's Island In The Stream. One rock 'n' roll classic made the cut, Sweet Child O'Mine by Guns 'N' Roses, as well as three recent pop songs; Sam Smith's Stay With Me, Pitbull and Kesha's Timber and Sing by Ed Sheeran. A quarter of mums polled said they sing songs from TV ads to send their babies to sleep, and a quarter of dads, somewhat unsurprisingly, turn to sport chants. Ireland's Call topped the list for rugby enthusiasts, followed by Swing Low Sweet Chariot, while Liverpool's You'll Never Walk Alone proved popular for football-loving dads. Eurythmics' There Must be an Angel came second on the top ten list, followed by Vanilla Ice's (left) Ice Ice Baby, while more current tunes from Pitbull, Ed Sheeran (right) and Sam Smith also made the cut . One in five parents admit they change the lyrics in lullabies because they don't them well enough, and one in ten insist it's because their version is better (picture posed by models) As for the true classics, Humpty-Dumpty ranked number one on the list, Rock-a-bye Baby ranked second and Three Blind Mice came third.

"Every country in the world may have its rich kids of Instagram, but in Mexico the increasingly ostentatious displays of wealth by the young elite is taking on a political dimension. In a country where a significant majority of citizens live in poverty, the self-styled Mirreyes (my kings), with their champagne and sports cars, are increasingly exposing the amount of wealth concentrated into a relatively small number of hands. Mirreyes, which refers to individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' and are 'placed above all others', post pictures of luxuries with a hashtag of the same name. Scroll down for video . Ballers and shotcallers: Mirreyes are often the sons and daughters of the members of Mexican high society .

Ready for takeoff: An expert on the subject of Mirreyes said 'the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts' Three for the money: Mirreyes' displays of wealth can  lead to political and legal advantages down the road . They are often the sons and daughters of government officials, wealthy businessman and other members of Mexican high society and although their displays of wealth can be embarrassing, they can also lead to political and legal advantages, Maclean's reported. One such individual, the eldest son of then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a cruise ship off the coast of Brazil during the 2014 World Cup and vanished without a trace, . Before he jumped off the ship's 15th floor and disappeared beneath the waves, 29-year-old Jorge Alberto López Amores told his friends to take cellphone videos of his leap. He said: 'I'll stop this cruise, I'll make history.' López got his wish as the boat stopped for two hours to search for him, according to Vivelo Hoy. His story is not the only example of the celebration of excess gone wrong. In 2012, the daughter of oil workers' union boss Carlos Romero Deschamps was brought into the spotlight for posting photos of her luxury lifestyle, including Gucci bags and expensive wine, on Facebook. Her flashy pictures did not sit well in a country where people work an average of 2 226 hours a year and households take in an average of $12,850 per year after taxes. Their stories are just examples of what the author of a book about Mirreyes called the Mexican 'Generation Me'.

Selfie star: López, the son of then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a yacht in 2014 . No need to pimp my ride: Mirreyes obtain cash from sources like inheritance, theft, corruption or the lottery . Kiss the bling: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes will either have a shiny watch, fancy champagne, or both . The author of Mirreynato, the Other Inequality, Ricardo Raphael, wrote in his book: 'The economic wealth Mirreyes use is the main marker of class. 'No matter where the money comes - work, inheritance, theft, corruption or lottery- the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts'. By identifying themselves as Mirreyes on social media, these seemingly spoiled brats are possibly creating connections which could be important for business and politics in the future because money attracts powerful friends. They are certainly being noticed. In 2011, a  a website called Mirrreybook was created by Pepe Ceballos. He began posting photos of mMirreyes on the site and it quickly became popular. Ceballos said: 'Mirreyes, who don't have anything to do with narcos [narcotics traffickers], seem like they're competing with them to see who has more. 'We've suddenly seen it in the kind of fashion or the bling-bling. There's more influence from the narcos.' In a recent source of embarrassment, Mirreyes were also featured in a controversial video that showcased the class of 2015 from private school Instituto Cumbres in Mexico City. In the professionally-produced video, well-dressed male students were shown drinking alcohol while carrying out a casting call with young women who dance, strip and wash their feet. Popping bottles: Mirreyes are individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' The flash and the not-so-furious: Members of this select group seem to have few reasons to be upset with life . Up in smoke: Some Mirreyes post photos implying they have something in common with narcotics traffickers . Look at me: The selfie has become somewhat of a status symbol and Mirreyes frequently use them to show off . Future endeavors: By identifying themselves on social media, Mirreyes are possibly creating good connections . The all-male  Catholic school was accused of sexism and promoting privilege after the video began to spread across the internet, according to the National Catholic Reporter. The school issued an apology late last month. It said: 'The Cumbres Institute Mexico asks for an apology for the content of the video that offended various persons, who have expressed anger. 'This video in no way represents the values and principles of the school, students, families and graduates. ''The necessary measures are being taken with the students involved and to establish rules so that it does not occur again.'

"Although St Mary’s Hospital in London is the first choice of venue for the delivery of the royal baby, hospitals in Reading and Norfolk are on standby . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s second child could be the first Royal to be born outside London for 85 years. Although St Mary’s Hospital in west London is the first choice of venue for the delivery, two other hospitals have been put on standby in case the Duchess leaves the capital. Kate is nearing the end of her pregnancy and is currently staying at Kensington Palace, less than two miles from the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s where Prince George was born in 2013. But it is understood that the Royal Berkshire in Reading and Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, have been told to prepare in case she goes into labour nearby. The 33-year-old may visit her parents in Bucklebury, Berkshire, this week – just 12 miles from the Reading hospital. Or she could opt to stay at Anmer Hall, the royal couple’s country home in Norfolk near Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The Duchess’s private obstetricians have been warned that they could be called to either location, The Daily Telegraph reports. Princess Margaret was the last member of the Royal Family to be born outside London. She was delivered at Glamis Castle, Scotland, in 1930. The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry were both born at St Mary’s, while the Prince of Wales, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward were delivered at Buckingham Palace. Although the Duchess’s due date has not been officially confirmed, she told well-wishers at a charity event last month: ‘I’m due mid-April, to the end of April.’ Bookmakers have predicted that the baby will arrive on April 24 or 25. Prince William is due to attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph on April 25 to mark the centenary of the First World War’s Gallipoli campaign. A royal spokesman said: ‘The Duke’s intention is to be at the commemorations. Being the 100th anniversary, it is very important to him.’ It is believed the Royal Berkshire in Reading and Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, have been told to prepare in case she goes into labour nearby.

"The mystery of what appears to be a screw fixed inside a rock (pictured) has perplexed scientists . An object that appears to be a screw fixed inside a rock has captured the world's attention since it was found in the 1990s, but the debate rages on about what it really is. Russian researchers believe the unusual object is 300 million years old, leading some people to claim that it may be proof of a highly advanced lost human civilisation, or even the work of aliens. However, experts suggest that there may be a more earthly answer –  that the ‘screw’ is in fact a fossilised sea creature. The researchers stumbled across the ‘screw’ after searching the Kaluga region after an asteroid strike occurred there, Ancient Code reported. The ‘screw’ measures an inch (2cm) long and was collected by a UFO and paranormal research team called the Kosmopoisk Group. They claim that the stone is between 300 and 320 million years old and after X-raying it, believe there is another hidden ‘screw’ inside the stone. But more conventional scientists have not got a look at the object, so have had to base their speculation on grainy pictures posted online. The Kosmopoisk Group has not said what the screw is made of, or given any detailed information about it. The self-styled group, which is also known as Spacesearch and the Russian Scientific Organisation, conducts expeditions to sites that are believed to have extraterrestrial activity or unusual creatures - and has a mixed reputation. Scroll down for video . The screw-like shape may actually be the reversed-shape of the creature, which gradually dissolved while the rock formed around it. Fossils of Jurassic crinoids collected in Israel are pictured . The leading hypothesis from experts who have seen photos of the stone is that the ‘screw' is actually the remains of an ancient sea creature called a crinoid. The screw-like shape may actually be the reversed-shape of the creature, which gradually dissolved while the rock formed around it. Some 600 species of Crinoids are now extinct but the creatures live on in different forms in modern seas. They have five  arms to snatch passing prey and a hidden mouth on the top. It is thought that the fossilised creature in the mysterious rock is a form of ‘sea lily’ – a type of crinoid that grew a stalk when it became an adult, to tether itself to the seabed. Crinoids were extremely common millions of years ago, and countless fossils have been found, some segments of which do resemble screws. Russian researchers have dated the unusual 'screw' to 300 million years old, leading some people to claim that it may be proof of a highly advanced lost human civilisation, or even the work of aliens (stock image) Researchers stumbled across the ‘screw’ after searching the Kaluga region after an asteroid strike occurred there. The ‘screw’ measures an inch (2cm) long and was collected by a UFO and paranormal research team called the Kosmopoisk Group . There are hundreds of species of extinct Crinoids, although the marine animal continues to live in seas today. Crinoids have a mouth on the top surface - next to their gut and anus - that's surrounded by feeding arms to grab passing prey. They generally have five main arms and a stem to attach themselves to rocks or the seabed. In fossilised form, the stem does resemble a screw. It's thought they were more common in ancient times, because limestone beds dating to the mid Palaeozoic are full of Crinoid fossils. The first Crinoids are thought to have appeared in the Ordovician period, between 488 million years ago and ending 444 million years ago and underwent a selective mass extinction at the end of the Permian period, where they evolved more flexible arms. Crinoid fossils look slightly different to reflect the variations across the species. However, some say that the stalks of crinoids were typically much smaller than the ‘screw’, with slightly different markings, and have discarded the theory. More far-fetched theories include that the 'screw' is the remains of an ancient form of technology that proves aliens lived on Earth millions of years ago, or that our ancestors were far more advanced than we think. Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual told MailOnline: ‘Lots of out-of-place artefacts have been reported, such as nails or even tools embedded in ancient stone. 'Some of these reports are…misinterpretations of natural formations. ‘In this case sceptics claim the screw is nothing more than the fossilised remains of a crinoid marine animal, while believers note that the screw is very different from the surrounding fossil evidence. ‘It would be great to think we could find such ancient evidence of a spaceship visiting us so long ago, but we have to consider whether extra-terrestrial spacecraft builders would use screws in the construction of their craft. ‘It also seems that this story is probably a hoax that is being spread by the internet, and reflects our desire to believe that extra-terrestrials have visited us in the past and are still visiting us today in what we now call UFOs.’ The leading hypothesis is that the ‘screw; is actually the remains of an ancient sea creature called a crinoid. It had a thick stem that attached it to the sea bed, which looks a bit like a screw when it's fossilised (pictured) Some 600 species of Crinoids are now extinct but the creatures live on in new forms in our seas today. This image shows a modern Crinoid, known as a Variable bushy feather star in the Philippines . The Alien that terrified people in the 1979 sci-fi film, was inspired by a crinoid. Swiss surrealist artist, Hans Rudolf Giger, created many artworks based on fossils, which were seen by Ridley Scott who commissioned Giger to make props for his film. Mr Giger's designs - one of which was all too memorably seen bursting out of a character's chest on screen - went on to win his team an Academy Award for Best Achievement for Visual Effects on the 1979 film and the franchise that followed. The Alien that terrified people in the 1979 sci-fi film, Alien (pictured) was inspired by a Crinoid . He was inspired by a 300-million-year-old Crinoid fossil, which was stolen in 2012. While the piece was returned to the Aathal dinosaur museum in Zurich, Switzerland, from which it was taken, it was slightly damaged. Museum curator Dr. Thomas Bolliger said: 'It was comparatively undamaged - although one of the arms had broken off. 'It really is a remarkable fossil and shows two separate species of a spineless animal that lived at the bottom of the sea around 300 million years ago.' A museum spokesman added: 'It is a very valuable but also a very unique fossil and it will be very difficult for anybody to sell or indeed to keep secret given the publicity around the theft.'

"During a recent episode of Divorce Court, a disgruntled man said the members of Wu-Tang Clan did something with his girlfriend - and it wasn't unleashing their famed Killa Beez. Nathan Sellers went on the show with his ex, Lia Palmquist, and accused her of sleeping with every member of the Wu-Tang Clan during one night as she partied with them at a hotel after a show. That would mean Palmquist had sex with the RZA, the GZA, Ghostface Killah, Masta Killa, U-God, Inspectah Deck, Raekwon, Cappadonna and Method Man. The tenth member of the Wu, Ol' Dirty Bastard, is dead so he wasn't involved no matter what. Nathan Sellers (right) went on Divorce Court with Lia Palmquist (left) and said she slept with the Wu-Tang Clan . American rap group Wu-Tang Clan (L - R) Ghostface Killah, Masta Killa, Raekwon, RZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, GZA, U-God and Method Man pose for a April 1997 portrait in New York City, New York. ODB is no longer alive . Palmquist admitted to partying with the guys from the Wu, but denied that she did anything sexual with them . Palmquist told show host Judge Lynn Toler: 'This sounds ridiculous, but he accused me of sleeping with the entire Wu-Tang Clan.' Sellers quickly fired back: 'She did.' The accused woman went on to tell Judge Toler that she did hang with the Clan on their tour bus and stay at their hotel until 7am talking politics, but maintained she stayed faithful to Sellers. She said: 'Nothing inappropriate happened and let me just put on the record that Wu-Tang is nothing but gentleman. 'They treated me highly respectful. 'I would never cheat on him. 'I would never be a bust-down or a groupie in that type of situation.' Unfortunately her ex-boyfriend wasn't buying it and Sellers said: 'She gave Wu some tang.' It's unclear who Judge Lynn believed, but she did say Palmquist engaged in 'bust-down behavior'. Sellers wasn't buying anything that his ex-girlfriend had to say and told the judge: 'She gave Wu some tang' It's unclear who Judge Lynn believed in the matter, but she did say Palmquist engaged in 'bust-down behavior' In March, the Wu-Tang Clan opened the silver box that held their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin . Sellers and Palmquist went on Divorce Court after being together for five years, according to the show's description of the episode. It read: 'The two met at a Halloween party where Lia was dressed as Lil Kim and Nathan was dressed as Hello Kitty. 'Lia says things were good for the first few years they dated until Nathan moved six hours away to attend school. 'Lia says Nathan then moved to San Francisco for a few months chasing his dreams of being a fashion designer, before moving back in with her again. 'Lia says her sex life with Nathan is non-existent right now. 'She says she wants a traditional family with kids, and she doesn’t think Nathan does.' Earlier this year, the Wu-Tang Clan opened the silver box that held their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin and sold the 31-track double LP to one bidder for millions of dollars. Under the terms of the sale, the buyer cannot share the album for at least 88 years. DailyMail.com was there with RZA, producer Cilvaringz, a small group of prospective buyers and half a dozen selected fans in Queens, New York City, for a playing of the album.

"If Dartmouth College students have the same inflated influence on presidential politics that they've traditionally enjoyed, Hillary Clinton has some long days ahead in New Hampshire. Of a randomly selected group of 50 students who said they followed presidential politics enough to comment, just nine told Daily Mail Online that the former secretary of state would make a good U.S. chief executive. Hillary's detractors were far more passionate than her fans – a potential problem since she needs a repeat of her grassroots-driven upset 2008 victory here in order to solidify her status as the Democrats' standard-bearer. Stacey Benton, a government major from Florida who leans Republican, said a President Hillary Clinton is 'just going to continue a lot of things Obama has been doing.' 'There hasn't been much good in Obama's foreign policy,' Benton added. She called Clinton 'grizzled' from a life in politics and said that 'just because she's a woman doesn't mean she should be president.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . THE COLLEGE ON THE HILL: Dartmouth is the only Ivy Leage school in an early presidential primary state, making it an intellectual hotspot for candidates looking to read the younger generation's tea leaves . HELLO, NEW HAMPSHIRE! Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is in the Granite State this week for her first swing since declaring her candidacy for the White House . Twenty-two of the 50 Dartmouth students interviewed on Sunday mentioned the deadly 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya as a black mark on Clinton's record. Many of them, like freshman Cameron Poole, weren't old enough to drive when it happened. 'I think there was blood on her hands,' Poole told Daily Mail Online, referring to Clinton's handling of an Islamist terror group's military-style assault that laid waste to a State Department facility. He said he believes Clinton's performance before, during and after should disqualify her from holding higher office. 'I definitely do,' he said. 'It shows how she acts under pressure.' Like most of his classmates, Poole was born during Bill Clinton's second term as president. Team Hillary is carefully cultivating his generation's progressives and moderates, emphasizing her grandmotherly listening skills while papering over her liabilities. Poole said he knows why Clinton isn't emphasizing her eight years as a presidential spouse. 'It almost seems like she tried to use the position of first lady to nudge her way into possessing political power,' he mused, dropping hints about her 'Hillarycare' medical insurance overhaul proposal. 'But I wasn't too old at the time.' New Hampshire election law allows college students to choose whether to register to vote at home or at school. Many of the students Daily Mail Online spoek with said they hadn't decided yet; but all of those wh ohad made up their mind said they would vote in the Granite State. POLITICAL CROSSROADS: Hanover, New Hampshire is a frequent presidential primary debate site, hosting Democrats in 2007 and Republicans (pictured) in 2011 . Most of the  students who said they would vote for Hillary Clinton said they have little knowledge of her history before she led the State Department. 'I don't know that much about her political baggage,' conceded San Mateo, California native Maya Poddar, 19. But she insisted that Clinton would make a strong candidate because of her support for liberal positions on social issues. 'I think it's ridiculous that we haven't progressed to the point in society where things like gay marriage aren't still questioned,' Poddar said. Other left-leaning students were lukewarm or directly hostile to Clinton. Dartmouth College government student Stacey Benton said of Clinton that 'just because she's a woman doesn't mean she should be president' Robin Jayaswal of Portland, Oregon, a budding economist, would say only that 'she definitely is one of the more qualified Democrats for the position.' Robert Stackhouse, a Fort Worth, Texas native, told Daily Mail Online that 'she doesn't look like that fantastic a candidate.' Stackhouse has few quibbles about Obama's foreign policy – 'it was probably more positive than negative,' he said – but isn't reassured by the idea of one of his secretaries of state taking over the Oval Office. 'It seems like she wants the job more than she would be good at it,' said Stackhouse. Dartmouth, the only Ivy League school in an early presidential primary state, is picture-postcard-beautiful but also isolated. Hanover, New Hampshire is 80 miles away from the nearest commercial airport and more than a two-hour drive from Boston. So political discussions happen in a vacuum. 'We're in a bubble here,' one student nearing graduation told Daily Mail Online during a Sunday full of interviews in dining halls, academic study lounges and dorm rooms. The entire Granite State is in some ways a closed information ecosystem, built half of Boston exurbs and half of towns best described as small, smaller and smallest. Manchester, the state's biggest city, has a population that barely ticks above 100,000. Fully 70 per cent of New Hampshire towns are home to fewer than 5,000. But the first-in-the-nation primary state's voters wield enormous influence every four years, and Dartmouth is their intellectual center of gravity. Clinton is visiting New Hampshire on Monday and Tuesday for the first time since she launched her presidential campaign online a week ago. A LIFETIME AGO: Hillary Clinton was first lady from 1993 to 2001, years when today's Dartmouth College undergraduates were born . OUTSIZE INFLUENCE: Dartmouth sits in a town of 11,000 and remains both the northernmost and the smallest of the eight famed Ivy League universities . Her organization's first seven days afloat were an experiment in rebranding a four-decades political veteran as a grinning grandma tuned in to the concerns of average voters. It's a farcical ploy that just might work, according to Julia Lau, a Dartmouth economics major from Honolulu, Hawaii. 'Her life has always been in the spotlight,' said Lau. 'I think that's why it's really interesting that she tried to go with this ""everyday American"" campaign.' 'Everybody knows that her life has not necessarily been about the everyday American.' Lau said if Clinton is the Democrats' nominee, she would more likely than not vote for her anyway. 'Any attempt at trying to reach out to the everyday citizen is always going to be a good thing ... whether it's just for show or if it's actually genuine,' Lau said. A young woman seated next to her in a campus cafeteria listened intently and summed up the philosophy: 'Fake it 'til you make it.' Answers to two questions about Clinton seem to unite Dartmouth students: Neither her age nor her sex matters much to today's collegiate elites. Clinton would be the second-oldest U.S. president, and 'people are going to bring up her age, but that doesn't really matter,' said Kevin Muzzi, a Democratic-leaning upperclassman from Greenville, Mississippi who voted for President Obama in 2012. ONE-PERCENTER: 'Everybody knows that her life has not necessarily been about the everyday American,' Dartmouth student Julia Lau said of Clinton . 'Age is not a huge factor for me,' added government student Alex Frye of New Albany, Ohio. 'And I hope gender is a non-factor. I think it should be a non-factor.' Jacob Cutler, a history major from Maryland, said, 'It may be a historic thing, but it shouldn't matter. I don't really care what the gender of the person is. It's whether their ideas are good.' That's the problem, Cutler added. 'She obviously has a lot of experience in a lot of ways, but what might keep her from winning is what she did with that experience,' he said. 'Under Obama I really think we've made a lot of mistakes' with foreign policy, he explained, 'and some [were] under her tenure.' 'I don't know what she would do to change things. I think that's for her to clear up.' It's early in the 2016 race, and for every student who talked with Daily Mail Online another two said they wouldn't start paying close attention until the fall. In October 2011 Dartmouth hosted a memorable Republican primary debate that included now-forgotten names like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain. Four years earlier it was the Democratic Party that took over Hanover for a day, back when Barack Obama was just finding his voice. Maryland native Jacob Cutler, pictured with unofficial Dartmouth mascot 'Keggy,' said electing the first female president 'may be a historic thing, but it shouldn't matter. I don't really care what the gender of the person is' But sometimes lightning in New Hampshire can strike early. It was in May 1987 – almost as early in the cycle as today's candidates find themselves – when Sen. Gary Hart's campaign imploded during a press conference in the Hanover Inn, just steps from the Dartmouth College green. The pothole in his road to the White House was an affair with model Donna Rice. Their trysting spot: a boat named 'Monkey Business.' There's not a single Dartmouth undergraduate today who was alive then. 'Most of the things I know about her were during her time as secretary of state,' said Alex Frye, a government major from New Albany, Ohio. 'I don't know much about what she did as a senator, or before that.' 'It's hard for me to think of any particular accomplishments,' Frye told Daily Mail Online. 'I suppose – I know she visited the most countries of any secretary of state.' 'But when you see a bunch of messes abroad, you kind of think of who was – well, it falls under who was secretary of state at the time.'","Dartmouth is the only Ivy League school in an early primary state, giving he school enormous influence and a recurring role hosting primary debates .

"A 25-year-old man left brain damaged as a baby after a blunder by doctors has today won his 23-year battle for £7.3 million compensation. The young man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, now relies on 24-hour care. He was born at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital in September 1989, but was readmitted three months later, suffering a serious brain haemorrhage. Maternity staff at the hospital failed to administer a vitamin K injection shortly after the man was born. A 25-year-old man was left brain damaged as a baby after doctors at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital failed to administer a vitamin K injection to help the blood clot and prevent internal bleeding. He now requires 24-hour care and will do for the rest of his life. (File picture) The booster is given to newborn babies to reduce their risk of blood clots. The Secretary of State for Health admitted liability, accepting the failure to give the man vitamin K breached their duty of care. At London's High Court today, Judge Michael Yelton approved the £7.3 million settlement, to be paid by the NHS Litigation Authority. It awards the man a lump sum of £2,345,000, as well as annual payments of £181,000, rising to £192,000 - making a total of £7,385,000. Vitamin K helps the blood to clot, and as a result can prevent excessive internal bleeding. In the UK new parents are asked if they would like their newborn to recieve the supplement. Babies are born with low levels of the vitamin, but the amount is normally enough to prevent problems. Some babies are at greater risk, and are more likely to suffer haemorrhagic disease of the newborn, also known as vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Because it can be difficult to ascertain which babies are at heightened risk, the Department of Health recommends all babies receive the supplement soon after birth. Though rare, HDN is a very serious disease. Half of all babies with HDN suffer a haemorrhage into their brain, often resulting in brain damage. Babies at higher risk of HDN include: . Source: NCT . Judge Yelton said the man should not be named because he was a 'vulnerable person'. But he said he was 'entirely satisfied' the settlement was in his best interests. He said he was 'very pleased' for the young man and his family. The brain damage the now 25-year-old suffered has resulted in significant cognitive and physical problems, including a weakness on his left hand side, and reduced hearing. He also lacks the capacity to manage his own affairs, and needs round the clock care. His family welcomed the settlement, adding it will allow for specialist support, specially adapted accommodation and 24-hour care. His solicitor Arani Yogadeva of Irwin Mitchell said: 'Vitamin K injections are offered to parents as a measure to boost their newborn baby's anti-clotting processes shortly after birth and reduce the risks of them suffering excessive bleeding caused by a deficiently in the vitamin. 'In this case, midwives and doctors chose not to provide him with the relevant dose without advising his mother about the vitamin and the importance of it - a decision which has had serious repercussions. 'We are delighted to have helped the family secure vital financial support, along with an admission of liability. 'It will ensure he gets the lifelong care he requires and also urge hospitals to ensure that guidance is following in relation to the issue of vitamin K.' At London's High Court today, Judge Michael Yelton approved the £7.3 million settlement, to be paid by the NHS Litigation Authority following a 23-year battle .","25-year-old was left brain damaged after doctors failed to administer vitamin K shortly after he was born at Luton and Dunstable Hospital .

"Millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst has pleaded not guilty to two weapons charges related to his arrest last month, further delaying his extradition to California to face murder charges. Durst entered his plea during an arraignment in a New Orleans court on weapons charges that accused him of possessing a firearm after a felony conviction and possessing both a firearm and an illegal drug, marijuana. Durst's hands were shackled to his sides, and two defense attorneys lifted him from an armchair to his feet to walk to the podium. Unlikely to face charges in California anytime soon: Robert Durst, 71, pleaded not guilty Thursday to two state gun charges in Louisiana in a case that would delay his extradition to LA to face murder charges. Durst is pictured here last month in New Orleans . Attorney Dick DeGuerin whispered into Durst's ear as he entered the plea. He had to whisper twice before Durst said, 'I am not guilty, your honor.' Judge Franz Zibilich asked if Durst was making that plea to both charges against him. DeGuerin whispered again, and Durst said, 'Yes, your honor.' The weapons arrest has kept Durst in New Orleans even though he waived extradition to California, where he's charged in the December 2000 death of a longtime friend. Durst is being held without bail in the mental ward of a state prison. Durst's story also is playing out two miles away in federal court in New Orleans. An affidavit filed there accuses Durst of breaking a federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms. Prosecutors have asked a U.S. magistrate judge to order Durst to be brought to federal court for a hearing next Thursday — and that he remain in U.S. custody until the federal matter is resolved. Durst, an estranged member of the family that runs 1 World Trade Center in New York, has had multiple run-ins with the law over his nearly 72 years. He was arrested in New Orleans last month on the eve of the finale of a six-part HBO documentary called 'The Jinx' about Durst, the disappearance of his first wife in 1982, the death of a longtime friend in 2000 and the death and dismemberment of a neighbor in Galveston in 2001. Murdered: Susan Berman, who acted as a media spokesperson for Durst in the wake of his wife's disappearance, was shot in the head at her LA home in 2000, just as the cold case into the disappearance of Kathleen Durst was reopened. Durst was charged with Berman's murder last month . A self-defense plea won acquittal in the death of Morris Black, but Durst is charged in Los Angeles with murder in the death of longtime friend Susan Berman, 55, who was shot in the head in 2000. Berman, an author, acted as a media spokesperson for Durst in the wake of his wife's disappearance. The Jinx suggested she knew a lot about Durst. Her death coincided with the cold case of Kathleen Durst's disappearance being reopened. Durst's lawyers, DeGuerin and Billy Gibbens, have said repeatedly that he just wants to go to California to deal with that charge. They also have challenged the weapons charges on several grounds, including the allegation that the FBI 'rummaged' through Durst's belongings before getting an arrest or search warrant. But Andrea Armstrong, a criminal law professor at Loyola University in New Orleans, said Wednesday that 'the fact that it was warrantless doesn't necessarily mean it was unconstitutional.' There are at least 11 circumstances, starting with consent, that make it legal to search without a warrant, she said. DeGuerin also has argued that the two felonies to which Durst pleaded guilty in Pennsylvania — possessing a firearm while a fugitive and doing so while under indictment — are not among those that would make it illegal for him to have a gun. Until his indictment Wednesday, Durst had been arrested but not formally charged in connection with the .38-caliber revolver authorities say was found in his room at the J.W. Marriott, where he was staying under the name Everette Ward. According to court testimony, an FBI agent recognized Durst in a New Orleans hotel March 14 and escorted him to his hotel room. Durst was arrested early March 15 on the Los Angeles warrant and arrested separately on the weapons charges the next day. Durst's lawyers say the arrest in New Orleans was timed to coincide with the final episode of 'The Jinx,' which also described the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, in 1982 from New York; the Los Angeles shooting of Berman, 55, in 2000; and Black's death in 2001.","Robert Durst was indicted Wednesday on the two weapons charges that have kept him in New Orleans .

"A financial fund for killer cop Michael Slager was shut down by crowd-funding website, GoFundMe, on Wednesday. The site told Daily Mail Online that 'after review by our team, the campaign set up for Officer Slager was removed due to a violation of GoFundMe's terms & conditions' but refused to elaborate due to privacy concerns. Slager has been charged with the murder of unarmed black father Walter Scott, 50, who was fatally shot five times in the back in North Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday. Slager, 33, was terminated from the police force on Wednesday. A separate fundraising campaign was started on site, Indiegogo, titled the 'Michael T. Slager Support Fund' and featured a picture of Slager in his police uniform. As of Thursday at 11am, it had raised $393 of a $5,000 goal on donations from 20 people after being set up on Wednesday. Two hours later, that total had jumped to $541. Scroll down for video . An Indiegogo page  to raise money in support of police officer Michael Slager had $393 of a $5,000 goal on Thursday - the company told Daily Mail Online 'they don't judge' as long as content fits their terms of use . A well-wisher of the accused killer cop gave a private donation to the fundraising page on Indiegogo and listed their name as 'trayvon' - perhaps in a twisted reference to Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012 . Officer Michael Slager is pictured standing over Walter Scott's body and feeling for a pulse after he put the man's fallen body in handcuffs. According to police reports, officers performed CPR on the 50-year-old father - but the cop was not filmed giving any medical assistance . Opening fire: Michael Slager, a police officer in Charleston, South Carolina, was caught on video shooting dead 50-year-old black man Walter Scott after reportedly stopping him over a broken tail light on Saturday . One of the individuals who donated listed their name as 'Trayvon' - perhaps a twisted reference to Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012. An explanation of the fundraising campaign reads: 'We're campaigning to show our Support for Officer Michael T. Slager! 'We believe in all of our LEOs and want to publicly support them! Although he may have made mis-steps in judgement he was protecting the community. 'Michael is a former Coast Guardsman with two stepchildren and a wife who is expecting a child, served for more than five years with the department without being disciplined. Please help in any way you can.' Killing: Walter Scott, left, was killed by Michael Slager, right. Scott was a U.S. Coast Guard veteran. Police officer Michael Sagler, (pictured right in his prison mugshot), who has been charged with his murder also was a member of the Coast Guard . A Facebook page was set up to support the cop who has been charged with murder and terminated from the police force . The statement then repeated: 'He has served five years with the department without being disciplined.' A separate Facebook page and Twitter account were set up linking to the fundraising site. The social media accounts appear to have been established by the same person, who tweeted: 'We're not here to judge wrong or right, there are two sides to every story. Let the courts decide after careful review.' The social media pages attracted dozens of negative comments. Marquese Lewis posted on the Facebook page supporting Slager: 'How about the real reason is you are an ignorant racist supporting a murderer.' Bruce A McIntyre added: 'If he cannot afford a lawyer, the court will appoint a Public Defender for him. Surely he is fine with that, as that is all most of his arrestees ever get.' In a statement to Daily Mail Online, an Indiegogo spokesperson said: 'Indiegogo allows anyone, anywhere to fund ideas that matter to them and just like other open platforms -- such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter - we don’t judge the content of campaigns as long as they are in compliance with our Terms of Use.' Indiegogo's list 'Prohibited Campaigns' includes those 'to raise funds for illegal activities, to cause harm to people or property, or to scam others'. The rules state: 'Campaign Owners shall not make any false or misleading statements in connection with their Campaigns.' The crowd-funding 'community guidelines go further and explain the website is not a place for 'hatred, abuse, discrimination, disrespect, profanity, meanness, harassment, or spam'. It reads on: 'Do not use to promote violence, degradation, subjugation, discrimination or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, or gender identity.' A Twitter account also supported Michael Slager after he fatally shot a father-of-four. The social media accounts appear to have been established by the same person . On Wednesday, North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey said that Slager's wife, who is eight months' pregnant, will still receive health insurance from the city until after her baby was born because it was the 'humane thing to do'. Last year, GoFundMe came under fire after allowing fundraising for Darren Wilson, a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri who shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown. In five days, people gave half a million-dollars to two fundraising pages for Wilson. The page has since been removed. Wilson resigned from the Ferguson police force but was not charged with any crime after a grand jury hearing.","GoFundMe told Daily Mail Online 'that after review, the campaign set up for Officer Slager was removed due to a violation of terms & conditions'

"Tom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson has revealed she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The 58-year-old actress, who took a leave of absence from Broadway play 'Fish in the Dark' earlier this month, shared the news  through a statement published by People magazine on Tuesday. She explained that her first test for cancer came back negative but that she was correctly diagnosed after seeking a second opinion and underwent the procedure last week. 'Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,' she said in the statement. Scroll down for video . By her side: Rita Wilson, who is married to Tom Hanks (pictured together in February), announced on Tuesday that she was recently diagnosed with cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy . 'I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.' Before the diagnosis, Wilson said she had 'vigilantly monitored' her health with mammograms and MRIs because she knew she had an underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ)'. The mother-of-two explained that she recently underwent a breast biopsy, but no sign of cancer was discovered until she sought the opinion of a second doctor on the advice of a friend. The doctor discovered the cancer and she then sought out the opinion of another pathologist, who confirmed the diagnosis, she said. Rita, who married Oscar-winner Tom in 1988, went on to implore others to seek a second opinion before thanking her loved ones for their support. 'I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,' she said. 'You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.' On Facebook on Tuesday, she encouraged other women to seek a 'necessary and vital' second opinion if they found themselves in similar situations. 'Not just by another doctor but by another pathologist,' she added. 'I'm doing well and getting stronger every day.' Advice: She shared the news on Facebook and linked to a statement printed by People magazine. Her cancer was not found in the first round of tests so she encourgaed others to seek a second opinion, like she did . Treatment: Wilson, pictured last year, said she underwent two  breast biopsies before she was diagnosed . Following her announcement, famous friends passed on their best wishes to the actress. 'Sending the wonderful Rita Wilson my love and best wishes for a speedy recovery and good health,' Katie Couric wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning. Christiana Amanpour added: 'Wishing my good friend @RitaWilson the best as she makes this important announcement, which will help millions of women and their families.' 'Sending all my love to the brave and beautiful @RitaWilson,' Josh Groban tweeted. Wilson released the statement on Tuesday after it was announced earlier this month that she had temporarily left the Broadway play, written by and starring Larry David. At the time, a spokesperson said Wilson was expected to return to the stage on May 5. While on medical leave, she has been replaced by Glenne Headly. Support: Celebrity friends flocked to Twitter to pass their best wishes to the actress after her announcement . Thankful: CNN host Christiane Amanpour noted how Wilson's statement will help future families . Admiration: Singer Josh Groban also sent his best wishes to the actress on Twitter on Tuesday . By her side: Actress Christina Applegate also sent her love to Wilson . Wilson is also known as the mother of Marnie, played by Allison Williams, in HBO's 'Girls'. She has two sons with Hanks, Chester Marlon, 24, and Truman Theodore, 19, as well as two stepchildren from Hanks' previous marriage - actor Colin Hanks, 37, and writer Elizabeth, 32 - to whom Wilson is close. Hanks and their mother, Samantha Lewes, had met in college but divorced in 1987, the year before he married Wilson. Lewes passed away in 2002, when she was just 49, after battling bone cancer. Wilson's message to other women to get screened comes just days after Taylor Swift revealed her mother, Andrea, had been diagnosed with cancer. She also urged her fans to remind their parents to get checked. Family: Wilson is pictured with Hanks and one of their sons, Chester, in December 2011. The couple has two sons together and Hanks is also father to a daughter and son from his first marriage . Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast and spreads in a web-like manner. Due to this, it does not typically form a lump, as is expected with breast cancer, and instead causes a thickening of the tissue, making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas. Other symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast, such as dimpling, or an inverted nipple. Women with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types, and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types. The cancer is invasive, which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body. It can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms. Mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer. Treatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year, and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas. The earlier the diagnosis, the better the prognosis. Patients have a slightly better outlook for both short- and long-term survival compared to other types of breast cancer. According to a study by Breast Cancer Research, the five-year survival rate is 85 per cent.","The 58-year-old actress revealed her diagnosis in a statement on Tuesday .

"A plane seat specifically targeted at making plane travel more comfortable for obese passengers and small children has won a prize for its innovation vision this week. The adapted chair by SII Deutschland, beat off competition from 21 finalists to win the Passenger Comfort Hardware award at The Crystal Cabin Awards in Hamburg, Germany. Sitting at one-and-a-half times the width of a standard seat, the SANTO seat (Special Accommodation Needs for Toddlers and Overweight Passengers) aims to improve aircrew procedure and passenger safety. Passenger Comfort Hardware winner: The SANTO seat by SII Deutschland is larger than usual seats, and makes use of space at the back of aircraft where the fuselage narrows . The adapted seat would make use of the usually wasted space at the back of aircraft, where the fuselage narrows. It would be a larger version of the aircraft chairs, meaning a wider passenger could comfortably and safety fit in the chair, without disrupting the neighbouring customer. As the SANTO seat has an extra half a seat width, a baby seat could be fitted securely into the chair, with enough space for a regular customer to sit alongside without paying for an extra seat. The designs were judged by a team of 24 experts, including panel chairwoman Melissa Raudebaugh, General Manager of Aircraft Experience at Delta Air Lines. 'Selecting the Crystal Cabin Award winners was a tough decision this year, as all finalists were of very high quality - ranging from renowned manufacturers to inspiring university concepts, which we will hopefully see flying soon', said Raudebaugh, as reported by PR Newswire. The seat won the prize as part of the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, and addresses the issue of the safety for obese passengers . Not only being space effective, the larger chair aims to address the on-going debate about whether  to charge obese passengers for two seats. Some American airlines have adopted this principle if customers are unable to buckle their seatbelt without the use of a seatbelt extender. In 2011 a male passenger claims he was forced to stand for seven hours in the aisle of a plane on his US Airways flight, from Anchorage to Philadelphia, as a 400lb man took up a lot of his seat. Another solution was put forward by Samoa Air in 2013 charging customers depending on their weight, in a bid to reduce fuel costs. Visitors look at Expliseat wide seats weighing four kilos at  the Aircraft Interiors Expo 2014. It is the leading trade fair for aircraft cabin designers and presents novelties in design, entertainment and connectivity . The Crystal Cabin Awards were awarded as part of Aircraft Interiors Expo which aims to showcase world's most advanced and creative ideas for the aircraft cabin. The SANTO was not the only seat design aiming to solve the issue of comfort when it comes to overweight passengers. Expliseat also displayed wider seating designs to accommodate larger passnegers. Prestigious aviation companies such as B/E Aerospace and Etihad Airways showed their concepts at the international trade fair of aircraft interiors which took place from April 14 to 16. Other awarded ideas included B/E Aerospace's solar cell films on cabin windows, and a vacuum technology to reduce space of waste by lavatories and trash bags created by Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. Premium Class & VIP: A380 Upper Deck by Etihad (UAE) One highlight this year was in the head-to-head A380-First Class race between two airlines from the United Arab Emirates. Etihad Airways won by a nose with its 'A380 Upper Deck'. Etihad is the first airline in the world to install a three room apartment in a commercial airliner, the 'Residence by Etihad'. Behind the Residence is the First Class Cabin with nine compartments and 70 Business Class seats. Greener Cabin, Health, Safety & Environment: Solar Eclipse by B/E Aerospace (USA) A thin solar cell film is installed in the sun visor of the cabin window, providing passengers with electricity to charge their electronic devices during flight. Although the system is still under development, the manufacturer is already working on achieving production approval soon. Industrial Design & Visionary Concepts: E2 Cabin Concept by Embraer (Brazil) The cabin for Embraers E2 generation of regional jets, is characterised by an innovative, easy maintenance design. The use of space is especially well thought-out. Special baggage lockers, for example, and a staggered seating concept, provide more space in the aircraft. Passenger Comfort Hardware: SANTO Seat by SII Deutschland (Germany) The 'SANTO Seat' (Special Accommodation Needs for Toddlers and Overweight Passengers) is beneficial for both passengers and airlines. The normally wasted space at the rear of the aircraft cabin, where the fuselage narrows, is used by a special seat, one-and-a-half times the width of a normal seat. The seat is ideal for overweight passengers and for passengers with small children. For these passengers, the seat is safer than a standard seat. Passenger Comfort Systems: Exede in the Air by ViaSat (USA) The satellite-powered 'Exede in the Air' solution brings a 12 Mbps internet connection to every seat, allowing passengers to stream films or shop online above the clouds without difficulty. Material & Components: LEXAN XHR2000 by SABIC Innovative Plastics (UAE) The 'LEXAN XHR2000' film has a transparency level of 80 percent, currently the highest possible level. Application possibilities range from windows to surface elements within the cabin, providing interior designers in particular with completely new possibilities. University: Trash Compactor by Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (Germany) Marc Spille a student of aviation studies, in collaboration with Airbus, developed a mobile trash container which uses the vacuum technology of the on-board lavatory to compress trash bags into a space-saving format within seconds.","The SANTO seat (Special Accommodation Needs for Toddlers and Overweight Passengers) won the prize for Passenger Comfort Hardware .

"An American soldier was killed in a shooting incident Wednesday in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad in which at least two other U.S. troops were wounded when an Afghan soldier opened fire at them, a U.S. official said. The incident happened after a meeting between Afghan provincial leaders and a U.S. Embassy official in the compound of the provincial governor in Jalalabad. All U.S. Embassy staff were accounted for and returned safely to their mission, the embassy said. NATO confirmed one of its soldiers died in the attack, without providing the nationality of the slain soldier, as is the coalition's policy.

"Ramon C. Estrada, 62, was set to be paroled in less than three weeks when he died on Sunday . A Utah prison inmate is dead of an apparent heart attack related to renal failure after a dialysis provider didn't show up for a scheduled treatment for two days in a row, a prison official said Tuesday. Ramon C. Estrada, 62, was set to be paroled in less than three weeks when he died Sunday at the prison in Draper, Utah Department of Corrections spokeswoman Brooke Adams said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. He was scheduled to have dialysis Friday at the prison's treatment center, but a technician did not show up on Friday or Saturday. The technician or technicians involved worked for a University of Utah Hospital clinic that provides dialysis for the prison. Kathy Wilets, a University of Utah Hospital spokeswoman, said there appears to have been some miscommunication with South Valley Dialysis technician scheduling, and the hospital is investigating. 'We have a responsibility to provide quality care for patients. We will now conduct a thorough review of the circumstances that led to this unacceptable mistake and will take whatever steps are necessary to improve communications and procedures,' Wilets said in a statement. The organization was saddened to learn of Estrada's death, she said. Adams said six other inmates had been waiting for dialysis treatment and were taken to a hospital for evaluation. Four of them were treated, and one of the four remained hospitalized Tuesday afternoon. The other two inmates were returned to their cells.  Adams did not have details about how long the four admitted to the hospital went without dialysis treatment. The Utah State Medical Examiner's office will conduct an autopsy on Estrada's body and determine his cause of death, Adams said. The corrections department's law enforcement bureau is investigating, but an initial review indicates that Estrada's lack of treatment may have played a role in his death, Adams said. The prison's clinical services director has been placed on leave as the department investigates how prison staff and South Valley Dialysis responded and how a similar situation can be prevented. prisoner: Ramon C. Estrada died at Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah after a dialysis provider failed to show for two days in a row . The department is taking immediate steps to ensure the prison has contact numbers for technicians scheduled to show up and that prison staff are notified when technicians show up for treatment and that they report on inmate conditions, Adams said. Adams said she did not have details about whether prison staff tried to contact the technicians when they failed to show. She told The Associated Press that was part of the ongoing investigation. The Unified Police Department, which covers Salt Lake County, is also investigating. Unified Police Lt. Justin Hoyal said investigators are waiting for autopsy results to pinpoint the cause of death, but didn't find any signs of foul play in the man's cell. Estrada had been in prison since August 2005 on a rape conviction, Adams said. He was scheduled to be paroled on April 21. Estrada was from Mexico and believed to have been in the country illegally, Adams said. He would have been turned over to the U.S. Marshals Service when his sentence was complete, she said. Randall W. Richards, a lawyer who represented Estrada in 2005, did not return messages seeking comment Tuesday. It was unclear if Estrada had an attorney at the time of his death.","Ramon C.

"An Islamic State sympathizer who was plotting to carry out an attack on a US military base similar to the deadly assault at Fort Hood in 2009 has been arrested. John T. Booker Jr, was detained in Manhattan, Kansas, on Friday morning and charged with multiple terror offenses, including attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. The 20-year-old, who refers to himself as Muhammad Abdullah Hassan, is said to have targeted nearby Fort Riley and planned to use a 1,000lb car bomb to blow himself up and kill 'people with power'. Booker was shown how to arm the bomb, which was actually a dud, and taken to a supposed secret gate to enter the base by FBI informants before being arrested around 9am. A religious leader who had counseled the 'troubled' young man said that he was mentally ill. Scroll down for video . Detained: John T. Booker Jr, who refers to himself as Muhammad Abdullah Hassan, has been arrested after being accused of planning a suicide bomb attack on a US military base . Booker was also charged with attempting to damage property by means of an explosive and providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He allegedly planned to drive a van bomb built by the FBI informants, including a man who pretended to be a 'high-ranking sheikh planning terrorist acts in the United States', into Fort Riley. Authorities say he never actually breached the perimeter of the base. Imam Omar Hazim of the Islamic Center of Topeka told The Associated Press that two FBI agents brought Booker to him last year for counseling, hoping to turn the young man away from radical beliefs. The young man came to the FBI's attention last year after an unidentified citizen complained to federal authorities about concerning Facebook messages he posted. On March 19, he allegedly wrote: 'Getting ready to be killed in jihad is a HUGE adrenaline rush!! I am so nervous. NOT because I'm scared to die but I am eager to meet my lord.' Imam Omar Hazim, who counseled the suspect, said that the young man was 'troubled' Imam Omar Hazim began counseling John Booker at the request of the FBI last year, though he now says 'maybe he came to me too late'. The Islamic Center of Topeka leader said that he had tried to guide the 20-year-old away from radical beliefs. Booker had bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and was 'troubled', the imam told a local newspaper. He would occasionally have 'inner conversations' while sitting alone like he was hearing voices, Hazim told KAKE. However, the suspect, who was said to occasionally wear a sword, had not been taking his medication because he did not like the way it made him feel and it was expensive. Mr Hazim had expressed concern to the FBI about allowing Booker to move freely in the community. He said 'I wasn't terribly surprised (about the arrest), I really wasn't. Because I had recognized over the last couple of months that he wasn't taking his medication'. He was then interviewed by agency officials and admitted he had enlisted with the army months earlier. The enlistment was cancelled before he was scheduled to begin basic training on April 7, 2014. Mr Hazim said the agents told him that Booker suffered from bipolar disorder, characterized by unusual mood swings that can affect functioning. Booker also suffered from schizophrenia, the Muslim leader told the Topeka Capital Journal. 'Maybe he came to me too late, I don’t know,' he said. The imam said he expressed concerns to the FBI about allowing Booker to move freely in the community after their first encounter. Mr Hazim said he later heard that two others were involved in a bombing plot with Booker. He said the FBI told him they were undercover FBI agents and that the sting was arranged to get Booker 'off the streets'. 'I think the two FBI agents set him up, because they felt at that point someone else might have done the same thing and put a real bomb in his hands,' Mr Hazim said. He said he has come to the conclusion that the sting was the right thing to do. The cleric said Booker admitted to him on Tuesday that he had stopped taking his medication because he didn't like the way it made him feel and it was expensive. A spokesman for the US attorney's office in Kansas declined to comment on Mr Hazim's remarks. Booker (left, in 2010 yearbook photo) had allegedly told Alexander Blair, 28 (right) about his plan to kill American soldiers and received money from him . The 20-year-old from Topeka, Kansas, was scheduled to start basic training with the Army on April 7, 2014 before extremist Facebook messages ended his enlistment . Booker reportedly planned to stage an attack inspired by the events that unfolded at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009, when Maj. Nidal Hassan killed 13 and injured dozens more, court documents show. Seven months after the Facebook post, an FBI informant engaged with Booker. Through their correspondences he 'repeatedly expressed his desire to engage in violent jihad on behalf of [ISIS],' the court documents show. He said that 'detonating a suicide bomb is his number one aspiration because he couldn't be captured, all evidence would be destroyed, and he would be guaranteed to hit his target', according to the Justice Department. Booker had also allegedly expressed interest in going to fight with extremists in the Middle East before signing on to the suicide attack.. The top federal prosecutor for Kansas also charged another Topeka man, Alexander E. Blair, 28, with failing to report Booker's plans to authorities. A complaint alleges that Blair and Booker shared some 'extremist views' and that Blair loaned Booker money to rent space to build and store a bomb. He has a hearing on Thursday to decide whether he should remain in federal custody and faces three years in prison if convicted. Booker was taken to an area near Fort Riley that he believed would allow him to enter the base and detonate a van with a 1,000lb ammonium nitrate bomb (file photo) Court documents suggested Booker wanted his planned attack to be similar to the deadly strike on Fort Hood (pictured in 2014) in 2009 when Maj. Nidal Hassan killed 13 and injured dozens more . The complaint filed against Booker also alleges he created a propaganda video before his planned attack. In it he is said to have told the American people to get their loved ones out of the military now because: 'The Islamic State is coming for them. From inside, whether it be in their homes, whether it be on a base like this, whether it be in the recruiting stations, whether it be in the streets.' He also urged people to pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi. If convicted, Booker faces life in prison. John T. Booker Sr, the young man's father, said that his son moved out of his home last year and he did not know about the extremist beliefs. 'The one statement that I will make is that I'm glad that he was arrested and that no one got hurt,' he said. The elder Booker told WDAF that his son had been an ROTC member and 'grew up as a normal kid'.","James T. Booker, 20, of Topeka, Kansas, was arrested following FBI sting .

"Democratic Presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton's security detail led a handful of journalists on two lengthy high-speed chases to homes of influential Democrats on Monday. Her lone official appearance on her first day in New Hampshire was a carefully stage-managed small-business roundtable in Keene. But a lunchtime visit to a main-street bakery and two more appointments later in the day were off-the-books and under the public's radar. If police radar had been engaged, however, it would have clocked Hillary's signature black conversion van - 'Scooby', for the uninitiated – hitting 92 mph in a driving rainstorm on Interstate 89, where the top speed limit is 65. No one in the motorcade displayed flashing lights or blasted a siren. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . SPEED DEMONS: Clinton's motorcade raced around New Hampshire on Monday . TRIAL BALLOON: A New Hampshire political operative described Hillary Clinton's afternoon meeting at this Claremont, NH home as an entree toward an endorsement by Senator Jeanne Shaheen. The home belongs to one of Shaheen's trusted aides . OFF TO THE RACES: Clinton returned to her beloved Mystery Machine following her afternoon house party . FINISH LINE: Clinton's entourage dined and partied at the home of former New Hampshire state Senate President Sylvia Larsen . INSIDE: The first photos of the custom van's interior – complete with entertainment center (at top left) – were shot through the vehicle's tinted glass at a gas station in Claremont, NH, under the watchful eye of a Secret Service agent . After Clinton emerged from Whitney Brothers, a children's furniture manufacturer, her black Chevy conversion van raced an hour north to the town of Claremont, hitting 73 in a 55 mph zone. Two hours later Scooby was on the move to Concord, bookended by a Secret Service detail that parted the puddles and kept the motorcade nose-to-tail – with the caboose car slamming on the brakes time and again. The Claremont event took Clinton to the home of Bethany Yurek, a constituent services 'special assistant' to New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Yurek is not a Washington heavy-hitter, but is part of Shaheen's inner circle. A political operative close to Shaheen's New Hampshire office said the meeting was meant to include a discussion about nudging the senator toward a presidential endorsement. In the nation's first presidential primary voting state, an early nod from a sitting senator to a former senator could carry enough weight to ward off Clinton's potential competitors. Yurek did not respond to phone messages seeking comment, and Clinton's campaign made arrangements only for the New York Times to attend. SCOOBY SIGHTINGS: On Monday the CLinton campagin-mobile made stops in three New Hampshire towns . PIT STOP: Scooby's Secret Service driver gassed up Hillary's chariot before opening up her engine and pushing it to 92 mph . MEET MOLLY: Clinton enjoyed the oldest campaign tactic in the book – posing with a baby – on Monday in the New Hampshire town of Keene, and gushed that she wanted to bring the infant home with her . In Claremont, according to tweets from a Times reporter, the wealthy former secretary of state's messaging featured progressive-friendly lines about income inequality. 'The deck is stacked in their favor,' she said of America's super-rich. 'My job is to reshuffle the cards.' Clinton and her husband, the former president, are themselves among America's much-derided 'one per cent' richest. She also sounded an alarm about capital gains tax cuts for big banks being the 'root' of America's economic malaise. That seems calibrated to appeal to Democrats on her left flank – those who are pining for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to enter the race. Clinton's Concord stop was a 7:00 dinner event at the sprawling home of former New Hampshire state Senate President Sylvia Larsen. GOOD NIGHT'S REST: Clinton and her traveling campaign team stayed Monday night at the Centennial hotel, a Victoria property full of 'boutique furniture pieces and chic art taken from the pages of Vogue' TOP AIDE: Huma Abedin, Hillary's right-hand woman, is on the campaign trail and stayed by Clinton's side as they stopped at a bakery in Keene on Monday . Larsen is a longtime Clinton loyalist who endorsed Hillary's first presidential bid in 2007. She hosted a 'Ready For Hillary' house party in February at the same home that hosted the candidate herself on Monday night. That house is steeped in Clinton lore. When then-Governor Bill Clinton filed his papers to run in the 1992 New Hampshire primary, it was Hillary who delivered the documents to the state capitol. Her last stop before making that trek in the rain was a gathering of professional women at Larsen's home. On Tuesday the Clinton campaign will remain in Concord for a second roundtable event – this time at the New Hampshire Technical Institute, the local community college. They'll be well-rested. On Monday night Clinton and her team stayed at the Centennial hotel in Concord, a Victorian-era complex full of 'boutique furniture pieces and chic art taken from the pages of Vogue,' according to the hotel's website.","Motorcade raced from Keene to Claremont to Concord, obliterating speed limits as Hillary kept a tight schedule of off-the-books events .

"A judge said he had to deal with his own 'revulsion' as he jailed four care home assistants who called their dementia residents 'fugly' and told one she was living in a brothel. The women, who worked at the dementia unit of the Bupa-run facility, in Bretton, Cambridgeshire, told one woman she was going to be killed. Another confused patient was told she was living in a brothel and should expect male visitors. Chloe Pearsall, 26, (left) and Nicole Howley, 25 (right) committed the acts of abuse at the care home throughout 2013 they have been jailed along with their colleagues Joanne Fisher, 36, and Barbara Holcroft, 63 . All four workers ‘systematically’ abused residents until a whistleblower reported them to bosses. Nicole Howley, 25, was jailed for two years this week after she was found guilty of two charges of ill-treating a person as a carer under the Mental Capacity Act. Colleagues Chloe Pearsall, 26, Joanne Fisher, 36, and Barbara Holcroft, 63, were convicted of one count of the same offence and sentenced to nine months each. Sentencing the women, Judge Sean Enright said he had ‘put aside his own personal revulsion’ to find a ‘just, proportionate sentence’. Using the word ‘fugly’ demonstrated the ‘lack of respect’ they showed patients, he added, saying: ‘This was systematic ill-treatment.’ The case highlights the plight of many old and vulnerable people in the care system and hospitals. The Daily Mail has repeatedly called for improved standards under its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. The four workers waged their hate-filled campaign throughout 2013. Wentworth Croft Care Home in Bretton, Cambridgeshire has 156 rooms which offer nursing, residential and dementia care for elderly people. During a trial at Peterborough Magistrates Court earlier this year, co-worker Lanya Edwards described how the women, all from Peterborough, abused one resident with ‘quite advanced’ dementia. Wentworth Croft Care Home in Bretton, Cambridgeshire (pictured) has 156 rooms which offer nursing, residential and dementia care for elderly people . The four workers waged their hate-filled campaign throughout 2013 and told one elderly resident that she was working in a brothel . ‘She would ask where she was a lot. I would say she was in a care home in Peterborough and she would be staying here until she got better,’ she said. ‘But I heard some care assistants tell her she was living in a brothel. She used to get quite worried. It is not a nice thing to hear.’ Miss Edwards said she heard Fisher, Holcroft and Howley taunting the women ‘at least a couple of times a week’. She also said she heard the women calling people ‘fugly’ behind their backs – although another witness, Jessica Skelly, told the court they used the term openly with at least one resident. ‘It was used to her. She used to get distressed and said she would phone the police,’ she said. Describing the vile abuse meted out to the woman who was told she was working in a brothel, she added: ‘Chloe, Jo and Nicole all referred to her as a prostitute… they said she wasn’t pulling her weight.’ Three of the workers regularly referred to one resident as a prostitute and told another she was fugly . After the group were found guilty, magistrates decided to send the case to Peterborough Crown Court for sentencing because their sentencing powers were insufficient to reflect the ‘gravitas of the offences and the vulnerability of the victims’. Andrew Hurst, representing the women on Wednesday, said they continued to deny the offences. They were all dismissed from their jobs in February last year. A spokesman for the care home said: ‘Everyone at the home is deeply shocked by the deplorable behaviour of these experienced carers.’ A fifth carer, Benjamin Appiah, denies ill-treating three women and will stand trial in June.","Judge had to set aside own feelings to give them an appropriate sentence .

"Richard Attenborough's possessions will be sold . They are mementoes of a brilliant career in movies, stretching from the tunnels of The Great Escape to the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park and Gandhi’s vast crowd scenes. Richard Attenborough was present – behind or in front of the camera – at some of the most magical moments in cinema history, and following his death aged 90 last year, the actor-director’s treasured possessions are going up for up sale at auction house Bonhams. Lord Attenborough’s son Michael, himself an acclaimed theatre director, said: ‘The items reflect my father’s incredible career. 'It is simply not possible to keep it all, even though we would absolutely love to. We do not have the room for it.’ Lord Attenborough made his big-screen debut in the 1942 film In Which We Serve, and was still acting more than five decades later when he appeared as eccentric boffin John Hammond in Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park. He was an avid collector and the lots include a treasure trove of unseen photographs, iconic props, scripts, posters and sketches. Many of the lots relate to his time in front of the camera and include mementoes from such career-defining films as Brighton Rock, The Great Escape and 10 Rillington Place. The Great Escape: This photo of Richard Attenborough (front) and Steve McQueen is expected to sell for £700 .

The student carefully noted all the stage roles he had notched up while at RADA. Equally well known for his work behind the camera, Lord Attenborough directed such classics as Gandhi, Shadowlands and Cry Freedom. His personal script for the Oscar-winning masterpiece Gandhi, which includes all of his annotations, is expected to fetch in the region of £3,000. Michael Attenborough said there were some items the family couldn’t part with, even if they wanted to. ‘We are not allowed to sell his Oscars and Baftas for legal reasons, and to be honest we wouldn’t want to,’ he said. ‘They have been distributed along the family and are now being looked after by the grandchildren.’ Michael Attenborough suggested Ben Kingsley (right) for the role of Gandhi – a decision his father never regretted . His role as the psychotic Pinkie in 1947’s Brighton Rock made Attenborough a box-office star. he is pictured here relaxing with young fans between scenes .

"The final Discworld novel written by Sir Terry Pratchett before he died last month at the age of 66 will be released later this year, his publishers have said. The book will be called The Shepherd's Crown and will feature Tiffany Aching, a witch-in-training who has featured in four of Sir Terry's books to date, first appearing in The Wee Free Men in 2003. The novel, which is based in the fictional realm of Discworld - a flat disc balanced on the back of four elephants and a giant turtle roaming through space - will go on sale in September. Scroll down for video . The final book written by Sir Terry Pratchett, The Shepherd's Crown, which will be set in the Discworld universe and feature witch Tiffany Aching, will be released this September, his publishers have said . Tom Weldon, from publishers Penguin Random House, said: 'It is a huge privilege to be publishing Sir Terry Pratchett’s final Discworld novel, The Shepherd’s Crown. 'Terry’s writing is loved and respected the world over and this publication will be an incredibly important and special event for us all at Penguin Random House, and for fans and readers everywhere.' Sir Terry published his fist Discworld novel, The Colour Of Magic, in 1983 and went on to sell 85million books worldwide, with his work being translated into 37 languages. Before that he had been a journalist, writing for the Bucks Free Press, the Western Daily Press and finally the Bath Chronicle. The character of Tiffany, who forms one of several side-plots in the 40 Discoworld novels, first appeared in The Wee Free Men (left) in 2003, and went on to feature in another three books . A Hat Full Of Sky, Wintersmith, and I Shall Wear Midnight saw Tiffany grow to be 16 and become a powerful witch. The plot of the final book is unknown, but the shepherd in the title could refer to her grandmother . He became a press officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board, with responsibility for three nuclear power stations, in 1980. 1948: Born to David and Eileen Pratchett in Beconsfield, Buckinghamshire . 1965: Left school to become a reporter for the Bucks Free Press . 1968: Married wife Lyn. Daughter Rhianna is born eight years later . 1971: Published his first book, The Carpet People, which received good reviews but generated only modest sales . 1980: Left journalism to work in PR for the Central Electricity Generating Board . 1983: Published the first book of the Discworld series, The Colour Of Magic, which sold out during its first day . 1998: Awarded an OBE at Buckingham Palace for 'services to literature' 2007: Diagnosed with rare form of early-onset Alzheimer's after car accident. Becomes a right to die campaigner . 2009: Knighted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace . 2012: He gives an interview stating that, while his health is better than expected, his condition is catching up with him. By this point he is thought to be writing by dictation . 2014: Sir Terry finishes his final book, The Shepherd's Crown, which will be published this September . 2015: Sir Terry dies at his home in Wiltshire. His death is announced by his daughter on Twitter . He was first published in 1971 with novel The Carpet People, but his career as a writer did not truly take off until The Colour of Magic was printed. In total Sir Terry published 70 novels, 40 of which were set in Discworld, blending together elements of fantasy, philosophy and real-world politics, while managing to satirise all three. The character of Tiffany Aching first appeared in 2003. Then aged just nine, she began her training as a witch, and was awarded an imaginary invisible hat to boost her confidence. Over the course of another three books, A Hat Full Of Sky, Wintersmith, and I Shall Wear Midnight, Tiffany turned 16, growing in power and gaining abilities along the way. While the plot of the final Discworld book has not yet been revealed, the shepherd of the book's title could be a reference to Tiffany's grandmother, Sarah Aching, who herded sheep. Sir Terry was born in 1948, the only child of a working-class couple - his father was a mechanic - and brought up in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Adventurous, and keen on learning by doing, he disliked school and had to be bribed by his parents into reading books. While he eventually became hooked on fiction, that never translated into a love of the classroom and he left as soon as he was able in order to become a reporter. As his literary career took off he won a host of prizes and was handed a total of nine honorary doctorates, before being awarded an OBE in 1998, and was finally knighted in 2009 'for services to literature'. Asked about his success at the time, he said: 'Most writers don’t make much money, they only happen to make some if they’re standing in the station when the gravy train comes in. Sir Terry wrote 70 novels, 40 of which were set in Discworld - a flat planet carried through space on the back of four elephants and a giant turtle - selling 85million copies (pictured after being given an OBE in 1998) 'I thought I was lucky to make some money, then lucky to make a living, then lucky to be a millionaire.' However, in 2007, he was diagnosed with posterior cortical atrophy [PCA], a form of early-onset Alzheimer's. Sir Terry, who was knighted in 2009 (pictured), suffered from a form of early-onset Alzheimer's, and was a right to die campaigner . The first hint that he was not well came as he drove home after watching his father, David, die from pancreatic cancer, when he misjudged a lane and scraped his car along a wall. As he succumbed to the disease he lost everyday skills such as touch-typing, but simply took to dictation software to write his books instead, insisting it made him even more eloquent. He also refused to become self-pitying. He rarely referred to his illness by name, instead preferring to call it 'the embuggerance' He even turned his illness to public campaigning, speaking tirelessly and eloquently in favour of people's the right to die in the manner of their choosing. Sir Terry passed away on March 12 'with his cat sleeping on his bed surrounded by his family' at his home in Wiltshire. His death was announced on Twitter by his daughter, Rhianna, who used his account to write: 'AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER.' 'Terry took Death's arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night. The End.' The character of Death, one of the most beloved in the Discworld series, always speaks in capitals. Since Sir Terry's death, mourning fans have donated more than £40,000 to The Research Institute For The Care Of Older People, a charity for which he campaigned.","Sir Terry's final novel, The Shepherd's Crown, to be released in September .

"They each have a dominant Instagram following and are renown for capturing incredible landscape pictures, but what happens when you send eight of the best photographers on a road trip to the Isle of Skye? In a quest to find the perfect photograph, the intrepid social media giants were sent by Europcar to explore and snap nearly 650 miles in three days, and post their findings with the hashtag #MovingSkyewards. Their breathtaking findings have been seen by a combined following of over one million users, with the team proving that Isle of Skye is the perfect road trip destination. Scroll down for video . Beautiful! Hanni Gharib perfectly captures the view at the edge of Loch Earn in the Isle of Skye . Winding wonder!

Reflective Loch Earn perfectly captured on the Europcar trip, which combined Danish and Scottish photographers for a promotional campaign . The intrepid road trippers stopped for a picture on their road trip, which was promoted using the hashtag #MovingSkyewards . The campaign team involved five Danes and three Scots who set out in March to capture some of the area's prized landscapes and landmarks. Photographers included Fedja Salihbasic, who boasts 427,000 followers on Instagram and Hanni Gharib who flew over, meet the likes of Steve Oates and James Wright. They had long been admirers of each other's work, so jumped at the chance to join efforts for the mission. Europcar's aim for the mission was to showcase how having access to a vehicle enables you to fully explore some of Scotland’s most picturesque and remote locations. A spokesperson for the programme said: 'At the start of the campaign, we hoped that the images would capture people’s imagination on Instagram and inspire them to explore this part of Scotland for themselves. A key aspect of the campaign was to highlight Skye’s unrivalled scenery, and we could think of no better people to champion the Misty Isle than our group of Danish and Scottish Instagrammers. As there is no railway access to the Isle of Skye the Instagrammers set off by car to the Isle of Skye, approximately a five hour drive from Edinburgh although the reality was much different. Hanni Gharib said: 'Our mutual passion for nature and photography made a five-hour trip into a 12 hour journey. 'Trying to regulate the amount of stops was hopeless given the breathtaking scenery that unfolded itself around every corner. 'And having our own vehicles gave us the freedom to take whatever (time-consuming, but visually rewarding) detours we chose along the way.' The campaign aimed to show that by having your own vehicle you can make the journey in your own time and enjoy easy access to some of the most spectacular areas of natural beauty along the way . The team were given hire vehicles by Europcar for the exploration. As there is no train service to the area visitors are restricted to buses or private vehicle . Hanni Gharib said: 'Our mutual passion for nature and photography made a 5 hour trip into a 12 hour journey' The result of their three-day adventure was an exploration of over 600 miles of Scottish landscape and a collection of stunning photographs using the hashtag #MovingSkyewards. Scottish photographer Steve Oates said: 'Scotland has some of the most spectacular scenery in the world, particularly up in the Isle of Skye. 'The drive north from Edinburgh takes you through some incredible locations, including Glencoe, Fort William and Kyle of Lochalsh with the stunning Eilean Donan castle, giving many opportunities to stop by the side of road for a quick photograph or, if you prefer, a wander up into the hills for an even more impressive view. 'The best part about driving is that you don't need to worry about the weather, which can change pretty suddenly in Scotland, and you can enjoy the way the surroundings change through different conditions as you drive around different locations. 'Driving around Skye is an incredible experience and one that already has us planning to go back again in order to explore some of the locations further.' Another key aspect of the campaign was to highlight Skye’s unrivalled scenery, and we could think of no better people to champion the Misty Isle than our group of Danish and Scottish Instagrammers .

"These shocking photographs reveal how a horse riding event for a cancer charity in Northern Ireland apparently used a surprise jump in the shape of a car. Dozens of animal welfare complaints have been made after a horse attempted to jump a black Peugeot 206 car with glass still in the windscreen at the event in Greencastle, County Tyrone. One animal can be seen crashing head first into the turf, dismounting a rider, after trying to scale the vehicle - a jump that could have seen it suffer deep wounds or even fatal broken legs. Shocking scene: Dozens of animal welfare complaints have been made after a horse attempted to jump a black Peugeot 206 car with glass still in the windscreen at the event in Greencastle, County Tyrone . Fall: One animal can be seen crashing head first into the turf, dismounting a rider, after trying to scale the vehicle - a jump which could have seen it suffer deep wounds or even fatal broken legs . A number of horses were said to have left the field with injuries at the event on March 28. One rider reported visiting A&E to be treated for badly bruised ligaments after her horse fell. One complaint sent to welfare officers warned that ‘someone could have been killed’ at the event. It said: ‘The public were asked to attend a charity “hack” which is supposed to be a casual walk; trot through road or forest trails with your horse with an odd natural fence to jump – i.e. trees or ditches. ‘In reality some the horses were made jump extremely dangerous obstacles, one being a car with glass still within and over atrocious ground conditions which is nothing short of animal cruelty.' It added: ‘From these pictures some of these animals are clearly not fit enough to be partaking in any jumping activities, ridden by people who had no regard for the safety of them.’ The complainant said a friend had attended the event, believing it would be in a good cause for charity, but was ‘utterly shocked at what she witnessed, advising many horses were beaten’. ‘One particular horse left with the skin from his chest between his legs torn and hanging off,’ they added. ‘There was a flap of skin hanging down between the horse’s legs.’ Getting up: A number of horses were said to have left the field with injuries at the event in Northern Ireland . The Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said today that complaints had been made after the horses were ‘exploited and abused’ in the ‘obviously dangerous’ event. A spokesman told MailOnline: ‘People have quite rightly felt the animals were being exploited and abused. Our point would be that the riders have the choice, but the horses don’t.’ Fermanagh and Omagh District Council - which has the power to prosecute, unlike the USCPA - said its animal welfare and agriculture officials are aware of the incident and are investigating. But Patricia Keenan, 34, who organised the event, said she had originally planned for the car to feature as a jump obstacle - but it was intended to be a 'photographic prop’ on the day. She told the Ulster Herald: ‘On the morning of the ride-out I had delegated a number of tasks, one of which was to close the pallets across the approach to the jump and hang a red flag on it. ‘Unfortunately due to time constraints and confusion within the delegated voluntary assistants, this instruction was not executed, with the unfortunate consequence that a few riders out of the entire field of 65 riders elected of their own will to deviate from the designated clearly marked route which involved a modest jump over a ditch.’ The charity supported by the race, Charis Cancer Care, said its trustees were not aware of the fundraiser - and would only comment on what had happened once it had investigated the matter.","Dozens of animal welfare complaints made after Northern Ireland event .

"Experts have discovered that this dove grey suit was once worn by notorious Nazi leader Hermann Goering. They used sweat stains on the uniform to link it to the overweight German commander and it is now expected to fetch £85,000 when it goes under the hammer in Plymouth, Devon. Goering, who founded the Gestapo and was commander of the German air force, was well known for being overweight and as a result the suit shows the strain of being worn by the large officer. It was originally believed to be a replica, but the careful examination of the sweat blemishes and fraying on the buttons and buckles led experts to believe it had been worn. The dove grey suit made by a Viennese tailor that was once worn by ruthless Nazi commander Hermann Goering . Hermann Goering, pictured in his full military dress during World War Two, favoured a dove grey suit . John Cabello, owner of Devon-Parade Antiques, where the uniform is being sold, said the wear and tear on the uniform helped them identify Goering as its original owner. He said: 'Goering was hugely overweight and had a tendency to sweat a lot, that would explain the profusion of sweat in the tunic. 'The stress levels on the tunic's folds coupled with the strain on the broaches of the tunic show it was worn by someone overweight. 'This also proves it was worn for a long, long time by someone who was fat enough to cause it to stretch and wear over a period of time. 'He also had a habit when he used to walk around talking to people of putting his left hand into his left pocket. Because of this the wear on the left pocket is substantially more than the right.' The outfit was made by the Viennese tailor, Tiller, who was known to have made uniforms for the Nazis during the war. Stress levels on the tunic's folds coupled with the strain on the broaches of the tunic show it was worn by someone overweight . The uniform was believed to have been liberated by the Americans before it found its way into a collection in Switzerland . The outfit was made by the Viennese tailor, Tiller, who was known to have made uniforms for the Nazis during the war . Although the tailoring of dove grey blue ensemble is very good, the materials used are of remarkably lower quality when compared to the uniforms worn by Nazi officers at the beginning of the war. Mr Cabello, from Plymouth, Devon, said: 'As the war progressed, it got harder to get materials and quality everywhere went down. 'There was also an effort by Goering to appear less grand during the latter part of the war. This is because as he was going around meeting the population, if he looks like he is living in opulence when they are in poverty it would not go down well.' Goering, pictured above, saw himself as Hitler's successor and was known to have been ill for much of the war . Air Force chief Hermann Goering pictured with Adolf Hitler by the Nazi leader's train during the war . Mr Cabello bought the uniform at auction from a private museum in Switzerland, and at the time it was believed to have been a copy of Goering's uniform that would have been used only as a display model and not actually worn by Goering. It was not until Mr Cabello began looking at the tunic and trousers in detail that he realised there were too many aspects of the uniform that could only have been caused by being worn by the Nazi himself. The son of a judge Hermann Goering was born in Germany in 1893. He fought in the air force during World War One and at the end of the conflict was recognised as a  hero. Goering became a leading figure in the Nazi party and was awarded a high position in Hitler's Government after he became Chancellor in 1933. He went on to play a key role in establishing the Gestapo and created early concentration camps for political opponents of Hitler. In 1935 he became commander in chief of the luftwaffe and held the post until the final days of the war. After learning that Hitler intended to commit suicide  in 1945 he sent Hitler a telegram asking if he could assume control after his death. He was removed from his position, expelled from the party and arrested. Goering was indicted by the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg in 1946. Goering was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to death by hanging. Ahead of his execution he took cyanide and died. Mr Cabello said: 'We had it looked at by several people who deal in uniforms and the general consensus is the fact that it is old and has definitely been worn. 'We don't know the origin of the uniform. We assume it was liberated by the Americans and the local population and found its way into a collection in Switzerland.' The uniform is being sold as a set which includes the original tunic, trousers and braces worn by Goering as well as a replica peaked cap and an original Nazi general's belt that would not have been owned by the Nazi commander. It is being sold by Parade Antiques in Plymouth, Devon . An overweight Hermann Goering, in one of his grander suits,  arriving at the Bayreuth Festival with Frau Winifred Wagner .

"An eight-year-old boy has died a day after his family's car hurtled off the road and into a Los Angeles harbor. His 13-year-old brother, identified as Abdelkrim Elmezayen, was pulled dead from the water at the scene shortly after 6pm on Thursday. Their parents are in a stable condition in the hospital.

"Last weekend, after a sunny day in the Borders, I posted this picture of myself on Twitter with the caption ‘Just met Nicola Sturgeon lookalike out canvassing!’ I admit, it wasn’t a particularly funny joke, but I had no idea of the outrage my light-hearted comment would provoke from the devoted followers of Scotland’s First Minister and the leader of the SNP. I was called ugly, vile, ‘someone who deserves to die’, and one wit even ‘hoped I would catch malaria’. In all, I’ve probably received more than 600 insults, and two days later they’re still coming. Luckily, I’ve got a thick skin, but whatever happened to free speech? In the knockabout atmosphere of an election campaign, everything is up for debate. Scroll down for video . Janet Street-Porter posted this picture on Twitter with the caption ‘Just met Nicola Sturgeon lookalike out canvassing!’ Both the Press and the public routinely talk about politicians in less-than-flattering terms, mocking their trendy (or spartan) kitchens, their silly casual clothes and their strange hairstyles, not to mention their attempts to eat a bacon sandwich, hug babies, cook a casual lunch or chuck a bowling ball — all in the name of a photo opportunity. The UK is home to a rich and raucous tradition of political satire, from 19th century caricaturists such as George Cruikshank and James Gillray, to more recent cartoonists Gerald Scarfe, Ralph Steadman and those in Private Eye magazine, as well as TV series such as Spitting Image, Mock The Week and Have I Got News For You. Most of our most successful comedians sneer at the party leaders. So you might imagine that the Scots could cope with a few harmless jibes about their own First Minister. Wrong, wrong, wrong. All the pollsters agree that the SNP is destined to win the vast majority of the seats (up to 50) North of the Border in the General Election, crushing the Tories and trouncing Labour. They already control the majority of votes in the Scottish Assembly. Could this surge of nationalism mean that Scotland is in danger of becoming another North Korea, a land where the ‘dear leader’ is sacrosanct, a figure on a pedestal, to be worshipped and admired — but never criticised? At the weekend, one commentator announced that ‘Scotland has fallen in love with Nicola — she is adored’. Indeed last night Ms Sturgeon was as feisty as ever in the leaders’ debate. My goodness, you certainly couldn’t say that about any party leader South of the Border, or in Wales. Despite all the photo calls at factories, in schools and cafes and villages halls, poll after poll shows that the public find most British politicians ‘out of touch’. Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have ‘minus’ personal ratings, while even Ukip’s Nigel Farage, once the poster boy for the disaffected, could be in danger of losing his bid to become an MP in South Thanet. Janet Street-Porter said she had no idea of the outrage her 'light-hearted comment' would provoke from Nicola Sturgeon's (pictured) supporters . So how has Nicola Sturgeon become Teflon Woman, a person so perfect that a mere joke about her appearance means (according to her fans) I can no longer be considered a feminist? According to her followers, I am a traitor to my sex, a woman less attractive than Red Rum, a sub-human who should be neutered. It’s all beginning to sound like a repressive communist state. Sadly, some SNP supporters combine commendable patriotism with a deep-seated distrust of the English — not just the posh people from down here, but anyone born in the ‘wrong’ country. I first encountered this when I made an hour-long documentary for BBC Scotland last year, looking at voting intentions in the independence referendum. I love Scotland and have spent many happy weeks walking, working and fishing there, so making this film was a real pleasure. I talked to people of all persuasions in the Borders, the Central Belt between Glasgow and Edinburgh, and in the North-East. We went to inordinate lengths to present a scrupulously balanced film — but when it was transmitted, because I was born in England (and am actually half-Welsh) I was attacked in the Scottish Press, on Twitter and other social media for having the audacity to host a programme about ‘their’ country. Utter madness. Some SNP members are so consumed with themselves that all they want is people to agree with them, and sod everyone else. They are blinkered zealots incapable of reasoned debate. During their aggressive campaign for independence — which got the knockback by a sizeable margin, with 55 pc in favour of remaining in the UK — the Nationalists earned a reputation for ruthlessly attacking anyone who didn’t agree with them. The author J.K. Rowling was denounced as unpatriotic for daring to speak out in favour of Scotland remaining part of the UK. Dubbed the Tartan Taliban and the Cyber Nats, fanatical SNP followers use social media to ‘troll’ opponents, and anyone daring to criticise their leader. When the BBC political editor Nick Robinson reported from Scotland on the referendum last year, the Nationalists took such offence to what they regarded as his biased broadcasts that hundreds of marchers took to the streets carrying a huge banner with the words ‘Sack Nick “The Liar” Robinson, a totally corrupt journalist'. But they don’t stop at professional attacks. When Robinson announced a few weeks ago that he had a cancerous tumour on his lung, the Cyber Nats went straight on Twitter with comments such as ‘a bit of chemotherapy would do the biased Beeb man good’. In similar vein, after a Daily Mail writer published a profile of Nicola Sturgeon in these pages recently, he was attacked relentlessly online, and called a Nazi, racist scum, a vile bigot, a misogynist, and told to f*** off back to England. Many of those abusing him had a blue Nationalist ‘45’ logo on their Twitter feed, to represent the percentage who voted for independence last year. So what of the woman these people idolise as some great political saviour unlike any other figure in Britain today? Janet Street-Porter (right) asks how Nicola Sturgeon (left) has become 'a person so perfect that a mere joke about her appearance means (according to her fans) I can no longer be considered a feminist?' Consider the facts: Ms Sturgeon, just like Ed Miliband, has spent her whole life (apart from a brief period working as a solicitor) entirely engrossed in politics. Her husband and her former boyfriends and most of her friends all work for the SNP. Yet it is Ed Miliband, not Sturgeon, who gets derided for being ‘weird’ and having not experienced the real world. From 1992 onwards, she unsuccessfully stood for seat after seat in local and national elections, before eventually gaining a place in the Scottish Parliament via a quota system in 1999. She had a total image make-over in 2004 — hiring a stylist, changing her Krankies-style hairdo, losing weight and softening her approach. But make no mistake, she is as ruthless an operator as any other party leader. Her stated goal is Scottish independence, no matter what effect that might have on the rest of the UK, even though her party lost what was supposed to be a ‘once-in-a-generation’ vote on this issue last year. When questioned on television this week, she refused to rule out a second referendum in the very near future. When it comes to dealing with the deficit and setting out an economic strategy, Cameron, Miliband and Clegg have had their plans ruthlessly dissected. Sturgeon, however, based her sums on an oil boom that has failed to materialise, which has deprived the Scottish economy of billions of pounds of expected revenue. She wants Scotland to be responsible for raising its own taxes, but when an independent think-tank, the Institute For Fiscal Studies, looked at her plans for tax and spending and said they would result in a whopping £7.6 billion deficit, she described their findings as ‘irrelevant’. Yes, I admire Nicola Sturgeon’s tenacity, and I applaud any woman who rises to the top in her chosen profession. I know from experience just how tough that can be. Nevertheless, we find ourselves in the unenviable position of facing an election where a party that 60 million Britons cannot vote for — the SNP — could hold the balance of power at Westminster. It is a self-proclaimed ‘progressive’ party which hypocritically accepted £2.5 million of donations from Brian Souter, the Stagecoach boss who doesn’t believe in equal rights for gays. Does that make her any different to Ed Miliband, with his much-criticised relationships with the trade unions, or David Cameron with his cronies in Big Business? Voters in England can do nothing to stop the Sturgeon bandwagon gaining momentum — SNP membership has tripled in the past year, and it’s now the third-largest political party in the UK. But worrying questions remain about some of her followers. By trying to stifle debate and silence any jokes (no matter how feeble) about their leader, they are beginning to look more like fanatics than political supporters.","Janet Street-Porter joked about SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon on Twitter .

"Four men have been moved out of intensive care after suspected drug overdoses during a party cruise on Sydney Harbour, possibly due to a dangerous strain of ecstasy pills known as 'blue scissors'. The men - two 21-year-olds and a 25 and 22-year-old - collapsed on the vessel on Good Friday, forcing it to dock near the Opera House. They were rushed to St Vincent's Hospital. Police said heir condition was critical overnight but they are now stable. On Friday afternoon, about 800 partygoers poured off the Bella Vista boat after the party came to an end . Four men are believed to have suffered from drug overdoses during a party cruise on Sydney Harbour, possibly due to a dangerous strain of ecstasy pills known as 'blue scissors' One man is suspected of taking up to four ecstasy pills in one hit, including blue ones with scissor stamps on them, a friend told police. Police believe at least that man, and possibly the others, had taken 'blue scissor' pills, similar to those linked to overdoses in Cronulla last year. Three men and a woman were hospitalised last November after taking the pills. On Friday afternoon, about 800 partygoers poured off the Bella Vista boat after the party came to an end. Police allege an officer was assaulted as people left the vessel. Two men, 21 and 22, were charged and will appear in court this month. Before the boat - which was hosting a 'Dirty Funken Beats' party - left King Street Wharf at noon, three sniffer dogs were on hand to greet passengers . Police say they discovered cocaine, marijuana and MDMA before the boat left the wharf . Before the boat - which was hosting a 'Dirty Funken Beats' party - left King Street Wharf at noon, three sniffer dogs were on hand to greet passengers. 'We are rather concerned about how the drugs came on board,' Acting Superintendent Joe McNulty said. 'Instead of getting one drug dog yesterday, we went pretty firm and got three drug detection dogs there to comb the wharf, comb the area and all the participants before they boarded the boat.' Police discovered cocaine, marijuana and MDMA, Supt McNulty said. Disgruntled passengers took to Facebook on Saturday demanding refunds from promoters. 'How bout that refund eh?' one person wrote. Dirty Funken Beats responded: 'We work hard to put on awesome parties for everyone and something happens out of our control and you want 40 bucks back. 'Not overly thoughtful but we will sort it for you.' The cruise operator was served with a short-term closure order, preventing the vessel going back on the water for 72 hours. Supt McNulty said it was the first time such an order had been served on a Sydney Harbour party boat.

Scroll down for video . Autistic boy Luke Shambrook, 11, was sitting on the side of a hill peering between trees toward a police helicopter at the moment he was found save after surviving for a remarkable five days on his own in the bush . Luke  went missing from the Candlebark Campground in the Fraser National Park near Lake Eildon, north-east of Melbourne, on Friday. He  was found just before midday AEST on Tuesday in thick bushland off Skyline Road, Eildon, 3km from the campsite. Luke was sitting alone and forlorn on the hill when he was spotted from the police helicopter . A camera on the helicopter captured the dramatic moment rescuers reached Luke on the fifth day of an increasingly desperate search, with a police officer the first on the scene . The officer knelt down and offered Luke reassurance he was finally safe . Other rescuers quickly followed, with one wrapping the terrified boy in a foil blanket, before he was gently taken from the bush to where he could receive proper medial attention . His parents Tim and Rachel were reunited with Luke as he was put into an ambulance in a stretcher, with his mother giving him a kiss. Luke gave his father Tim a 'big thumbs up' when they saw each other, the family said. Luke Shambrook has been found alive after he went missing from a Victorian campsite at 9.30am on Friday .

'When the rescue team found him, he was in high spirits and was walked out of the bush on his own two feet,' they said in a statement. 'The family are very happy to be reunited.' Luke is suffering from dehydration and hypothermia and has been driven to Alexandra Hospital to undergo further medical assessments in the company of his parents. Acting Commander Rick Nugent said: 'He's a lucky boy, he's a strong boy, and we are so rapt for the family and we are so thankful for the support.' Police said he was found 3km from where he first went missing but he could have walked much further in the days he was missing. 'Police would like to thank all those involved in the search over the past few days and appreciate the immense amount of community support,' a spokeswoman said in a statement.

"It is a common fear, known as trypanophobia. For around 20 per cent of the population, the thought of going to the doctors for an injection invokes a deep-rooted sense of dread. Many avoid the doctor's surgery altogether, leaving themselves open to the risk of various illnesses and infections. But for those terrified of needles, a team of scientists at Rice University in Houston, may have the answer. They have developed a new device, Comfortably Numb, to ease the pain of an injection. Their invention numbs the skin prior to the jab by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin. Scroll down for video . Comfortably Numb is a new, single-use device that eases the pain of an injection by producing a rapid chemical reaction to cool the patient's skin within 60 seconds . Three first year students, (from L-R) mechanical engineer Mike Hua, bioengineer Andy Zhang and computer scientist Greg Allison, came up with the invention, they describe as 'simple and elegant' The trio, made up of computer scientist Greg Allison, bioengineer Andy Zhang and mechanical engineer Mike Hua, currently has a functioning prototype, that has produced a numbing effect in just 60 seconds. 'Our device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water, ' Mr Hua said. 'A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. 'We then numb the skin by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin.' Current solutions are either ineffective because they fail to numb the skin adequately, or take too long, the researchers said. They noted that a commonly used medicated topical patch takes about an hour to work, whereas their new device 'works on the order of seconds and minutes', Mr Zhang said. 'We are targeting anyone who has to get an injection, which is nearly everyone,' Mr Allison said. 'But the device is especially applicable to people who are more susceptible to pain.' As such, he said, it is particularly useful for children and the elderly. And, it is intended for use during procedures 'where you have to get shots in more sensitive areas of the body, such as the face or the groin', he added. The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. It costs around $2 (£1.34) to produce, they said . The trio said the device could also be used to ease the pain of ear piercings and tattooing, and help reduce swelling. 'We looked into all sorts of methods for numbing, both quick and long-term, chemicals, using ice packs - which is similar to what we're using now,' Mr Hua said. The device is 3D printed and consists of two sealed chambers containing the chemical ammonium nitrate and water. A simple twisting motion moves the chambers into alignment to allow the chemicals to flow through the chamber to produce a rapid endothermic reaction. The skin can then be numbed by contacting the device's metal surface to the patient's skin. Within 60 seconds the patient's skin is numb and they can have an injection without experiencing pain. 'We explored everything that surrounded the problem before we even began brainstorming.' 'At the end of the day, what we're creating is a self-contained device with a very cold contact surface, and there are many applications for that,' Mr Allison added. Some of the solutions the trio researched were highly technical and required a materials science degree, or skills the first-year students had not yet learned. 'That's the kind of amazing thing about our project,' Mr Allison said. 'Because we don't have these incredibly refined skills in certain areas, that meant we had to think of very simple solutions. 'Being limited in that way led to something that is very novel and innovative, but at the same time, simple and elegant.' The team designed the device to be single-use, rather than reusable to avoid the difficulties of cleaning it and resetting the device. Mr Zhang, said: 'The materials that we use are relatively inexpensive and found in abundance: plastic, rubber and metal. The team from Rice University in Houston said the device could be used in future for those having tattoos, or people wanting to get their ears pierced without suffering the pain . 'The materials for one of these cost about a quarter, and then we just had to do estimates based on how much manufacturing would cost. 'We compared our device to similar things already in production, and we've estimated the cost at about $2 (£1.34).' The team is currently in the process of applying for a provisional patent for the device, and the students hope to continue their work together in their spare time when they return to Rice in their second year. 'As a team, we just want to follow the project, because we think it has a lot of potential. I think that's what drew us to this specific project,' Mr Allison said. 'We haven't really discussed yet whether we're going dedicate to making this a company, but it's something we're open to.'","Comfortably Numb is a single-use 3D printed device that numbs the skin .

"Britain's leading art gallery has uncovered new evidence in its attempt to keep a £1million Constable masterpiece that was looted by the Nazis from its Jewish owner during the Second World War. Tate Britain chiefs believe the chance discovery of an export permit will bolster their claim that the 1824 oil painting – Beaching A Boat, Brighton – was legitimately brought to Britain. The 1946 document bears the signature of a dealer called Karola Fabri and seeks permission for the transfer of artworks from Budapest to Zurich, including one by Constable identified as Fishing Boat. Scroll down for video . New evidence? Tate Britain chiefs believe the chance discovery of a 1946 export permit (pictured) will bolster their claim that Constable's painting was legitimately brought to Britain . Constable's masterpiece Beaching A Boat, Brighton was looted by the Nazis from its Jewish owner during the Second World War . The discovery of the permit in the archives of Budapest’s Museum of Fine Arts is the latest twist in an increasingly fraught dispute between the Tate and the descendants of the painting’s original owner, Baron Ferenc Hatvany, who died in 1958. The descendants of Hatvany – believed to be two daughters and a grandchild – say the Nazis stole the painting and smuggled it out of Hungary. It turned up in Britain in 1962 and passed through several hands before being donated to the Tate in 1986. The family launched a claim three years ago. The Government-backed Spoliation Advisory Panel, which rules on disputes over looted art, supported the heirs last year and said the Tate had a ‘moral obligation’ to return the painting. Sources close to the case say the export permit could prove the Tate’s claim that Hatvany voluntarily disposed of the painting while he was still alive. The Tate does not dispute that the painting was looted by the Nazis but the gallery’s understanding is that it was returned to the owner after the war and then legitimately exported. Stormy seas: The battle over Constable's painting evokes the story of a Jewish refugee's fight to reclaim a looted picture in the film Woman in Gold (pictured) Gallery chiefs are expected to argue that the permit proves the work was still in Hungary after the war. But The Mail on Sunday understands the claimants will argue the permit doesn’t change anything as it does not identify Hatvany. One source said: ‘If you had stolen the painting, you would still need to get an export permit to get it out of the country.’ A source at the Tate explained that there was legal duty to protect any assets owned by the British public, which is why the gallery argued that the painting should remain in the UK. They said: ‘No one disputes that the picture was at one stage looted by the Nazis, what is in dispute is what happened after it was returned to its owner.’ The dispute evokes the story of Dame Helen Mirren’s new film, Woman In Gold, which charts the story of how Jewish refugee Maria Altmann battled for almost a decade with the Austrian government to reclaim Gustav Klimt’s iconic picture of her aunt called Portrait Of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.","'Beaching A Boat, Brighton' taken from Jewish owner in Second World War .

"Asbestos has been discovered in the roof at New York City's mayoral residence and work to remove the potentially cancer-causing materials from Gracie Mansion will begin this month. The hazardous material was discovered last month as crews prepared to replace the mayoral mansion's leaky roof. Officials do not believe the work poses any health risk to Mayor Bill de Blasio and his family, who will remain in the home during the renovation. Asbestos has been discovered in the roof at New York City's mayoral residence and work to remove the potentially cancer-causing materials from Gracie Mansion will begin this month . Mayor Bill de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray hosting a black history month youth event at Gracie Mansion in February: The family expect to remain in the property during the building work . 'Gracie Mansion is one of Manhattan's oldest structures built more than 200 years ago and as with any older homes, maintenance is necessary,' mayoral spokesman Peter Kadushin said on Wednesday. 'Beginning this month Gracie Mansion will undergo asbestos abatement and some long-needed roof repairs.' The cost of removing the asbestos will be about $250,000 and the contract was awarded this week to Regional Management Inc., officials said. The replacement of the mansion 30-year-old roof, which is being done by Nicholson and Galloway, should cost an additional $3.4 million, officials said. The roof was frequently overmatched during rain storms, forcing city work crews to be dispatched to patch problem areas multiple times this winter, officials said. The two projects will be undertaken concurrently and should be completed by October or November, officials said. de Blasio poses with his son Dante (left), daughter Chiara (right), and wife Chirlane outside of their Park Slope home which the family had considered remaining in before moving to Gracie Mansion last July . A storage shed also is being built on the mansion's property. And officials said that about 10 of the building's windows were undergoing upgrades to become energy-efficient at the cost of another $13,000. De Blasio's predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, earmarked $3 million to the Parks Department capital budget in 2012 to replace the tired roof. Bloomberg never lived in the mansion during his 12 years in office — he instead opted to remain at his tony Upper East Side townhome — but oversaw extensive renovations to the home, which he used for meetings and ceremonial events. After considering remaining in his Brooklyn home, de Blasio, his wife and their two children moved into Gracie Mansion last July. The home, which is managed by the nonprofit Gracie Mansion Conservancy, was built in 1799, at which time it sat in the countryside more than five miles north of what was then a very small New York City. The mansion was seized by the city in 1896 after its owner failed to pay taxes. It became the official mayoral residence in 1942.

"An Afghan interpreter who risked his life on the front line with British troops was shot with his two-year-old son by Taliban hitmen after he says he was ‘abandoned’ by the UK Government. The 26-year-old, who was known as ‘Chris’ by UK soldiers, was hit in the leg when gunmen opened fire near his home in Khost, eastern Afghanistan. His son Muhammad also sustained injuries in the attack, which Chris says was the latest in a series of attempts to kill or kidnap him because of his time spent helping the British Government – which now won’t let him come to the UK. Shot: 'Chris' the interpreter (left) and his son Muhammad (right) was badly injured by Taliban gunmen near their home in Khost, eastern Afghanistan. He said it is one of several attempts made to kill or kidnap him . During more than three years with UK forces, Chris worked with elite units including the SAS, Royal Marines and Parachute Regiment. The father-of-two, who spent two months in hospital after the shooting, said he has taken evidence of threats to UK authorities on ten occasions – but has repeatedly been dismissed and told merely to take more security precautions. He claims he has also narrowly escaped a kidnap attempt, and now has to hide in a network of hostels. He said: ‘I worked outside military bases with UK forces where I took huge personal risk on a daily basis – I served with distinction, placing myself in mortal danger to save my British colleagues. ‘My family and I have experienced a serious threat to life as a consequence of working for the British, resulting – most recently – in me being shot on December 26 when the Taliban came to my village looking for me. ‘My son was hit too. This only happened because of my work with the British. The Government has totally forgotten its allies who helped them during the worst of times here. I have seen British soldiers die in front me and I have collected soldiers’ remains – now I think I am being abandoned.’ Chris – who worked for British forces between October 2008 and April 2011 – claims that UK commanders are aware that he was forced to stop working for the soldiers because of threats to his family made by the Taliban. Blood: The aftermath of another attack on an interpreter. Chris says they are at risk but that his concerns have been dismissed by the British Government . Danger: Despite attacks such as this, the majority of frontline interpreters who want to build new lives in the UK do not qualify for the immigration scheme . But like the majority of frontline translators who want to build new lives in the UK, Chris does not qualify for an immigration scheme because of his dates of service. The scheme is only available to those with at least a year’s continuous service after December 2011. So far just one of more than 300 Afghan interpreters who say they have been threatened by the Taliban because of their work with British soldiers has been given a UK visa. Last night, as it emerged that a Taliban thug suspected of murder in Afghanistan has won the right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds, Rafi – who is leading the fight to help other interpreters stay in the UK – said: ‘Human rights? Do only criminals and those who have killed British soldiers and translators have human rights? Doors are opened to them but closed to us. Shattered: The interpreter's car was badly damaged in the attack. Just one of more than 300 Afghan interpreters who say they have been threatened by Taliban because of their work has been given a UK visa . Lawyers will point out that the shooting is just one of scores of occasions when interpreters have been targeted . ‘It is disgusting the way we are being treated. We are not even being treated like human beings, my colleagues have to live in the shadows with their families looking over their shoulders constantly in fear of death whereas the Taliban are being allowed to stay with all the benefits from the British taxpayer. It is like we are the terrorists and they are the heroes.’ Rafi, who fears giving his full name, was blown up by the Taliban in a blast that killed a British officer. He is now involved in a court case next month challenging the UK’s position on translators. A judicial review brought by Rafi and one other Afghan interpreter is to challenge whether the Government complied with its statutory obligations towards hundreds of translators – and the attack on Chris and his son earlier this year will be highlighted. Lawyers will point out that the shooting is just one of scores of occasions when interpreters have been targeted. At least 20 interpreters serving with British troops were killed in action and dozens wounded while serving with UK forces. Six were murdered by the Taliban while on leave and five are said to have been hunted down since UK forces left. They claim the threat of violent reprisals from the Taliban has grown since British forces withdrew from Afghanistan and that many are in hiding unable to work and having to move regularly to escape assassination units. Two years ago The Mail interviewed 31 former translators in the Afghan capital Kabul who claimed to be in fear of their lives. Out of ten contacted last week, six said they had survived direct threats in recent months. One said : ‘Many families have been attacked, some relatives killed, others tortured and people loyal to the British military are living in hiding.’ UK officials deny that their translators have been ‘abandoned’, and stress that each case is individually examined and assessed by British officials in Afghanistan. Asked about Chris’s claims, the Ministry of Defence said it could not discuss individual cases. Taliban henchman accused of murder CAN stay here: Man who 'killed governor's son' in Afghanistan wins right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds . By Ian Drury, Home Affairs Correspondent for The Daily Mail . Home Secretary Theresa May initially rejected the 32-year-old's claim for sanctuary - but immigration judges have now thrown out her decision . A Taliban henchman suspected of murder in Afghanistan has won the right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds. The 32-year-old, known only by the initials SAKA, has admitted that his father was in charge of 65 Taliban troops, but claimed he only agreed to join the terrorist group because he was worried about his safety. Court papers reveal that he was arrested when he was caught trying to desert the Taliban, and accused of killing a provincial governor’s son. The papers go on to say: ‘The appellant claims he then spent four years in prison but was never formally convicted. He claims he was tortured and beaten.’ SAKA alleges that he managed to escape from prison and eventually travel to the UK. The Home Office was asked to consider whether he had actually been convicted of murder and whether his presence in Britain ‘constituted a danger to the community’. The Afghan, whose identity has been kept secret by the courts, had an initial claim for sanctuary rejected by Home Secretary Theresa May. But immigration judges have now thrown out her decision and given SAKA permission to stay. It was ruled that deporting him would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Experts said he would be ‘at risk of mistreatment and physical harm if he were arrested on account of being a suspected Taliban’. Hearing the case in the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, Judge Helen Rimington ruled that if SAKA were sent home the Taliban ‘might be informed ’. He would also be at risk from the current Afghan government on the basis of his former membership of the Taliban, she said. Last night a former British commander criticised the judgment and demanded a shake-up of human rights legislation so it could not be exploited by former insurgents. Colonel Richard Kemp, who led UK forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘Our blind adherence to European human rights legislation sees British soldiers who risk their lives to defend us hounded through the courts while this enemy fighter is allowed to stay here to threaten our country. ‘Our security at home already has enough challenges from jihadists returning from Syria without our own courts wantonly adding to our problems in this way. This case underlines the urgent need to change the law to prevent such dangerous absurdities.’","'Chris', who  worked with SAS and Marines, was shot near home in Khost .

"James Bond would have lasted just seven minutes into his last movie Skyfall before succumbing to fatal wounds from a uranium shot if the secret agent played by Daniel Craig was real. A group of medical experts watched the 23rd outing for Ian Fleming's hero and concluded that Bond would have been unlikely to survive to the end of the two hour film, and would have died or been critically injured several times . Within the first seven minutes, Bond is hit by a depleted uranium shell - an armour-piercing round normally used to destroy tanks that would almost certainly have killed the hero. Scroll down for video . James Bond would have died minutes into Skyfall - after being hit by a depleted uranium shell and then falling from a speeding train, where he could easily have severed his spine . As Bond fights in an icy loch he would have been likely to have died from the cold or lack of oxygen . In a feature for Total Film, the medical experts examine several different action movies to see whether the man characters would have survived their ordeal. Other movies to undergo the medical assessment were Die Hard featuring Bruce Willis. Unsurprisingly John McClane would not have survived. According to the experts, Bond's depleted uranium wound would have been fatal as it 'would have turned his lungs inside out and killed him'. In the unlikely event the massive round did not cause catastrophic injuries, the radioactive nature of the ammunition 'would greatly increase his cancer risk'. Bond cheats death throughout the two hour film, including when he is locked in a gunfight on the streets of Istanbul as he attempts to chase villain Patrice for a hard drive containing details of undercover agents . The hero effortlessly performs surgery on himself, but would have been likely to have lost too much blood . Not that growing old gracefully was ever likely for James Bond, who at one stage performs surgery on himself to remove a bullet, where he 'risks blood loss, lack of consciousness, nerve and muscle damage'. He also faces a significant risk of infection. Even jumping from the roof of a speeding train into a river presents its own risks, which probably should not be tried by ordinary members of the public as he would likely 'sever his spinal cord or break his neck'. 7 mins - Bond is shot in the chest by a depleted uranium bullet, likely to kill. If he had survived this the radioactive qualities of the ammunition would have increased his risk of cancer. 12 mins - The action hero is shot and then jumps from the roof of a speeding train into a river. The height of this fall would be likely to break his neck. 31 mins - After being shot Bond bravely removes a bullet from his shoulder. This DIY surgery would have led to significant blood loss as well as damaged his nerves and muscles. 2hrs - Bond fights in an icy loch. While the temperature alone would have presented problems, fighting underwater would have significantly depleted Bond's oxygen supply and could have caused him to drown. While James Bond's Aston Martin DB5 has survived since 1960, it is unlikely the man himself would have . However, filming the movie can prove slightly dangerous as Daniel Craig has recently required knee surgery after hurting himself while performing a stunt in his final Bond movie Spectre. Even Home Alone would have produced three fatalities. Marv and Harry would have likely died within hours of the movie's end while Kevin would have been killed within the first third of the film after falling from some shelves. However, Tom Hanks in Cast Away could have plausibly survived on a desert island for four years - as long as he escaped relatively unscathed from the plane crash. Although according to the experts, 76 per cent of the time he would have died in the accident. While Bruce WIllis' character in Die Hard, John McClane, pictured, would not have made it to the fourth movie . Tom Hanks in Castaway could have survived on the island - in the unlikely event he escaped the aircraft .","Action heroes would almost certainly die if they were worked in real life .

"Office workers were shocked to discover a couple having sex in a park in full view of their tower block on the hottest day of the year. The couple appeared not to mind being in full view during their steamy encounter at the Three Bridges playing fields in Crawley, West Sussex, as temperatures reached 25C in some parts of the UK. Workers at an office block which overlooks the park said the pair, who were semi-naked, did not even appear to be put off when people walked past them during their sex session at 3.30pm yesterday. Scroll down for video . The couple appeared not to mind being in full view as the enjoyed the steamy encounter in broad daylight at the Three Bridges playing fields in Crawley, West Sussex, as temperatures reached 25C in some parts of the UK . Photographs and videos of the unusual incident were quickly posted online and shared thousands of time. In one video, taken by shocked office workers, one man can be heard asking ‘Why would you do that?’ before describing it as ‘well funny.’ A woman exclaims ‘Oh my god’ and ‘Oh my dear Lord’ as other employees point out the illicit encounter before she says she wants to get an air horn to disrupt the couple. A man responds: ‘We should start clapping’ before the woman quips: ‘I don’t think they’d hear us, open the windows and shout maybe.’ Another claims to his colleagues that it’s the second time the pair got down to business, branding it ‘round two’. The minute-long video finishes with one woman exclaiming: ‘Corr he’s classy!’. One officer worker who also witnessed the encounter but wished to remain anonymous took to Facebook to share news of the incident. She said: 'I unfortunately witnessed the incident from my office window. 'A couple walked past and instead of stopping or trying to cover up what they were doing in the slightest, the bloke just pulled his jeans up over his bum a little bit and carried on.' Another, Emma Thrift, said: 'It wouldn't be the first time we've witnessed this sort of thing from the office.' It came on the hottest day of the year so far and the warmest April ever on record with temperatures reaching 25.1C at St James's Park in London and at Frittenden in Kent. The Met Office said the mercury also hit 24.7C in Wisley, Surrey and 24.6C in both Norfolk and Gravesend, Kent. Forecasters said that while temperatures would drop today, some areas such as the south west could still see the mercury hit 22C. Pictured: The sun rises near Latrigg, overlooking Keswick in the Lake District early today . Northern parts of England, where temperatures hovered around just 10C yesterday, will see slightly improved temperatures of up to 12C today. Pictured: Sheep graze near Latrigg, overlooking Keswick in the Lake District . At its peak yesterday, parts of London and the south east were hotter than Athens, Rome, Nice and Ibiza. Sun worshippers enjoyed the unseasonably warm weather, flocking to beaches in Brighton, Bournemouth and Devon, while scores soaked up the rays in London's parks. However, despite the unseasonably warm weather of late, forecasters predict 'a real reversal of fortunes' today thanks to a drop in temperatures as a cold front moves down from the north of the country. Many parts of the country, especially the Midlands, are set to see the mercury drop by about 10C as the colder air sweeps down the country. The mercury will fall from the mid-20s yesterday to 12C today. However, while most areas will be cooler than the last couple of days, temperatures will still reach up to 22C in the parts of the south west such as Devon and Cornwall and up to 19C in London. Northern parts of England, where temperatures hovered around just 10C yesterday, will see slightly improved temperatures, with up to 12C forecast today. It is not the first time a couple have been caught having sex in full view of others. Earlier this year, a 50-year-old regional manager and 26-year-old  office worker enjoyed a steamy encounter after staying late at work at an insurance firm in Christchurch, New Zealand. They undressed and had sex in front of the large office windows, quickly drawing attention from those across the street. Video footage and photographs of the encounter caused an online phenomenon that was watched by millions worldwide.","Couple caught on camera having sex in broad daylight in Crawley park .

"When she was 15 weeks pregnant with her fifth child, Clare Van Santen was told she had breast cancer. 'I was pregnant with Elijah when I found out that I had breast cancer, so it was a bit scary wondering what was going to happen with the pregnancy and the other kids,' Ms Van Santen told Daily Mail Australia. After undergoing a specific chemotherapy regime which had been found to have no negative impact on unborn children, and having a mastectomy, her son was born happy and most importantly, healthy. 'He had a full head of hair when he was born, and I was bald so that made me feel better,' Ms Van Santen, who is from Perth, joked. Singe mother-of-five Clare Van Santen, 37, (back of image) is currently battling terminal breast cancer. She is pictured here with her four youngest kids Susan 17, Nikita, 14, Jack, 12, Elijah, 9, . The Perth woman was first diagnosed when she was pregnant with her fifth child, Elijah, now aged nine . When she asked her doctor after all her treatment whether she was in remission, he told her that with breast cancer, if it is contained within the breast like hers was, you are essentially cured. But ten years on, after living a life which she thought was cancer-free, the single mum-of-five has been told her cancer is now terminal. Her biggest concern going forward is for her children, whose ages range from 20 to nine years old, and how they will live without her. 'I worry about how they’re going to be and who’s going to look after them, what’s going to happen, how they’re going to cope,' Ms Van Santen said. After her initial diagnosis, the Perth woman learned in October 2013 her cancer had spread to her liver, and she also had a small amount in one of her shoulders. 'I went to have lap-band surgery and they did a scan of my liver and found some legions which ended up being cancer, little tiny bit in my shoulder too,' Ms Van Santen revealed. Ms Van Santen has a bucket list of things she wants to do with her children: Keisha, 20, Susan 17, Nikita, 14, Jack, 12, Elijah, 9, in the time she has left . She was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005, but it has since spread to her liver, shoulder, and brain . The 37-year-old has undergone coutnless chemotherapy and radiation treatments in the past decade . Instead of the surgery she was supposed to have, she had to endure five months of chemotherapy and hormone treatments, which successfully shrunk the spots in her liver. 'For most people a Bucket List is something that has lots of adventurous things on it... My Bucket List is for me and my kids, so they can enjoy their home environment and that we can make as many happy memories as possible while I can.' - Clare Van Santen. Some of the items on the mother-of-five's list include: . Then at the beginning of this year, Ms Van Santen began having some strange symptoms once again. 'I'd been having headaches and just forgetting things, and sometimes I'd read something and the worlds had been jumbled around. 'On February 14 I had a seizure and discovered the cancer had gone to my brain,' she revealed, saying the horrible event happened in front of three of her kids. Radiation therapy is currently trying to shrink the ten tumors spread throughout her brain, but the cancer is inoperable, and devastatingly, terminal. As for how much time Ms Van Santen has left with her children, it's impossible to know. 'They can’t say,' she said, speaking of her doctors. 'They've said a few months to a few years.' Ms Van Santen has a bucket list of things she hopes to do, see and experience with her family before her time is up, but life is much harder for her than it used to be. With the time she has left she hopes to makeover the kids' rooms so they have their own sanctuary, get a 'HUGE comfortable leather lounge for me and kids to sit on, so I can be with them', and fix up other things around the house. Ms Van Santen also wants to go on a family holiday on a cruise, have a photo-shoot with her kids, and simply 'make lots of little moments special'. She has thrown her support behind Breast Cancer Care's Buying Time campaign which aims to raise money to fund more breast cancer nurses . Ms Van Santen, pictured here with eldest daughter Keisha, is not sure how much time she has left with her kids . And perhaps the most important: 'Finding someone who will love my kids nearly as much as I do!'. But the medication she currently on makes her more exhausted than 'I've ever been in my life', and leaves her wiped out for days at a time. However the mum-of-five said her life would be even more difficult if she didn't have the support of Breast Cancer Care, WA. She has thrown her support behind the Buying Time Campaign, which aims to raise money which will go towards funding more breast cancer nurses and support services. 'I've rung them crying so many times,' Ms Van Santen revealed. 'Their support is so, so amazing.' When a patient first receives their diagnosis and calls the care centre, they are allocated a nurse who helps them through their entire journey. The nurses make house calls, ring and check up on them, send counsellors out to get people through tough times and help patients get connected with support groups. She hopes to take her family on a holiday together, and get a photoshoot with everyone soon . Ms Van Santen also hopes to raise awareness about the mortality rates of women with breast cancer . 'They help with everything, if you need some financial help, or you need legal help, if you need a lift...' Ms Van Santen said. '(And) it’s good to be able to speak to other people going through the same thing,' she added, speaking of the help she received through her Stage 4 support group. Through her involvement in this campaign, Ms Van Santen also wants to help raise awareness about the mortality rates of women who suffer from breast cancer. She has questioned why she is classified as a 'survivor' because she has lived for more than five years after her diagnosis, but will still eventually succumb to the disease. Ms Van Santen said she would like to see more research done on Stage 4, or terminal, breast cancer because even though hers was detected early, it will still eventually take her life. 'So much money goes into awareness for breast cancer, but no money goes into actually researching Stage 4 cancer,' she said, adding that as it's the one that takes lives there should be more known about it. Ms Van Santen hopes in the future there can be more awareness about the mortality rates of the disease, and that people know that even if detected early, that breast cancer can still kill. 'It’s important for so many people, you know, my kids, people's families', she said. You can support the Buying Time campaign here, donate to help Clare Van Santen tick things off her bucket list here, or keep up with her journey here.","Clare Van Santen, 37, has Stage 4 breast cancer, which means it's terminal .

"Feline family ties proved essential at a zoo in Japan recently after a newly born white tiger cub fell in to a pool of water, and had to get his brothers to come to the rescue. Born on January 25 and almost three months old, the quadruplet male cubs were let out into their glass cages for the first time at the Tobu Zoo in Saitama prefecture, on the outskirts of Tokyo. Initially hesitant to go out in front of a crowd of zoo staff and visitors, the cubs were encouraged by their mother, Cara, aged nine, to walk out of their cage and into the outdoors living space. Curiosity soon got the better of the cubs, who began playing around the water area. Then trouble struck; one accidentally fell into the play pool. Noticing that he was in trouble, his brothers ran to the rescue. Grabbing him where they could, it took two kitties at least three attempts to finally manage to pull out their loudly complaining brother.

"The mother-of-three who dropped her two-year-old son into a cheetah pit is the assistant director of a childcare center. Michelle Schwab, who has three sons and a degree in therapeutic childcare, has been charged with child endangerment after  she allegedly dangled her child over the 10-foot-deep enclosure in Cleveland Metroparks Zoo before he slipped and fell. She faces six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Visitors heard a scream at 3pm on Saturday and looked to see Schwab, 38, and her husband leaping into the pit to retrieve the child, who was treated for a leg injury. On Monday, a spokesman for KinderCare, a nationally-acclaimed education, care and resource provider, confirmed Schwab has taken a leave of absence from her management role at one of the centers in Columbus, Ohio. Scroll down for video . Charged: Michelle Schwab, a mother-of-three with a degree in therapeutic childcare, has been charged with child endangerment for allegedly dangling her son of a cheetah pit. She is an assistant director at KinderCare . Witnesses say Schwab jumped in to retrieve the boy from the compound at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo at 3pm on Saturday. The animals appeared to ignore the boy, witnesses say (file image of one of the zoo's cheetahs) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . In an email to DailyMail.com, spokesman Colleen Moran said: 'We were saddened to hear of Saturday’s incident at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo involving Michelle Schwab’s son, and we wish him a speedy recovery. 'Ms Schwab has been the Assistant Director at the Sawmill Road KinderCare in Columbus. She is currently home with her family, and will remain out of our center while this issue is investigated and addressed. 'In addition to the agencies looking into this issue, we are looking into the incident further ourselves, as we closely examine issues involving the treatment of children by our employees, even if those incidents arise outside of our centers.' Schwab, of Delaware, Ohio, was charged on Monday in Cleveland Municipal Court and will be arraigned on April 22. On Sunday, Dr Christopher Kuhar, executive director at the zoo, said the two felines did not approach the boy when he fell in the pit. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' The exhibit was closed following the child's fall. Zoo visitor Michael Lurie was at the cheetah exhibit when he heard the child scream.

"Flying gas stations that can refuel robotic military aircraft have come a step closer. The first ever mid-air refuelling of an unmanned aircraft was today successfully achieved by the Navy's X-47B drone. The Salty Dog 502 vehicle is one of two Unmanned Carrier Air Vehicle demonstrators (UCAS-D) on the X-47B program. Scroll down for video . The first mid-air refuelling of an unmanned aircraft was today successfully achieved by the Navy's X-47B drone. Earlier today, the aircraft plugged its in-flight refuelling (IFR) probe into the hose of an Omega Air KC-707 tanker off the coast of Maryland . Earlier today, it plugged its in-flight refuelling (IFR) probe into the hose of an Omega Air KC-707 tanker off the coast of Maryland. During the test, it trailed the Omega Air Refuelling 707 tanker from a mile off before using optical sensors and a video camera to monitor its approach to within 20 feet (six metres). Depending on the weather, the aerial refuelling demonstrations are due to last throughout the weekend. The drone is about the size of an F/A-18 Super Hornet, weighs in at 44,000 lb (20,000kg) and has a 62ft (20m) wingspan. Salty Dog 502 is one of two Unmanned Carrier Air Vehicle demonstrators (UCAS-D) on the X-47B program . The goal of each of the refuelling demonstrations is to transfer 3,000lbs of fuel in five minutes. But this is the final test of the historic X-47B, which will now be donated to museums despite, according to Foxtrot Alpha, only having 20 per cent of their flight hours used up. Refuelling in flight is the last hurdle for the Northrop Grumman-built jet, claims to Captain Beau Duarte, program manager of the Navy's Unmanned Carrier Aviation. With a wingspan of 130 feet, the Triton is wider than commercial airliners such as the Boeing 737 . An airliner-sized Navy surveillance drone made its first transcontinental flight in September, flying 11 hours across the US. The cross-country test was the first for the MQ-4C Triton, which will play a role in the Navy's planned Broad Area Maritime Surveillance program. The drone can provide blanket surveillance for the Navy as part of the branch's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance program. Triton uses 'radar, infrared sensors and advanced cameras to provide full-motion video and photographs' to Navy personnel. Northrop Grumman says the unmanned aircraft also has a capacity to fly up to 28 hours at a time and surveil 1million square miles in a single mission. With a wingspan of 130 feet, the Triton is wider than commercial airliners such as the Boeing 737. Mid-air refuelling is difficult enough for human pilots, but the ability for drones to do it could eman they only ever have to land for equipment updates. The Navy envisions the X-47B's successors, the UCLASS drones, as making 24-7 patrols around aircraft carriers. 'We will have met all of the program's mission objectives and will [take] those lessons learned, fold them into the UCLASS performance specification,' Duarte said. The X-47B drone is about the size of an F/A-18 Super Hornet, weighs in at 44,000 lb (20,000kg) and has a 62ft (20m) wingspan .","Salty Dog 502 trailed Omega Air Refuelling 707 tanker from a mile off .

"A man was horrified after finding a five inch piece of TIMBER in his frozen curry. John Foran’s wife Nita was preparing a chicken tikka biryani stir-fry on Tuesday April 7 when he found the splinter-covered shard. The £2 ready meal was bought from an Iceland Foods store in Spytty Retail Park near the couple’s home in Newport, South Wales, within the last two weeks. John Foran was horrified to find a five inch piece of timber in his Iceland chicken tikka biryani curry . John, 59, said: 'When it fell out of the bag I couldn’t believe it. 'As Nita was putting it in the stir fry dish, she thought it was just a big bit of veg. 'It was a piece of wood with splinters coming off it. 'I just don’t understand how it got inside.' Iceland  said they are carrying out a thorough investigation into how the timber shard came to be in the curry . Shocked John immediately contacted Iceland who are currently investigating the matter. He said: “It may only have been £2 but that’s beside the point. 'Things like this should not be in your food. 'I contacted Iceland and all they said was take it back to the shop and that they’ll be in touch. 'But I want people to know what could be hiding in their meal.” An Iceland spokeswoman said: ’Please be assured that we take all complaints extremely seriously. We can confirm that Mr Foran has now been in touch with our customer care department regarding the foreign body found in his ready meal. 'Mr Foran is returning the item to the store and the foreign body will be collected by our supplier in order for them to carry out a thorough investigation. As soon as we have the results of this investigation we will get back in touch with Mr Foran.’","Man left horrified after discovering TIMBER in frozen Iceland curry .

"The case of a British woman allegedly murdered by her pastor husband in Ghana took an astonishing twist last week when a court was told that she died of a heroin overdose. Hotel staff found the body of pregnant Charmain Speirs face-down in a bath where it is believed she had been lying for four days. Her husband Eric Isaiah Adusah – a self-proclaimed prophet and evangelical preacher – has been charged with her murder. Pastor Eric Isaiah Adusah has been charged with the murder of his pregnant wife, Charmaine Spears . Ms Speirs and Mr Adusah, who were married last September, were said to have argued during their stay . Local news reports said an autopsy showed the mother of one died of 'opiate heroin overdose'. Mr Adusah's defence lawyer Mr Adomako Acheampong has claimed in court that 41-year-old Ms Speirs was a habitual heroin user – and that her whole family were addicted to the drug. But speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Ms Speirs's brother Paul said that his sister had never touched drugs and it was 'an outrageous lie' to say his family were all addicts. He added: 'The defence lawyer seems to be suggesting she had been a heroin addict for years but that's absolute rubbish.' The gardener, 30, admitted that he had battled heroin addiction – but said it had been Ms Speirs who ensured he sought help at a Christian-run rehabilitation centre near Glasgow. He insisted he had now been drug-free for ten years. He also said his sister, who had an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship, would not have taken any such substances of her own accord, adding: 'My sister was always against drugs.' The couple pictured on a Christmas card. Mr Adusah is the leader of Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, north London and has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010 . And he rejected the claim that his entire family, including parents Peter, 63, a self-employed plumber, and 61-year-old cleaner Linda, were addicted to drugs, saying: 'My parents can't stand the things.' He revealed that Charmain's family had been surprised at her 'whirlwind marriage' to Mr Adusah last September and had never trusted him. And he said that her friends had noticed changes in Ms Speirs after she met and then married 28-year-old Mr Adusah, who was based in Britain but is originally from Ghana. Ms Speirs grew up in Arbroath in the Angus region of Scotland before moving to Swansea, where she studied photojournalism and then worked as a radiography assistant for the NHS. Last year she married Mr Adusah, leader of the Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, North London. He has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010. The couple travelled to Ghana early last month so Mr Adusah could preach at a three-day religious rally. On March 16 after the rally the couple checked in to the upmarket Mac-Dic Royal Plaza Hotel in Koforidua for five days. But when Mr Adusah left at dawn on their second day, he reportedly told reception staff not to disturb his wife as she was 'fasting and praying', and left a Do Not Disturb notice on the door. Hotel managers became concerned when Ms Speirs would not respond when they knocked. On March 20, porters used a spare key to gain access and made the grim discovery. Now her family are desperately seeking answers as they try to piece together fragments of information. Mr Speirs said: 'We've been left in the cold, we don't know a thing. My mum and dad just want to get Charmain's body back home.' A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.' Mr Adusah has been charged with murder in Ghana and has had his application for bail rejected. He has not yet entered a plea. The case has been adjourned until later this month.","Charmain Speirs allegedly murdered by pastor husband Eric Isaiah Adusah .

"The University of Michigan yanked an upcoming screening of the Oscar-nominated drama American Sniper over student complaints but quickly did an about-face after news of the cancellation sparked a firestorm on campus. The school tweeted out a statement saying the ‘decision to cancel not consistent w/high value @Umich places on freedom of expression.’ That tweet was linked to a statement by E. Royster Harper, the school's vice president for student life, acknowledging that it was ‘a mistake’ to call off the screening. ‘The movie will be shown at the originally scheduled time and location,’ Harper’s statement read. ‘We recognize, however, that some students are uncomfortable with the content of the movie, and appreciate that concern. It's back on: The University of Michigan nixed an upcoming screening of the Oscar-nominated drama American Sniper over student complaints but quickly did an about-face . The movie was originally set to be shown during a student mixer Friday, but the university decided to cancel the screening over complaints that American Sniper portrays Muslims as villains . ‘Therefore, the university also will show an alternative movie, “Paddington,” in another location on campus at that same time and date to provide our students with additional options that evening.’ The Michigan Daily originally reported that the Center for Campus Involvement has announced the decision to cancel the showing Tuesday in response to complaints by students about portrayals of Arabs and the Middle East in the film, starring Bradley Cooper as America’s most lethal sniper Chris Kyle. Sophomore Lamees Mekkaoui started a petition earlier in the day after learning that a showing of the film was planned for Friday. Mekkaoui identifies as Arab and Middle Eastern and feels the film ‘condones a lot of anti-Middle Eastern and North African propaganda.’ The student's petition, which was signed by hundreds of people, described the Navy SEAL sharpshooter, who was shot dead by a fellow Marine at a gun range last year, as a 'mass killer' and 'a racist who took a disturbing stance on murdering Iraqi civilians.' Mekkaoui said that she had seen American Sniper earlier and it made her feel 'uncomfortable.' She suggested that showing the film on campus could incite viewers to violence against Muslims. Not mincing words: Sophomore Lamees Mekkaoui (left) started a petition saying the subject of the film, the late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle (right), was 'mass killer' and 'a racist' Taking a stand: The school's head football coach Jim Harbaugh responded to the movie controversy by tweeting that his team would watch the film . Instead of American Sniper, the school planned to show the PG-rated Paddington . The student center responded to Ms Mekkaoui's petition by issuing and apology and replacing the R-rated film about the war in Iraq with a PG-rated children's movie about a stuffed bear. On Wednesday, conservative campus group Young Americans for Freedom started a competing petition calling on the Ann Arbor school to show the film, reported Detroit Free Press. 'The movie ‘American Sniper’ is not about a racist mass murderer or a criminal,' the petition read. 'It is about a decorated American war hero who served his country valiantly. 'If the University prevents a movie like this from being shown, it promotes intolerance and stifles dialogue and debate on the subject…As adults at a public university, we should have the option to view this movie if we so choose and have the opportunity to engage on the topics it presents to come to our own conclusions on the subjects.' The school's head football coach responded to the movie kerfuffle by tweeting that his team would watch the film. 'Proud of Chris Kyle & Proud to be an American & if that offends anybody then so be it!' Coach Jim Harbaugh tweeted late Wednesday night. The high-grossing blockbuster directed by Clint Eastwood was originally scheduled to be shown during a student mixer Friday. Now, American Sniper will be screened separately from the UMix Late Night event, 'in a forum that provides an appropriate space for dialogue and reflection,' the Center for Campus Involvement said in a statement.","Center for Campus Involvement announced cancellation Tuesday in response to complaints about portrayals of Arabs in the film .

"When President Barack Obama dined with a dozen technology business leaders in California four years ago, it was Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt who sat at the head of the table. Obama sat on one side, between the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Facebook pioneer Mark Zuckerberg, but the place of honor was no accident. Google executives and employees donated more than $1.6 million to Obama's two White House campaigns, and the online search giant parachuted top talent into both. One result has been a coziness with the U.S. government's executive branch that few other companies can match – marked by access for lobbyists, mentions in nearly half of Obama's State of the Union addresses, and a personnel feeder trough serving the White House with new senior hires. BEGINNING: In 2007 Barack Obama had an on-stage cameo with Google's then-CEO Eric Schmidt as part of a presidential candidate series . INFLUENCE: Schmidt (far left) shared the head of the table with the spouse of a venture capitalist whose firm owned 20 per cent of Google, as President Obama dined with tech leaders in 2011 . There have even been allegations that Google's up-close-and-personal relationship with the West Wing earned it a reprieve from what would have been an earth-shaking Federal Trade Commission antitrust lawsuit. Google has insisted it never received special treatment in that case, punctuating its denials with an animated GIF of a laughing baby as a jab at the news outlet that leveled the charge. White House visitor logs suggest a different kind of story for the company whose motto is 'Don't be evil.' Employees of the Silicon Valley behemoth have been in the White House more than 230 times since Obama took office – approximately once per week. At least 190 of those meetings were with senior officials. More than 60 featured Google lobbyist Johanna Shelton. Overall, according to The Wall Street Journal, Google spent $16.8 million on lobbying last year. That's four times the amount spent by Apple, whose market capitalization is twice as big. It needed that muscle in 2011, after the FTC found Google allegedly manipulated search results in ways that favored its own for-profit products. Amazon and eBay were among the companies who complained that Google was engaging in practices that violated antitrust laws. The Journal reviewed emails showing that Google co-founder Larry Page met directly with FTC officials in late 2012 to discuss a settlement. About the same time, White House visitor logs show, Google chairman Eric Schmidt met with Obama senior adviser Pete Rouse. REVOLVING DOOR? Google vice president Megan Smith left her job to become Obama's chief technology officer . Lobbyist Joanna Shelton and General Counsel Kent Walker met with Jason Furman, then the newly minted chair of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. Furman followed up with a meeting with FTC chairman Jon Leibowitz. The government closed its investigation two months after Obama won re-election. READY FOR HILLARY: Stephanie Hannon, director of product management, civic innovation and social impact at Google, has become the Hillary Clinton campaign's top technology guru . Google agreed to change its business practices but dodged a potential 10-figure fine – and saved the cost of litigating a years-long case that could have resulted in breaking up the company into smaller, more market-competitive units. Both Google and the FTC said at the time that there was no undue influence. Google pilloried the Journal, which first suggested a link between the company's access and the investigation's outcome, saying the meetings its executives held with administration officials involved discussions about 'everything but' the antitrust investigation. In a blog post, the company cited 'patent reform, STEM education, self-driving cars, mental health, advertising, Internet censorship, smart contact lenses, civic innovation, R&D, cloud computing, trade and investment, cyber security, energy efficiency and our workplace benefit policies.' The written defense Google published took specific aim at Journal publisher Rupert Murdoch, and included an animated GIF of a laughing baby in a high chair. But a Google spokesperson confirmed Thursday on background that company executives has talked with the FTC about unspecified antitrust concerns in the past. The spokesperson declined to be quoted or named. Schmidt is a one-man case study of the kinds of influence a multibillionare tech titan can wield in Washington when the stars align. LEFT-HAND MAN: Schmidt (right) got a prime seat at the table when newly minted President Obama met with a group of CEOs in February 2009 . 'EVANGELIST': Online pioneer Vint Cerf is Google's top 'Internet evangelist' and also a member of Obama's National Science Board . His ascent in Obama's world began in 2007 when the future president visited Google's California headquarters for a one-on-one interview, staged for the benefit of the company's employees, then 16,000 strong. Schmidt asked him about Iran, Pakistan, and Guantanamo Bay. 'Close down Guantanamo,' Obama replied, 'restore Habeas Corpus, say no to Renditions, no to warrantless wiretaps.' The exposure was vital: Obama ended up lapping the field in fundraising in the high-tech sector. Obama offered Schmidt his choice of cabinet slots after the 2012 election – either Treasury or Commerce – and was even prepared to create a new 'Secretary of Business' position for him. He declined all three but accepted a post on the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. He continues to evangelize about both his company and the president's agenda, including 'net neutrality' regulations that have big Internet service providers up in arms. Schmidt's roots with Obama run deep. When the future president visited his campaign headquarters on Election Day in 2012, Schmidt was there overseeing final efforts to leverage 'Big Data' to nudge last-minute voters to the polls. He was by then already a donor to Obama's White House bids, contributing the maximum amount allowed by law both times. Schmidt's specialized software gave then-Senator Obama access to high-tech voter targeting algorithms that Republican John McCain couldn't match. HIGH LIFE: Google Ideas director Jared Cohen co-wrote a book with Princess Beatrice of York in 2013, three years after he left the Obama State Department to work for the search giant . ELECTION KINGS: Michael Slaby (left) and Justin Vincent (right) were key architects of Obama's data-mining and voter-targeting software efforts, and both were emigres from Google . And Michael Slaby, the chief integration and innovation officer af Obama For America, the president's campaign organization came over from a job as technology strategist for TomorrowVentures – Schmidt's venture capital fund. OFA also boasted former Google software engineer Justin Vincent as its senior codewriter, and former YouTube/Google lead Web developer Angus Durocher as its lead online software engineer. Google itself was accused publicly of favoring Obama's 2012 re-election campaign in a more visible way. Customized search results would appear when users typed 'Obama' into a search window, but entering 'Romney' yielded no such help. Google claimed at the time that it was the result of a computer algorithm, not human intervention. This week the president's new initiative linking global warming with public health includes a specific buy-in from Google. The company, the White House says, will 'donate ten million hours of high-performance computing' and help scientists to create 'early warning capabilities' for climate change-related disasters and related risks for diseases. Some of that work could conceivably be performed by former White House staff who have joined Google, just as the president counts several former Google executives among his advisers. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton this week hired away a top tech talent from Google for her presidential campaign-in-waiting. Stephanie Hannon, formerly Google's top dog on product management for 'civic engagement,' will help her navigate the digital waters in 2016. Poaching seasoned Google veterans is a maneuver the Obama White House has perfected. Megan Smith, a former vice president at the company, is now the administration's chief technology officer. Angus Durocher, a computer engineer who left Google to work for the Obama campaign, tweeted this photo of himself and Vice President Joe Biden when he was at work in the campaign's New Hampshire nerve center . The deputy CTO position was held for Obama's first two years by another Google emigre, Andrew McLaughlin. He left the administration in 2011 after a reprimand for sharing details of government policy matters with his former coworkers via a personal email address. Shortly after Obama moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, former Google project manager Katie Stanton became his director of citizen participation. Sonal Shah, a former Google global development chief, moved to Washington the same month to lead the White House Office of Social Innovation. And Vint Cerf, a widely acknowledged 'father of the Internet,' serves on Obama's National Science Board. Cerf has worked for Google since 2005 as a vice president and its 'chief Internet evangelist.'","Google employees donated $1.6 million to President Barack Obama's two White House bids .

"J.B. Silverthorn got charged with a DUI moments after being convicted for his first on Monday . A 44-year-old man got charged with a DUI moments after being convicted for his first, after allegedly turning up to court drunk and driving away. Police say they repeatedly told J.B.

But the suspect reportedly proceeded to get in his car and pull out of the parking lot before being stopped by deputies. Silverthorn was charged with felony DUI, meaning he could serve a minimum of one year in jail. He was also booked for driving without headlights. He's currently being held in the Erie County jail with his bail set at $1,000. It couldn't be determined if he has a lawyer. Silverthorn was deemed guilty this week for driving over the limit and crashing his car into the Niagara River on December 29.

"Aaron Hernandez left behind his life as a millionaire star athlete today, swapping a designer suit for a set of gray scrubs at a prison  where he will begin a life sentence for murder. It is perhaps fitting that Hernandez was booked at MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, a prison just across the freeway from Gillette Stadium where he used to play for the New England Patriots. Hernandez hasn't set foot in the stadium since June 2013, when he was arrested under suspicion of murdering Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianceé at the time. On Wednesday, a 12-person jury found Hernandez guilty, sentencing him to life in prison without the possibility of parole due to some especially heinous aspects of Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . The beginning of the rest of his life: Aaron Hernandez was taken to the MCI Cedar Juntion prison in Walpole, Massachusetts on Wednesday after he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez circled in red, arriving at the 700-inmate prison . Old neighborhood: Cedar Junction is about a mile and a half away from Gillette Stadium, where Hernandez used to play tight end for the New England Patriots . Nothing to smile about now: Hernandez slumped down in his chair on Wednesday as a guilty verdict was read (left). Pictured on the right during happier times, playing for the Patriots . Hernandez was shocked by the decision, mouthing 'You're wrong', before slumping to his seat - perhaps seeing the riches to rags reality of his new life. Hernandez has vowed to appeal the decision. Directly after court, Hernandez was taken to the 700-inmate facility that will serve as a stark contrast to his former home - a $1.3million mansion. Hernandez arrived at Cedar Junction around 1pm for booking and was given the prison number W106228. The booking process took about two hours, and was probably not the most comfortable of experiences. According to a report by WBUR, new inmates at the facility are taken downstairs into the basement where the intake center is located. It is there that they change into their new uniform of gray scrubs and laceless canvas shoes, turning over their personal clothes to be either incinerated or mailed home. New home: Hernandez is starting his sentence at maximum-security prison MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts (pictured above) Stately: Before his arrest, Hernandez lived in a $1.3million mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts (pictured above . They then post for a new mugshot and are fingerprinted before sitting in a special chair that scans their bodies for possible hidden objects. All new inmates receive a paper bag containing seven pairs of underwear and a specially-designed razor and pen that can't be used as a weapon. Jerry-rigged weapons are something Hernandez should be concerned with, according to Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hogson. Sheriff Hogson spoke with WHDH after the ruling on Wednesday and said that as the focus of a high-profile case, Hernandez will be targeted in the prison. 'It depends how he's classified or where he'll be, but it's always a possibility, always a concern,' Hodgson said. Labor: Workers at Cedar Junction's prison manufacture license plates for 50 cents an hour - a far cry from the $40million contract extension Hernandez received from the Patriots in 2012 . The food at Cedar Junction was described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Hernandez pictured above eating chicken after a Patriots game . Some other aspects of prison life may not be up to Hernandez's standards either - such as the 50 cents an hour inmates are paid to manufacture license plates. In 2012, the Patriots extended Hernandez's contract for five years in a $40million deal that was unprecedented for a tight end. Also in 2012, he signed a deal to be a spokesman for shoe brand Puma. And for a former professional athlete who's used to eating large satisfying meals, Hernandez may lose his appetite in the cafeteria where the food was once described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Cedar Point is where all male inmates are booked when they start their sentences in Massachusetts, so Hernandez will eventually be moved to another facility in the coming weeks or months, . It's reported that he will be sent to Sousa Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Massachusetts next.

"The plastic surgeon who gave a 'Brazilian butt lift' to a young Australian tourist who died during the procedure lost another patient just a year before her tragic death, it has been revealed. The family of Evita Nicole Sarmonikas arrived back in Sydney on Tuesday from Mexico where they flew on a mission to bring her body home, after being pressured to have her remains created before an official autopsy could be carried out following her death in March this year. It has now been revealed Dr Victor Ramirez, of the Hospital Quirurgico del Valle in Mexicali, the capital city of the Mexican state of Baja California, operated on Roseann Falcon Ornelas in 2014. Australian woman Evita Nicole Sarmonikas died while undergoing plastic surgery last month in Mexico . The 52-year-old American woman was given a tummy tuck by Dr Ramirez, and began complaining of shortness of breath just five hours after her operation, and was in so much pain she could not move. Ms Ornelas sister Belinda Munoz told The ABC's 7 30 Report that she 'sat there in a mess of fluids and blood just oozing out of her body causing her to be soaked in bed. And yet the clinic associates refuse to change her bedding or help in any way.' Ms Munoz said that she wished she had spoken out about Dr Ramirez when her sister died, and that 'now the beautiful Evita is gone. My heart breaks for her family'. 29-year-old Evita Sarmonikas, from the Gold Coast, was admitted to Hospital Quirurgico del Valle on March 20 while on holiday with her boyfriend, and died on the same day. Her sister Andrea told 7 30 Report that the clinic in Mexicali attempted to convince Ms Sarmonikas boyfriend to have her body cremated before an official autopsy could be conducted. Her family insisted that an independent inquest into her death be arranged, and flew over to Mexico to collect her body. 'I knew I had to go over. I wasn't going to let her body leave without having a proper investigation,' Andrea told 7 30. Dr Ramirez lost another patient the year before Ms Sarmonikas died on his operating table . Ms Sarmonikas' sister Andrea told 7 30 Report that the clinic in Mexicali attempted to convince Ms Sarmonikas boyfriend to have her body cremated before an official autopsy could be conducted . Ms Sarmonikas's sister and her mother flew to Mexico to collect her body after an official autopsy . When Andrea and her grieving mother arrived in Mexico, they were handed paperwork that Ms Sarmonikas was meant to have filled out before surgery, and found that sections were incomplete. Ms Sarmonikas' sister said that the autopsy also highlighted discrepancies in the report prepared by the Mexican clinic. 'It's information that confirms this needs to be investigated seriously and that there are some irregularities that need to be clarified,' she said. The President of the College of Plastic Surgeons in Mexicali confirmed that Dr Ramirez's certification had lapsed, and that he had been stood down until after the investigation into Ms Sarmonikas' death had been completed. 'Currently, due to issues referring to our association's guidelines, statutes, and rules, he is temporarily suspended from duty,' Marco Antonio Gutierrez Lamadrid said. The Hospital Quirurgico del Valle has also been closed down amid dozens of reports of poor hygiene, outdated facilities and unsafe practices. An inspection also discovered inadequate operating theatres, insufficient post operative care and outdated medical devices, according to Proceso. The Australian Medical Association has warned Australians of the danger of travelling to developing countries to seek cosmetic surgery. The AMA's vice president Dr Stephen Parnis said that doctors would often see complications such as bleeding, wound breakdown, and wound complications in patients who underwent the procedures. Ms Saarmonikas died at the Hospital Quirurgico del Valle in Mexicali, the capital city of the Mexican state of Baja California . Andrea Sarmonikas said that the clinic's report revealed inconsistencies . The family of American woman Belinda Munoz, who died after being operated on by Dr Ramorez, said they wished they had spoken out after her death . 'What we see from time to time is things like infections, often with highly resistant bugs that we don't see in Australia,' Dr Parnis said. 'We have no information about the original procedure and it often makes it more difficult to care for that person in the absence of that vital medical information,' he said. Dr Parnis said that Australia had a 'world-class' level of care and that regulation was taken seriously. 'That often does not occur in other parts of the world. And that is important because that is an important check on the standards provided so that we can find if there is an adverse outcome and why it happens,' he said. A statement from Ms Sarmonikas' family released a statement urging other women not to 'risk death to improve on perfection'. 'The autopsy showed Eva went into cardiac arrest following surgery. The hospitals' only response was to cling to their waiver, removing themselves from any liability,' a family member wrote on the Facebook group. 'There have been no answers and their only offer of 'cooperation' was an urgency to return her to us in the form of ashes. The Australian Embassy has strongly advised we do not allow this to happen,' the statement said. 'Evita as we knew her on earth would be devastated at the amount of attention she is receiving at the moment, as she was extremely private and worked very hard to never be a burden on anybody,' her family wrote. 'However the abundance of love that we all hold for her is propelling the action that needs to be taken before she be laid to rest, and she deserves that.' Dr Victor Ramirez's name made headlines in 2012 after he used a photo of Kim Kardashian on a billboard to advertise his services . Tributes have poured in for Evita Nicole Sarmonikas (right, pictured with friend Sherri Burton) after her death in a Mexican hospital last week . Ms Sarmonikas's family did not at first say what procedure Evita was undergoing before she died but they explained: 'As beautiful as Evita was inside and out. She was still filled with certain inadequacies. As almost every woman on earth does.' 'Her perfect and whole soul was not strong enough in light of a world that constantly bombarded her with an urgency to demand more from herself and her body,' they explained. 'She never demanded anything from anybody, but was always out giving her people. These near perfect graphic comparisons our young women are bombarded with from get go are too much for innocent hearts to battle, and the consequences are fatal when not conducted by adequate professionals. 'These doctors promised her more perfection to fill an emptiness that began developing early in our childhood. This emptiness further expanded with traumatic experiences in her adult life and the constant social boarding of a false beauty illusion,' they Facebook post continued. Her sister Andrea has urged others not too risk their lives in the pursuit of what they perceive as beauty. 'This was not the way to go home, no woman should risk death to improve on perfection,' they said. 'Tomorrow morning when you look in the mirror say to yourself 'I am enough, I am worthy, I am perfect just the way I am'. 'Don't listen to a world that is hungry to fill your insecurities with poison. Stop feeding an industry that hates humans, especially women in the natural state and their perfect birth bodies. Do it for Eva, do it for you.' The doctor who performed the procedure, Dr Ramirez, made headlines in 2012 after he used a photo of the famously curvaceous reality star Kim Kardashian on a billboard to advertise his services. A Facebook tribute page has been set up for Evita to share advice and support and to help fundraise to bring her body home to Australia . Tributes have also poured in from friends and family, vowing to remember her as a happy woman . The billboard was accompanied with the slogan 'No arriesgue su belleza, ni su salud', which translates as 'Don't risk your beauty or your health' - a bid to encourage people to visit a professional plastic surgeon instead of an unsafe one. Dr Ramirez's website says the ideal candidate for buttock augmentation surgery is someone with 'lack of volume of the buttocks'. 'Currently, the safest way to achieve the desired results through buttock augmentation is using silicone implants,' an outline of the procedure which takes 2 and a half hours reads. 'Although it might seem easy and economical, never allow anyone to inject substances that increase the volume of the buttocks through the injection of oily substances because the damage that they cause is irreversible due to the fact that the modelling agents cannot be extracted from your body and will generate serious problems the rest of your life.' The news comes after emotional tributes poured in for Ms Sarmonkias from friends and family. 'Eva my heart, my love, my joy. Where are you? I need you. We were meant to grow old together and still be conquering life hand in hand as sisters. I'm still not understanding. I haven't been able to sleep,' Sherri Burton wrote. Ms Burton recalled the last time the pair spoke, and the final day they spent together before Ms Sarmonkias went overseas. 'The last thing you wrote to me, about 7 hours before you went to be with our Heavenly Father, was ""wish you were here with me"". You always thought about me when you were having fun and wanted me to experience it. 'It has been 7 days since you were physically with me in this very room I’m typing in. Sitting on this very chair,' the tribute continued. 'Eva… There are not enough words to express how I feel about you. Thank you for loving me. I am honoured to have received such love. I am honoured to call you my sister. Ms Sarmonkias worked as a receptionist at LJ Hooker in Surfer's Paradise, and her former colleagues have remembered her as bubbly, bright and beautiful young woman. 'The LJ Hooker Surfers Paradise Network is deeply saddened to hear of the sudden passing of one of our past employees Eva Sarmonikas,' a statement read. 'With the bubbliest and brightest personality anyone could ever imagine it was a pleasure to hear her wonderful voice at the other end of the line.","Evita Sarmonikas, 29, died in Mexico in Mexico after undergoing a 'butt lift'

"A 3D printing company has created a prosthetic leg for a goose after it was left struggling for self confidence following an amputation. Ozzie the goose was close to being put down numerous times after he broke his leg and it was amputated at the joint. But an animal lover's appeal for help led to a South African tech company stepping in to manufacture him a brand new limb. Ozzie the goose has his stump measurements taken as BunnyCorp works to design him a new leg . Ozzie's new 3D printed leg (pictured) was designed in the shape and size of a goose leg to fit him perfectly . Philip Van Der Walt, director of BunnyCorp, said it was a few weeks ago when his company 'got word of a goose with a situation'. He said: 'He broke his leg and it had to be amputated at the joint. 'He was lucky as animal lover and rescuer Sue Burger got hold of him and started nursing him back to health. As time went by he struggled more and more to cope with only one leg resulting in damaged wings and self confidence. 'They considered ending his struggle many times but always decided not to. 'Out of desperation, Sue managed to get onto the national radio station here and called (South African broadcaster) RSG in the hope someone would hear their plea and be able to assist them somehow. 'Helen from 3D printing systems contacted me a few days later telling me about someone who is looking for help, as she normally sends us medical related queries. The prosthetic limb is composed of several parts and replacement pieces which comprise his new leg . After creating specific design files, a 3D printer was used to manufacture the new limb (pictured) 'We soon discovered that it was the same person from the radio. We contacted Sue and told her we would look into it and see if we can get something off the ground.' Mr Van Der Walt then gathered up sponsors to help fund what is believed to be the first 3D-printed prosthetic limb for an animal in South Africa. He added: 'Sue brought the goose to the BunnyCorp offices where we took photos and took measurements of the goose's leg. We explained to them the process and what we had planned and then set a date for the test. 'We started working and came up with a few possible solutions, we are by no means experts on animal prosthetic but we do work with human prosthetic and this did give us some insight on what should work. 'The CAD (computer-aided design) files where then sent to Hybrid Advanced Geometries to be 3D printed and finished. 'We got together on the 3rd of April and did a fitting test on the goose, the parts fitted perfectly but he was a bit confused about his new leg as he has been without one for about five months. 'He will need some therapy to assist him and close monitoring for a few days. We can then re-look the design and see if any improvements can be made before we 3D print the final product.' Ozzie the goose is able to fly short distances again after the replacement limb allowed him to properly land .","Ozzie the goose has been given a new leg manufactured using a 3D printer .

"A 'blokey' joke book on sale at River Island containing an offensive joke about domestic violence has caused a Twitter storm prompting the high street brand to withdraw it from shelves. The 'Very Blokey Joke Book' by Jake Harris, which  was displayed in the high street brand's menswear department and is also available on Amazon, contains a quip about a man watching his wife being beaten up by friends. The 'Really Blokey Jokes' book by Jake Harris on sale at River Island (left) contains an offensive joke about domestic violence (right) A picture of the offensive joke was first tweeted by media commentator Tim Doble via @BetterThanToday who was shocked when he noticed the joke in the book on the shop floot . 'A man is watching his wife get beaten up by five men when the police arrive,' reads the joke. '""Why didn't you help?""' asks one stunned cop. ""Five seemed enough,"" the man replied,' reads the offensive punchline. Shocked Twitter users branded the joke 'horrific' and 'staggeringly offensive' and demanded action from the clothing brand.

Within two hours of the first tweet being sent the brand posted an apology and confirmed they would be withdrawing the book from shelves. A River Island spokesperson confirmed to the MailOnline: 'River Island shares the concern expressed about this particular product. 'We removed the book from our stores as soon as it was brought to our attention and we have also taken steps to strengthen our controls internally to ensure an inappropriate product such as this could not find its way into our stores again.

The illustration also depicted a woman's mouth gagged with the football with speech bubbles saying: 'Get your clothes off the floor! Have you put the bins out? Switch the footy off!' The merchandise was received a barrage of criticism on twitter with one one blogger Joanne Harris branding it a 'revolting piece of sexism'. The company removed the item from its website and told the Daily Telegraph at the time: 'As soon as this product was brought to our attention we withdrew it from sale and removed it from our website.'

'Tragic if people take this to heart, it's a joke book,' wrote another. When one critic @JoeBoy_AFC was branded a misogynist for his support of the joke book, he ranted across three tweets: 'Who said I'm an outright misogynist? Because I'm not crying about a jokebook?

Defending his stance Tim Doble replied: 'You must be deluded if you think men and women are treated equally in the present day. We've come a long way, not far enough.' Tim also added: 'Remember that last time a joke book was published for women glorifying domestic abuse of men? Me neither.'

"It is the show with an ever rising death count, where not even the most powerful man in the kingdom is safe on the toilet. Yet, for its female characters, Game of Thrones has some of the most powerful roles for actresses on television. The HBO drama, which is based on George RR Martin's fantasy novels, is about to begin its fifth series, which has seen many of the female characters take leading roles - mainly because the men have died in increasingly tragic circumstances. Scroll down for video . Emilia Clarke, left, who plays Daenerys Targaryen believes Game of Thrones has great female characters . Lena Headey, left, has hinted that scheming Cersei Lannister may survive the ten episodes of season five . Arya Stark (played by Maisie Williams) grows from feisty tomboy to child assassin and nomad . Emilia Clarke, who plays Daenerys Targaryen is set to bring her army, replete with dragons, to Westeros for the final showdown. She said: 'You start to see all of the women in the show accepting who they are and embodying that with such power that it's palpable. 'I think that's the beauty of the show: as women, we accept our femininity and take strength from it, as opposed to trying to hide it and behave in a masculine way.' As series five begins, other female characters are battling for survival - and vengeance. Arya Stark is an assassin and a nomad, her older sister Sansa is forced to rely on her feminine wiles and sinister queen Cersei Lannister clings  to power in King's Landing. The sorceress Melisandre has control over another claimant to the throne, Stannis Baratheon, and is bringing her magic to The Wall, where Jon Snow struggles against incipient rebellion among the Night's Watch. Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) must rely on her feminine wiles to survive, while Tyrion Lannister is a renegade, fleeing from his family who want to kill him for slaughtering his father Tywin while he was on the loo . Despite the massive death count, Kit Harington, pictured, who plays Jon Snow has survived into series five . The beheading of Ned Stark, played by Sean Bean, was the most shocking death of the first series and a signal to fans that none of their heroes were safe . Charles Dance put in a terrifying performance as the stern patriarch Tywin Lannister who meets his end on the loo, shot by his son Tyrion with a crossbow . After four seasons of torture and explicit sex scenes the show has been criticised for the levels of sexual violence, yet it is the male characters who tend to meet an unfortunate end. Tywin Lannister, played by Charles Dance was shot on the toilet by his son, while Ned Stark, played by Sean Bean, was beheaded. No family escapes the slaughter with Tywin's grandson, the young King Joffrey killed by poisoned wine at his wedding. And his son-in-law King Robert Baratheon dies after being mauled by a wild boar. A key death that helps set Daenerys on her path to female warlord, liberator and fearsome 'Mother of Dragons', is that of her manipulative brother Viserys, who is killed by having molten gold poured over his head. King Joffrey (left), played by Jack Gleeson, is poisoned during his wedding to Margaery Tyrell; Daenaerys's brother Viserys Targaryen (Harry Lloyd),  is killed by having molten gold poured over his head . Khal Drogo, played by Jason Momoa, becomes ill from an infected wound and then the black magic his wife Daenerys employs to save him reduces him to a vegetative state, so she smothers him and burns his body . Daenerys's husband, the tribal leader Khal Drogo, then dies after a wise woman uses black magic to reduce him to a vegetative state - and his wife smothers him and burns his body. Despite the succession of ever more imaginative and shocking demises, Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark - the feisty child warrior who has yet to learn of her brother Robb's killing at the massacre dubbed the Red Wedding - has promised even bigger shocks in the new episodes. 'When I say, ""There's a massive change in Game of Thrones"", I think it's the first time I've actually meant it! People are going to think, ""You go through a change every year!"" Yet, according to the 17-year-old, viewers better brace themselves when the new series starts on Sky Atlantic in the UK. She said: 'But this year it's on a completely different level, and that's why it's so exciting. It sounds so broad, but actually ""change"" is really, really specific.' Richard Madden's Robb Stark (left), meets a grisly end during his own nuptials in a massacre dubbed the Red Wedding; Oberyn Martell, nicknamed The Viper (played by Pedro Pascal), is killed during a fight with man-mountain Gregor Clegane . The death of King Robert Baratheon, played by Mark Addy (left) kicks off the entire series, after he's mauled by a wild boar after his wife Cersei plied him with wine before a hunt; his brother Renly Baratheon, Gethin Anthony, (right) is assassinated by a shadow summoned by his own brother's sorceress adviser Melisandre . The fifth series also sees the introduction of three new female characters, known as the Sand Snakes. Part of a brood of eight illegitimate daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell, who is killed in a brutal fight with Gregor 'The Mountain' Clegane in Westeros at the end of season four, the women (Obara, Nymeria and Tyene), who are all trained in combat, seek revenge for the brutal death of their father. Meanwhile, Lena Headey, who plays the scheming Cersei Lannister, told the Radio Times that her character may survive the entire ten episodes of series five. One of the few left alive from  her family, with her father, husband and eldest son dead, and her twin brother (and former lover) roaming the land as a one-armed fighter, the former queen is fighting to remain in power. She told the magazine: 'Cersei's a woman born in the wrong time, to a terrible father, and raising her kids.' But she warns that the arch-manipulator is about to learn some 'really severe lessons'. Let the games begin.","Emilia Clarke who plays Daenerys Targaryen will be central to series five .

"Nobody dreams of being a step-parent says Christine Bleakley, but it's a job she's determined to do well for the two daughters of her fiance, footballer Frank Lamapard. Talking to The Times, the TV presenter has revealed that while a tough role to take on, dispelling old notions of the 'evil step-mother' has now become her main goal. The 36-year-old has been in a relationship with the Manchester City midfielder for fiver years, and says building a bond with his children has been a careful, 'well-thought-out process.' Scroll down for video . Christine Bleakley has opened up about the difficulties of becoming a step-mother to Frank Lampard's two daughters Isla (on Christine's lap), seven, and Luna (far right), nine . Frank and Christine are engaged to be married after meeting at the Pride of Britain Awards five years ago, and enjoying what the TV presenter has called an 'old-fashioned courtship' Christine's relationship with Frank's ex-wife and the mother of his children, Spanish model Elen Rivas, has been a long-distance one, fraught with tension fuelled by Twitter rants from fiery Rivas. But that doesn't appear to have prevented her from becoming very close to Luna, nine, and Isla, seven. It hasn't been easy though, says the Irish TV star. 'I'd like to think, if you asked the girls in ten years' time, they would say that it was a well-thought-out process - I didn't meet them for a year, on purpose.' Christine says she's glad to have forged a close bond with Frank's two daughters Isla (centre) and Luna (right), but admits that it has been a slow and carefully thought-out process . 'They know I'm their little mate. I don't want to be their mummy. That was never even a thought,' says TV presenter Christine of her closeness with Frank's children from his relationship with model Elen Rivas . Wanting to be careful of disrupting their lives, Christine, who currently presents new TV series Wild Ireland, says she and Frank waited until they were sure of their long-term feelings for each other, before introducing her into their lives. But if things got off to a slow start, it seems she's very much a permanent fixture in their world going forward. The star has a very hands-on with the two girls, who spend half the week at her and Franks home, and half the week with their mother Elen. She said: 'Frank's away a lot, their mummy could be away, I have them on my own. It's me going to violin recitals, me doing their homework, me doing the bathtime tonight and getting them to school in the morning - I've grown into that and we have our own little system.' Both Christine and Frank have expressed their desire to have children together in the past, but now say there are no current plans to have babies due to busy career schedules and a possible move to New York . Christine is currently presenting ITV show Wild Ireland, which sees her travel the west coast of her homeland . But while she's clearly a big influence in their lives and it's obvious that she enjoys the quality time she spends with the girls, Christine says she is very clear when it comes to the boundaries. She said: 'They know I'm their little mate. I don't want to be their mummy. That was never even a thought.' And while the pair have expressed desires to have their own children in the past, the 36-year-old is keen to add that with plenty of time taken up with careers and step-children, there are no current plans to make babies of her own any time soon. Despite not wanting to be seen as a 'mummy' replacement, Christine has said that she has a very hands-on role when it comes to looking after Frank's two children, given that he can be away a lot for football games . Christine recently joined Phillip Schofield as a guest presenter on This Morning while Holly Willoughby is currently on maternity leave following the birth of her third child in September . But while she's so far nailed the step-mother role and a Lampard/Bleakley wedding is slated for 'some time in the future', Christine says she won't be conforming to typical WAG traditions any time soon. Confessing the interview that she never for one minute ever imagined herself dating a footballer, the guest This Morning host says that her relationship with Frank began with 'an old-fashioned courtship.' After meeting at the Pride Of Britain Awards in 2009 following an introduction by Piers Morgan, Christine says the pair forged a deep and meaningful bond over long distance phone calls. 'I'd like to think, if you asked the girls in ten years' time, they would say that it was a well-thought-out process,' says the Irish TV star on her approach to becoming a step-mother to Frank's daughters . As for the gimmicky style that so often comes with being a top WAG? Forget it, says Christine. When it comes to her beauty regime, the brunette says she's extremely low maintenance, loving nothing more than the days she kicks back with little effort in the hair and make-up department, . Botox sounds like it's not on the menu either. When asked about facial fillers, she merely scoffed at the current craze for girls in their twenties even opting for the stuff. The TV presenter says she'll never become a typical WAG and has a low-maintenance beauty routine .

"Rita Wilson took to her Twitter account on Wednesday to thank her supporters, one day after revealing she has breast cancer and undergone double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The 58-year-old actress - who is married to actor Tom Hanks - tweeted: 'I am overwhelmed with gratitude by your prayers and good wishes and the kindness you're sending. Thank you. Thank you.' On Tuesday, she shared the news of her disease through a statement published by People magazine. Thanking her supporters: Rita Wilson took to her Twitter account on Tuesday after revealing she has breast cancer and undergone double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery (pictured in September 2014) Rita, who took a leave of absence from Broadway play 'Fish in the Dark' earlier this month, revealed she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and completed a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. She explained that her first test for cancer came back negative but that she was correctly diagnosed after seeking a second opinion and underwent the procedure last week. 'Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,' she said in the statement. Grateful for the outreach: 'I am overwhelmed with gratitude by your prayers and good wishes and the kindness you're sending. Thank you. Thank you' By her side: The star - married to Tom Hanks - announced on Tuesday that she was recently diagnosed with cancer and has undergone a double mastectomy (pictured together in February) 'I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.' A mastectomy is an operation that removes all or part of the breast. Before the diagnosis, Wilson said she had 'vigilantly monitored' her health with mammograms and MRIs because she knew she had an underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ)'. The mother-of-two explained that she recently underwent a breast biopsy, but no sign of cancer was discovered until she sought the opinion of a second doctor on the advice of a friend. The doctor discovered the cancer and she then sought out the opinion of another pathologist, who confirmed the diagnosis, she said. Recuperation: 'I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery' Advice: She shared the news on Facebook and linked to a statement printed by People magazine. Her cancer was not found in the first round of tests so she encourgaed others to seek a second opinion, like she did . Rita, who married Oscar-winner Tom in 1988, went on to implore others to seek a second opinion before thanking her loved ones for their support. 'I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,' she said. 'You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.' On Facebook on Tuesday, she encouraged other women to seek a 'necessary and vital' second opinion if they found themselves in similar situations. Treatment: Wilson, pictured last year, said she underwent two  breast biopsies before she was diagnosed . 'Not just by another doctor but by another pathologist,' she added. 'I'm doing well and getting stronger every day.' Following her announcement, famous friends passed on their best wishes to the actress. 'Sending the wonderful Rita Wilson my love and best wishes for a speedy recovery and good health,' Katie Couric wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning. Support: Celebrity friends flocked to Twitter to pass their best wishes to the actress after her announcement . Thankful: CNN host Christiane Amanpour noted how Wilson's statement will help future families . Christiana Amanpour added: 'Wishing my good friend @RitaWilson the best as she makes this important announcement, which will help millions of women and their families.' 'Sending all my love to the brave and beautiful @RitaWilson,' Josh Groban tweeted. Wilson released the statement on Tuesday after it was announced earlier this month that she had temporarily left the Broadway play, written by and starring Larry David. At the time, a spokesperson said Wilson was expected to return to the stage on May 5. While on medical leave, she has been replaced by Glenne Headly. Admiration: Singer Josh Groban also sent his best wishes to the actress on Twitter on Tuesday . By her side: Actress Christina Applegate also sent her love to Wilson . Wilson is also known as the mother of Marnie, played by Allison Williams, in HBO's 'Girls'. She has two sons with Hanks, Chester Marlon, 24, and Truman Theodore, 19, as well as two stepchildren from Hanks' previous marriage - actor Colin Hanks, 37, and writer Elizabeth, 32 - to whom Wilson is close. Hanks and their mother, Samantha Lewes, had met in college but divorced in 1987, the year before he married Wilson. Lewes passed away in 2002, when she was just 49, after battling bone cancer. Wilson's message to other women to get screened comes just days after Taylor Swift revealed her mother, Andrea, had been diagnosed with cancer. She also urged her fans to remind their parents to get checked. Family: Wilson is pictured with Hanks and one of their sons, Chester, in December 2011. The couple has two sons together and Hanks is also father to a daughter and son from his first marriage . Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast and spreads in a web-like manner. Due to this, it does not typically form a lump, as is expected with breast cancer, and instead causes a thickening of the tissue, making one part of the breast feel fuller than other areas. Other symptoms including a change in the texture of appearance of the skin on the breast, such as dimpling, or an inverted nipple. Women with this type of breast cancer are usually a few years older than women diagnosed with other types, and it is more likely to occur in both breasts compared with other types. The cancer is invasive, which means it has the potential to spread to other parts of the body. It can be found through screening tests including physical exams or mammograms. Mammograms are encouraged yearly when a woman turns 40s or earlier if they have a family history of breast cancer. Treatment includes removing part or all of the breast followed by chemotherapy or radiation. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year, and about one in ten cases are invasive lobular carcinomas. The earlier the diagnosis, the better the prognosis. Patients have a slightly better outlook for both short- and long-term survival compared to other types of breast cancer. According to a study by Breast Cancer Research, the five-year survival rate is 85 per cent.","The 58-year-old actress revealed her diagnosis in a statement on Tuesday .

"Two mothers who dramatically rescued a baby and group of young girls from rising tides were horrified to discover onlookers filming the incident instead of helping them. An 18-month-old baby and three girls - aged three, six and eight - were trapped on a sandbank at Blackpool Beach while out walking during the school break. But when it was obvious they had found themselves in trouble, those perched on the nearby pier did nothing to help - instead, they took out their smartphones to record the drama. Two mothers saved the lives of three girls and a baby after the youngsters were trapped by the rising tide . The Mirror reported the two mothers held the baby and young girls' heads above the rising tide until volunteer lifeboats reached them. Lifeboat crew member Nathan Lee told the paper: 'They thought they were going to die. One mum was disgusted people were filming it all on cameras, not helping. 'A few more minutes and none of them would be here.' The incident serves as just another reminder of the dangers of rising tides after more than 60 spectators had to be rescued at the Boat Race in London on Saturday. Lifeboats were deployed to transport the onlookers from the shore after they became trapped on the edge of the River Thames. Video footage showed a group of at least 40 people stranded by the rising waters after watching the rowing race between Oxford and Cambridge universities. A boy, reportedly eight years old, was also rescued from an embankment after he became separated from his mother, while seven people were evacuated from Chiswick Eyot when they were cut off by the rising tide. The RNLI said it was a 'surprise' to find so many spectators in trouble and the number was 'significantly greater' than in previous years. Many were unaware that they would be exposed to the substantial wash from the flotilla following the races and from the rising tide, it said. As a result many were cut off and found themselves with limited options to reach higher ground. Chiswick RNLI station manager Wayne Bellamy said: 'This incident showed once more that the tidal Thames can catch people unaware.'

"The world's biggest bunny is preparing to see his heavyweight title challenged - by his giant son. Darius, who measures over four feet long and weighs in at a whopping three and a half stone, is officially the world's biggest rabbit. But his title is now being contended by his son Jeff, who already measures 3ft 8in - with six months left of growing to do. Scroll down for video . New contender: Jeff the rabbit, pictured with his owner Annette Edwards, measures 3ft 8in long and is set to challenge for the title of the world's biggest bunny . The rabbits' owner, Annette Edwards, 63, from Bromsgrove, says she looks forward to the day when Jeff dwarfs his father. It costs her £5,000 a year to feed her giant bunnies as they munch their way through 2,000 carrots and 700 apples. The pair both also eat a huge dog bowl full of specialist rabbit food every day, and a bale of hay a week. Ms Edwards said: 'Although the pair of them are huge, they're the best animal friends I could ask for. Giant genes: Jeff, left, is pictured with his giant father Darius, who currently holds the record for being the world's largest rabbit . Rabbit fan: Ava Johnson, seven, struggles to pick up the monstrous Jeff as he is almost as large as her . 'They are both very laid back and chilled out - Jeff really takes after his Dad. Most rabbits like lots of attention and get on well with children and these two are no exception. 'They're even friendly to other animals! Jeff's best friend is my other pet, a boxer dog called Kay.' Continental Giants are the largest breed of rabbit and can grow to around 4ft when fully grown but Darius - who is officially four foot four inches long - and Jeff come from a bumper crop. Jeff was born after Ms Edwards introduced Darius to one of her other rabbits Sally - another Continental Giant who measures 3ft 5 inches. The family all live in her back garden but they are so big that they each require a dog crate that would normally house a pet as large as German shepherd. Annette added: 'Darius was always big but Jeff is huge considering he's still a baby. I'm expecting him to grow much bigger than his dad. Competition: Darius the rabbit measures 4ft 4in long while 3ft 8in Jeff still has six months of growing to do . Big breed: Continental Giants are the largest breed of rabbit and usually grow  to around 4ft at their biggest . 'As soon as I think he's made it, he'll be measured by his vet and then Guinness will certify that he is the biggest rabbit in the world. 'Even though they're so big, they are very low upkeep. They really do look after themselves most of the time. 'They run free in the garden during the day and at night go to sleep in their cosy crates. They never make a mess and actually would be great house rabbits. 'Although when they start to moult at the end of the summer, they need a good daily brush. 'And being the world's biggest rabbit, and his son, they've got a giant appetite to match. 'But it's actually good for them to be eating hay all day long - to keep their teeth and digestive system healthy.'","Darius is world's largest rabbit at 4ft 4in, weighing three and a half stone .

"That's not a light lunch, it's just bad lighting, say administrators at a Virginia School standing up for their FLOTUS approved school meals. A concerned mother took a photo of her child's lunch consisting of a dull looking fish fillet, a whole wheat bun, and corn and then posted it to social media this week. Virginia’s Portsmouth Public Schools say that their lunches are in compliance with Michelle Obama's federal lunch rules. Scroll down for video . Look appetizing?: A corned mother took a photo of her child's lunch, a dull looking fish fillet, a whole wheat bun, and corn and then posted it to social media this week . Reasoning: Virginia’s Portsmouth Public Schools say that their lunches are in compliance with Michelle Obama's federal lunch rules . After the photo began circulating the web, Food Service Coordinator Jim Gehlhoff said the lunch was 'concerning' but that it may not actually be as bad as it looks, reports EAG News. 'Poor lighting and food presentation make this lunch unappealing,' he said in a statement released to the media. 'The meal in this photo and other meals served by Portsmouth Public Schools meet nutritional and USDA requirements,' said Gelhoff. According to the school district's lunch menu from their website, Tuesday’s lunch options included spicy Cajun fish with brown rice, a cold cut turkey sandwich, a chef's salad, fresh orange or canned fruit, and 1 per cent skim milk. Wavy took a poll asking people if the though the lunch seemed acceptable and 92.3 per cent of people who voted didn't believe that the lunch looked palatable. 'No child should go to school hungry – it’s that simple,' committee chair Rep. John Kline said at a House Education and Workforce Committee this week. 'Today’s discussion is not about whether we agree on this basic principle; I am confident we all do. Instead, our discussion today is about beginning a larger effort we will continue in the coming months to ensure the best policies are in place to help reach this goal,' he continued. Another paltry lunch: This lunch posted in October shows another American student's dissatisfaction with the school meal . Squeamish: This school lunch allegedly shows a maggot found in a child's green beans . The School Nutrition association doesn’t think Michelle Obama's lunch regulations are to blame but they think a funding increase is needed for the National School Lunch Program. ‘That will help school food authorities afford the foods that we must serve, but unfortunately that won’t make students consume it,’ SNA President Julia Bauscher said during testimony. ‘And that’s what we’re also focused on…finding ways to ensure students will eat the healthy foods that we’re making available to them and not throw it in the trash.’ Two months ago Michelle Obama again came under fire for the 'shortcomings' of her Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act scheme. Students and parents  posted photos of Michelle Obama's 'measly' school lunches in February and in October of last year. The images, which were all posted on Twitter with the hashtag #ThanksMichelleObama, range from a slice of moldy salami in a wrap and a green hotdog to a small portion of salad with a side of cheese, to a maggot found in a child's green beans.

"Police are investigating links between the Hatton Garden gems heist and a strikingly similar raid on a Berlin bank two years ago. German detectives have been ‘closely monitoring developments’ in the £60 million London case and are expected to make contact with Scotland Yard this week. In particular, they are keen to find out whether any DNA was recovered from the scene of the Easter weekend raid and, crucially, whether it matches forensic samples found in a tunnel used in a £8.3 million robbery at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013. The culprits behind the Hatton Garden raid (pictured) may have carried out a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in Berlin, it has emerged . In a case which has strikingly similar traits to the £60m heist in London, thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break-in at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013 . There has been speculation that the London robbers – who stole jewels and cash from 72 boxes at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit centre – are from Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, it is believed the Volksbank raiders, who have never been caught, are Polish. One of the five-man gang left a book at the crime scene – a Polish translation of American Desperado, the autobiography of drug smuggler Jon Roberts. And wooden boards used for their 100ft tunnel were bought in Poland. Thomas Neuendorf, of Berlin Police, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We are very interested in the case in England and I’m sure our investigators will get in touch… If DNA matching our samples is put into the Interpol database by Scotland Yard we will be immediately notified.’ Suspects caught on CCTV during the London heist were also dressed as construction workers - a tactic used in the Berlin raid . In a similar fashion to the German heist, the burglars timed their raid over the Easter bank holiday, entering after the premises emptied on Thursday night and leaving on Easter Sunday . In the German case, the gang spent almost a year building their tunnel before drilling through the bank’s 3ft-thick concrete walls. In London, the robbers used heavy-duty drills to bore holes into a reinforced 7ft-thick wall. In both cases, police are investigating the possibility of an insider helping the thieves. Scotland Yard declined to comment last night. Value of items taken, including jewels, said to be between £60m and £200m. Raid took place over three-day Easter weekend when workers had left building. 71 safety deposit boxes raided. Burglars used heavy duty drill to bore holes into a reinforced, two-metre-thick wall so they could gain access to boxes. Thieves dressed as workmen and gasmen. Police criticised after alarm ignored on Good Friday. Value of items taken, including diamonds, gold and silver, said to be £8.3m. Raid took place after thieves accessed the building while it was closed for the weekend. 294 security vaults broken into. Burglars also used drill to break through 3ft of concrete walls to break into the bank's strong room. The thieves disguised themselves as workmen. Security guards criticised after alarm went off two days before tunnel found.","Police investigating links between Hatton Garden heist and Berlin bank raid .

"Amit Yadav, 20, was high on cannabis when he crashed into an oncoming Renault Cleo . A young driver who was high on cannabis when he crashed into an oncoming car, killing his two friends, been jailed for six years. Amit Yadav, 20, was driving his red Honda Civic up to 25 miles over the speed limit when he lost control and smashed into an oncoming Renault Cleo in August 2013. His two passengers - brothers Haider, 20, and Taimur Kayani, 17, from Leytonstone, were killed in the collision on Lodge Avenue, Dagenham. Taimur, who had been sitting in the front passenger seat, was pronounced dead at the scene. His brother died later in hospital. The couple in the Cleo, Rayape and Rosette Sellathurai, also suffered serious injuries. Mrs Sellathurai required surgery to remove part of her damaged intestine, while she suffered further injuries to her bladder and abdomen. None of the passengers in the Civic were wearing seatbelts at the time of the collision, according to crash scene investigators. At the time of the incident, Yadav gave a statement saying he had swerved to avoid an oncoming car, but claimed at his trial that he had no memory of the crash. THC acid in his blood indicated Yadav had been smoking cannabis only a few hours before the crash, and cannabis was found in his glove compartment. Forensic scientist Elizabeth Davidson said: ‘Cannabis is generally less impairing than alcohol and other drugs, but studies have shown that it can impair cognition and impair driving performance.’ She added: ‘The impairment due to cannabis my out last the experience of the high of taking cannabis and may last four or five hours after.’ Brothers Haider (left) and Taimur Kayani (right) from Leytonstone, east London, were killed in the collision . Yadav denied two charges of causing death by dangerous driving and one count of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, but was convicted in February this year after a four-day trial. Tom Nicholson, prosecuting, told Snaresbrook Crown Court that between the date of the accident and the date of conviction Yadav had racked up two further convictions for speeding. At the time of the accident, Yadav was subject to a nine-month suspended sentence for conspiracy to commit theft for stealing from customers at cash points in Manchester. David Josse, defending, said: ‘It is perhaps obvious that this defendant in no way intended and far less desired the outcome of this tragic incident. ‘My client was only 18 at the time of the offence, he is now 20 years old, he suffered serious injuries himself – he suffers from serious pelvic problems as well as scaring – he spent 10 days in hospital, he’s clearly remorseful and that is born out in his resulting psychological condition.’ The court heard Yadav has been undergoing therapy to help him deal with the accident. Mr Josse added: ‘He said he wanted to gain some understanding of how he could lose control of the vehicle – he recognises that most people wouldn’t accept that as a very good explanation, so at least he has some insight into his own answer so to speak.’ Taimur and Haider Kayani (pictured as children), who died in the crash, were described as 'inseparable' Sentencing, Judge Simon Wilkinson told Yadav: ‘You were driving a car that was involved in a head-on collision on a residential street, the reason for this collision was that you were driving far too fast. ‘You lost control, you careered into the opposite lane, the driver in the oncoming vehicle had no opportunity to take any evasive action and was completely blameless for the collision that followed. ‘The driver’s wife suffered life threatening injuries and both of your two passengers lost their lives, and the parents of those two brothers will realise that no sentence that I can pass can possibly reflect the worth of their two sons or lessen their heart ache.’ Following the accident, the Kayani brothers, were described as ‘inseparable’ and dedicated to their family by their father Qamar. Around 1,500 people attended the funeral, coming from as far away as South Africa and Pakistan. Their father wept throughout Judge Wilkinson’s sentencing remarks and was comforted by police officers. Yadav, of Woodford Avenue, Ilford, was expressionless as his sentence was read out.","Amit Yadav was driving his red Honda Civic up to 25 miles over speed limit .

"Proud parents bragging about their little darling's every move on Facebook is a regular annoyance for many people using the social network. But one Australian woman got so sick of her friend's constant updates about her baby daughter that she wrote her a scathing letter demanding the mother stop - claiming she is 'p*****g a lot of people off'. Jade Ruthven, 33, was so upset by the 'poison pen' note that she got her own back by forwarding it onto comedian Em Rusciano - who shared it with her thousands of followers on social media. Scroll down for video . Too many posts: The letter claims Jade Ruthven, 33, pictured with Addison, has been sharing endless pictures and statuses about her baby daughter on Facebook . The 'poison pen' letter was sent to an 'baby spamming' mother after the author got fed up with the amount of pictures and statuses she was writing on Facebook about her child - and it has now been shared worldwide . The incredible printed letter, littered with expletives and exclamation marks, starts with the anonymous author saying they had got together with 'a few of the girls' to say they are 'SO OVER' the running commentary of Ms Ruthven's life with her young baby daughter Addison. It adds: 'Look we all have kids that we are besotted with - guess what - every parent thinks their child is the best. But we don't ram it down everyone else's neck!!! 'She wears a new outfit - well take a photo and send it PRIVATELY to the person who gave it to her - not to everyone!!! 'She crawls off the mat - we DON'T care!!!!! She's 6 months old - BIG DEAL!!! 'Stop and think - if every mother posted all that c**p about their kid - I'm sure you'd get over it pretty quickly, . 'We can't wait for you to get back to work - maybe you won't have time to be on Facebook quite so much.' The letter claims to show what 'people really think' about mother Jade's constant Facebook updates, adding: 'We can't wait for you to get back to work -maybe you won't have time to be on Facebook quite so much'. Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has ‘backfired’, as she is ‘feeling more loved and supported than ever’ The dental hygienist still doesn’t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can’t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty . After saying they think the offending child is 'gorgeous' and they 'love her', the writer continues - adding that Ms Ruthven is 'p*****g a lot of people off'. 'We all thought it might ease off after the first month, but it hasn't', it adds. Not everyone is as interested as you are about what [deleted] does so give us all a break. 'We're doing this to let you know what people really think.' For Ms Ruthven the letter came completely out of the blue and was like a slap in the face, particularly as she is a first-time mother trying to find her feet. ‘I was actually excited when I checked the mail and saw a hand written envelope thinking it was an invite. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect what was in it!’ Jade told Daily Mail Australia. ‘At first I was in shock and thought this letter must be a joke. I read it and re-read it about four times. ‘I was shaking with anger and shock to think a so call friend of mine could be so heartless and gutless to not even sign their name.’ The dental hygienist still doesn’t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can’t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty. ‘To be honest I have no idea why anyone would do this to me. I don’t think I have had an enemy in my whole life,’ Jade told Daily Mail Australia. Jade and her husband Ryan (pictured with their daughter Addison) were both very angry but chose to try and see the funny side of the ridiculous letter . ‘My husband Ryan was just as angry as me but we soon decided to laugh it off as a bad joke. ‘These people clearly have too much time on their hands to sit and chat about my Facebook usage. It’s quite sad really.’ The cruel nature of the letter spurred Jade to stand up for herself. She refused to bow down to the bullies, particularly when she released how damaging this kind of behaviour can be. ‘To have someone do this to me, in truth, makes me feel sick,’ said Jade. ‘Lucky for me I am a strong, healthy person. Being a first time mum is hard enough to get your head around but for someone who was feeling alone or who was struggling with the challenges of motherhood this could have had terrible consequences. ‘But it takes a lot more to keep me down than a nasty letter!’ However, Jade wants the coward author to know their nasty act has not brought her down. She has also vowed to continue to post photos of her treasured baby. ‘No way did I feel self-conscious or consider changing my online activity,’ laughs Jade. ‘That’s how I think this person/people can’t be that close to me. ‘If they were they would know I would never take this lying down, start crying in the corner and then take myself off Facebook.' Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has ‘backfired’, as she is ‘feeling more loved and supported than ever’. ‘The support I have received from family, friends and even total strangers has blown me away.’ Rather, it is an opportunity for her to set an example for her daughter and support other new mothers . Jade was accused of 'p***ing' everybody off by posting too many photos of her baby daughter on Facebook . Comedian Em Rusciano wrote an 870-word opinion piece about the letter for Australian website news.com.au, after Jade sent it to her through Facebook. Questioning why the offended women didn't just speak to Jade or 'unfollow' her on Facebook, Ms Rusciano said: 'It’s not like she busted into their houses armed with life-size portraits of her child dressed as a tiny adorable pumpkin and demand that they be hung on every wall. 'Obviously in some people’s opinion she’s been overdoing it on the proud mother moments. 'Annoying, yes. Worthy of an anonymous poison pen situation, no.' Ms Rusciano added the 'mean' letter represents the 'Holy Trinity' of anxiety. 'It attacked her mothering, her self-perspective and probably left her feeling as though all her friends had turned on her' she wrote. 'It honestly doesn’t feel as though “the girls” just wanted Jade to change a particular behaviour, . 'it feels as though they wanted her to feel c**p about herself. 'If this were me I would have felt ambushed, alone and obsessed with finding out who “the girls” actually were so I may understand their motivation better.'","Jade Ruthven, 33, from Perth, received angry anonymous letter .

"A Chinese court has jailed a 71-year-old journalist for seven years for leaking a government document warning against the 'dangers' of a free press. Gao Yu - named one of the International Press Institute's 50 'world press heroes' in 2000 - 'illegally provided state secrets to foreigners', Beijing's No. 3 Intermediate People's Court said on a verified social media account today. The ruling stated Gao had leaked a 2013 directive by the ruling Communist party named 'Document number 9' to a Hong Kong media outlet. Gao Yu, 71, has been jailed for seven years for 'illegally providing state secrets to foreigners' in the shape of a government document warning against the 'dangers' of press freedom to a Hong Kong media outlet . Chinese police push away journalists waiting outside Beijing's No. 3 Intermediate People's Court for today's verdict in Gao Yu's case . China's current President Xi Jinping has overseen a harsh crackdown against critics of the ruling Communist Party, with scores of journalists, lawyers and academics detained and dozens jailed . The document warns of the 'dangers' of multiparty democracy, independent media, 'universal' definitions of human rights and criticism of the party's historical record, according to copies widely circulated online. 'We are very disappointed with this verdict,' said Shang Baojun, one of her lawyers, who argued in court that a 'confession' from Gao had been extracted after threats were made against her son. Gao is 'the victim of vaguely worded and arbitrary state-secret laws that are used against activists as part of the authorities' attack on freedom of expression,' said William Nee, a researcher for Britain-based Amnesty International. Known for her outspoken support for democracy and press freedom, Gao went missing last April and resurfaced on China's state broadcaster a month later admitting she had made a 'mistake'. Shang said the main evidence presented at Gao's trial in November was a 'confession' she made after police threatened the journalist's son, who they had also detained. He added that after the verdict was read out Gao stated in a 'strong voice' that she would appeal, but was not allowed to make any further statement. The court denied the defence access to documents used to convict her, the lawyer said. The septuagenarian suffers from high blood pressure and Shang added he was 'very worried' about her health. Chinese courts are tightly controlled by the ruling party and more than 99 percent of defendants are convicted, with appeals rarely successful. Police and security staff pushed foreign journalists hoping to cover the verdict more than 100 metres away from the courthouse, and bundled a Chinese individual into a police vehicle. Police take down the details of journalists outside the court where Gu's trial was held. Reporters were pushed more than 100 metres away from the courthouse . The Beijing No. 3 Intermediate People's Court. One of Gao Yu's lawyers, Shang Baojun, claimed her client's TV 'confession' was made after police threatened her son, who they had also detained . China's current President Xi Jinping has overseen a harsh crackdown against critics of the ruling Communist Party, with scores of journalists, lawyers and academics detained and dozens jailed. The country's definition of 'state secrets' is notoriously broad, taking in the number of people executed each year, information about pollution and databases listing commercial companies. A consistent advocate for democracy and free speech, Gao was imprisoned following the government crackdown on student protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Her political writings saw her jailed for six years in the 1990s, also on a charge of 'leaking state secrets'. She was detained again in the lead-up to the Tiananmen crackdown's 25th anniversary last year, as were dozens of other government critics, and her one-day trial was conducted in secret. Prosecutors said that a researcher affiliated with China's agriculture ministry gave Gao a copy of 'Document number 9' in 2013, according to a copy of the verdict posted online by friends of Gao and confirmed to AFP by Shang. The prosecution said she had used the online telecommunications tool Skype to transfer the document to Ho Pin, head of Hong Kong-based publishing house Mirror Books, one of many outlets which has released the text in the last two years. A truck is buried in by protesters as it makes its way through the crowds in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, at a pro-democracy rally in May 1989. Gao was imprisoned after the government crackdown which followed . Gao Yu is one of a number of prominent Chinese dissidents who have been detained, exiled or kept under house arrest in recent years . Mirror Books denied receiving the document from Gao in a statement posted online Friday. 'This so-called 'secret document' is not concerned with military secrets, or even economic secrets. It is a mere guide to ideology,' it added. The US said last year it was 'deeply concerned' by the criminal proceedings against Gao. Her arrest 'was part of an effort to intimidate and silence journalists and activists' ahead of the Tiananmen anniversary, the US chapter of free speech group PEN International said in a statement. The verdict was 'another blow to free expression and press freedom in China', it added. Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the case had been handled 'in accordance with the law'. 'This is a matter of China's internal sovereignty,' he told reporters. Ahead of the ruling, France-based Reporters Without Borders said it would be a gauge of 'how far the Chinese authorities are ready to go in order to suppress those who speak with an independent voice'. The group ranked China 176th out of 180 countries in its 2015 Press Freedom Index.","Gao Yu, 71, gave 'state secrets to foreigners', according to Beijing court .

"The Catholic Church has been accused of blocking the appointment of the first ever homosexual ambassador to Vatican City. Laurent Stefanini, 55, was in January asked by French President Francois Hollande to represent their country at the Holy See. But the controversial appointment was met 'with a stony silence', according to the French media. The appointment was met 'with a stony silence' by the Vatican (pictured), according to French media . Le Monde newspaper reported that Mr Stefanini was a practising Catholic but his proposed move from head of protocol at the Elysee had 'not received the agreement of the Vatican's administration'. It added: 'The homosexuality of the appointee would have triggered a barrage against him.' This is despite the fact that Mr Stefanini worked as number two to the French ambassador at the Vatican, the smallest country in Europe, between 2001 and 2005. Le Monde writes ironically that Mr Stefanini counted without the 'charitable souls in Paris and Rome who wanted to turn his sexual orientation into a disability' and 'mobilised to derail his nomination'. Laurent Stefanini, 55, was in January asked by French President Francois Hollande (pictured) to represent their country at the Holy See . In July 2013, Pope Francis seemed to speak out against centuries of anti-gay teaching by the Catholic Church, saying homosexuals should not be marginalised. Speaking on a flight back from Brazil to Italy, he reaffirmed the official position that homosexual acts were sinful, but homosexual orientation was not. 'If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?' said the Pope. The Vatican has not yet commented on the Mr Stefanini's case, but sources close to President Hollande confirmed that other candidates were now being looked at for the prestigious job. Vatican City, home of the Holy See and headquarters of the global Catholic Church, covers 110 acres and has a population of 842. France's Council of Ministers approved Mr Stefanini's appointment on January 5th, but the position remains vacant. The Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Andre Vingt-Trois sent a letter to Pope Francis to support the French Government's choice of ambassador. However, some members of the Roman Curia believed Mr Stefanini's appointment was a provocation by the French Government.

"She might be celebrating her 75th birthday, but an overjoyed Queen Margrethe of Denmark looked far younger as she waved to excited crowds from the balcony at the Amalienborg Palace. The Danish monarch was joined on the balcony by her sons, Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and Prince Joachim, 45, who were with her again for a procession down Copenhagen shopping street Strøget to the Københavns Rådhus [city hall] for a slap-up lunch. And the two were by Margrethe's side once again in the evening when the Danish royals welcomed royals from all corners of Europe to Fredensborg Castle for a gala banquet followed by a magnificent fireworks display. Early arrivals: Crown Princess Mary and Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark were among the first guests to arrive for the gala dinner . Cut-out: Crown Princess Mary's bell-sleeved dress featured a rather risque cutaway bar, showing off her  ponytail . Smart: Denmark's Princess Marie and Prince Joachim were next to arrive with Prince Joachim wearing a striking red velvet tuxedo . Smart: Denmark's Princess Marie chose a floor-length ivory dress covered in delicate beads . Joining them was Frederik's Australian-born wife Mary, 43, who opted for a striking silver gown featuring a neat high neckline and dramatic blouson sleeves. Margrethe's other daughter-in-law, the French-born Princess Marie, 39, was also at Fredensborg and looked wonderful in a floor-length cream beaded gown. Other members of the Danish Royal Family to attend the event included Margrethe's sister Princess Benedikte, 70, who chose a summery floral dress with a square neck and sheer train. As with Wednesday night's lavish dinner at Christiansborg Palace, Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt  was on the guest list and cut a dramatic figure in a heavily sequinned black and nude dress. But while socialist politician Ms Thorning-Schmidt, who is married to former Labour MP Neil Kinnock's son Stephen, caught the eye, it was the many royals in attendance who took centre stage.

Stunning: The 262-year-old castle, which was built by Frederik IV, was lit up by the flashes from the exploding fireworks . From Sweden came the country's King Carl XVI Gustaf and his glamorous Brazilian-born wife Silvia, who arrived with Crown Princess Victoria, 37, who looked ravishing in a spectacular sequinned dress. The Norwegian Royal Family was represented by dashing Crown Prince Haakon, 41, who had arrived in the Danish capital earlier that day to mark Queen Margrethe's birthday alongside his wife, the ice blonde Crown Princess Mette-Marit. Margrethe's birthday celebrations had kicked off with a touching family wake-up call, which saw Margrethe's two sons and their families join crowned heads from the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg to sing traditional Danish folk songs beneath her window. Next on her agenda was an appearance on the balcony of the Amalienborg Palace alongside her son and heir, Crown Prince Frederik, 46, his wife Crown Princess Mary, 43, and their four children. Waiting below was an enormous flag-waving crowd who went into raptures as the royals appeared, watched by members of other European royal dynasties, among them Sweden's and Norway's. Also on the balcony was Margrethe's second son, Joachim, 45, his French wife Princess Marie, his children from his first marriage, Nikolai, 15, and Felix, 12, and his youngest two, Henrik, five, Athena, three. One royal who couldn't be present on the balcony or for the gala dinner at Fredensborg that followed was Margrethe's 80-year-old husband Prince Henrik who, according to palace officials, is suffering from flu. The French-born royal also missed the carriage procession down Copenhagen shopping street Strøget to the Rådhus and was replaced for the day by his son Frederik. Royal wave: Queen Margrethe is flanked by her sons Frederik and Joachim as she waves to the crowds . Celebrating: Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik, his wife Mary and their nine-year-old son Prince Christian on the balcony .

Despite being without Prince Henrik, the appearance proved a cheerful affair - largely thanks to the antics of four-year-old Prince Vincent, who did his best to scale the railings of the balcony. Held back by his father, the youngster smiled mischievously and was quickly copied by his twin sister Josephine - much to their mother Princess Mary's amusement. Australian-born Mary, who was elegant in a navy ensemble topped with a grey cocktail hat, certainly appeared to be enjoying the moment, smiling broadly as she stood with her four children. Frederik, meanwhile, was content to wave to the crowd and at one point leaned down to whisper in the ear of his older son, nine-year-old Prince Christian. Girls together: Prince Joachim holds his three-year-old daughter Athena, while Crown Princess Mary clutches four-year-old Josephine .

Last night's banquet was the finale in a two-day orgy of celebration that began on Wednesday night with a dinner at Christiansborg Palace that brought together royals from the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg as well as those from Sweden and Norway. Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia, the youngest reigning royals in Europe, led the way in, followed by the equally glamorous King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands. Norway's King Harald, who joined the Danish royals on the balcony, was accompanied by his wife Queen Sonia, and his son Crown Prince Haakon and daughter-in-law Mette Marit. Sweden's 65-year-old King Carl XIV Gustaf also brought his heir, in his case Crown Princess Victoria, 38, and her former personal trainer husband, Prince Daniel. Other royals to attend included the elegant Queen Mathilde of the Belgians who shimmered in a stunning purple gown at Wednesday night's event and smiled broadly as she made her way inside on the arm of husband King Philippe.

"Once famed for his mop of blacker than black hair, disgraced Democrat Rod Blagojevich, 58, has really let his haircare regime go while he serves his prison time. The former Illinois governor has return to his roots while inside and has been photographed with his still full head of hair a shocking white color rather than the boot polish black that was his trademark as a politician. Blagojevich was infamously caught trying to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat when he was elected president in 2008. Fade to gray: Once famed for his mop of blacker than black hair, disgraced Democrat Rod Blagojevich, 58, has really let his haircare regime go while he serves his prison time . Back in his days as governor of Illinois, Blagojevich was famed for his boot polish black hair . He was impeached and removed from office by the state Legislature in early 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges. Blagojevich is currently serving a 14-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood near Denver. The photos, the first of Blagojevich in prison, were first published by the National Enquirer. The photos show the former governor sitting at a desk, reading a book and wearing glasses and sitting outside in shorts and a wife beater shirt. While he continues to awaiting word on a last-ditch appeal, Blagojevich has daily contact with his family and teaches the history of war battles to other inmates, his attorney said. Last July lawyers attempted to argue that a high court ruling in McCutcheon v. the Federal Election Commission in April 2014 bolstered their view that Blagojevich was engaged in legal, run-of-the-mill political horse trading, not corruption. The McCutcheon ruling, they argued, found that soliciting contributions crosses the line into corruption only when a politician makes a clear, explicit promise to take official action in return for a donation. Blagojevich is currently serving a 14-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Englewood near Denver after he was caught trying to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat when he was elected president . In that context, defense attorneys said the trial judge was wrong to set a lower standard for jurors by telling them, to convict, they only needed to find that Blagojevich sought donations 'knowing or believing' it would be given for some official act. But government attorneys responded saying that Blagojevich's legal team hadn't correctly characterized the Supreme Court's findings in McCutcheon. 'The decision provides no support for Blagojevich's argument on appeal,' the two-page filing said. 'Nothing in the (McCutcheon) decision suggests that an exchange of contributions for specific official acts is quid pro quo corruption only if the arrangement is stated 'explicitly' or 'expressly.'' The Chicago-based appellate court has been considering Blagojevich's appeal for more than a year months. It's unclear when it might issue a decision.","The former Illinois governor has been photographed in prison for the first time since starting his 14 year sentence in 2012 .

"A politics teacher at a £31,000-a-year boarding school attended by Sir Winston Churchill has been banned from classrooms after he was caught on video exposing himself to a woman on a train. Nuku Vanonyi Cudjoe-Calvocoressi, 41, who was head of politics at St George's School in Ascot, was travelling on a Richmond to Reading train when he pulled up his shorts and exposed himself to a 33-year-old female passenger. He has now been banned from teaching for at least five years following a hearing by a National Council of Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) disciplinary panel in Coventry. Scroll down for video . Nuku Vanonyi Cudjoe-Calvocoressi, who was head of politics at St George's School in Ascot, was on a train when he pulled up his shorts and exposed himself to a female passenger (pictured) On June 30 2014 Cudjoe-Calvocoressi was convicted of indecent exposure at Berkshire Magistrates' Court following the June 13 incident on-board a train. The court heard at the time that he pulled up his shorts and exposed himself to her. The woman began secretly filming him on her mobile phone and asked her husband to meet her at Wokingham train station, where he confronted Cudjoe-Calvocoressi. Cudjoe-Calvocoressi left the station but was soon found and arrested by police and was charged with indecent exposure. When interviewed by police he initially denied that he had deliberately exposed himself, but when  he appeared at Berkshire Magistrates' Court he pleaded guilty to the offence. At the school's internal investigating meeting Cudjoe-Calvocoressi admitted that he had exposed himself - but said that he did not realise he was causing distress. Following the court case he was sentenced to a supervision requirement, a community order which runs until July 27 2017 and was ordered to pays costs of £85, compensation of £700 and a £60 victim surcharge. He was also told to sign the sex offenders register for five years. The woman filmed Cudjoe-Calvocoressi when he exposed himself on the train, leading to his conviction . The exclusive St George's School in Ascot (pictured) which was originally a boys' school, has an impressive alumni including Sir Winston Churchill, Princess Beatrice and even Made in Chelsea star Kimberley Garner . Now, at the NCTL disciplinary panel in Coventry Cudjoe-Calvocoressi admitted the alleged facts and admitted that the conviction was for a relevant offence. Imposing the ban on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, NCTL official Paul Heathcote said: 'There is no allegation that his actions were sexually motivated and his actions did not involve children, nor did he use his professional position. 'While his actions had the potential to cause harm, there is no evidence that they did so. 'In all the circumstances I agree with the panel's recommendation that Mr Cudjoe-Calvocoressi be allowed to apply for the order to be set aside on or after 29 July 2019.' The ban means that he is prohibited from teaching and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. He has the right to appeal to the High Court against the decision. However, the door has been left open for him to return to teaching. In a decision imposed on behalf of the Education Secretary it was held that Cudjoe-Calvocoressi should be allowed to apply to return to teaching in 2019 when the five-year order that he signs the Sex Offenders Register comes to an end. The exclusive St George's School, which was originally a boys' school, has an impressive alumni including Sir Winston Churchill, Princess Beatrice and even Made in Chelsea star Kimberley Garner.

"A Florida childrens hospital has installed a 'catcam' to let patients play remotely with abandoned animals. Patients at Wolfson Children's Hospital are able to remotely play with animals at the Jacksonville Humane Society shelter. The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys to let the children control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV as the animals react and play with them. Scroll down for video . The toys include a long 'tail' that swings from side to side when the user presses a button. The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys. Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV in their room as the animals react and play with them. The Idaho firm behind the system has already installed its system in 10 animals shelters across the US, letting anyone play with cats via the system - and plans to sell a version for pet owners via Kickstarter next month. 'Play through programs like the Play with Cats project has a powerful normalizing effect on a child's hospital stay,' said Wolfson Children's Hospital President Michael Aubin. Patients who are in isolation with a specific treatment or a chronic medical condition like cystic fibrosis or bone marrow transplant will be among the first to benefit. Made possible with a $15,000 grant from the Mattel Children's Foundation, the Play with Cats program connects to 151 hospital rooms throughout Wolfson Children's Hospital via GetWellNetwork. The Wolfson Children's Hospital Auxiliary first started a Pet Therapy Program in 1995. Two years ago, the hospital opened a pet visitation program, allowing children with long-term stays or in end-of-life situations to receive a visit from their own dog. 'This is the latest program to be implemented at Wolfson Children's Hospital to give more of our patients a chance to interact with a kitten or cat, which provides a welcome distraction.' said Pat Kirkland, Family Support Services Manager at Wolfson Children's Hospital. 'About 20 percent of our patients are on isolation at some time during their stay, so we are excited to bring the healing power of an animal friend to the bedside.' 'Our partnership with Wolfson Children's Hospital began with JHS veterinarians providing required vet checks and vaccines that allow patients in the hospital to visit with their own dogs. 'We are proud to expand the partnership using iPet so that all patients may benefit from the healing power of animals,' said Denise Deisler, executive director of the Jacksonville Humane Society. The system was developed by Idaho firm ReachIn. 'The idea came from the ability to move anything over the web,' Scott Harris of the firm told MailOnline. Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button, and then watch on the TV in their room as the animals react and play with them. 'We started working on the technical side of remote control, and then an engineer went home to work on arm overnight. The next day he came in, took me to one side and said he'd been moving the arm, and his cat had started playing with it. He admitted he then hadn't got any work done and spent the evening watching the cat play - so I thought we might be on to something.' The firm contacted a local animals shelter and worked with them to build three toys. In May 2012, the first catcam went online, and was a huge success. Users join a virtual queue, and can then control three toys and a webcam in the enclosure. The iCompanion site that visitors play with cats in rescue homes around the US virtually . Now the firm plans to expand the idea after huge interest from shelters. Users from 90 countries played within 2 weeks playing, and adoption rates went up 57% at shelters, said Harris. The firm is now trying to work out how to fund the systems after over 300 charities got in touch wanting it. The firm is launching a kickstarter campaign to allow people to buy their own version of the system on May 1st. Users can control a variety of toys in the enclosures . 'it costs us to build these things and maintain them, and 317 shelters have requested it, so we are working with as many as we can.' The firm hopes to develop a low cost version costing around $200 for shelters, but admits the R&D costs are currently too high.

"The US body that regulates Internet addresses is looking to crack down on a Canadian company using the new '.sucks' domain name to extract exorbitant sums from celebrities such as Kevin Spacey and companies looking to protect their reputations. So far, purchased names include Youtube.sucks, Bing.sucks, Visa.sucks, Bankofamerica.sucks, Yahoo.sucks, Telusmobility.sucks and other major brand names. Kevin Spacey has reportedly paid have his his '.sucks' domain taken down. Kevin Spacey is reportedly among celebrities paying out to have their name removed from one of the  '.sucks' domains which opened on 30 March . Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains attacking her, CNBC reported. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or 'ICANN,'  sent a letter on Thursday to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canada's Office of Consumer Affairs to see if the actions of company Vox Populi Registry Ltd. were illegal. ICANN initially approved of the so-called top-level domain name, among nearly 600 it has added recently to expand beyond common names such as '.com,' '.org' and '.us.' But it is backtracking after an advisory panel made up of industry groups and companies like Microsoft, Verizon and eBay complained last month. Vox Populi began accepting registrations using '.sucks' on March 30 from trademark holders and celebrities before it is released to public applicants. Taylor Swift has also had to spend defensively in the past to remove her name from '.porn' and '.adult' domains . It has recommended charging $2,499 a year for the privilege, and according to Vox Populi CEO John Berard, most of the names have been sold by resellers for around $2,000 a year. Berard has said the domain name is meant to create destinations for companies to interact with their critics and called his company's business 'well within the lines of ICANN rules and the law.' Two weeks ago, the advisory body called the Intellectual Property Constituency representing major companies and industry groups asked ICANN in a letter to halt the rollout of '.sucks,' calling it a 'shakedown scheme' and 'predatory.' Companies like GoDaddy.com register some domain names for just $1 a year, and Vox Populi will offer consumers the right to secure a '.sucks' address for just $10 a year starting in September. The advisory body says that the threat of opening a '.sucks' site to the average consumer later is 'an essential element of Vox Populi's coercive scheme.' ICANN said in its letter that if Canadian or U.S. regulators find Vox Populi's actions are illegal, it could declare the company in breach of its contract and seek to change the registry's behavior. It said it is also seeking other remedies within its agreement with the company.

"Gypsy groups have launched a campaign to remove the definition of them as 'swindlers' from the  Spanish dictionary. Protest letters were delivered to members of Spain's Royal Language Academy, which produces the definitive dictionary. The Gypsy Secretariat Foundation, which are leading the campaign, are hoping to use it to raise awareness of discrimination against gypsies, also known as Roma. Members of Spain's gypsy community throw flower petals into the Manzanares river, symbolizing the departure of their ancestors from India and their exodus across the world during an event in memory of the Roma victims of the Nazi Holocaust in Madrid, Spain . The reference to a swindler ('trapacero') was introduced late last year following complaints about the 22nd edition entry that included a colloquial reference to a 'gypsy' ('gitano') as one 'who deceives or maneuvers to cheat.' 'Gypsies feel indignant,' said Sara Jimenez, 37, a Roma lawyer who works for the foundation's equality department. 'It's not fair because we are a people marked by prejudices, stereotypes and these type of contributions by the Royal Language Academy encourage rejection and stigmatization and do not correspond to gypsies in Spanish society.' The academy said definitions reflect actual use and are not meant to be derogatory but has offered to change the forthcoming online edition to clarify that such references are pejorative. Foundation spokeswoman Pilar Calon said the group did not object to other academy dictionary definitions for gypsy but would like the 'swindler' reference changed. 'That was a swindle in itself!' said Calon who hopes to meet with academy authorities - made up of esteemed authors, intellectuals and language experts-  soon to discuss the issue. The protest was delivered on International Roma Day and beore handing in the letter,  group representatives gathered to throw flower petals into Madrid's Manzanares river in the customary homage to the gypsies killed in the Holocaust and other extermination campaigns. panish groups representing gypsies have launched a campaign to remove a reference to them as swindlers from the world's benchmark Spanish dictionary . Spain has about 750,000 people of Roma heritage, out of a total population of some 47 million. Although a minority, the ethnic group has always formed an important part of Spanish society and culture, most notably due its strong links to Spain's emblematic flamenco music. One of the country's most internationally renowned flamenco dancers is gypsy Joaquin Cortes. Although there have been giant steps made toward greater integration in society, Roma are still often marginalized and discriminated against in housing, education and jobs. The still have little representation in Parliament, business or academia. The community is commonly associated with dealing in scrap metal and selling flowers or cheap clothes at town markets.","Gypsy Secretariat Foundation  complained over the definition of 'gypsy'

"The FBI has cleared the Tulsa County Sheriff’s department in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a volunteer deputy earlier this month. Sheriff Stanley Glanz said in a press conference on Monday that the special FBI agent in charge of the state of Oklahoma, Jim Finch, had informed him of the investigation's results earlier that morning. 'He told me the FBI has completed their investigation and they found no wrongdoing at the sheriff's office,' said Glanz, who also said there were no civil rights violations in the incident. Scroll down for video . Sheriff Stanley Glanz told a press conference on Monday that the FBI had informed him of the result of the investigation into the shooting of Eric Harris by reserve deputy Robert Bates on April 2 . Robert Bates, a 73-year-old reserve deputy, says he mistook his handgun for a taser and accidentally shot Eric Harris while attempting to help other deputies take Harris into custody. He has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the April 2 death and faces four years in prison if convicted. On Monday Glanz said he didn't believe reports that Bates' training records were falsified and he claimed the volunteer 73-year-old insurance executive had been properly trained. But the sheriff stopped short of saying Bates was qualified to use the gun he used when he killed Harris earlier this month. 'Mr. Bates has been to the range several times and is qualified and that is documented,' the sheriff said. When asked if Bates was trained on the specific gun he fired at Harris, Glanz said: 'That is something we're still looking at and it will be part of the administrative review.' Harris' family has questioned whether Bates was adequately trained. The Tulsa World newspaper, citing unnamed sources, has reported some of Bates' supervisors were told to certify him after he failed to meet some qualifications. Bates has disputed those reports. His attorneys released some of his training records over the weekend, including certificates showing what training he received, job evaluation reports and weapons training and qualification records dating to 2008. Robert bates has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the April 2 death of Eric Harris and faces four years in prison if convicted . Glanz also said Monday that action will be taken against two deputies at the scene, including one caught on video cursing at Harris as he lay dying. The sheriff said both have received threats and have been reassigned for their own safety. 'Through our administrative process we will review what those officers did and will take some administrative action,' the sheriff said, but didn't provide specifics. He said nine officers were involved with the sting, and that two officers had pinned down Bates when the shot was fired. The sheriff said on Monday that Bates had been his insurance agent and that they'd known each other for about 25 years. He said they met when Glanz's oldest son was in high school and got into a car accident. Bates served as Glanz's re-election campaign manager in 2012 and has donated cars and equipment to the sheriff's office. Shot dead: Eric Harris, who is pictured with his son Aidan, was killed in the incident on April 2 . Sheriff Glanz said he had no plans to resign and that his office's reserve deputy program meets national standards set by the Commission on Accreditation For Law Enforcement Agencies. A Harris family attorney is scheduled to speak on Monday afternoon to address Bates' training records. Monday's news conference followed the release on Saturday of official records detailing Bates' training and certification. The records included certificates showing what training he received, job evaluation reports and weapons training and qualification records dating to 2008. Bates' attorneys said the 64 pages of information include records Bates, of Tulsa, copied and kept for himself. Although there are time gaps in the documents provided, some of the records seemed to indicate Bates was proficient in firearms and dozens of other training courses. 'For the first time today, we feel like someone's starting to look at the other side of this as far as his qualifications,' Scott Wood, an attorney for Bates, said after the documents were released. Sheriff Glanz said he doesn't believe reports that Bates' training records were falsified and that he has in intention of resigning over the incident . Bates spoke at length about the deadly incident for the first time on the Today show on Friday, where he was flanked by his lawyer and family members. He also took the opportunity to apologize to the family of the man he killed. 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said as he became emotional. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' The interview comes just days after Bates turned himself in to face charges of second-degree manslaughter. He was released after posting a $25,000 bond. On the Today show, he recalled how he had been in his car several blocks away when Harris, 44, ran towards him amid a botched undercover gun-sale operation. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after the man. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the video, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him. I'm sorry.' Apology: Robert Bates became emotional as he apologized to the family of the man he shot dead during a botched sting operation on April 2. The reserve deputy appeared on the Today show on Friday . Mix up: While on the Today show, he showed where he keeps his Taser (left) compared to where he keeps his gun (right). He said that there have previously been cases of officers confusing the position of the two . The fatally-wounded man can be heard daying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' On the Today show, Bates said he was immediately hit by shock when the gun went off. 'Oh my god, what has happened?' he recalled thinking. 'This was not an intentional thing. I had no desire to ever take anyone's life.' He said that the shock remains with him and he is unable to sleep or concentrate. Bates also stood up and demonstrated where he keeps his Taser on his body - slightly below his chest - compared to where he keeps his gun - on his lower right-hand side near his pants pocket. Today show host Matt Lauer asked him how he could make the mistake, when the two pieces of equipment are kept so far away from each other on the body. 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates responded. Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' 'I thought to myself after reading several cases, 'I don't understand how this can happen'. You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' The interview follows reports that Bates, a millionaire insurance broker, had been allowed to 'play cop' after he donated pricey equipment to the department - a claim he called 'unbelievably unfair'. Bates, who is among several well-to-do Tulsa residents who moonlight as reserve deputies, has purchased five vehicles for the police force. The Tulsa County volunteer deputy disputed earlier this week a Tulsa World report that sheriff's office supervisors were ordered to falsify his training records. The World said at least three of Bates' supervisors were transferred for refusing to go along with the requests, and said it consulted multiple sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, but it gave no indication how those sources were familiar with the situation. 'I want to do everything I can to make sure that people know that this allegation of falsified records is not true,' Wood said. Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . His lawyer added that the report was largely based on claims made by a man who was terminated from the department seven years ago, at which point Bates had only been there a few months. Bates is classified by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office as an 'advanced reserve'. This means that he went through 480 hours training of the 'Field Training Officer' or FTO. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he had previously attended a five-day homicide school in Dallas and also received 'active shooter response training' with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona. He also claims to have been involved in 'at least 100 other' assignments. But the sources who spoke to Tulsa World claimed that the reserve deputy was not properly trained to be an armed deputy, despite Sheriff Stanley Glanz saying otherwise. Indeed, Sheriff Glanz and Bates' own legal team have repeatedly produced records which they claim prove he was an 'advanced reserve' and had undergone 480 hours training. However, when asked to produced proof that Bates was certified to use three weapons, including the revolver he fired at Harris, the Sheriff's Office say they have been unable to find the paperwork.","Sheriff Stanley Glanz told a press conference on Monday that the FBI investigation had cleared his department over the April 2 death .
