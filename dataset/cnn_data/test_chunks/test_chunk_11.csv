"Barcelona players were put through their paces as they put the finishing touches to preparations for the Champions League quarter-final clash with French giants PSG. The first-leg of the highly anticipated tie will take place at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. Speaking to the club's official website, defender Adriano warned his team-mates ahead of the game they must be at their absolute best if they are to overcome PSG's star-studded squad, which includes the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Thiago Silva and Lucas Moura. He said, 'We have to be alert throughout the match. If we make any mistakes, even small ones, they have excellent players that can break the game.'

And Adriano was quick to heap praise on his fellow countrymen - 'all of them are excellent players' - but noted Lucas in particular as the main threat for the opposition.

"It's being billed as the Euro-derby in Madrid and depending on who you support the precedent is either last season's Champions League final or the six games that have been played between Real and Atletico since then. In Monday's pre-match press conference almost every question asked to Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti made reference to the fact that in six Madrid derbies this season Real are yet to win a single game – losing four and drawing two as Atletico have beaten them twice in the league and in the Spanish Super Cup and the Copa del Rey. But a remarkably relaxed Ancelotti, showing the kind of form in press room that he will hope his players show on the pitch Tuesday, reminded everyone that his team did not need to win. Two draws could see them go through so what was the problem? He said he didn't see Barcelona's slip on Saturday night against Sevilla because he was at the cinema 'enjoying a film' and when he was asked about Atletico Madrid's threat from set-pieces he responded: 'Don't forget we won the Champions League with a set-piece last season.' Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti says he is not obsessed with Atletico Madrid ahead of Tuesday's clash . Madrid-based papers Marca (left) and AS are looking ahead to the Champions League quarter-final first leg . Sergio Ramos (centre) scored an injury-time equaliser for Real as they beat Atletico 4-1 aet in the Champions League final last season at Benfica's Stadium of Light in Lisbon . However, Atletico are unbeaten in six Madrid derbies this term and dumped Real out of the Copa del Rey . His reference to Sergio Ramos' injury-time goal against Atletico Madrid in Lisbon that levelled Diego Godin's header and allowed Real to run in riot in extra-time will have struck a chord with Real supporters who in the build-up to the game have been busy reminding their rivals that while they may have won none of the last six meetings they did come out on top in the match that mattered more than any other. Real Madrid are at full strength for the game and that seems to have left Ancelotti as upbeat and confident as at any time so far this season. He toyed with his Spanish inquisitors when they questioned him about whether or not Gareth Bale would start the game. The Welshman was rested at the weekend but will be in the XI on Tuesday night. 'If Bale is not 100 percent fit he will not play because we have everyone available' said Ancelotti leaving a pregnant pause. But as the possibility that Spanish favourite Isco might start the game presented itself the Italian coach added: 'But he is 100 percent.' He added: 'Bale was fantastic last season but had been really good this season. He came good in the big finals scoring in the Champions League and Copa del Rey finals so let's see how he performs now in the final months of the season.' Gareth Bale (centre) is set to start for Real after being rested at the weekend against Eibar on Saturday . Like Ramos, Bale was also on target during Real's Champions League final success over Atletico last season . The feeling among Real Madrid's coaching staff is that while Bale has been criticised by the Madrid press for not being the team player that Isco is, his ability to win a big final with a goal or an assist is unmatchable. Anelotti added: 'I am not obsessed with Atletico Madrid,' mentioning 'attitude' several times in his positive discourse and admitting that was the key missing ingredient from Real Madrid's 4-0 defeat to Atletico in February. He said facing Simeone was 'honour and a problem' and picked out Atletico Madrid's resilience when asked what their greatest quality was. 'They fight from the first minute to the last,' he said. Atletico Madrid fans believe that fight will see them overcome Real Madrid for the seventh time this season and the Vicente Calderon will be full for what, with their title hopes now gone, is their game of the season. Real's swagger has been rediscovered though, wth the return of key players Sergio Ramos, James Rodriguez and Luka Modric. Ancelotti recalled the moment Modric' corner was headed in by Ramos in Lisbon. 'It's a wonderful memory,' he said. 'Now we have the challenge of going for Real Madrid's 11th European Cup. Real know they face a stern test against an Atletico side that beat them 4-0 when they last met in February .

"Thiago Silva is gearing up to play Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-final this week and the Paris Saint-Germain defender believes he will face an attack possessing the three best players in the world. The Spanish league leaders can unleash a front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar upon the French champions, who beat them at the Parc des Princes in the group stages of the competition earlier this year.

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic and substitute Edinson Cavani both scored twice Saturday as Paris Saint-Germain won their first trophy of the season by retaining the League Cup with victory over 10-man Bastia. Ibrahimovic, who missed last season's final through injury, opened the scoring from the penalty spot after Sebastien Squillaci was sent off, and doubled the lead just before halftime.

PSG are chasing an unprecedented quadruple, as Laurent Blanc's side also made it to the French Cup final and currently lead Ligue 1. But they will be without Ibrahimovic next week against Barcelona in the first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals and the Sweden striker will miss also miss four matches of the domestic season after receiving another ban for his criticism of a referee. Ibrahimovic has been in tremendous form recently, scoring a hat trick in the 4-1 win over Saint-Etienne in the French Cup semifinals midweek and has bagged 13 goals in his last seven appearances for club and country. Once again, he was the man of the match at the Stade de France. With David Luiz and Thiago Motta both out with injuries, Serge Aurier returned to the PSG defence while Adrien Rabiot was given a starting role in midfield. In a tight start to the game, PSG created the first chance in the fourth minute when Ibrahimovic collected a long pass in the box following a free kick from Ezequiel Lavezzi, but the Swede was flagged offside.

The former AC Milan striker jumps for joy after finding the target from the penalty spot . Former Arsenal defender Sebastien Squillaci was sent off for the foul that led to the penalty . PSG had a penalty claim turn down soon after when Gael Danic touched the ball with his right arm inside the box. But referee Benoit Bastien did point to the spot in the 20th minute when Squillaci brought Lavezzi down, with the former Arsenal player receiving a straight red card for his foul. Second on PSG's all-time top scorers list behind Pedro Pauleta with 104 goals, Ibrahimovic made no mistake from the spot, sending keeper Alphonse Areola the wrong way with a shot in the top left corner. Squillaci's red card forced Bastia coach Ghislain Printant to change his strategy, with Mathieu Peybernes coming in for Danic. The move did not make a big difference as PSG took complete control of the match and overwhelmed Bastia midfield. Ibrahimovic doubled the French champions' lead before half-time to put them firmly in control . The 33-year-old celebrates with team-mate Marquinhos as PSG cruised to victory . Pegged back in their own half, the Corsicans fought back PSG's relentless attacks for 20 minutes but a poor headed clearance from Peybernes fell into Ibrahimovic's path, with the 33-year-old chesting the ball down before unleashing a low shot at the near post to double the lead. PSG continued to apply pressure after the interval and went close in the 48th when Pastore saw his angled shot end just wide at the far post.

Another PSG counterattack brought another goal in added time, with Cavani curling a shot past Areola from Ibrahimovic's assist as PSG claimed its fifth League Cup.

"Rangers boss Stuart McCall insists he is taking life at Ibrox in his stride. The former Motherwell manager admitted being wowed by Murray Park in the days after he replaced Kenny McDowall. The club's £12million training facility is a major improvement on the public pitches at Dalziel Park he was forced to make do with during his Steelmen stint. Stuart McCall insists he's loving life at Rangers despite losing heavily to Queen of the South . But along with the plush surroundings, McCall knows being manager of the Glasgow giants means he also has to cope with the kind of intense scrutiny levels he did not have to deal with at Fir Park. Not everyone is cut out for the strains of the job, as McDowall proved when he quit after posting just three wins from his 10-game spell as caretaker. The former Celtic youth coach found himself in charge just as the battle for power at Ibrox reached its bitterest point and at one stage admitted life at Rangers had 'taken its toll' on him. McCall has taken over a brighter picture following Dave King's boardroom victory and the 50-year-old former Light Blues midfielder seemed to shrug off the extra pressure during his first few weeks in charge as he led his side to three successive wins - including successes against Hearts and Hibs. Lewis Kidd (left) battles for the ball against Rangers' David Templeton in Queen of the South's victory . But the focus will have sharpened since Gers suffered their first defeat under his watch when they lost 3-0 to Queen of the South on Thursday.

"France's biggest handball star Nikola Karabatic will stand trial for fraud over his suspected involvement in an illegal betting case. Karabatic, a multiple world and Olympic gold medalist, and his younger brother Luka were among a group of players banned by the French league two years ago for betting on the result of a match in which their Montpellier club, which had already secured the title, lost to a struggling team. Karabatic's lawyer Michael Corbier told Sportsmail on Wednesday the trial will likely take place within months. French handball star Nikola Karabatic has been accused of match fixing along with 15 others . Former Montpellier ace competes for France in Handball World Cup match against Iceland in January . 'We would have preferred the charges to be thrown out, but we'll aim for a not-guilty verdict,' said Corbier. 'In theory he is facing five years in prison and a fine, but even a suspended sentence of just half an hour in jail would be too much.' Karabatic, who was briefly detained when the case emerged, now plays for Barcelona in the Spanish league. Karabatic leaves the Montpellier's courtroom after attending his appeal in October 2012 . Other former or current Montpellier players including Mladen Bojinovic, Samuel Honrubia, Dragan Gagic, Primoz Prost, Issam Tej and Mickael Robin will also be tried. Karabatic has denied placing bets on the match that Montpellier lost 31-28 to Cesson-Rennes. Betting authority Francaise de Jeux reported an unusually high increase in betting at halftime in the match, raising suspicions and triggering a police investigation.

"Stuart McCall has sent a warning to Bilel Mohsni as he insisted Rangers will need cool heads for the promotion run-in. The Tunisian centre-back extended his questionable disciplinary record by picking up a booking for reacting to opposition fans during Thursday’s 3-0 defeat from Queen of the South. McCall believes Mohsni has good defensive attributes but is adamant the Ibrox side cannot risk unnecessary suspensions as they attempt to land a Premiership place via the play-offs. Stuart McCall calls time on training ahead of Rangers match with Raith on Sunday . The Rangers boss has spoken to Tunisian defender Bilel Mohsni (2nd left) about his discipline . ‘I’ve had to have a word with him over his concentration levels,’ said McCall. ‘He did some absolutely outstanding things in the game and then he did some slack and sloppy things. ‘I didn’t know what he was booked for and Kenny (Black) had said it was a reaction to their fans. He was probably frustrated and angry at the result. ‘But I’ll have another look at it as we can’t afford to have silly bookings at this point in the season. Ian Black got one the other day and there are a couple of other lads a game away from being suspended. ‘If it’s for tackles you can maybe understand it but we can’t afford cheap bookings for running to the crowd, taking your shirt off, back chat with referees, kicking the ball away – I don’t like things like that. It’s a lack of discipline.’ Rangers players look dejected as defeat to Queen of the South dents their bid for promotion . Rangers will attempt to bounce back from the first loss of McCall’s tenure when they host Raith on Sunday. They currently sit behind second-placed Hibs on goal difference but have a game in hand. ‘There will be a lot of big games, big crowds, tension and drama until the last kick of the season,’ added McCall ‘So cool heads is the way to go. But I still like fire in the belly. I don’t want people to surrender meekly and mildly. Nothing wrong with a bit of passion as long as it’s channelled in the right way.’ McCall insisted the Palmerston reverse shouldn’t be viewed as a ‘disaster’ and feels he already has evidence of his side’s ability to recover from disappointments. ‘We just have to draw a line under it. I don’t want doom and gloom. We drew the first two games when I came here. That wasn’t what we wanted, so we bounced back from those. We then went on a decent run and now we’ve had another setback.

"Tim Visser wants to end his Edinburgh career lifting European silverware at the ground he will call home next season. The final of the European Challenge Cup is now tantalisingly within reach for Alan Solomons’ side after their heroic quarter-final triumph over London Irish. Only Newport Gwent Dragons stand in their way in what will be a tough semi-final at BT Murrayfield in a fortnight. Should the Scots prevail, they will head for Twickenham Stoop - home of Harlequins for whom winger Visser signed a two-year deal this month. Tim Visser was a key player in Edinburgh's dramatic win over London Irish at the Madejski Stadium . ‘The Stoop is going to be my future home ground and it would be great to get to know it by playing a final there,’ he said. ‘For that to be one of my final games for Edinburgh and to pick up silverware would make things pretty special, really emotional and a great end to my time at the club. ‘Helping Edinburgh bring the first major trophy back home would be the perfect way to give back something to the club, to repay them for all they have done through the years, all the good friends I have made, all the good memories.’ Scotland cap Visser was one of Edinburgh’s key men in the dramatic win at the Madejski Stadium. He played a crucial role in a mighty rearguard action when he joined the scrum as a flanker following the sin-binning of prop John Andress. VIsser is hopeful he can end his Edinburgh career at the ground he will call home from next season . And it is the strength of character shown in those closing minutes that has convinced him the season will end with silverware and a top-six spot in the Pro12. ‘That was an unbelievable win and you can’t under-estimate its significance,’ he said. ‘I was at the scrum in the end and the way Dicko (Alasdair Dickinson) held up their player when he went over the line in that final minute showed the desire we had to come away with a win. ‘The way we defended in those final moments shows the fight of the boys to get underneath the ball at the end and keep them out. Edinburgh will have to see off Newport Gwent Dragons if they are to reach the final at the Stoop . ‘The Edinburgh of old would have probably let that through and we would have lost. ‘We work hard for each other. That is exactly what you saw at the end of the game. Our aim is to finish in the top six and to lift the European Challenge Cup. Both are definitely on.’","Tim Visser has agreed to join Harlequins next season .

"Palmerston remains a very painful place for Rangers managers. Consider this the first harsh lesson of Stuart McCall’s tenure. Back in the chill of mid-December, Ally McCoist led the Ibrox side here on the day it emerged he had handed in his notice of resignation. A convincing 2-0 defeat did nothing to alleviate the mood of gloomy chaos that had engulfed the club. Nine days later, McCoist was out on gardening leave. Fast forward almost five months, and Rangers arrived here in far more ebullient spirits with a new boardroom regime installed and three successive victories under McCall’s command. That Hibs and Hearts were among the victims added to the sense of a substantial revival. In Dumfries, however, it felt more like a flashback to the bad old days of their campaign. Rangers were simply second-best all over the plastic pitch in Dumfries . Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park . Lewis Kidd celebrates after an own goal doubles Queen of the South's lead at the start of the second half . Gavin Reilly (left) celebrates after forcing an own goal for  QOTS's third to dent Rangers' second place hopes .

Booked: Templeton, Moshni . Ref: Don Robertson . Att: 5,093 . Immense credit must go to Queens, who recorded a thoroughly merited victory that has significantly boosted their play-off hopes. Under James Fowler, they are capable of bright, energetic football that delivered goals from Derek Lyle and Gavin Reilly, as well an own goal from Lee Wallace. McCall, though, must have felt a twinge of despair. He has spent much of his recent time emphasising that nothing had been achieved by the recent uplift. That so much work still had to be done were they to achieve their aim of promotion. A first defeat of his six-game reign confirmed that assessment in the most emphatic fashion. The Ibrox outfit remain third behind Hibs on goal difference, albeit with a game still in hand. Radical improvement is once again required when they host Raith Rovers on Sunday. Queens will face Falkirk at that same time, having just overhauled their key rivals for the fourth and final play-off spot. This was the best possible fillip for Fowler’s men, as they seek to grow that one-point advantage. Ranger's Newcastle loanee Haris Vukic (left) attempts to block a shot by QOTS' Chris Higgins . New manager Stuart McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club . Rangers were without suspended skipper Lee McCulloch – banned after a red card for an elbow on Hearts’ Osman Sow at the weekend – which meant a starting role for Bilel Mohsni alongside Marius Zaliukas at the heart of the defence. There was little to trouble either backline in the initial exchanges, as the game developed at a rather sedate pace. McCall watched it unfold pensively. Clearly, what he was seeing wasn’t to his liking. His side did have flickers of threat early on, but they often owed much to fortune. Andy Murdoch saw a mis-hit cross clawed out by Zander Clark, before a similar delivery from David Templeton looped fractionally over. The winger was another change to McCall’s line-up and he saw plenty of the ball before the break, without making it amount to a great deal.

Lyle (centre) wheels away after putting the hosts in front with a strike on 33minutes . One neat bit of skill saw him drift infield from the left flank before thumping a shot just too high. Another powerful swipe was blocked by Andy Dowie’s head – at the expense of ringing ears. Queens had offered even less up front throughout this spell, but suddenly sprang into life to claim the lead after 33 minutes with pretty much their first serious attack. Daniel Carmichael swept play wide to Lewis Kidd who took on Wallace. The Ibrox left-back toppled, apparently looking for a foul that wasn’t there, allowing Kidd to break into the penalty area. His cut-back found Lyle, who took a touch on his left foot before dispatching a sweet finish off his right. The home fans roared approval, barely having time to draw breath before the advantage was very nearly doubled. Lyle set up Reilly and his daisy-cutter drew a fine stop from Lee Robinson at full stretch. The QOTS striker acknowledges the home supporters after making the score 1-0 in the first half . Play continues as a flare is let off in the Rangers section of the crowd at Palmerston Park . QOTS goalkeeper Zander Clark ensures Rangers' Bilel Mohsni does not find the back of the net . Rangers used the shock to stir them into greater vigour. Nicky Clark was close with a brave effort from a Darren McGregor cross, which led to him being flattened by his namesake in the Queens goal. Then, after a Haris Vuckic corner caused uncertainty, Kenny Miller sent a looping header against the bar. The first half duly closed with a penalty shout from Wallace after he tangled with Mark Durnan. Referee Don Robertson remained unmoved. Far worse followed for Wallace 16 seconds after the restart as he got the final touch to his side’s second concession of the evening. Kidd celebrates after forcing an own goal from Rangers Lee Wallace immediately after the break . QOTS's Gavin Reilly (left) demonstrates a calm finish to put his side 3-0 to the good . Ibrox minds still appeared to be in the dressing room as Reilly surged into the box and sent a low cross speeding through the six yard box. It reached Kidd beyond the far post, who angled a drive back towards goal. Off balance, Wallace attempted to clear from the line but only succeeded in helping the ball into the net via his heel. Rangers were rocking. They looked shaken by the energy of their hosts. Fowler’s side seemed to be first to the ball in every area. Templeton collected a booking for diving after attempting to go past Durnan, but creating clear chances remained a trickier task. Not long after, the winger was replaced by Robbie Crawford. Clark saw a deflected effort held, before a Mohnsi effort from distance was shuttled round the post. Yet there still wasn’t a convincing edge to these attacking forays. The fluidity witnessed against Hearts at the weekend had disappeared. Scott Hooper applauds the home support as he leaves the field followed by dejected Rangers players . Queens were now content to try and pick Rangers off when they could. And they notched their clinching third goal after 69 minutes. Holt nicked possession away from Crawford and worked a little exchange that released Reilly. The flag stayed down as he calmly slotted beyond Robinson. Rangers attempted a pride-saving late flurry but found Clark in excellent form in the home goal. Notable saves from Vuckic and substitute Kris Boyd ensured McCall’s side would exit without even a sliver of consolation.","Rangers were beaten by Queen of the South in the Scottish Championship .

"Amid the flurry of tributes that followed Al Kellock’s announcement he was retiring at the end of the season, one from another old warhorse stood out. ‘So my friend and foe Alastair Kellock calls time on a great career,’ tweeted Scotland and Saracens lock Jim Hamilton. ‘Been a pleasure punching and getting punched by you. And punching together.’ As he suggested, Hamilton had stood toe to toe with his countryman as opponents when their respective teams, Edinburgh and Glasgow, clashed. But, in the second row for Scotland, they would have each other’s backs as they fought — normally against the odds — for their country. Al Kellock will retire at the end of the season and take up a new role with the SRU . On Thursday, at the home of Glasgow, it was announced that this fierce warrior would be standing down from active service after a career that truly boasted blood, sweat and toil for both club and country. At 33 and having amassed 56 international caps and made over 200 appearances for Glasgow and Edinburgh, Kellock has decided that his body and mind have been put through enough. No one could deny that he deserves nothing but praise and admiration, although lifting the Pro12 title at the end of the season would also be a more than fitting send-off. And yet, it might never have been. As he reflected upon his career yesterday, Kellock admitted that the odds were stacked against him even being a rugby player as he grew up in football-mad Bishopbriggs. In fact, his local high school didn’t even have a rugby team. He began, unsurprisingly given his height, as a budding centre-half in the school football team and only saw a rugby ball when he trained on a Tuesday and Thursday night at Allan Glen’s RFC. However, encouraged by his parents, who drove him to training, the decision to choose the oval ball has never since been regretted. The record books will show that he skippered Scotland to their first ever Test series win in the southern hemisphere and led Glasgow Warriors into their first ever play-off final. And, of course, more history could yet be made. ‘To retire as Glasgow captain is good enough but if I could go out as the Glasgow captain who wins the Pro12 for the first time in our history would be fairy-tale stuff,’ said Kellock, who played his 150th game as skipper in the 34-34 draw at Leinster last Friday. ‘If you had told me when I was at school I would go on to achieve some of the things I have achieved, and have a chance to round things off by winning the league, I wouldn’t have believed you. Kellock amassed 56 international caps and made over 200 appearances for Glasgow and Edinburgh . ‘When I was starting out, I was one of very few people at my school who dreamed of playing at Murrayfield. All my school friends wanted to play at Hampden and, don’t get me wrong, as a west of Scotland guy I played an awful lot of football, too. ‘We only played rugby in a three- week block in PE once a year and during one of them, my teachers said I had potential and took me to Allan Glen’s. Even then, when I finished school, I always played football with my mates and never saw a rugby ball apart from when I went to the club for training two evenings a week. ‘I had to make the decision when I was nearly 16 to pick football or rugby as I couldn’t do both at weekends because they clashed. ‘Choosing rugby was the best decision of my life. ‘I was picked to go on a tour for state school pupils to Ireland, organised by Sean Lineen, and two years later I played for the Scottish Schools Under-18 side alongside the likes of Mike Blair and Rory Lawson. We didn’t have a school team at Bishopbriggs but the selectors must have seen something in me to give me the chance.’ What they saw was an inspirational leader who wasn’t afraid to put himself about the pitch. And, at 6ft 8in tall and 18st 7lb, he was a formidable opponent. Kellock moved from Allan Glen’s to Stirling County and from there he was awarded a professional contract with Edinburgh Rugby in 2002. He played 56 times for the capital club, before moving west in 2006. He was almost immediately awarded the Glasgow captaincy, a position he has held ever since. Kellock’s senior Scotland debut was in a non-cap tour game against Queensland Reds in 2004. Later that year he won the first of his 56 caps against Australia at Murrayfield. He had always insisted he would only retire when he thought his body couldn’t take much more and the number of injuries and operations he has had made him realise it was time to call it a day. ‘It was dreadful telling everyone I was retiring and it was a reflective time for me,’ said Kellock. ‘There were some tears from my daughter and I would have loved to keep on playing but I knew it was time to call it a day. ‘I have had operations on my shoulder, elbow and will probably need one on my hand. I have had four knee operations and knew I needed to make one big, last push to try to help Glasgow to win the league this season and then call it quits. ‘I’m not going to go away easily as I want to play my part from now until the end of the season. I will be pushing as hard as I can to be involved as much as I can in all our matches. ‘I know how well the young lads are playing but training will still have an edge to it, probably more of an edge, as I want to get a starting place and retire after lifting some silverware with Glasgow.’ Kellock has been handed a job within the Scottish Rugby Union similar to the one secured by Chris Paterson when he retired three years ago, which will make him a rugby ambassador north of the border travelling round clubs. He will also be involved in learning about the commercial and business aspects of the governing body and will also work with the players at Glasgow, such as young lock Jonny Gray. ‘The job the SRU has given me is brilliant as it allows me to learn different parts of the business,’ he said. ‘I am not ruling out doing more coaching work in the future. I am just saying, at the moment, I will be concentrating on the business side but will be mentoring players and helping them with their line-out work. ‘There are some top second-row players at the club like Jonny, who is a grafter and would run into a brick wall for the Glasgow cause. He calls the line-outs and is someone who keeps getting better. ‘Players like Jonny are responsible for the success of the club in recent years. When I first joined Glasgow, we were bringing in 1,500 people at Hughenden, but now we’re regularly exceeding 6,000 at Scotstoun, which makes me incredibly proud and happy to be part of the journey. ‘To have captained the side for nine years is such an honour and I have so many fantastic memories, such as beating Toulouse away from home in Europe and winning against Munster in the Pro12 semi-final last season when my daughter was mascot.’ Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend paid tribute to the role Kellock played in the continued improvement of the club both on and off the field. ‘Al has been instrumental in Glasgow’s rise over the past five or six years and he’s been an excellent role model for our values, with the work he does to improve himself, his team-mates and the club,’ said Townsend . ‘He is very passionate about rugby in Glasgow and it’s great that he’s moving into an important role with Scottish Rugby and Glasgow Warriors when he retires. ‘Al has put his body on the line a lot during his nine years with the club and he’s still competing very hard with the other second-rows to be selected ahead of them. He shows excellent leadership whether he plays or not and his first thought is how he can help the team win. ‘He has been an excellent person to work with. The ideal captain. He has left a fantastic legacy for the future of the club to continue to grow.’","Glasgow Warriors captain Al Kellock will retire at the end of the season .

"Ultimately, Bristol City were never destined to become the first Football League club to win promotion this season at Deepdale, even though they are inching ever closer. Swindon’s win over Peterborough meant Steve Cotterill will have to wait until Tuesday to finish the job of returning to the Championship, but almost as importantly they made sure Preston wouldn’t make any ground on them in the top two. Three points at Bradford on Tuesday will do the trick - only that standing in their way now. It would take something to go seriously awry for the Robins not to be returning to the second tier after a two-year absence, and they did their job well enough to prevent any late scares in the north west. Bristol City striker Aaron Wilbraham celebrates his 63rd minute goal against Preston at Deepdale . Preston (3-5-2): Johnstone; Clarke, King, Wright; Humphrey (Wiseman 84), Welsh, Johnson, Gallagher, Laird; Beckford (Davies 90), Garner (Robinson 84) Subs not used: Stuckmann, Kilkenny, Woods, Little . Bristol City (3-5-2): Fielding, Ayling, Flint, Williams; Tavernier, K.Smith, Pack, Freeman (Elliott 90), Bryan; Agard (Emmanuel-Thomas 82), Wilbraham . Subs not used: Richards, Cunningham, Osborne, Saville, Wagstaff . A six-minute rendition of ‘F*** off Swindon Town, you are staying down’ rang out of the gleeful away end at Deepdale - populated by 2,400 - as that return got ever closer. City had dispensed of their rivals on Tuesday night, hammering them 3-0, and took great delight in revelling in their triumph. It was an afternoon whereby neither side played with any nerves - there are reasons why these two occupy the automatic promotion places - although lacking a fluidity you would perhaps expect. There was an illusion of this being an open game, but the two five-man midfields shattered that. Jermaine Beckford came closest for the hosts, his smart overhead kick just flying wide, while the out of sorts Daniel Johnson blasted way over. Joe Garner felt he should’ve been awarded a penalty after being clattered by Frank Fielding. Steve Cotterill, knowing results elsewhere dictated they could still clinch elevation by five o’clock, clearly put a rocket up his free scorers at the break. Before then they had threatened from free-kicks, managed to get into decent positions, but didn’t threaten nearly enough. Wilbraham got on the end of James Tavernier’s wicked cross from the right, but his shot was superbly tipped onto the bar by Sam Johnstone. Kieran Agard failed to stretch far enough to convert from two yards shortly afterwards. Preston were on the ropes, their biggest crowd in two years growing restless immediately after half-time. That was until Jermaine Beckford popped up, five yards out, to send Deepdale delirious just before the hour mark. Paul Gallagher picked up on lapse defending to take control of the situation inside the away box, firing across goal for Beckford to sweep beyond Fielding. At that stage, it took Simon Grayson’s side seven points ahead of MK Dons - drawing at Port Vale - in third. But they only managed to hold the lead for four minutes, Aden Flint intelligently flicking a header towards the middle of the six-yard box for Wilbraham to power home in front of the travelling band from the West Country, his 20th of the season. Grayson will be frustrated at the way in which his side switched off from a routine set piece. This could’ve been a day they made the title race very interesting indeed. As it was, Agard forced Johnstone into another decent save, diving down to his right to tip wide on the angle, as Cotterill’s side searched for a winner. That did not come, despite substitute Jay Emmanuel-Thomas’ best efforts. The ice is stored away, but not for long.","Second-placed Preston hosted League One leaders Bristol City .

"Edinson Cavani's agent has talked up a potential switch to Manchester United this summer after admitting a move to England is a possibility. United are monitoring the Uruguayan striker's situation at Paris Saint-Germain, and Cavani was furious about being taken off against Marseille at the weekend. And the 28-year-old's agent Claudio Anelucci says that a stint in the Premier League is most likely in the current climate, while a move to Spain would also suit his client.Ed .

'Edi is under contract at Paris Saint-Germain and there are several factors that come into play with respect to his future.' Once the situation is clarified there are several different scenarios given that players like him, at his level of maturity, are coveted by the biggest clubs in Europe.

"American Airlines is tapping into the youth market with the introduction of their new in-flight music. New indie music was first piped into the cabin - during boarding and disembarking - a few months ago and has quickly become a hit with passengers. In fact, many have taken to Twitter to share their approval of the new on board playlists, which feature rockers such as The xx, Haim, Phantogram and Hozier. American Airlines is targeting a younger demographic with the introduction of their new 'indie' cabin playlists . According to BuzzFeed News, on an internal blog, American Airlines representative, Barbara Delollis, discussed the company's decision. 'For 2015, they sought out a style of music that's upbeat yet not distracting, helps American stand out from the competition and appeals to younger generations,' she wrote. And it takes a lot for a track to make the cut. According to Delollis, the songs aren't just those 'you might find on the iPad/Spotify of a Gen Xer or Millenial. Foster The People is just one of many indie rock bands that are included on American Airlines' new playlists . Tracks from Hozier (left) and Lykke Li (right) were also hand selected to be played on board the flights . While boarding and while disembarking, specially selected indie rock music will now be piped into the cabin . The change comes on the heels of unfavourable customer feedback about the airline's previous cabin music, which were instrumental piano versions of pop songs. Brian Richardson, senior manager of American's in-flight entertainment and connectivity, also shared his thoughts about the switch on the same internal blog. 'The instrumental versions of pop songs had become tired and people were ready for a change,' he added. One Twitter user was especially excited to hear one of her favourite bands, Phantogram, on board . Washed Out, or Ernest Greene, is an electronica singer-songwriter and record producer from Georgia . Hozier's Take Me to Church was one of the biggest songs of the year - and can now be heard on board . Phantogram (left) and The xx (right) are two of the featured artists on American Airlines new cabin playlists . One customer mused that boarding his American Airlines flight felt like heading into a trendy nightclub . For this Twitter user, the best part of his flight was the boarding music playlist - and arriving safely, of course . Some passengers aren't totally excited about the change, like this man, who liked the previous elevator music . He also shared his excitement about seeing customers on board take out their smartphones and use the Shazam app to identify the songs playing. 'Who would've thought that we'd be introducing some people to these indie artists?' he wrote. The indie music is paired with the airline's new state-of-the-art cabins and, so far, all mainline and some regional aircraft have adopted the in-flight playlists.

"A woman who suffered stomach cramps and bleeding for two years was horrified to be told it was due to a tumour the size of a golf ball in her cervix. Kerry Hamilton was finally diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma, a rare cancer of the soft tissue normally found in women over 50. At just 34, she was forced to undergo a hysterectomy and was devastated at the thought of not being able to have children. She now wants to raise awareness about rare cancers like leiomyosarcoma, so that other women with seemingly 'everyday' symptoms like cramps visit their GP. Kerry Hamilton, 34, had stomach cramps, bleeding and irregular periods for two years. Doctors finally discovered she had a tumour the size of a golf ball growing in her cervix . Ms Hamilton, an education consultant, began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009, when she flew to South Africa to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month (pictured) Since her time in South Africa (pictured) she had experienced spotting in between her periods, longer periods than normal and stomach cramps . Ms Hamilton, from Birmingham, said: 'I'm on a bid to raise awareness about rare cancers and the symptoms that people might ignore - without realising that it is important to listen to their body. 'The kind of cancer I had - despite it being in my cervix - would not have showed up on a smear test. 'So it's important to visit your GP if you're concerned about anything, as well as always going for routine tests.' Ms Hamilton, an education consultant, began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009, when she flew to South Africa to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month. A week before she was due to fly home she fell violently ill with stomach cramps. She spent seven days in hospital where a local doctor told her that she was suffering with a cyst on her ovaries that had burst. Leiomyosarcomas are cancers that develop in a type of muscle tissue called smooth muscle. These muscles are found in the walls of muscular organs like the heart and the stomach. They are rare and usually only affect people over the age of 50, but they can start anywhere in the body. They most commonly start in the walls of the womb, the limbs and the digestive system. People with early leiomyosarcoma often have no symptoms. Possible . symptoms to develop as the cancer advances include a lump or swelling, . abdominal bloating, swelling or pain and a change in menstruation. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support . Over the next two years she returned to the park to work as a guide and a ranger and later returned to the UK where she started working as an educational consultant. When she returned, she went for a routine smear test in 2011 and was given the all clear. Ever since being hospitalised in South Africa she had experienced spotting in between her periods, longer periods than normal and stomach cramps. By last summer these symptoms had become worse and intense pain and lots of bleeding. Her GP suggested it was a hormonal problem and that she go on the contraceptive pill to try and control it. But as she was single, Ms Hamilton didn't see the point of using a contraceptive and felt uneasy about taking hormonal treatment. She also didn't want to ignore the signals her body was giving her, and so never took the contraceptives that were prescribed. It was only in January this year, when she was called for her next smear test, that she was finally diagnosed. The nurse due to carry out the smear said her cervix was so irritated that it was impossible to conduct the test. Ms Hamilton, pictured in 2009, became aware something was seriously wrong when a nurse couldn't perform a smear test on her as there was so much inflammation . Doctors diagnosed Ms Hamilton with a leiomyosarcoma  - a cancer of the soft tissue, the muscle, fat, blood vessels, or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body . She then broke the devastating news that she suspected Ms Hamilton had cancer. After an MRI scan, doctors confirmed she had leiomyosarcoma and would need a hysterectomy to save her life. A leiomyosarcoma is a cancer of the soft tissue, the muscle, fat, blood vessels, or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body. Ms Hamilton's was found in the walls of her cervix. Only about 3,300 new cases of soft tissue cancers are diagnosed each year in the UK, and they mainly affect people over the age of 50. Ms Hamilton described the shock of being told she may never be able to become pregnant naturally. 'This was going to be the year I was going to go out and meet someone and start to think about having a family. 'But now I wouldn't be able to carry a child. 'I couldn't believe that I had cancer in my cervix for all that time.' Ms Hamilton underwent a hysterectomy at just 34-and was devastated at the thought of not being able to carry a child. But she remained positive, saying 'there is somebody else going through much worse' She underwent egg collection so that one day she might have a child that is biologically hers. On March 19th this year she underwent the operation to remove her womb – and the tumour – and is now recovering at home. While many women would become disheartened after such an ordeal, Ms Hamilton said she believes . She said: 'Luckily I am a naturally positive person, and I just think that there is somebody else going through something much worse than me. 'When I was finally diagnosed it was more of a relief than anything to know what was wrong. 'It was when I was told that I would need a hysterectomy that when it hit me, and I became really upset.' Even before she had cancer, Ms Hamilton ran the Race for Life for Cancer Research UK, and this year raising money for the charity will be more meaningful than ever. She said: 'I have done the race the last two years, and I always said I would do it every year, so this year I'm on a mission. 'I've already raised £1,600 which is so amazing and humbling.'

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes recent defeats are down to his players' own failings rather than the opposition having cracked their system. The Reds' 3-4-2-1 formation, implemented from mid-December, helped produce a 13-match unbeaten Barclays Premier League run which lifted them to within a win of breaking back into the Champions League qualification places. But despite receiving plaudits for the quality of their football, which at times appeared to be unplayable, flaws started to appear a month ago when they were held to a goalless draw by Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn in the FA Cup. Brendan Rodgers says his sides recent defeats are down to his players, not his tactics being susses . After scraping a win against Swansea they were then exposed by Manchester United and Arsenal, two teams already in the top four. However, Rodgers insists a drop-off in results is more to do with their own performances than those of their opponents. 'I don't think it's about being worked out. We didn't start well (against Arsenal), and it doesn't matter what system you are playing if that happens,' he said. 'In the last four games that we've played we haven't created as much, and that's more on ourselves. Liverpool have lost ground in the race for the Champions League places and will find it hard to recover . 'Of course you give opponents credit but every team will go into a game to defend well and work hard against you. 'Probably the Blackburn game when we drew 0-0 and the games following that we haven't created as much. 'That's something that we want to reinforce - the creativity for chances and hopefully taking those chances. 'It's a difficult system to play against, but it's one of a number of systems we've played here and played very well. Alexis Sanchez fires home Arsenal's third goal, as the Gunners thrashed Liverpool at the Emirates . 'It's my job to always look to find the solutions, that's what I've tried to do in the games when we didn't look like scoring, finding a way to win.' Blackburn, who host Liverpool in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Wednesday, will take heart from the Merseysiders' mini-slump at a crucial time of the season. For Rodgers and Liverpool though the cup now represents the only chance to save their season and that should guarantee a reaction at Ewood Park. 'It's important to have a game quickly when you lose,' added Rodgers. 'The group is very committed to winning this trophy but in order to do that you have to qualify and we know Blackburn will be a difficult game for us. Steven Gerrard (left) and Mario Balotelli look on as Rodgers give a talk to his players and staff . 'A trophy this season will mark another step forward for us. Getting to a final and winning a trophy is what we want. 'In terms of the FA Cup that was always an objective. 'On Wednesday, we'll look to reach our second semi-final of the season in the cup competitions (having been narrowly beaten by Chelsea over two legs).' With the play-offs out of reach for Rovers they will also be putting all their efforts into trying to reach a Wembley last-four encounter with Aston Villa.

"Ander Herrera says he bares his full name on the back of his shirt for superstitious reasons following his spell at Athletic Bilbao. In a short Q&A video posted on the club's Facebook page on Tuesday morning, the Manchester United midfielder revealed that he wears both his forename and surname in order to carry on his form that earned him the move to the English giants last summer. Herrera joined the Red Devils for £29million following a relatively successful three-year period at Bilbao where he reached the Copa del Rey and the Europa League finals in his debut season at the club in 2011-12.

I started using Ander Herrera from Athletic [Bilbao] three years ago and I think I had a very good three years in Bilbao so I wanted to keep using that,' he answered following a supporter's question. After a stop-start beginning to life at Old Trafford, Herrera has forced his way into Louis van Gaal's starting line-up with a series of impressive displays that have coincided with the club's upturn in results. The 25-year-old took his tally to seven goals in all competitions this season with his double as United won 3-1 at home to Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday. Herrera's celebrations were both met with so much emotion - something the Spaniard has admitted it's not uncommon to him in the past. And adding in the Q&A video, he hopes to show a lot more emotion as United target silverware in the future. 'Every win, every victory make me happy but I hope the most emotional moments are coming I'm sure of that because I'm at Manchester United,' he said.

"Drilling threes on the buzzer is all good as far as Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James is concerned - the buzzing of drills at the dentist is a whole other story. The 11-time All Star brushed off rough treatment from the Chicago Bulls as his Cavs won on Sunday by saying it's the sort of thing NBA stars should expect come this stage of the season. 'It's April,' James shrugged. But the self-titled King James' talk wasn't so tough as he paid a second visit to the dentist's chair in a fortnight, as shared with his 9.3 million followers on Instagram. 'Back at the dentist and I'm hearing a bunch of drilling going on behind me from my docs so I had to sit up like, ""What the heck is going on back there."" Hahaha but seriously what's up. #DentistNightMares,' he wrote in his latest chronicle from the dentist's chair. LeBron James posts an image of himself not especially pleased with the buzzing of drills at the dentist . The 11-time All Star led his Cleveland Cavaliers to victory over the Chicago Bulls on Sunday . LeBron delivered his first triple-double for Cavs as they won a 50th game of the campaign and 18th straight at home in their march towards the playoffs. He contributed 20 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists, and one more if he claims credit for telling Kyrie Irving to shoot a 52-foot three on the buzzer at the end of the third quarter. James came crashing back to earth in the room filled with drills and sharp implements on Monday though after his on-fire Cavs accounted for the Bulls with some impressive shooting from outside at key moments proving the difference. On Sunday night LeBron's rival Joakim Noah was less than hospitable with a heavy foul or two. But the 30-year-old was more bothered by the man in the white coat and his assistant.

"It is no secret that when a gang member is sentenced to prison, he doesn't leave that life behind. Among the state of California's approximately 162,000 inmates, the most dangerous serve their time in Level IV maximum-security facilities where it is estimated as much as 97 per cent are gang affiliated. The gangs rule life behind the cement walls the same way as out on the streets, but for those who choose to leave the criminal families behind, the California Department of Corrections offers a chance at a different way of living on the inside. New order: Jeffrey Burkes (ex-Black Guerilla Family), Rubin Davis(ex-Mexican Mafia-Southern California), Norman Wayne Willhoite (ex-Aryan Brotherhood) and Dimas Deleon(ex-Nuestra Familia-Northern California), have spent collectively 55 years hating one another. In the past, standing next to each other would have meant kill or be killed.  Now, all four  reside in a Sensitive Needs Housing Unit . New unit: A former member of an Aryan Brotherhood gang walks through the prison yard in the Sensitive Needs Housing Facility at the California Department of Corrections, a section of the prison where gang behaviour is banned . Mixing it up: Inmates of different races and gang backgrounds play basketball together in the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit yard under the supervision of correctional officers in stark contrast to the segregation that generally governs prison life . Since 1999, the CDC has seen a dramatic increase in requests from inmates seeking special protection for dropping out of prison gangs, and as a result has set up several Sensitive Needs Housing Units. A Sensitive Needs Housing Unit can be found inside Level IV maximum-security facilities and is set to protect former members from the gangs, some of the more prominent being the Black Guerilla Family, Aryan Brotherhood and rival hispanic gangs Nuestra Familia from Northern California and the Mexican Mafia from the south. The exclusive units inside Sensitive Needs Housing provide a safer environment, free from gang activity, and the transition out of gang membership is dramatic. As these images show, inmates of different races and gang affiliations mix during their daily exercise and in the cafeteria during lunch. Prisoners who would previously have killed each other on sight due to their race or gang, now jokily tackle each other during a friendly basketball game on the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit's court. Building bridges: An ex-Mexican Mafia (southern California) gang member exercises with  former members of the Nuestra Familia (northern California) in the the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit. Historically, members of these two rival gangs would have killed each other on sight . The other side of things: Prisoners who still remain in the 'normal' parts of the prison, outside the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit, refuse to exercise simultaneously, inmates alternate their workout routines until members of other gangs race have finished . Former leader: Dimas 'Diablo' Deleon,  was one of the most feared enforcers for the Nuestra Familia (Northern California) prison gang. He explains how, in his world he was the self-proclaimed God; his word determined who lived or died. After spending almost 16 years in solitary confinement, he chose to drop out and now resides in a Sensitive Needs Housing Unit . Dining together: Inmates share meals in a cafeteria setting, which is a freedom allowed in Sensitive Needs Housing Units . One of them is Dimas 'Diablo' Deleon, formerly one of the most feared enforcers for the Nuestra Familia. In his world, he was the self-proclaimed God - his word determined who lived or died. After spending almost 16 years in solitary confinement for his gang leadership, he says lost respect for the collective decision-making and chose to drop out. He now resides in the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit, where corrections officers, as well as inmates, report a considerable reduction in racial violence and segregation. Although inmates of the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit are no longer gang affiliated or validated, the fact remains that they are some of the most hardened and dangerous men behind bars. Some racial segregation is still self-imposed by the inmates, and they are routinely stripped and undergo full-body cavity searches for weapons and narcotics. A gang dropout in the Sensitive Needs Housing Facility participates in a 'joint venture program,' a collaboration between the prison and a private sector company. Outside of Sensitive Needs Housing, inmates with jobs earn 20 cents an hour. Those who have renounced gang membership have the opportunity to work for the federal minimum wage. The money he earns is distributed among his family, the family of the man he murdered, personal savings, and an inmates' fund . Break with tradition: Free of body shackles, inmates in a Sensitive Needs Housing Unit walk to the prison yard for their daily exercise . Still issues: Several packets of black tar heroin, a razor blade, a homemade syringe, and a cooking spoon were wrapped in artwork. The contraband was probably smuggled into the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit in the anal cavity of a visitor and passed to an inmate . For those living outside the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit, old rules apply. Every gang has a hierarchy, and members and affiliates follow orders from the leaders who are deemed 'validated' by outside powers. Only the most feared and brutally confident inmates within a Level IV prison reach validation status. Leaders of gang hierarchy manage daily operations such as murders, assaults and narcotic trafficking inside the prison. With racial tensions running high at Level IV facilities, validated gang members and other residents of Administrative Segregation Housing Unit spend their exercise time in 15ftx7ft cages, called 'dog runs.' Even though inmates are segregated and separated by the cages, they refuse to exercise simultaneously. Instead, inmates alternate their workout routines, waiting until members of rival gangs have finished. Two worlds - one prison: Handcuffs are removed from an inmate housed in a vertical cage in the Administration Segregation Unit in preparation for a full cavity search at the Calipatria State Prison, left, and right; an inmate receives a haircut in a Sensitive Needs Housing Unit . Strict rules: Until he passes three bowel movements, this inmate, suspected of hiding a weapon or drugs in his anal cavity, is confined in a special Administration Segregation holding cell containing nothing more than a bare mattress in Calipatria State Prison . Two worlds on the inside: A prisoner known as 'Gumby' is standing in an Administration Segregation Housing cell in Calipatria State Prison.

"For most people, spotting a Google Street View car is an interesting, if uneventful, point in the day. But for Nasr Bitar, it was his time to shine.

"He's been at the sharp end of football for the majority of his career but a former Premier League striker seems to have met his match when literally trying his hand at another profession. Preston North End forward Kevin Davies has been through the wars during his 22 years in the beautiful game - being bumped and bruised by many an opposition defence. The 38-year-old isn't adverse to putting the boot in himself though -proven by the fact that he formerly held the record for the most Premier League bookings by a player with 99, alongside Lee Bowyer, before Everton midfielder Gareth Barry took that unwanted stat this season. Preston North End striker Kevin Davies tweeted a picture of his cut right hand after chainsawing on Tuesday . However, Davies' latest injury is self-inflicted as the England international inadvertently hacked away at his right hand while operating a chainsaw. Accompanied with the caption: 'Chainsaw 2 KD 0,' the former Bolton Wanderers captain tweeted on Tuesday a picture of his hand covered in two plasters where the damage had been done. It's the second time in less than two months where Preston's No 9 has injured that part of his body. During Preston's FA Cup fifth round replay 3-1 defeat to Manchester United on February 16, Davies managed to play over an hour after team-mate Joe Garner accidentally crushed his left hand in the opening exchanges of the contest. A day later he tweeted a picture of his injury accompanied with the caption: 'Sore hand today think my partner in crime Joe Garner landed on it!'

"England must have played against worse teams than this St Kitts Invitational XI but, after a day that descended into near farce, it is difficult to think of any. Warm-up games can be low-key affairs but there cannot have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this. St Kitts were simply shambolic, so bad that Chigwell Cricket Club could give them a decent game, and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of Caribbean cricket. They were simply not fit for purpose. Jos Buttler appeals for a stumping as England dominated the second day of a farcical match in St Kitts . Mark Wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for England . The statistics will say that England, having bowled St Kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match, rattled up 379 for six declared with both Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retiring out. Then St Kitts, given just one session to hang on, capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory. The match was drawn, just about, and it should also have been hung and quartered. The modern fixture madness that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win Test series these days. But when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering. England may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests. Wood celebrates his first England wicket, but he is probably still a way off getting a first Test cap . Alastair Cook acknowledges the crowd after making a century, shortly before being retired out . Jos Battler had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before England declared with a mammoth 320 lead . For what it is worth, Bell and Joe Root made untroubled half-centuries yesterday after Cook had moved to his first century for England since the Ashes warm-up in Hobart 18 months ago and promptly retired. Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler then had a bit of a bash before England declared at the fall of Stokes just before tea, the small matter of 320 ahead. Then, in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the ‘contest,’ England brought Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood into the match for a work out. Wood, the Durham fast bowler, looked lively in his first bowl for England off his minimalist run-up and earned his first wicket when he bowled Shane Jeffers but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first Test cap just yet. Gary Ballance looked out of touch, the only real problem for England in a very comfortable match . Liam Plunkett charges in as England reduced their hosts to 24 for six in farcical circumstances . When St Kitts plummeted to 24 for six and almost had a batsman timed out before he emerged just in time with the Velcro on his pads barely fastened, the home side’s embarrassment was almost complete. Yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as England gave their two spinners a decent bowl, Akeem Saunders and Leon Clarke doing most to keep England at bay. The only place in England’s first Test team yet to be decided, it seems, is between Adil Rashid and James Tredwell for the sole spinner’s slot and Tredwell was the clear winner here, taking three wickets to Rashid’s one. The Yorkshireman will need to have a very good second match to edge out Tredwell. James Tredwell (left) outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest to be England's Test spinner next week . Buttler makes an unconventional stop as England came close to winning the game in just two days . The only concern for England will be the form of Gary Ballance who looked out of touch before falling for 16, the legacy perhaps of a World Cup where he somehow became a symbol of England’s unimaginative one-day thinking. England’s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm-ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at St Kitts whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on Thursday. The first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at Warner Park tomorrow and the once proud reputation of Caribbean cricket will most likely take another hit. Truly, it is a sad state of affairs.","England reduce Invitational XI to 24 for six after amassing lead of 320 .

"Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo appeared to be enjoying his vacation in Portugal as he posed for a picture at the dinner table with family and friends just days after his affair with a fitness instructor was exposed. Rojo went away during a week off for his club side, pictured with team-mate Angel di Maria on the plane, after United's 3-1 victory over Aston Villa on Saturday. The Argentina international is impressing in defence under Louis van Gaal in his first season in the Premier League, though it his time off the field in Manchester that has recently come into question. Marcos Rojo (third from left) enjoys a meal out with friends and family in Portugal during a week off . Rojo (back right) poses while travelling to Portugal along with his family and Angel di Maria (left) Fitness instructor Sarah Watson claims Rojo and his advisors tried to frame her for blackmail . Fitness instructor Sarah Watson, 34, claims Rojo and his advisors tried to frame her for blackmail after she enjoyed a brief liaison with the United star following a night out. Rojo's identity in the case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. She said: ‘He came over to me and sat down. His English was quite bad but he was chatty and said nice things to me about how I looked and how he liked my Versace dress. ‘He said “You’re gorgeous, you’re the best looking girl in here.” It was all very cheesy, but he’s so good looking that I gave him my number.’ Rojo invited her to his friend’s flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. “My love, where are you?” he asked. ‘It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.’ So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo’s – known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit – made a shocking proposition. ‘He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.’ But she did find the Argentine star’s dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. ‘I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,’ she said. The Argentine defender was in action for Manchester United against Aston Villa on Saturday . Rojo celebrates with team-mate Di Maria after the 3-1 victory at Old Trafford in the Premier League . Watson says that the 25-year-old offered her money to spend the night with him - which she declined - and then accepted a £30,000 offer from a newspaper to sell her story. She never received that money, and Sarah then says Rojo's representatives tried to entrap her with promises of cash to spin the story. Watson said: ‘[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me £100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah’s estimated £25,000 legal costs. The defender has not spoken about the incident publicly, while his friend Bereit - who Sarah claims offered her the money - declined to comment. Watching from the stands as Rojo impressed at Old Trafford against Tim Sherwood's side at the weekend, was his wife Eugenia Lusardo, a lingerie model based in Lisbon, and their young daughter, Morena. Both are pictured with Rojo as he enjoyed a meal in Lisbon, the city he used to ply his trade in with Sporting before signing for United last summer.

"On the day of his arrival at Liverpool in June 2012, Brendan Rodgers struck an emotive theme, telling stories of afternoons at his grand-father’s house in County Antrim spent watching the great Liverpool teams of the 1970s and ’80s competing in domestic cup finals. Rodgers has, it must be said, always had an understanding of the importance of domestic silverware to the club. On Wednesday night at Ewood Park, he must only hope his modern Liverpool side can raise themselves above recent modest levels and take another step towards a Wembley final that could yet go some way to rescuing his season. Brendan Rodgers set his side the objective of winning a trophy and finishing inside the top four . Liverpool have lost ground in the race for the Champions League places and will find it hard to recover . Steven Gerrard (left) and Mario Balotelli look on as Rodgers give a talk to his players and staff . Blackburn's record against top-flight opposition . Speaking ahead of the replay at Blackburn, Rodgers would not go so far as to say the FA Cup could save this campaign for Liverpool. He cannot be seen to be writing off his team’s top-four Barclays Premier League hopes just yet. Nevertheless, an FA Cup final would be more than useful, for all kinds of reasons. ‘I don’t want to go down the route of saying that it saves our season,’ said Rodgers. ‘Our objective at the start, though, was to win a trophy. ‘So I think if we didn’t get in the top four and we didn’t have a trophy this year, we would be disappointed. I think certainly the FA Cup would give us a great boost as a team with lots of young players and players coming into the club. ‘That’s the expectancy we want. We want to be able to be challenging every year. ‘That was the key thing for me, to get the group challenging at the top end of the league and for trophies. The FA Cup would mark a good step forward for us.’ Coming towards the final part of a season that saw Liverpool start badly, improve markedly and then disappoint once again, the problems facing their manager are familiar. Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez scored 55 club goals between them last season but this time round the club’s top scorers are Raheem Sterling and Steven Gerrard with 10 each. Meanwhile at the back, familiar failings re-emerged in the 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on Saturday as Liverpool defended poorly and were left asking questions — for the first time in a while — of their goalkeeper Simon Mignolet. Liverpool ace Kolo Toure is expected to start in the absence of the suspended Martin Skrtel and Emre Can . Summer signing Dejan Lovren may also be given the chance to impress at Ewood Park . Blackburn vs Liverpool predicted line-ups . Asked if a defensive repeat would see Liverpool lose to a Championship side, Rodgers said: ‘I think so, yes. We didn’t defend at Arsenal. We didn’t defend the ball well enough, we gave the ball away in poor areas for two of the four goals. ‘Over the last few months we defended really well, we had six clean sheets against good opponents and defended very well away from home. ‘The minute you come off it and if you come off it against good players you can get punished and that is what happened.’ Worryingly for Rodgers, his best two defenders — Martin Skrtel and Emre Can — are suspended along with captain Gerrard. There remains a genuine desire to reach May’s Wembley final in order to let Gerrard leave the club in memorable fashion, something that was outlined by midfielder Joe Allen last week. ‘There is no getting away from that,’ said Allen. ‘That is something that drives us. We all feel we owe Steven a lot.’ If it is to happen, Liverpool must overcome what should be a stiff challenge from Gary Bowyer’s team. Blackburn did more that frustrate Liverpool in the 0-0 draw at Anfield exactly a month ago. They could have won and we can expect them to again trouble a defence that may have to feature two of Rodgers’ weakest links, Kolo Toure and Dejan Lovren. Certainly Liverpool must lift themselves if they are to prosper. The fact that they have already overcome a similar challenge in round four — winning a replay at Bolton — will perhaps encourage them but that was a Liverpool team trending upwards in form. Currently, there is a sense that the opposite is happening. Liverpool will be hoping to replicate their 2001 FA Cup triumph by beating Arsenal in the final . The obvious beneficiary of all this is the grand old competition itself. With Arsenal, Aston Villa and Reading already in the last four, the FA Cup is guaranteed to find itself with semi-finalists who desperately want to lift the trophy. Deep down, the FA will long for an Arsenal-Liverpool final. That will evoke some classic memories involving the likes of Charlie George and Michael Owen. Rodgers would surely give much for the opportunity to avenge last weekend’s league defeat on such a grand stage. ‘There is everything still to play for and we can still make it a really successful season,’ he said. Whether those words were spoken in hope or expectation, only he will really know.","Liverpool take on Blackburn Rovers in FA Cup semi-final replay .

"Japan's J-League is just four games into a new season, but already the behaviour of its players is hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons after a player appeared to stamp on an opponent's face. Videos of the South Korean defender Kim Min Hyeok, who plays for Sagan Tosu, have gone viral after he allegedly brutally stamped on the face of opponent Mu Kanazaki. Sagan are ninth in the J-League and furious claims have been made that the 23-year-old deliberately committed the horrific foul after being jostled by 11th-placed Kashima Antlers player Kanazaki. Kim Min Hyeok (left) and Mu Kanazaki (right) fight it out for the ball on the wing during a J-League clash . After Kanazaki went down, it is alleged that Hyeok stamped down on the face of his fallen opponent . Despite the vicious looking nature of Hyeok’s apparent attack and Kanazaki’s dramatic clutch to his face, the defender only received a yellow card and was allowed to play on, much to the fans' uproar. Whether or not the foul was intentional, it is suspected that the reason for Japanese  fans’ outcry is not so much the act itself, but the fact that it was committed by a South Korean player. Hyeok's boot appears to scrape down Kanazaki's face, but the man on the floor came out as the winner later . Hyeok was somehow only shown a yellow card for the challenge that infuriated fans at the stadium . Some Japanese fans have demanded not only the expulsion of Hyeok, but of all South Koreans, from the game. However, regardless of the controversy, justice - to some extent - was served when the supposed stamped-on player’s team won 3-1, with Kanazaki among the goals.","Kim Min Hyeok has been accused of stamping on an opponent's face .

"Boss Tim Sherwood backed Christian Benteke to fire Aston Villa to safety after the striker's crucial hat-trick saved a point against QPR. The forward's treble - his first in two years - clinched a pulsating 3-3 draw with their drop rivals as Villa edged further clear of the bottom three. Villa are three points above the Barclays Premier League drop zone and denied QPR the chance to leapfrog them in the table. Christian Benteke scored a stunning hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against Queens Park Rangers . Manager Tim Sherwood said that Benteke can fire Villa to Premier League safety . Defeat would have left Villa in the relegation zone and behind QPR but Benteke struck a 25-yard free-kick with seven minutes left to save them and complete his treble. The Belgium international has seven goals in seven games under Sherwood and the boss hopes he can maintain his form to keep Villa up. He said: 'That's the plan. 'It doesn't come much better than that. He's a good player, I have always said it and he's in a rich vein of form. 'It's fantastic for him to score the goals, it's just a shame we couldn't get the three points. 'It's not about what you deserve, it's about what you get and we got one point. 'This could be a vital point come the end of the season in the end, when you go so late into the game and Christian has had to pull that out the bag we're grateful.' But Sherwood insisted Villa should have won after Benteke's first-half double, cancelling out Matt Phillips' opener, gave them a 2-1 lead at the break. He said: 'It's disappointing when you dominate a football match like that, the ref should have stopped it at half-time. QPR were only ahead for three minutes in the first half after Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park . Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh goal of the season early on . 'I thought we tired in the second half but that's to be expected and two of those back four have trained about four times in eight weeks. We dropped off a little bit too deep and couldn't keep that pressure on them. 'But anyone who has seen that football match knows it shouldn't have been close.' Rangers hit back after the break through Clint Hill and Charlie Austin, the latter netting with just 12 minutes left. They have taken four points from their last two away games after winning just once on the road this season before Saturday's 4-1 win at West Brom. The draw, though, left them two points from safety having played a game more and boss Chris Ramsey admitted he was nervous after Austin's goal. He said: 'It's a long time, it's heart attack time for managers that. You can see you're going to win but you know there's a chance anything can happen, a free-kick, a corner or a bit of magic. Benteke's added two more, including this wonder free-kick - much like Jason Puncheon's on Monday night . 'I thought we could (hang on) but a free-kick is a free-kick, at that stage most of their attacking options had been exhausted. 'I'm disappointed if I'm being honest. But before the game if someone said we'd get four points from the last two games we probably would have taken that.' Rangers were seeking back-to-back away wins in the top flight for the first time since 1995 but Ramsey targeted home victories to keep them up. They host Chelsea on Sunday before welcoming West Ham and Newcastle to Loftus Road. He said: 'I don't know what we need but we're probably going to have to win three games. I don't know what the points total will be but our two home games are going to be very important after Chelsea. 'We have got a couple of very difficult ones in Liverpool and Manchester City and then we have the potential cup final against Leicester on the last day of the season. 'Most teams would take being in it right to the end and then roll the dice, you don't want to start being detached because it's a big mountain to climb.'","Christian Benteke netted all three as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against QPR .

"Gary Mabbutt has spoken for the first time about how he was left with a 30 inch scar following a five hour operation to save his leg. The ex-Tottenham and England star, 53, was rushed to hospital after waking up at 1am to find that the leg had gone cold back in 2013. Mabbutt's diabetes had led to a clogged artery in the limb and doctors warned him it was 'touch and go' on whether it would have to be amputated. Gary Mabbutt has been left with a 30inch scar on his left leg after his diabetes caused an artery to be clogged . He was treated at King's College Hospital in south east London, undergoing an emergency five-hour operation. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound. Mabbutt, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 17, will not be able to play football again, leaving his dream of becoming a manager in tatters. As he is unable to train with players on the pitch, he has been forced to turn down roles in coaching. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal it . The Spurs legend has spoken for the first time about the agony he went through and says he hopes to raise awareness of his condition. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'When they talked about battling to save my leg, I realised I was helpless. As a diabetic you know complications can occur. But you think ""It's never going to happen to me"". It is vital to educate everyone with diabetes how to take care of themselves. If you have anything unusual with your feet, tingly toes, blisters, see your doctor.' In 1982, father-of-two Mabbutt became the first diabetic ever to play for England and captained Tottenham to FA cup glory in 1991. Former star: Mabbutt is pictured, left, lifting the FA Cup while playing for Tottenham in  1991 . He was unaware that his diabetes had triggered peripheral arterial disease, clogging up the blood vessels in the legs. Every year, surgeons perform around 8,000 amputations on diabetics in the UK - but campaigners say four out five could be prevented. Amputations cost the NHS £650million a year - and up 80 per cent of the amputees die within five years. Diabates sufferers are entitled to annual eye tests as they are are 20 times more likely to develop sight problems, but Gary Mabbutt wants a similar programme to apply to feet. Experts say millions of diabetics are unaware their condition could lead to foot problems and agree regular checks could save limbs.","Spurs legend woke up in middle of the night to find his leg was cold .

"Tim Sherwood's jacket did not survive beyond the first 10 minutes and after this astonishing contest it remains to be seen if either of these sides fare much better. When Aston Villa's animated manager threw his gilet to the ground in celebration at the sight of Christian Benteke's first half equaliser, he probably rather hoped his players were man enough to remain in the Barclays Premier League after all. Indeed when he then saw Benteke convert the second of his three goals after 33 minutes, he may have felt his damning critique on Monday had provoked exactly the response he was looking for. But the grit, desire and determination his forwards had demonstrated was lacking at the opposite end of the field and a QPR side every bit as desperate to maintain their top flight status did a fine job of exposing exactly the weaknesses Sherwood had highlighted. Matt Phillips (left) headed Queens Park Rangers into a seventh-minute lead, getting on the end of Bobby Zamora's cross . Winger Phillips garnered just enough power on his head to plant beyond Brad Guzan in the Aston Villa goal . Joey Barton wheels away after watching Phillips nod in at the back post, as Ciaran Clark (left) and Carlos Sanchez appeal for offside . But QPR were only ahead for three minutes after Christian Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park . Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh Premier League goal of the season . If it made for a hugely entertaining encounter, it must have been hell for the managers however friendly they might claim to be. Sherwood walked off the pitch at half-time with his hands planted casually in his pockets, comforted by the fact that his side were sitting five points clear of relegation danger. But when Charlie Austin followed Chint Hill's second half equaliser with a third goal for the visitors, Villa had replaced Chris Ramsey's spirited side in the bottom three. Only 12 minutes remained, and even if Benteke required just five more minutes to score again with a terrific free-kick the overriding feeling in the Villa ranks was certainly more one of frustration than relief. Benteke did not look like a man who wanted to enjoy his hat-trick at the sound of the final whistle. On the contrary, he looked devastated. Both sides have some difficult games ahead but when Tottenham and Manchester City come next for Villa, there is plenty to concern Sherwood. A replay of QPR's goals will not make pleasant viewing. The failure to close down Bobby Zamora before he delivered the cross that enabled Matt Phillips to strike after only seven minutes. The failure to challenge Hill and so stop him scoring his first Premier League goal. The failure too to respond to the threat being posed by Austin, who was allowed to take a touch to control the cross from Phillips before driving the ball past Brad Guzan. Such frailties could yet drag Villa down this season, and Sherwood knows it. 'We are not equipped unfortunately to go anywhere and dig out a result,' he complained afterwards, and on this evidence he would appear to be right.

Defender Clint Hill was the unexpected scorer of QPR's equaliser just after half-time to make it 2-2 . Hill grabs the Queens Park Rangers badge in celebration after scoring his first ever Premier League goal . Charlie Austin got ahead of Ron Vlaar and had looked as if he'd won the game for QPR . At times his side were excellent here, thrilling their supporters with a tremendous first half display. Phillips might have landed the first blow for QPR but the players he was probably referring to as 'the icing on the cake' were giving him plenty of cause for celebration. They were attacking with great flair and finesse, with the pace of individuals like Gabriel Agbonlahor and Leandro Bacuna and the sheer power of Benteke. The call for more men made Sherwood's selection of 19-year-old Jack Grealish somewhat curious. But the teenager too was performing well. More than man enough for the occasion. As a game it was something of an emotional rollercoaster, even if the warmth of the embrace between Sherwood and Ramsey before kick-off was soon replaced by the cold reality of a dire situation for both teams. Never one to hide his feelings, Sherwood responded to QPR's opening seventh minute goal by unzipping the aforementioned gilet in disgust. It was understandable really, given how meekly his defenders tried to stop Zamora from delivering the cross Phillips then headed home from close range. Only three minutes later and the same gilet was off altogether, Sherwood throwing it to the ground after seeing Benteke's shot take a nasty deflection off Mauricio Isla's trailing foot and loop over Rob Green. The drama in the technical area added to the sense of excitement around Villa Park. The atmosphere was electric, the place almost erupting again when Grealish so nearly marked his first Premier League start with a goal. Benteke delivered a perfect ball into the path of the teenage winger only for Green to make the save at his feet. Sherwood's decision to play a midfield diamond and exploit the pace of his attackers was working well for Villa. Not everyone seemed to agree, and at one stage Sherwood seemed to be placating a fan who didn't seem quite so impressed. But his team were playing with real verve, with Benteke scoring a second after 33 minutes with a goal that owed as much to the speed, vision and courage of Agbonlahor as the precision of the finish. Agbonlahor was just quick enough to send Benteke clear before being hacked down by Sandro, and remained curled up in a ball while his colleague raced towards goal. Benteke finished cleverly, shaping to shoot beyond Hill before dragging his effort back inside the QPR defender and beyond the reach of a wrong-footed Green. Austin salutes the travelling Rangers supporters inside Villa Park but they weren't able to cling on to the points .

Villa Park looked a picture on Tuesday night as the two relegation battlers went head-to-head in Birmingham . Sherwood said Ramsey was one of the finest coaches he had worked with and he certainly impressed here. He had seen how his forwards had been starved of service in the first half and responded after six minutes of the second by making two substitutions. It had the desired effect, Hill equalising four minutes later; punishment for what appeared to be Bacuna's failure to stay with his man. Austin's goal – his 17th in the Premier League this season - would be a further source of concern, even if Benteke did then level for a second time with a wonderful free-kick that beat Green via the inside of a post.

"He has been a colossus of the game. He has made 700 professional club appearances and won 81 caps for England, six Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Champions League. In his pomp, he was the stuff of strikers' nightmares, driving some of the world's greatest goalscorers to distraction with lightning-sharp reactions and an instinctive reading of the game. That's why it's such a shame that what is likely to be Rio Ferdinand's farewell year in the English game has fizzled out. Rio Ferdinand pictured in training at Queens Park Rangers last week. The 36-year-old defender started regularly in the first part of the season but has been unable to hold down his spot in the side . Ferdinand started the first seven matches of QPR's Premier League campaign before being dropped . Ferdinand has enjoyed a fantastic career, winning six Premier League titles, but a fairytale finish is unlikely . Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs lift the European Cup for Manchester United in Moscow back in 2008 . Ferdinand also won 81 caps for England during his glittering career . He would love to be out there, hunting down and hassling opponents, robbing attackers of the ball, winning the aerial duels, playing his part in Queens Park Rangers' survival mission. Keeping them up would be a fitting curtain call. Instead, Ferdinand's season has been one spent on the margins - either suspended, benched or out of the squad altogether. Once again, the 36-year-old was forced to watch on from the sidelines as Rangers claimed a potentially crucial point away to Aston Villa on Tuesday night. Ferdinand had picked up a slight knock and was ruled out. He has played just five times since the start of October - not much of a swansong. On Sunday, he posted a Twitter picture of a pile of chicken bones after lunch at his mum's. He had not been involved in the 4-1 win at West Brom 24 hours earlier and it weirdly seemed to sum up his peripheral role at the moment. By contrast, Ferdinand had started QPR's first seven games of the campaign, lasting the full 90 minutes in all of them. Harry Redknapp had grand plans and the best of intentions last summer. Having called time on his Manchester United career after 12 trophy-laden seasons, Ferdinand moved to Loftus Road in what Redknapp described as a 'remarkable coup for the club.' Harry Redknapp described Ferdinand's signing last summer as a 'remarkable coup' for the club . But after initial promise, Ferdinand has largely spent the season on the bench . Premier League (6): 2002-03, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13 . FA Cup (1): 2003-04 . Football League Cup (2): 2005-06, 2008-09 . FA Community Shield (5): 2003, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013 . Champions League (1): 2007-08 . FIFA Club World Cup (1): 2008 . Even in his mid-thirties, Redknapp believed Ferdinand would bring 'quality, class, experience and know-how' as QPR returned to the top flight. He envisaged Ferdinand in a sweeper role, the central pivot of a three-man defence in an in-vogue 3-5-2 system. He would bring all that experience to bear, helping Clint Hill and Steven Caulker keep opposition attacks at bay. Unfortunately, it just didn't work. In their first seven Premier League games of the season, QPR won one, drew one and lost five. They leaked 15 goals and the scale of their task in staying in the top division was clear. Ferdinand was demoted to the bench, Richard Dunne and Nedum Onuoha were introduced and the dye was cast for the season. His suspension for using the word 'sket' in a tweet didn't help and by the time that was served, Ferdinand was down the pecking order. Ferdinand has shown glimpses of his imperious best for QPR this season . But Ferdinand's farewell season in English football has not lived up to his expectations . Chris Ramsey has played Ferdinand on three occasions since taking over from Harry Redknapp . Queens Park Rangers find themselves two points from safety after their 3-3 draw at Aston Villa on Tuesday . As you would expect, Ferdinand has conducted himself like a model professional on the training ground, maintaining his fitness in case he was called upon. And there have been such occasions, notably the 2-0 win at Sunderland in February - Chris Ramsey's second game in charge after replacing Redknapp, that ended QPR's 11-game losing run on the road. Ferdinand may yet be called upon again in the run-in, with QPR sitting two points shy of safety, but the season so far will have fallen short of his hopes and expectations. That fairytale finale, with Ferdinand leading an heroic resistance to keep Rangers in the Premier League, seems unlikely. There are rumours that clubs in the money-soaked Qatar Stars League are preparing to tempt Ferdinand with one final payday but that remains to be seen. For now, Rio's farewell has sadly fallen a bit flat. The fixtures remaining for the bottom six in the Barclays Premier League .","Rio Ferdinand missed 3-3 thriller with Aston Villa through injury .

After the game, Parish posed for a picture at Selhurst Park with Palace manager Alan Pardew, England boss Roy Hodgson and Bill Wyman - one of the original members of The Rolling Stones and avid Palace fan. Parish posted the picture on Instagram, writing: 'Great moment for me , AP, the England manager, one of the original @RollingStones @bill_wyman.' Writing in his FourFourTwo column broadcaster Geoff Shreeves, who was also in the Palace boardroom after the game, said: '(Bill Wyman) has been an avid supporter for 68 years, having attended his first game aged 10. 'He can name virtually every player in that period, despite having spent 30 of those years in The Rolling Stones. 'Bill Wyman is not only a charming man but also somebody with a genuine passion for the game and its traditions. Wyman (back right) with fellow members of The Rolling Stones back in 1964 .

"QPR are still two points and a seven-goal swing away from Premier League safety but in winger Matt Phillips they might just have the man to help them beat the drop. The Hoops winger has been in sensational form since the turn of the year and now sits second - behind only Barcelona's Lionel Messi - in the list of top assist makers in Europe's big five leagues in 2015. Phillips set up another two goals for Chris Ramsey's side in their 3-3 draw with Aston Villa on Tuesday night, taking his tally for 2015 - and the season - to seven.

That leaves the former Blackpool man just one behind Argentine superstar Messi, who has recorded eight assists this year to help Luis Enrique's side to the top of La Liga.

The ex-Chelsea midfielder has made an incredible 17 assists in the Bundesliga this season, with seven of those arriving since the turn of the year. Verona's Emil Halfredsson, who spent an unsuccessful two-year spell with Tottenham between 2005 and 2007, is one of six players to have laid on five goals in 2015.

"Jack Wilshere has moved a step closer to recovery from the serious ankle injury that has wrecked his season after completing 90 minutes for Arsenal’s under 21 side. The England midfielder came through the 4-1 win over Stoke City unscathed as he pushes for a return to Arsene Wenger’s first team before the end of the campaign. He was joined by Mikel Arteta and Abou Diaby, recovering from ankle and calf injuries respectively, in the Under 21 Premier League fixture at the Emirates Stadium. Jack Wilshere moved a step closer to recovery from the serious ankle injury after 90 minutes for the U21 side . Wilshere tries to cut inside of Stoke's Ollie Shenton during the match in the U21 Premier League . Alex Iwobi stole the show with a hat-trick for Arsenal at the Emirates alongside a few of their senior stars . Hat-trick hero Iwobi is capped for England’s youth teams but likely to play for Nigeria . Arsenal Under 21: Deyan Iliev; Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Stefan O’Connor, Krystian Bielik, Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill, Abou Diaby (Julio Pleguezuelo 71), Mikel Arteta (c) (Stephy Mavididi 60), Serge Gnabry, Jack Wilshere, Daniel Crowley, Alex Iwobi . Substitutes not used: Ryan Huddart (GK); George Dobson, Gedion Zelalem . Scorers: Iwobi 23, 40, 90+2; Mavididi 73 .

Substitutes not used: Dominic Kurasik (GK); Tom Adeloye . Scorer: Shenton 8 . Referee: Anthony Da Costa . Attendance: 2,674 . Wilshere has been out of action since suffering the injury in the 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United on November 22 but is finally nearing full fitness. It has been the latest in a succession of injury problems that have hampered his development into the world class player he was expected to become for club and country. Having made a return to action in a reserve friendly with Brentford last week, this was a step up in quality for Wilshere and he exerted a quiet influence without taking a hold on the game. He saw a free-kick 25 yards from goal deflected just over the crossbar early on and initiated a move later in the first-half that culminated in Serge Gnabry firing a snapshot on the turn that was saved the legs of Stoke goalkeeper Daniel Gyollai. Wilshere might have capped his night with a goal but his improvised volley from a Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill cross was saved before Stephy Mavididi slammed home the rebound for Arsenal’s third on 73 minutes. Arteta, who has been on the sidelines since the Champions League game with Borussia Dortmund on November 26, captained the team but failed to make much of an impact during his hour of involvement. Diaby, whose never-ending succession of injuries has seen him absent for an astonishing 226 weeks of his Arsenal career, was arguably their most influential performer as he fights for a new contract. Mikel Arteta was among the players as he stepped up his recovery from an ankle injury . Wilshere runs with the ball during the U21 Premier League match on Tuesday night at the Emirates . With his runs through the centre of midfield, Diaby caused plenty of problems for the Stoke defence and he had two opportunities to get on the scoresheet in his 70 minutes of action. On 17 minutes, a lovely through ball from Gnabry set him clear inside the box but a last-ditch tackle ruined everything and, shortly afterwards, he curled a shot a fraction over the bar from the edge of the area. With the first-teamers mis-firing, it was left to Alex Iwobi to make an impression with two clinical first-half goals that were almost identical and a stoppage time third. On 23 minutes, Iwobi, who is capped for England’s youth teams but likely to play for Nigeria, surged at the Stoke defence, beat two men and fired crisply across the keeper and into the far corner. And he repeated the trick five minutes before the break, locating the same corner from pretty much the same position after latching on to Diaby’s slide-rule pass. Abou Diaby of Arsenal pictured shooting during the match between Arsenal U21 and Stoke City U21 . England midfielder Wilshere came through the 4-1 win over Stoke unscathed on Tuesday night . Arsenal had started on the back foot and fell behind eight minutes in when the highly-rated Ollie Shenton was gifted the simplest of close-range finishes when goalkeeper Deyan Iliev fumbled a cross from Nathan Ricketts-Hopkinson. But by the time Iwobi completed his hat-trick in stoppage time, Arsenal were in complete control. It was the best of the young striker’s treble as he burst forward at lightning pace and delicately lifted the ball over the keeper. When Arsenal’s senior side have been a First Division team for a century, it seems incongruous to find the under 21s stuck in the second division. But that could soon be rectified. This win kept them in touch with the leading pack and Arsenal retain games in hand on all above them as they seek to claim one of the two promotion places to the top division.","Jack Wilshere played 90 minutes for Arsenal's Under 21 side .

'When he started, nobody knew what was going to happen. 'His idea was that he did not care about names at all, you don't need stars, everybody had to prove themselves again. 'The first contact with him was already poisoned. As a professional you lose your trust. He does great things on the pitch but the coach Van Gaal was a bad man. Our relationship was crushed.'

"The 2013/14 season was seen as a step forward for Arsenal, spending the majority of the campaign at the top of the Premier League and ending their trophy drought with the FA Cup. But the Gunners still finished in fourth place yet again, with Arsene Wenger's team were heavily criticised after throwing away the title. That poor run of form in 2014 couldn't seem further away now with Arsenal flying in the league, a recent 4-1 victory against Liverpool demonstrating their step forward. But still, the north London side have exactly the same record as they did at this stage last season. Arsenal were reeling after a 6-0 defeat by Chelsea at this stage last season and had 63 points from 31 games .

The Premier League table after Arsenal had played 31 games in 2013/14 (left), and now (right) Played 31, won 19, drawn six, lost six - the only stat differentiating the two tables is Arsenal's favourable goal difference in this campaign - a season which their points tally of 63 merits a place of second, rather than fourth. With the addition of Alexis Sanchez as well as a new-found solidity in Francis Coquelin and the goalscoring returns of Olivier Giroud and Mesut Ozil, the Gunners are already being tipped to challenge for the title next season. But the run of form at the start of the season - in contrast to 2013/14 when they impressed in the opening months - has cost Wenger.

"Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey may become a united force again in seasons to come. They could continue as rival managers. Whatever happens, they will remember this night when they went toe to toe for 90 minutes of top-flight football. There was adrenaline, action, twists and turns. It was good to see two English coaches who have come up through the ranks against each other in a match of this importance. Their teams’ Premier League statuses were not decided on Tuesday night, but this felt like a sliding-doors moment that directed their paths. Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey embrace each other as they met at Villa Park on Tuesday night . There was adrenaline, action, twists and turns as Ramsey and Sherwood went head to head at Villa Park . Queens Park Rangers led, then Aston Villa led, then Charlie Austin gave QPR a taste of victory before Christian Benteke wiped it away with his hat-trick goal. It was absorbing stuff on the pitch as well as in the technical areas, where Sherwood and Ramsey stood. They shuffled and shouted, cajoled and pointed. Never during the match did they exchange glances, perhaps too afraid to look the other in the eye and give the game away. Sherwood and Ramsey’s relationship was forged over four years at Tottenham. They helped bring through young talent; Sherwood predominantly picking and motivating, Ramsey mainly coaching. Harry Kane, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb are part of their Spurs legacy. Now Premier League bosses, they still live 10 minutes apart in Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. They have been for pints this season and will do so again in the future no doubt, unpicking this game that had so much at stake. Sherwood tore his jacket off as he celebrated his team's goal en route to Christian Benteke's hat-trick . Sherwood throws his jacket as he celebrates the goal at Villa Park in the relegation battle . Sherwood was out at pitchside much earlier than his friend and rival, so he waited and watched as Ramsey, jacket wrapped around his waist, strode out on his own from tunnel to dugout. The Villa boss extended his hand and there was a warm embrace between the two men as an arc of photographers snapped away nearby. Sherwood wore his customary gilet. In the seventh minute it was unzipped, three minutes later it was ripped off and flung to the floor. The timings coincided with QPR’s opening goal, and Villa’s equaliser. Think Temuri Ketsbaia minus the hoarding kicks. Sherwood, as we have become accustomed, was living the match on the edge. Unafraid to hype its importance before kick-off, he was treating it as such once the whistle blew. The showdown between Sherwood (left) and Ramsey (right) ended in a 3-3 draw at Villa Park . By half-time we had seen the full show. In the 16th minute he placed his hands on his head when QPR keeper Rob Green saved from Jack Grealish. In the 24th he hurried his players to take a free-kick. Soon after he was telling fans behind his dugout to calm down after Grealish delivered a poor corner. He produced his double-fisted pump celebration after Benteke’s second, the one we saw during the latter stages of the FA Cup win over West Brom. Sherwood was more restrained in the second period, particularly when Clint Hill found a leveller. Austin’s strike left him shellshocked before Benteke put a smile back on his face. With six games to go, both men have much to think about.","Aston Villa and QPR drew 3-3 in the Premier League on Tuesday night .

"Leeds Rhinos have sent full back Zak Hardaker on an anger management course after a student was left with two black eyes and bruising during a violent incident in February. Hardaker was at the centre of a police assault probe into an attack on a 22-year-old man at student flats in Leeds, but was not charged with any offence. Leeds issued a lengthy statement outlining Hardaker's punishment, which will also see him forfeit one month's salary to be donated to a local charity and do up to 20 hours a week of voluntary work for the club's foundation for the duration of his contract. Hardaker and team-mate Elliot Minchella both paid £200 in compensation and wrote a letter of apology to a 22-year-old man following a police investigation but Leeds said Hardaker's punishment is far stronger 'given his previous misconduct'. Leeds Rhinos have sent full back Zak Hardaker (centre with the ball) on an anger management course . The one-cap England international received a five-match ban and a fine for a homophobic comment made last year and was also fined by England for breaching team discipline during the 2013 World Cup. The statement from Leeds read: 'The club has accepted his apology for his actions, however, given his previous misconduct, Zak has realised that it is his actions rather than his words that must now show his intentions to put these events behind him.' It went on: 'We have passed the point of telling him what he has to do, however, for the first time Zak has admitted to us and, more importantly to himself, that he has an issue with aspects of his lifestyle which he wants to improve. 'We have listened to what he has committed to do for himself and we will support him.' Minchella received a written warning and a fine of 50 per cent of his monthly salary, while team-mates Rob Mulhern, Josh Walters and Ash Handley were fined and issued verbal warnings. Police said the student received two black eyes and a bruised neck during the incident. Hardaker received a five-match ban and a fine for a homophobic comment made last year . Leeds Rhinos have today issued the following statement relating to an incident which happened in the city earlier this year that was brought into the public spotlight: . 'The Leeds Rhinos Players Code of Conduct prohibits players from visiting licensed premises after midnight without prior permission from me or the Head Coach. Our investigation has revealed this regulation was breached by five players on a midweek evening before the start of this season. Furthermore Zak Hardaker and Elliot Minchella were involved in an incident at a student accommodation building, which led to a police investigation and a written apology from both players to a student and a £200 compensation payment from Hardaker and Minchella. 'Our internal investigation has now concluded. It has been an exhaustive process and we are always disappointed when players fall below the standards we expect of them and let everyone else down. The players themselves are embarrassed and very apologetic and I am sure it has been a lesson learned for all involved. 'Rob Mulhern, Josh Walters and Ash Handley have each received a fine and a verbal warning. Elliot Minchella has received a written warning and a fine of 50% of his monthly salary. 'With regard to Zak Hardaker, the club has accepted his apology for his actions, however, given his previous misconduct, Zak has realized that it is his actions rather than his words that must now show his intentions to put these events behind him.

"Jenson Button believes McLaren now have their rivals in their sights ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. After starting the new Formula One season in Australia with a severe lack of pace, McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda made significant progress a fortnight later in Malaysia. Although both Button and team-mate Fernando Alonso retired during the race at the Sepang International Circuit, the duo at least discovered the car was competitive alongside other midfield runners. Jenson Button looks on in the garage during final practice for last month's Malaysian Grand Prix . That came as a pleasant surprise to Button, who is now hoping further steps have been taken going into this weekend's race in Shanghai. 'Obviously we want to finish a race, but seeing improvement in pace was much more important,' said Button. 'Yes, we both had failures, but I'd rather that with us pushing and trying to get more power out of the car than trotting around at the back and simply getting to the end. 'To be able to race other cars, and see the Red Bulls until a long way into the race, was good. 'We would probably have been 20 seconds behind them. I know they're not quick, but that is a good step forward for us. Button returns to the McLaren garage after retiring during the race at the Sepang circuit . 'Right now we're comparing ourselves with the Force Indias, Saubers and Lotuses. 'We were quicker than Force India; the Sauber was on the same sort of pace, and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. 'Fighting with the pack is important for me. It's what I enjoy and hopefully race by race we'll start picking them off.' Despite the positives, Button acknowledges the entire team, including Honda, 'still has a long way to go'. British driver Button in action before he retired from the Malaysian Grand Prix . Button added: 'We need and want more downforce to fight with the guys around us, and we still have a lot to do with the power unit, but our basic car is good. 'If you look at our high-speed pace, compared to the Force India and Sauber, then we are much stronger. 'So we're moving in the right direction, and I'm already surprised we are racing cars. It's great to see.' Part of the reasoning behind McLaren's improvement in Malaysia, in comparison to Australia, was the high temperatures which suited the car. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso (left) drives ahead of team-mate Button in Kuala Lumpur . Button appreciates the cooler air in Shanghai could have an effect. The 35-year-old said: 'There is a feeling the expected cooler weather will make it harder to generate tyre temperature. 'That could mean any progress we make doesn't necessarily translate to a lap-time benefit. 'But there is definitely progress being made, and it's great to be able to play a role in helping move the whole team forwards. 'It'll be fascinating to see how much change we can effect over the forthcoming races.'","Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso both retired in Malaysia last month .

"A man accused of chopping up his friend's body and dumping his severed head in an apartment block's recycling bin had previously started a bloody fight at his gym, it has emerged. Carlos Colina, 32, is being held on $1 million bail after pleading not guilty to aggravated assault and battery and improper disposal of a human body in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday. The remains of Jonathan Camilien, 26, including a torso and limbs, were found in a duffel bag near the campus of Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Saturday morning before his head was found in Colina's apartment building across the street, according to the police report. Now the Boston Herald has unearthed police reports and witness accounts showing Colina had intimidated fellow gym users and even fought them before being thrown out. Accused: Carlos Colina is pictured at his arraignment in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday after human body parts were discovered in a duffel bag and a head was found in his building's recycling bin . Colina previously worked out at the Cambridge Athletic Club but was kicked out following a fight over gym equipment on November 24. A witness told the Herald how Colina started punching a much smaller man all over his body as the man unsuccessfully tried to fight back. He suffered bloody cuts to his head, the witness said. 'The trainers broke the fight up,' he said. 'Carlos gets up and starts walking away, yelling, ""I'm a beast! I'm a beast!’ like he was proud of himself.' The victim suffered broken ribs in the attack, WHDH reported. Colina has an outstanding assault and battery case pending against him from the fight. The witness said that before the November incident, Colina stood and glared at other gym users if they were using gym equipment he wanted. 'Intimidating': Colina, pictured in photos he posted to Facebook, also has an outstanding assault and battery case pending against him after he allegedly attacked a fellow gym user last November . 'Threats': A witness said Colina had also intimidated other gym users when he wanted to use equipment . Colina is believed to have known his alleged victim; he is friends with his younger brother, Christopher Camilien, on Facebook. The two brothers lived together in Somerville. Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said Camilien's death is considered a homicide, even though Colina has not been charged with murder. She said analysis of evidence and more information from the medical examiner are needed to determine if additional charges are warranted. 'We are not seeking anyone else in connection with the discovery of these human remains,' she said. No motive has been released. Colina and Camilien were last seen returning to the building just after 11pm on Friday, according to the investigation, and a neighbor reported hearing an argument coming from the apartment. Colina was seen in surveillance video from nearby Biogen offices exiting the apartment building at about 4.15am on Saturday carrying a duffel bag, authorities said. Scene: A vacuum could be heard inside his building, pictured, after police discovered the victim's head . Probe: Police stand by where the remains of Jonathan Camilien were discovered in Cambridge on Saturday . He returned to the apartment building empty handed. A saw, rope and cleaning supplies were found in Colina's apartment, which is located one block from the Cambridge Police Department. He also had wounds on his face and neck and a vacuum could be heard during the search when police discovered the victim's head, according to theBoston Globe. Defense attorney John Cunha Jr. called it a sensational case. 'Obviously the circumstances of the case are sensational enough,' he said. 'I'm not going to exacerbate it.' A pretrial hearing has been scheduled for April 14.","Carlos Colina, 32, pleaded not guilty to assault and improper disposal of a human body on Monday after the remains were found near his building .

"In the search for meaning and importance, the FA Cup might have found its saviour. Enter Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers, a club and manager not just popping into the party to say a polite hello and a quick goodbye. Tonight, against Blackburn at Ewood Park, Rodgers faces one of those defining moments in a season that has not lacked them. His only hope must be that this time it doesn't go so horribly wrong. So far it has been a theme of the campaign that when the need was greatest, so too have been the disappointments. He loaded for duck on a bear hunt in the Champions League against Real Madrid and lost. He wanted to save his best resources for Chelsea and lost that game, too. Kolo Toure found the net in Liverpool's FA Cup clash with Blackburn but his effort was ruled out . Blackburn salute their fans at Anfield after earning a Sixth Round replay at home to the Premier League side . When the European portion of their season fizzled out, first in the big show and then in the Europa League, the Premier League offered an opportunity. Getting into the top-four without Luis Suarez and often in the absence of Daniel Sturridge would be an immense achievement. Having started the season so badly and recovered so impressively, it became a real possibility. Then two huge games - Manchester United and Arsenal. A chance. Steven Gerrard lost his mind, the defence lost the plot and Liverpool lost by a combined total of 6-2 across the two games. A top-four place is virtually gone, unless anyone can conceivably see them making up seven points and a massive goal difference on Manchester City. Suddenly, the romance of the FA Cup is a little more two-sided. They need it badly. Steven Gerrard's birthday falls on May 30, the same day as the FA Cup final at Wembley . The FA Cup represents Liverpool's last chance of silverware after a disappointing season . 'I don't want to go down the route of saying that it saves our season,' said Rodgers before the replay of their quarter-final against Blackburn. 'Our objective at the start, though, was to win a trophy. 'So I think if we didn't get in the top four and we didn't have a trophy this year, we would be disappointed. I think certainly the FA Cup would give us a great boost as a team with lots of young players and players coming into the club. 'That's the expectancy we want. We want to be able to be challenging every year. 'That was the key thing for me, to get the group challenging at the top end of the league and for trophies. The FA Cup would mark a good step forward for us.' The need for trophies has been a dominant theme since Rodgers took over at Liverpool and made them contenders again. There is no denying the steps he has taken with the club and very little to suggest he is anything other than one of the sharpest managerial minds working in this country. Daniel Sturridge will be crucial to Liverpool's chances of reaching the FA Cup semi-final . Glen Johnson is in good spirits in training ahead of Liverpool's trip to Ewood Park on Wednesday . But how he will be tested if this season ends without either a top-four place or a trophy. Raheem Sterling rather helpfully alluded to the need for the latter recently. That tricky contract situation has not gone away and it is less likely to have a happy ending for Liverpool if they can't present a silver argument to Sterling in the summer. The same goes for potential new arrivals. Rodgers can talk magnificently and persuasively but his sales pitches to leading players would be enhanced immeasurably if he could talk about current achievements. Something shiny and tangible and recently acquired would help. It's a tough ask. They face Blackburn with a defence looking as woefully shaky as it did at the start of the season. Without Martin Skrtel and Emre Can tonight that defence could be vulnerable again. Steven Gerrard is also missing. Not ideal, though not necessarily a tremendous setback against a Championship side. In any case, Liverpool and Rodgers need to find a way through. It has been three years since they last won a trophy – under Kenny Dalglish - and the FA Cup is a chance to stop the clock. It's a defining moment that must not end in another failure. Liverpool have not won a trophy since they beat Cardiff to win the Carling Cup three years ago . Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool, November 4 . Finally back on the grandest stage, but Rodgers opted for a watered down XI. Dejan Lovren, Steven Gerrard, Raheem Stirling, Jordan Henderson, Philippe Coutinho and Mario Balotelli played all previous Champions League matches but none of them started. The aim, it appeared, was to prioritise the following league game. Karim Benzema celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Liverpool at the Bernabeu . Liverpool 1-2 Chelsea, November 8 . It was time to vindicate the gamble in Madrid, which was widely criticised. Rodgers made seven changes to the side that lost in the Champions League and Emre Can put them ahead. But Chelsea won 2-1, leaving Liverpool eighth in the Premier League. Having rested a host of players in Madrid, Brendan Rodgers' side then lost a crunch league game to Chelsea . Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool, January 27 . After drawing the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final, Liverpool blew a host of chances and fell to a stoppage-time winner. A big opportunity missed. The Stamford Bridge also knocked Liverpool out of the Capital One Cup following a 1-0 win at home . Besiktas 1-0 Liverpool, February 26 . Ten years after their Champions League miracle in Istanbul, Liverpool returned to face Besiktas in the Europa League last 32. They held a 1-0 first-leg lead. It went horribly wrong and they lost on penalties. 'Unfortunately, on this occasion, Istanbul is not a happy place,' said Rodgers . Demba Ba celebrates after Dejan Lovren missed the crucial penalty in the shoot-out against Besiktas . Arsenal 4-1 Liverpool, April 4 . Liverpool's last real shot at getting into the top four and it fell apart spectacularly. Raheem Sterling's unauthorised interview hardly helped matters in the build-up and the game was a disaster. They were 3-0 down at half-time and ultimately repeated the kind of defensive inadequacies that hurt them earlier in the campaign. A huge anti-climax.

"Arsenal have been here before. Manchester City sniffing around with their millions, looking to prize away some of Arsene Wenger's finest talent. Jack Wilshere is the latest man linked with a switch to the Etihad Stadium, where he would follow the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Samir Nasri who swapped London for the North-West as City stormed towards Premier League and FA Cup glory. But times have changed. The Gunners are now ahead of City in the table and appear to be a club on the up, while the men from Manchester must rebuild. And if £30million or more is truly on the table for Wilshere, Arsenal must consider it. Manchester CIty are considering making a move for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere this summer . Wilshere hasn't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against Manchester United in November . Alexis Sanchez cost Arsenal £30m, while Chelsea splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in Diego Costa. Those two forwards have a combined total of 33 league goals this season. And for all Wilshere's many talents, he would not be a game changer for Manuel Pellegrini, or whoever City's manager may be next season. He was touted as a future Arsenal and England midfielder when he burst onto the scene, showing the world what he can do in a Champions League tie against Barcelona, and possesses a technical ability which wouldn't see him out of place at the Nou Camp. His quick movement, superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp, driving style of play manager Wenger likes at the Emirates Stadium, as Wilshere's goal of the season against Norwich last season perfectly demonstrated. He has been doubted on several occasions, partly because of his lifestyle off the pitch, in the most part because of his treacherous injury record at the age of 23. The midfielder has picked up a total of 24 knocks during his seven-year professional career. He was tipped as a future Arsenal star and England international when he broke through the ranks in 2008 . Wilshere is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career . But even as recently as this season, Wilshere was hitting form before going off against Manchester United. He was certainly more impressive than Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla in the Arsenal midfield, and impressed for England in a deep-lying role. There now seems to be little space for the Stevenage-born schemer to fit in this starting XI. Ramsey, Cazorla, Sanchez, Francis Coquelin, and Mesut Ozil played behind Olivier Giroud in the recent thumping victory over Liverpool, and that's without the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck involved. Of course, the ideal state of play would be for Wenger to build a team around Wilshere, a man who is signed on for three more years, and not to consider any bids from divisional rivals at least. But Arsenal would be foolish to dismiss anything over £30m in today's market, especially considering the kind of players Wenger can now attract to the club. Wilshere impressed in a holding role for England in an international friendly against Scotland last year . He was in form before ankle surgery, scoring a fine goal against Manchester City in September . The midfielder fired past Brad Guzan to score the opening goal against Aston Villa last season . Wilshere's effort against Norwich was voted the 2013-14 Premier League Goal of the Season . Arsenal's relationship with City, who the club have never held a firm rivalry with, could also play a part. Any interest from fellow top-four clubs Chelsea or Manchester United would probably be dismissed immediately. The current Premier League champions are looking to rebuild under Sheik Mansour and need homegrown, young players to freshen up an ageing side. Wilshere is seen as a possibility along with Jordan Henderson in midfield. Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba have also been linked with a summer transfer, with Nasri and Yaya Toure among many names who could leave. But with Liverpool set to hand Henderson the captain's armband after Steven Gerrard's departure, his stay would seem more likely despite his contract running down at Anfield. Arsenal fans would hate to see Wilshere go and he encapsulates the style at the Emirates. However, for a man who has scored five goals in his league career, and one who would not neccessarily push on close rivals to better things, it may be worth thinking about. Jordan Henderson is also a possibility for Manchester City as the club look for homegrown youngsters .","Manchester City considering bid for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere .
Jordan Henderson is also an option for the Premier League champions .

But the England international is not necessarily a first-team regular .

"The Manchester derby is now one of the biggest match-ups in world football. Millions across the globe cram around TV screens to catch a glimpse of the fixture, and its appeal gets ever greater with each passing season. But just how Manchester is the clash between City and United? Sportsmail takes a look at everything local between the two giants. Sergio Aguero and Manchester City travel to Old Trafford to face United on Sunday afternoon . Owners . You will not find many United fans who pine for the days when Martin Edwards, son of a Salford butcher, ruled the roost at Old Trafford. Despite being the man who brought Sir Alex Ferguson to the club and backed him when many wanted him sacked, former chairman Edwards (who was later cautioned after a peeping tom episode in a ladies toilet) remained a figure of distrust. Likewise, there will not be many City supporters who look back fondly on the chaotic era of hometown former TV salesman and combover king Peter Swales, who often came across as out of tune with reality (if you get a chance watch the hilariously belief-defying City! documentary on YouTube), as he went through manager after manager after manager. Peter Swailes was local, but not many Manchester City fans want to be reminded of his chairmanship . Not many United fans pine for the days when Martin Edwards, son of a Salford butcher, ruled the roost . Sheikh Mansour might not be local but is a hugely popular figure at Manchester City after bankrolling the club . Avram (left) and Joel Glazer have proved divisive figures at United since their family bought the club . At Old Trafford, there remains a resentment for those upstairs. That the owners are from Tampa and not Timperley, however, is irrelevant. The Glazer family could be from Timbuktu - their cash-draining tenure is still hard to take even though the yellow and green scarves are not as easy to spot. Across town, however, the sheikh who shook it up for the Blues is a hero. Is there a more popular owner in football? While City fans may no longer (thankfully) pay homage by wearing Arabic robes or waving £20 notes in the air, the man from Abu Dhabi is adored. Managers . It has always been rare to find a football club with a hometown manager. However, you do get the sense that both Louis van Gaal and Manuel Pellegrini do their best to familairise themselves with their environment. Van Gaal has taken a lot of local knowledge from Ryan Giggs. More than once the Dutchman has asked the son of Salford (via Cardiff) to speak to the players about the opposition and tell them exactly what victory would mean to the supporters. Giggs, a fierce Red, is said to have come into his own when Liverpool were next up. Louis van Gaal has tried to immerse himself in the local culture after taking over as manager last summer . Van Gaal has leaned on assistant boss Ryan Giggs for tips around the city during his stint in charge . Manuel Pellegrini has been keen to familiarise himself with Manchester over the last two years . Manager Pellegrini with chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (left) over in Abu Dhabi last May . Van Gaal, who originally stationed himself at a city centre hotel, frequented many of the city's finest eating establishments and knows his way around town. While you won't see Pellegrini supping a pint of mild next to the bronze statue of LS Lowry in city centre backstreet boozer Sam's Chop House, the Chilean has also been quick to immerse himself in local culture. Not too long after his arrival he was spotted in a Hale picture shop, having maps of the local area framed for his walls. However, when this reporter once asked him if he had been anywhere nice during his time off the answer of 'York' was not what was expected. Coaches . The aforementioned Giggs, as assistant manager, gives the coaching staff at Old Trafford a homegrown element. Brian Kidd (right, at Crystal Palace on Monday) is Manchester through and through . Kidd is more Mancunian than Happy Mondays dancer Bez drinking a can of Boddingtons in the rain . Unless Tyler Blackett makes a comeback for United there won't be any local lads in the two XIs . Aside from the local lad, the only things missing from Carrington are a windmill and some tulips with Dutch quintet Frans Hoek, Albert Stuivenberg, Marcel Bout, Jos van Dijk and Max Reckers key players. It is a similar situation at City with Brian Kidd, more Mancunian than Bez drinking a can of Boddingtons in the rain, co-assistant manager alongside a number of the boss's trusted lieutenants. Fiery Argentinian Ruben Cousillas splits responsibilities with Kidd while goalkeeping coach Xabier Mancisidor and Jose Cabello, both Spaniards, complete the Latin look. Players . Both clubs pride themselves on bringing through their own products. However, when Sir Alex arrived at Old Trafford he was disgusted to learn that City scooped the cream of Manchester's talent and quickly (and successfully) set about putting that right. A generation such as the Class of '92 is unlikely to be seen again, but the derby could see no Mancunians in either squad for the second time in a row. For three years, after the departure of Wes Brown to Sunderland, Danny Welbeck flew the Manchester flag. But following the Longsight lad's move to Arsenal, November's first instalment at the Etihad Stadium saw not one hometown native in either squad for the first time in living memory. Sir Alex Ferguson was disgusted that City's youth academy was more profitable on arrival at United . Along with Ferguson, Eric Harrison (left) brought through the Class of 92, to include Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Terry Cooke . Wayne Rooney was only born 30 miles down the road but he may as well be from another planet as far as many from this neck of the woods are concerned. There will be Italians, Argentines, Spaniards, Ivorians and maybe even a Colombian, but unless Tyler Blackett can stun the football world and force his way into Van Gaal's line-up, it will be a Manc-free derby. Fans . Interest in the derby will be spread all over the world. United like to remind us of their 659m global followers while City, according to a recent club-commissioned report, have a fanbase that is rapidly expanding across the planet. Outside Old Trafford, street vendors will attempt to flog half-and-half scarves. Some of the tourists may even buy them. Manchester City fans are derided by their rivals for the amount of 'empty seats' at the Etihad Stadium . Regardless, nowhere will victory be celebrated with as much vigour and defeat taken with as much bitterness as in Manchester. No United fans from Manchester? City fans all from Stockport? Nonsense. Ask any Red or Blue if they fancy going into work on Monday after a derby loss and they will give you the same answer. While City fans may serenade their hosts with 'You're the pride of Singapore' and United supporters respond in kind with jibes about empty seats at 'the council house' both know that this is a city divided by football loyalties.","Manchester United host bitter rivals City on Sunday afternoon .

"Are these the kits that Manchester United fans will hope lead them to a prosperous 2015-16 campaign? Supposed images of the club's home, away and third strips for next season have leaked on to the internet, which is bound to excite many an United supporter. Last summer the Old Trafford outfit announced that they had signed a £750million deal with Sportwear giant adidas to make their kits for 10 years starting from the 2015-16 campaign. Supposed leaked images of Manchester United's (left) new adidas kit for next season have been  online .

The German brand follow Nike who had been supplying United for 13 years ith the 20-times English champions.

United's rumoured home strip for next season has done the rounds for a while but it is the designs of the away and third kit that will catch the eye. The Red Devils' second strip is predominately white with the iconic three adidas stripes running down the sleeves in Manchester United red and accompanied with a V-neck collar in the same colour. The away jersey is reported to be complemented with black and red shorts and white socks. United's third kit for next season differs from this year's ensemble too with blue replaced for black.

But rather than Arsenal, it now seems Liverpool hold the main Premier League interest in the 22-year-old. So, what more do you need to know? Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia is a Liverpool target and has also interested Arsenal in recent years . 22? He's been around for a while... Despite his young age, Kondogbia has amassed over 100 league appearances for Lens, Monaco, and even Sevilla. And during that five-year professional career, the central midfielder has been constantly watched by Arsenal scouts. He also impressed at the FIFA Under-20 World Cup alongside Paul Pogba in the French midfield, while his frame and playing style doesn't exactly scream 22 years old. Kondogbia is only 22 but has racked up over 100 league appearances with Lens (above), Sevilla and Monaco . The central midfielder was a key player for France alongside Paul Pogba at the Under 20 World Cup in 2013 . Tough guy then? Exactly. Standing at 6'2"", Kondogbia is a real presence in the Monaco midfield, allowing the likes of Joao Moutinho to strut their stuff further forward. He's strong in the tackle, but make no mistake, his prowess on the ball is also impressive. Possessing a fine left foot, Kondogbia doubles up as a playmaker, and also scored the first goal in the tie in the first leg against Arsenal. Having made his mark in both Ligue 1 and La Liga, you could say the Frenchman is the perfectly well-rounded midfielder, someone who would fit in seamlessly in the Premier League... Kondogbia's fine strike put Monaco in front against Arsenal in the Champions League last-16 first leg . So why haven't we seen him in England? Time is still on Kondogbia's side, but Premier League clubs have certainly tried. Arsenal were heavily linked with him before he left Sevilla, though the versatile player bought out his contract and opted for Monaco. With Liverpool crying out for players to freshen up an ageing/departing spine, the 22-year-old's presence would surely suit Brendan Rodgers. But he must move quick, with Real Madrid, Manchester United, Juventus and Paris St Germain all keen to sign the man who has been capped three times by his national team. Mesut Ozil swapped shirts with Kondogbia at half-time in the second leg at the Stade Louis II .","Geoffrey Kondogbia impressed against Arsenal in the Champions League .

"Wisden, the cricket bible, has launched a stinging attack on English cricket and says that the national team have lost touch with the game's public. Editor Lawrence Booth, also a respected cricket writer with Sportsmail, uses his notes to take England to task after a tumultuous year spent trying to recover from the bitter fall-out of losing the last Ashes series 5-0. English cricket, says Booth in the 152nd edition of the fabled Almanack, which is published on Wednesday, 'repeatedly lost touch with the basic idea that the national team belongs to us all'. Wisden editor Lawrence Booth has launched a stinging attack on the ECB's handling of Kevin Pietersen . The star batsman will ply his trade for Surrey in a bid to reclaim his spot in the England Test team . And he continues: 'A few wins might have deflected attention from a charge sheet that would include the mishandling of the Kevin Pietersen affair, worrying Test attendances outside London, a head in the sand attitude to the one-day team and - not yet a decade after the 2005 Ashes had presented English cricket with a golden chance to attract a new generation to the sport – a fall in the number of recreational players. 'Starting with the drubbing in Australia, England lost eight full series out of all across the formats in 2014, to say nothing of their defeat by the Netherlands at the World Twenty20. In all, they lost 28 games. Only once had this been surpassed in a calendar year by one of the eight major teams – the dysfunctional 2010 Pakistanis. 'National selector James Whitaker had called Cook ""our exceptional leader""; Paul Downton, the ECB's new managing director, hailed Peter Moores as the ""outstanding coach of his generation"". It was a nexus of self-preservation yet, as the wagons circled, the wheels kept threatening to fall off.' The Wisden editor is just as scathing about England's decision to sack Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the drink of what turned out to be the most disastrous World Cup in England's history. Peter Moores presided over a disastrous World Cup but was labelled 'the outstanding coach of his generation' by the ECB's new managing director Paul Downton . The beleaguered Alastair Cook was stripped of the one-day captaincy before the World Cup debacle . 'To leave the sacking of Cook so late made little sense,' says Booth. 'Had he stepped down in August after the 3-1 Test win over India he could have done so with his post-Ashes reputation partly restored. This would have allowed him to gather strength for the ludicrous run of 17 Tests in less than 10 months, starting in Great Optimism in Antigua in April 2015 and ending in Near Exhaustion in South Africa in January 2016. (As someone pointed out, 17 Tests are almost a third of Don Bradman's career.) 'Trouble was, Cook had become more than just a cricketer: cast by his employers in the role of latter-day saint to Pietersen's fallen angel, he was now an article of faith. Giles Clarke (the ECB chairman) even suggested the Cooks were ""very much the sort of people we want the England captain and his family to be"" which was all well and good but couldn't stop him edging behind. Downton, Whitaker and Moores were all bound up with his fate. Cook had to succeed, as much for others as himself. It was an intolerable position. 'England overplayed their hand. The Test win over a supine India did not mean Cook would effect a similar transformation of the one-day side. This seemed obvious to everyone – except to the men who run the game.' But Booth, who also writes for Sportsmail, says Cook's eventual sacking so late made little sense . National selector James Whitaker (right) had called Cook 'our exceptional leader' Pietersen appeared on the Graham Norton Show - the presenter suggested 'team sport's not for you' England also come under attack for the way they handled the sacking of Pietersen, a situation where they had right on their side - plus the support of the bulk of those who follow the team around professionally - but somehow allowed the maverick to claim the morale high ground. A situation that, incredibly, is still going on, after Wisden went to press on this year's edition. 'The ECB's comments on the fall-out with Pietersen should have been clear and concise,' writes Booth. 'If you're widely regarded as a pain it helps if you're scoring lots more runs than anyone else. Instead, England botched the PR battle. They hinted that some darker truth about his behaviour would emerge once a confidentiality agreement expired in October. Yet the lull merely prolonged the fiasco. And, when the dirt failed to materialise, the ECB looked rudderless. Worse, in the eyes of those agitating for an explanation, they looked indifferent. 'It was typical of a story beyond ECB's control that their best moment was not of their own making. Having searched in vain for the words that justified his sacking, they were gifted a 324-page solution, an autobiography so full of rancour that BBC chat-show host Graham Norton suggested to Pietersen: ""Maybe, just maybe, team sport's not for you."" This year's Wisden also includes both a withering review of Pietersen's nasty book by the Mail on Sunday's Patrick Collins, who retired this year after a distinguished career, and an excellent piece of the aspect of his career totally overlooked by Pietersen in his book – batting that touched genius. Simon Hughes admirably fills the void that Pietersen left himself. Gary Ballance has been named one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year in the new edition . Ballance's Yorkshire team-mate Adam Lyth, called up by England, is also in the top five . Jeetan Patel (left) and Angelo Mathews make up the remainder of Booth's top five cricketers . Sri Lanka's brilliant Kumar Sangakkara clinched the title of leading cricketer in the world . Australia's Meg Lanning (batting against England) is honoured with the inaugural women's award . The thousands of disciples of Wisden always look immediately at who the editor has chosen as his five cricketers of the year, one of the oldest and most highly regarded prizes in sport. Booth has chosen well and predictably in the cases of Moeen Ali, who has the honour of being pictured on the front cover, Gary Ballance, Adam Lyth and Angelo Mathews and enterprisingly in Jeetan Patel, who is rewarded for his prolific season for Warwickshire. To me, the award suffers in that players are only allowed to be picked once. For instance, how good would it be if, on his retirement, a player would be described as a five-time Wisden cricketer of the year? Booth is a progressive, brilliant, imaginative editor but perhaps such a move would be just a little too controversial for such a traditional vehicle as Wisden. The brilliant Kumar Sangakkara, who will be delighting championship audiences with Surrey this summer, is the leading cricketer in the world while, for the first time, there is an international woman cricketer of the year. Australia's Meg Lanning is honoured with the inaugural women's award. As ever, Wisden is a must for any cricket fan and even at a time of continuing turmoil for the England team and genuine concerns about cricket's future world-wise, it is a reassuring presence however critical the editor is of it. Moeen Ali (England and Worcestershire) England’s search for a spin bowler to replace Graeme Swann was thought to be doomed – until Moeen Ali lit up the summer with 12 wickets in the Southampton and Manchester Tests against India. He finished the series with 19 at 23 apiece. Earlier in the season he had almost saved the Headingley Test against Sri Lanka, batting for all bar one ball of the final day. And, when he was promoted to open for the one-day side, he scored the third-fastest hundred by an England batsman, from 72 balls against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Moeen Ali celebrates taking the wicket of India's Cheteshwar Pujara at Old Trafford last summer . Gary Ballance (England and Yorkshire) Gary Ballance began the summer with a century in his first home Test, against Sri Lanka at Lord’s, and followed up with two more against India – at Lord’s and Southampton. By the end of the season he boasted a Test average of over 60. Gary Ballance celebrates reaching his century during the third test with India in Southampton last year . Adam Lyth (England and Yorkshire) Yorkshire opening batsman Adam Lyth was the leading run-scorer in the County Championship, with 1,489 runs at an average of 67 and six hundreds, and was one of the pillars of his team’s triumph. He was rewarded with a place on England’s tour of the Caribbean in April 2015. Yorkshire's Adam Lyth was the leading run-scorer in the 2014 County Championship season . Angelo Mathews (Sri Lanka) Angelo Mathews was the inspiration behind Sri Lanka’s first Test series victory in England. After helping to save the First Test at Lord’s with a century, he made 160 – and took four wickets – as Sri Lanka came from behind to win in Leeds. Mathews also led his team to wins in the one-day series and the one-off Twenty20 international. Angelo Mathews after making 160 for Sri Lanka in the second Test with England at Headingley . Jeetan Patel (New Zealand and Warwickshire) New Zealand off-spinner Jeetan Patel was central to Warwickshire’s success across all three formats. He claimed 107 victims in total, more than anyone in the country, and his 25 wickets in the NatWest T20 Blast – the most in the competition – helped his side lift the trophy on home turf at Edgbaston. Jeetan Patel takes the final wicket as Warwickshire beat Middlesex in last year's County Championship .","Wisden editor Lawrence Booth launched an attack on English cricket .

"Big-hearted Ipswich Town left back Tyrone Mings has seemingly paid off his mother's debts in his latest act of generosity. The 22-year-old posted a text message conversation between him and his mother on his Instagram account. His mother thanked him for wiping 'all my debt away for the first time ever in my life', adding that 'my worries have all gone.' Tyrone Mings has seemingly paid off his mother's debts in an act of generosity . Mings posted a screengrab of a text message conversation on his Instagram account . Mings replied two minutes later: 'Aww mumma you deserve every penny. Thankyou for all the years of hard work' before adding 'And that's just the start.' Alongside the screengrab, Mings wrote: 'This is why I do it, this makes worth it [sic]' His apparent act of generosity drew over 2,000 'likes' and lots of praise from his followers, with many saying he was a role model that children should look up to. An Ipswich spokesman said the post was 'a private matter between Tyrone and his mum.' It is not the first time that Mings has acted out of the kindness of his heart. Left-back Mings has been a key player in Ipswich Town's push for promotion this season . Mings has been linked with a move to Premier League side Arsenal following impressive performances . In March 2013, he gave Tris Monk two tickets for an Ipswich game after the fan tweeted that he was 'skint'. The father-of-two from Haverhill was saving for a new house and couldn't afford to go to the match. And in July 2014, Mings bought new replica shirts for two supporters after his squad number changed from 15 to 3 after they had already purchased them. Mings arrived at Portman Road in 2013 from non-league Chippenham Town and has developed to become an integral part of an Ipswich side that is pushing for the Championship play-offs this season. In January, he was linked with a move to Premier League giants Arsenal.","Left back posted screenshot of text message conversation on Instagram .

"Louis van Gaal believes Manchester United will hit the ground running in their attempt to win the Barclays Premier League next season after persuading the Old Trafford hierarchy to agree to a short and sharp pre-season tour of America in July. After last summer’s mammoth trek across the United States, an angry United manager Van Gaal vowed that it would never happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started. Now Sportsmail can reveal that Van Gaal and United have turned down offers from Asia and Australia and are about to sign off a visit to America – in all likelihood to the west coast. The trip will last in the region of 12 days – a whole week shorter than last summer - and will be over by August 1. Manchester United beat Real Madrid in Michigan last summer in front of 109,000 fans . United played four games in America last pre-season, here Wayne Rooney scores against LA Galaxy . United beat Liverpool in the final to win the International Champions Cup last summer . While rivals such as Manchester City are trekking around Australia, Van Gaal and his United players will operate out of one base in America and travel to their games from there. The club have agreed once again to rake part in the International Champions Cup that they won last summer by beating Liverpool in a final in Miami. The tournament is played all over America but this time the promoters have essentially allowed United to choose their own venues as they are so desperate to have England’s most famous club in it. Details of the competition were supposed to be announced last week with United given a provisional deadline to commit to their schedule by last Friday. However, the announcement has been put on hold while Van Gaal and United tweak final details. Last season, Van Gaal joined United after the World Cup in Brazil to find the club committed to a two-and-half week marathon comprising visits to Los Angeles, Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and, finally, Miami. Rooney scored another spectacular goal for United against Aston Villa last weekend . Following their tour of America, United suffered a slow start but are now firing on all cylinders in the league . The Dutch veteran was furious at the itinerary that he felt asked too much of his players as they were constantly asked to fly in to different time zones and even play at altitude in Colorado. Having to then play the final in Florida during a thunderstorm was the final straw. For long periods of this winter’s negotiations, Van Gaal and United seemed set to commit to a schedule on America’s East Coast. It is understand, however, that Van Gaal has recently performed a volte face and expressed a preference for the more agreeable climates of the west. Van Gaal has insisted this time that his team will travel to match venues from one base and will have no repeat of the arduous treks endured to games in Pasadena and Ann Arbor last year. One possible base is the Seattle Seahawks training camp on America’s north-west coast. The Premier League season starts early this year, with the competition kicking off on August 8.","Manchester United will embark on a short tour of America this summer .

"England suffered an injury scare at the start of their practice 'match' here in St Kitts when Stuart Broad dramatically slipped in his delivery stride and was left clutching his ankle on the floor. Broad had complained about the state of the crease, which was damp after overnight rain, after bowling just three balls of his first over of the day at Warner Park. The groundsmen placed sand on the crease but from the very next delivery Broad slipped and went crashing to the ground, a blow which necessitated lengthy treatment before he left the field.

England attempted to make the most of a bad lot when they loaned Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Jonny Bairstow to their opponents to give them additional practice. But the move backfired for Trott who edged Jimmy Anderson to third slip off just the third ball of the day and departed for a duck to follow the 72 he made on his return to England colours on Monday.

"As well as moving Aston Villa up one place in the Premier League table on Tuesday night, Christian Benteke's hat-trick against QPR was also a triumph for the top-flight's Belgian contingent. The 24-year-old's treble accounted for the 46th, 47th and 48th goals scored by players from Belgium this season, making them the third most prolific nation in the division. Benteke's goals - which arrived in a memorable 3-3 draw at Villa Park - moved Belgium above France (46 goals) and within 19 of second-placed Spain (67 goals). Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke celebrates after scoring his third goal against QPR on Tuesday . Benteke's hat-trick earned Villa a point and moved Belgium into third place for Premier League goals this term .

Belgium's total has been aided by the form of Chelsea's Eden Hazard, who has struck 12 times in the Premier League to help Jose Mourinho's men to the top of the table. Tottenham winger Nacer Chadli and Everton striker Romelu Lukaku - both of whom are international team-mates of Benteke and Hazard - have also chipped in with eight goals apiece, while Kevin Mirallas, Marouane Fellaini, Mousa Dembele and Toby Alderweireld have also been on target. Spain have the likes of Chelsea's Diego Costa (19 goals) and Manchester City playmaker David Silva (11 goals) to thank for their tally, although they still sit miles behind runaway leaders England. Diego Costa scores one of the 67 goals scored by players with Spanish nationality against Southampton . Manchester City midfielder David Silva has netted 11 top-flight goals so far this season . A total of 255 goals have been scored by 81 different English players during the current campaign, with Tottenham's latest hero Harry Kane (19) and QPR hitman Charlie Austin (17) leading the way. Three Lions captain Wayne Rooney and Under 21 star Saido Berahino have both netted 12 goals this season, with Liverpool trio Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling pitching in with six goals each. France sit fourth on the list, boosted by 14 goals from Arsenal forward Olivier Giroud and five each from Swansea's Bafetimbi Gomis and Chelsea striker Loic Remy.

"Money will not play a major part in Pep Guardiola's contract discussions with Bayern Munich, according to board member Jan-Christian Dreesen. The former Barcelona boss, who led Bayern to the Bundesliga title and German Cup in his first season in charge, has a contract which expires in the summer of 2016. Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge revealed earlier this year that negotiations over a new deal will take place this summer as Bayern look to extend Guardiola's stay at the Allianz Arena.

"Robin van Persie has declared himself fit for Sunday's Manchester derby. Van Persie has missed Manchester United's last six games following an ankle injury he suffered in the 2-1 defeat at Swansea on February 21. Manager Louis van Gaal said last week he did not expect the striker to be fit enough to return for Sunday's game against Manchester City at Old Trafford, but Van Persie reported good news for United fans on Wednesday. Robin van Persie has declared himself fit for the Manchester derby after missing United's last six games . Louis van Gaal will be pleased to have Van Persie back but he is unlikely to start the game . The 31-year-old tweeted: 'Back to training with the group today. Was a great session. Happy to be fit and able to play again. Looking forward to my next game!' Even if Van Gaal considers Van Persie to be fit to take part in the derby, it is hard to see how the former Arsenal front man would fit into the starting XI. United have hardly missed the Dutchman, who has scored just 10 goals this term. During his absence, the Red Devils have only lost once - against his former employers Arsenal in the FA Cup. United have recorded creditable victories over Tottenham and Liverpool and last Saturday they moved above City into third with a 3-1 win over Aston Villa. Wayne Rooney scored a stunning volley during the win. The United skipper has performed well up front in a 4-3-3 formation alongside Ashley Young and Juan Mata, who scored both goals in the 2-1 win at Anfield two-and-a-half weeks ago. Marouane Fellaini has also provided able and robust support from midfield. Wayne Rooney celebrates with Radamel Falcao after scoring against Aston Villa at the weekend . Victory for United this weekend would pile more misery on out-of-form City and improve Van Gaal's chances of achieving his target of Champions League qualification. Once he returns from his summer break, he is likely to take United on a shortened pre-season tour, with the most likely destination the United States, it has emerged. Van Gaal made no secret of his annoyance at United's pre-season schedule last summer. United had already committed themselves to a three-week long tour that took in five matches across five American cities by the time Van Gaal took over as manager. United travelled almost 13,500 miles on the trip, which included games in Los Angeles, Denver, Detroit, Washington DC and Miami - all against high-profile opposition. This summer's tour is expected to see United take on fewer opponents and undertake less travel. The trip will have to be over a shorter period of time too as the Premier League season begins on August 8 - just eight weeks after the end of the international break. It is understood that Van Gaal will sign off plans for the tour in the coming weeks.","Manchester United have Robin van Persie back fit for Sunday .

"It's been a good couple of weeks for Ander Herrera and Juan Mata, so you'd forgive the Spanish duo for taking some time off to enjoy the Manchester sunshine on Wednesday. The pair have been in scintillating form in recent games with both bagging braces in Manchester United's last two victories.

Fabregas suffered the break during Chelsea's win over Stoke City on Saturday, taking a hit to the face from Charlie Adam's forearm minutes before the Scot struck a 66-yard wondergoal at Stamford Bridge. The Spaniard has since travelled to Milan to see a specialist, who produced masks for Fernando Torres, Petr Cech and Demba Ba previously, in the hope of returning to action as soon as possible.

"Senad Lulic scored a late goal to give Lazio a 1-0 win at Napoli which sent them into the Coppa Italia final and added to Rafael Benitez's problems on Wednesday. Holders Napoli went into the match as favourites after drawing 1-1 away in the first leg of the semi-final but were knocked out after a familiar tale of missed chances and poor defending. Napoli coach Benitez was under pressure after his side slipped from third to sixth in Serie A, leaving their Champions League qualification hopes in tatters, and retaining the Coppa was seen as a chance to salvage their season.

Goal: Lulic 79' Even before Wednesday's result, there was mounting speculation that the Spaniard would not renew his contract at the end of the season. Napoli forward Manolo Gabbiadini fired a free kick against the foot of the post and headed wide from Marek Hamsik's cross as the hosts pressed in the first half. Gonzalo Higuain twice came close to being put clean through on goal early in the second half while Jonathan de Guzman wasted another chance to break clear of the Lazio defence with a poor first touch. But Lazio, who face Juventus in the final, were also dangerous and went ahead 11 minutes from time when Felipe Anderson rolled the ball across the face of goal and Lulic beat three defenders to the ball to turn it in from six metres. The Bosnian, who scored the winner when Lazio beat AS Roma in the final two seasons ago, was also the hero at the other end when he cleared the ball off the line after a brilliant run by Lorenzo Insigne.

"Cristiano Ronaldo scored the 300th goal of his Real Madrid career to become the third player in the club's history to reach the landmark alongside Alfredo Di Stefano and Raul. The Portugal forward netted against Rayo Vallecano in the 68th minute to move Madrid within four points of their great rivals Barcelona, letting out his frustration  following an unfair booking for a dive which could see the three-time Ballon d'Or winner suspended for Saturday's La Liga game with Eibar. Yet Ronaldo joined the 300 club in just 288 appearances by doing what all forwards should, sending a header downwards and beating goalkeeper Cristian Alvarez, before celebrating with Gareth Bale and his team-mates.

Not only that, the former Manchester United great has scored 99 goals under manager Carlo Ancelotti in just 89 games, following his five against Granada three days ago. His latest puts the 30-year-old  just seven goals behind Di Stefano's record of 307 in 396 outings, and 23 shy of Raul's 323 in 741 — with plenty of time to surpass both Bernabeu legends. Up until his opening goal 22 minutes from time, however, it long looked like Ancelotti would be left as deflated as the balloons that Ronaldo took a disliking to in the first half. Ronaldo had given four orange balloons that invaded the pitch at the Campo de Futbol de Vallecas a kicking as his team failed to dominate against a team with little left to play for in mid-table. Rayo in no way had their flip flops on, and fancied giving the winners of La Decima a run for their money. They did just that, proving far more difficult than the Granada side beaten 9-1 on Sunday. Yet Real's rotten luck was epitomised by Ronaldo's yellow card  in the 52nd minute, received for diving inside the 18-yard box with the game at 0-0. He had beaten the offside trap, before cutting inside to shoot, only for defender Antonio Amaya to chop him down. Quite clearly, too. Replays were not needed to show it was a wrong decision from referee Mario Melero Lopez to book Ronaldo for diving. From every angle, there was no question it should have been a penalty, and Ancelotti will appeal the caution in a bid to have his one-game ban rescinded. 'I told the referee that everyone saw it was a penalty,' Ancelotti said afterwards. 'I told him it was incredible that he didn't award a penalty and that he showed Cristiano the yellow card. We will appeal.' The booking lit something in the stomachs of the Madrid players, as Toni Kroos, Bale and Dani Carvajal were cautioned for dissent less than three minutes later before they broke the deadlock soon after. Ronaldo gave four orange balloons a kicking in the first half on what was shaping up to be a frustrating evening for CR7 . Ronaldo was having a frustrating evening until he scored his 300th of the career for Real Madrid . 300 - goals . 288 - appearances . 206 - right footed . 52 - left footed . 41 - headers . 55 - penalties . 77 - assists . On 68 minutes,  Carvajal got his own back. The Spain right-back escaped his marker down the  wing before crossing for Ronaldo to head home his 300th goal for Los Blancos. An easy way to reach a milestone. Ronaldo, in celebration, gestured towards the linesman who robbed him of the penalty and, from then on, the win never looked in doubt. It was James Rodriguez who put daylight between the teams just five minutes later. The Colombia international's controlled shot found the bottom-left corner, and effectively killed the game off to ensure Madrid would not be left six points adrift of Barcelona. Ancelotti added: 'We tried to pressure them with more intensity high up the pitch but in the first half we were not convincing. In the second, we were more complete, we played well and we deserved to win.' They will have to repeat the trick  on Saturday against Eibar to remain within touching distance of Barcelona, but are set to be without the suspended Ronaldo. The man Real paid £80million for in 2009 continued his protests with the officials after the full-time whistle, but it seems he will have to wait patiently to chase down Di Stefano and Raul.

'When we had training he would come over and train with the team, and then afterwards he would go straight back to work.' Dowd was succeeded at City by Joe Corrigan but continued playing at Stoke City before ending his career at Oldham Athletic in 1974.

"English cricket’s new bosses flexed their muscles when Paul Downton paid the price for a humiliating World Cup by being sacked as managing director. Downton was fired by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, in conjunction with chairman-elect Colin Graves, after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body’s management board ahead of their spring meeting today. The decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding Hugh Morris after England’s Ashes whitewash was unanimous, with one board member saying Downton was just ‘too accident prone’. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . It was Downton who took the huge call to sack Kevin Pietersen and then re-appointed Peter Moores, calling him ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’. He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain. Former England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate. Ultimately it was England’s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton. ‘The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,’ said Harrison in an ECB statement. ‘The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.’ Michael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton . Vaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender . That new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector. That makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today’s board meeting at Lord’s. Yet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves. ‘This doesn’t impact on Peter Moores’ position at all,’ Harrison said later on Sky. ‘This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.’ Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing .

"Philippe Coutinho fired Liverpool into the FA Cup semi-finals and made it a night to remember for Jordan Henderson. Liverpool’s captain provided the 70th-minute assist for Coutinho to break Blackburn Rovers’ resistance and secure a 1-0 win that sets up a Wembley date against Aston Villa a week on Sunday. It has been a dramatic 24 hours for Henderson, as his partner Beccy gave birth to their second daughter, Alba. The 25-year-old had not slept the night before the game.

As well as scoring the winner, he had the most shots, most touches, the highest duel success, highest dribble completion, and the most tackles. Henderson said: ‘Philippe has a great football brain. It’s the easy bit giving it to him. Another bit of brilliance wins the game and gives everyone a lift.’ Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers revealed Henderson told him there was no chance he was missing the fixture once the baby had arrived. Rodgers explained: 'His wife had a second child during the night so he had to go away, hadn't slept so much, travelled all the way back again and put in the performance he did tonight.

The Reds boss had denied a report that an internal meeting following the 4-1 defeat to Arsenal had descended into crisis talks and his players responded on the pitch by booking their spot in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley with a hard-fought 1-0 replay victory over Blackburn. 'There was a lot made of that,' he said. 'I'm a coach who speaks openly to players. Part of the coaching philosophy for me is about reviewing and reflecting performance. 'It's something that we've done all year when we were winning games. That provides us the lever to move forward - how can we be better, how can we improve? 'Because we lost a couple of games, there's a lot been made of that meeting but that review was very, very important in how we want to work.

"Liverpool just edged past Blackburn Rovers in their FA Cup sixth round replay to make it to a 24th Cup semi-final in the Anfield club's illustrious history.

Solid at right back, he kept Raheem Sterling quieter than most full backs in the Barclays Premier League would. Restricted in going forward as he kept an eye on England star. Baptiste 8 .

Tracked back really well and did his best to neutralise the threat of Coutinho. Could have given away a penalty in stoppage time for challenge on Joe Allen but referee made right decision. Marshall 7 . Creative force. Provided the ammo for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede as they looked to take advantage of an unfamiliar back-line. Unlucky to be denied by Simon Mignolet. Ben Marshall was unlucky to be denied when his header was saved by Simon Mignolet in the second half . Cairney 6.5 .

Good return to the side, albeit against lower league opposition. Team selection on Saturday indicated he was fifth choice but Anfield career not necessarily over. Moreno 6 . Comfortable evening on the whole with Blackburn lacklustre down the right. Little to do. Alberto Moreno had a comfortable evening on the whole with Blackburn lacklustre down the right. Little to do .

"Who has been Liverpool’s player of the season? Had you asked that question 12 months ago, the answer would have been glaring: Luis Suarez. For his 31 goals and his breathtaking displays, the accolade could only have gone to the Uruguayan. It was not, though, a case of him operating alone. Had it been a ‘normal’ season, Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling would all have been worthy recipients. But they were not the only contenders. Jordan Henderson was outstanding. Martin Skrtel was a big presence. Luis Suarez was clearly Liverpool's player of last season after the striker scored 31 goals in the campaign . Steven Gerrard (left) and Phillippe Coutinho (front) also played well as Liverpool's title tilt fell short . The Brazilian playmaker put in a real all-action display for his team. As well as scoring the winner, he had the most shots, most touches, the highest duel success, highest dribble completion, and the most tackles. Fast forward to the present and ask the same question: who has been Liverpool’s player of the season? There is no obvious candidate. Henderson, of course, would have his backers. The England international has excelled since the turn of the year, while Coutinho would command his share of the vote. Brendan Rodgers suggested after the Brazilian’s fabulous goal against Manchester City on March 1 he might be a contender for PFA Young Player of Year but, at times since, his flame has not flickered so brightly. Sterling had three blistering months when his goals were key to reviving fortunes. Emre Can has caught the eye since Christmas, while results have been better with Lucas Leiva in the team; Liverpool have only suffered three defeats in the 23 matches he has started. And that explains why Liverpool are where they are at the moment. There have been lots of satisfactory contributions, a few excellent, but there hasn’t been anywhere near the consistency of 12 months ago. Jordan Henderson has chipped in with some important goals and impressed with his boundless energy . Coutinho has again played well and won the game for Liverpool to send them into the FA Cup semi-finals . Coutinho has popped up with some important goals this season — five of his six strikes have earned Liverpool results (four wins and a draw). It is why they find themselves on the wrong side of the line for Champions League places and why they have made such heavy weather of this FA Cup campaign. For long periods here they flattered to deceive. Sterling saw little of the ball and Sturridge continued to show how out of form he is. The goals have dried up for Rodgers’ side over the course of the last month — they had only scored seven in their previous six matches before this game. Rodgers must have feared the worst as Simon Mignolet kept his side’s Wembley dreams alive with two stunning saves early in the second period, but then, much to his relief, up popped Coutinho. There is still time, of course, for one of Rodgers’ squad to emerge as the absolute best of this bunch; on May 19, a gala dinner will be held at the city’s Echo Arena when the successor to Suarez will be announced. Daniel Sturridge's injury-hit season has been a tempestuous affair for the out-of-sorts striker . Raheem Sterling was denied of service at Ewood Park during a frustrating display for the contract rebel . At this moment, nobody is better placed than Coutinho. If Liverpool are going to clamber into the top four — still a possibility given Liverpool’s implosion — and win the FA Cup, much will depend on the little Brazilian. He proved he had what it takes to settle a frantic collision at Ewood Park. Rodgers needs him to show that right through until the end of May.","Luis Suarez was Liverpool's player of last season .
But who would earn that accolade this year? Jordan Henderson has many backers, as does Coutinho .

"Hector Bellerin is fast becoming seen by fans, and possibly even by his manager, as Arsenal's premier right back, after impressing in the absence of Mathieu Debuchy. The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates . Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season . 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations. 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres . Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time . But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again . 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. But after his brilliant goal at the Emirates stadium last weekend, one thing is for certain - he is no longer known just for being quick over 40 metres.","Hector Bellerin broke Theo Walcott's Arsenal sprint record last summer .

"Celtic retained their seven-point lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership with an easy 2-0 win over 10-man Partick at Parkhead. The home side laid siege to the Thistle defence at the start of the match but had to rely on a Kris Commons penalty a minute before the break to give them the interval lead. Thistle midfielder James Craigen had been shown a straight red card by referee Willie Collum for a 'last man' foul on Hoops midfielder Stuart Armstrong to concede the spot-kick. leaving the visitors a player down for the second half.

Midfielder Stefan Johansen, stand-in skipper in the absence of suspended Scott Brown, added a second in the 63rd minute as the encounter turned into a Hoops procession. With second-placed Aberdeen beating Inverness 1-0, Ronny Deila's side maintained the gap over the Dons but also have a game in hand as the title race draws closer to conclusion. With a heavy schedule in mind, the Hoops boss returned midfielder Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and striker John Guidetti his starting line-up. Thistle manager Alan Archibald was forced into one change with forward Kallum Higginbotham coming in for the injured Kris Doolan but he was mostly a spectator as the Firhill defence was forced to withstand an early Hoops' barrage. Celtic came close twice before two minutes had elapsed. Stefan Johansen doubles Celtic's advantage in the 63rd minute with left-footed shot into the bottom corner . Johansen is mobbed by his team-mates following his second-half strike . Parkhead defender Virgil van Dijk, up for a corner, flicked an Armstrong cross against the crossbar at the near post before a desperate blocking tackle by Maryhill defender Conrad Balatoni prevented an almost certain goal from Johansen's drive. Balatoni again came to Thistle rescue in the ninth minute, beating Guidetti to a header in front of an empty goal, after left-back Emilio Izaguirre had troubled Fox after surging into the penalty area. Moments later, Mackay-Steven was set up Johansen but his goalbound drive from 12 yards was deflected away by Thistle defender Callum Booth. Yet, in the 21st minute, in a rare attack, the visitors almost snatched the lead but Higginbotham's spectacular volley from 14 yards was saved by Craig Gordon - but only on the stretch. Commons' long-distance drive in the 28th minute just cleared the bar but a minute before the break he was more accurate from the spot, firing the penalty low into the corner giving the despairing Fox no chance. Leigh Griffiths spurns a glorious opportunity to put Celtic 3-0 ahead late in the match . The goal came as some relief to the home fans who had grown slightly irritated as the first half wore on. Two minutes after the break Commons forced Fox into a decent save with a powerful 25-yard drive and while the Maryhill defence cleared their lines from rebound it looked ominous. Thistle continued to defend stoutly and desperately in equal measures but were undone again when Johansen took a clever Guidetti pass before rolling the ball into the corner of the net from 10 yards. Two minutes after replacing Guidetti, Leigh Griffiths somehow turned a Mackay-Steven cross past the far post from two yards out but it was inconsequential. In the 79th minute, with the game drifting, Gordon made another good save, this time from Thistle substitute Gary Fraser, on for Stuart Bannigan.

"Two college students have been charged in connection to an unconscious girl who was allegedly gang raped on a Florida beach during Spring Break in broad daylight, authorities said. Troy University students Delonte' Martistee, 22, of Georgia and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, of Alabama were charged on Friday with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators relating to the incident that occurred between March 10-12, according to Bay County Sheriff's Office. According to WFSA, it has been confirmed by university officials that both men were suspended, and Martistee, a promising track star, has been removed from the team. The alleged victim  told deputies she thought she had been drugged before the incident and that she was afraid to report it because she could not remember many details, Panama City News Herald reported. Scroll down for video . Delonte' Martistee, 22, (left) and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, (right) have been charged in connection with the alleged rape after police in Troy, Alabama, found the clip on a cell phone during another investigation .

Calhoun of Mobile, Alabama was suspended from Troy University along with Martistee, university officials confirmed . 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said. Authorities  are still searching for two additional suspects in the case. Friday's charges stem from a video police found where hundreds of people are seen watching the incident without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach, authorities claim. The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. McKeithen branded the video the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' and likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. Following the incident that occurred between March 10-12, the men were arrested and charged on Friday and were taken to the Bay County Jail as they await their first appearance . In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. 'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' Authorities said hundreds of people walked past but did not stop the attack near Spinnaker Beach Club on Panama City Beach, Florida, in broad daylight during a Spring Break party last month . The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media. In one video, police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her. And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach... If you condone this behavior, you should be in jail, as far as I'm concerned.' The investigation related to the incident is ongoing.","Troy University students Delonte' Martistee, 22, and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, have been charged in connection to the alleged sexual attack .

"This is the incredible moment a tiger was sent crashing to the floor after mistiming an attack on a fleet-footed bird. The ferocious feline was chasing what was sure to be dinner when it slipped on the icy surface and lost its footing. As the tiger raced towards the bird, it flew directly upwards forcing the mammal to try and stop dead in its tracks. Oops-a-daisy! This tiger lots its footing in spectacular style while trying to catch a chicken at a zoo in China . On the attack: At first all was well, with the tiger homing straight in on an airborne feathery meal . Target: As the bird flew upwards the tiger began to rear up, ready to grab its prey from the air . Fail: The tiger began to slip as the bird flew higher and higher in a blind panic - and it was all caught on camera by photographer Libby Zhang . Hang time: The slip caused the tiger to flip right onto its back, with the bird now well out of reach . But momentum caused its feet to slide away from underneath and go skidding along the slippery ground. The hilarious moment took place at the Hengdaohezi Siberian Tiger Park in Northeast China and was captured by photographer Libby Zhang. Libby, from Houston in Texas, was visiting the park and photographing the tigers' feeding session.

'One tiger tried to reach it but he lost his balance on the slippery icy and fell backwards. 'I was surprised to see the tiger slip and raised my camera in a hurry with rapid fires on the trigger. 'I wanted to capture the beauty and power of tigers in the same image, but this tiger slip series was a total surprise and added bonus for my trip.'","The hilarious moment took place at the Hengdaohezi Siberian Tiger Park in Northeast China during feeding time .

"Manchester City's youngsters finished off a job well done against Leicester City, adding to their 3-0 first-leg lead with two late goals from Isaac Buckley and Brandon Barker at the King Power Stadium. Layton Ndukwu had given Leicester hope of clawing back the advantage with 20 minutes to go but substitute Buckley and Barker struck to kill that dream off and set up a final against Chelsea later this month. City will face Chelsea at a venue, likely to to be the City Football Academy Stadium, in the first leg on April 20 before travelling to Stamford Bridge a week later on April 27. Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring at the King Power Stadium on Wednesday .

Unused subs: Albinson, Fernandes, Dilrosun . Bookings: Wood, Bryan, Angelino . With City holding a big advantage from the first leg last month, this clash always looked difficult for Leicester, and their inability to find an early goal made the task of overhauling the advantage even tougher. City were the better team for much of the first half but goalkeeper Kjetil Haug had to be aware to keep out Hamza Choudhury from close range at the other end. That was their best chance until Charlie Oliver handled inside his own penalty area with 20 minutes to go to gift Ndukwu the chance to give the home side the lead. That opportunity was one he gratefully accepted, confidently dispatching his spot-kick past Haug. Layton Ndukwu of Leicester City scores from a penalty to cut the deficit but it was not Leicester's night . Brandon Barker (right) scored City's second goal of the evening as they made it to a first final in seven years . Despite still holding a decent lead, City surged forward in response and Buckley equalised, thumping home Barker's cross. And Buckley effectively returned the favour when he was hauled down inside the area moments later to allow Barker to make it 5-1 on aggregate from the spot. City march on and face Chelsea in a rematch of their last final in this competition seven years ago. The Premier League champions' youth side won 4-2 on aggregate on that occasion and will be hoping for a repeat this year.

"Fabio Capello claimed John Terry is still England’s best defender and maintained he should never have been stripped of his captaincy. Speaking about the Terry race row for the first time since leaving his post as England manager, Capello said England would be in a much stronger position if they still had the Chelsea stalwart at their disposal. ‘I think John is England’s best defender and they have not got a lot of defenders,’ said Capello, ‘It is better to have a player like John than not have him.’ Fabio Capello insists defender John Terry should never have been stripped of the England captaincy . Capello claims England would be in a much stronger position if they still had the Chelsea star at their disposal . The Italian was in charge of the national side when Terry was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, the brother of then England teammate Rio, during a Chelsea match against QPR in October 2011. He was stripped of his captaincy by the Football Association after being charged by police. Capello resigned as England Manager in February 2012 just two days after publicly criticising the FA’s decision and obviously remains bitter about the whole affair. He believes Terry should have kept his role under the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven. ‘I fought for John to be able to come back and play but they [the Football Association] said “no you can’t decide about the player, you need to wait for the court decision,” and I said “Why?” But they had already decided before I asked. John Terry was caught up in a race controversy with then-QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in 2011 . Chelsea captain Terry, who has 78 England caps, retired from international football in September 2012 . Asked if it was time to persuade Terry, who has been a permanent fixture in the Chelsea side bound for the Premier League title, to come back into the England fold, Capello - speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards - directed his ire at the FA. ‘You know what happened with me, they decided he could not play with the national team and I didn’t understand because he was not guilty. ‘When it happened I said to the President [David Bernstein] “You decided he’s guilty?” No he’s not guilty, it’s good you can play with the national team and I don’t understand why you don’t play.’ Terry was cleared of racially abusing Ferdinand in a criminal hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court but retired from international football in September 2012 after the FA pursued their own charges. An FA hearing found Terry, who has 78 England caps, guilty of using insulting words which included a reference to Anton Ferdinand’s colour or race and he was banned for four matches and fined £220,000, . Terry, 34, said he was ‘deeply hurt’ by the incident and will never play for England again. Capello agreed his international career was probably over. ‘I don’t think he has the chances to play with the national team more,’ said Capello, ‘But I saw some young players that played with me are improving. [Chris] Smalling is playing and [Phil] Jones. I’m happy because a lot of players I put in the national team are playing now and well.’ The Chelsea defender was cleared in court of racially abusing Ferdinand but was banned and fined by the FA .","Fabio Capello believes England would be much stronger with John Terry .

"The brother of Boney M's lead singer Liz Mitchell has been arrested in connection with the killing of a Syrian-born imam. Burnell 'Bernie' Mitchell - who changed his name to Khalid Rashad after converting to Islam - has been held on suspicion of conspiracy to murder after the death of Abdul Hadi Arwani, a Syrian national. The 61-year-old has also been arrested on suspicion of preparing and instigating acts of terrorism as Scotland Yard detectives  continue to investigate Mr Arwani's shooting. A 36-year-old man has been charged with his shooting while a woman, aged 53, was arrested this in Brent on suspicion of terrorism offences. Burnell 'Bernie' Mitchell - also known as Khalid Rashad - (left) has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and terrorism offences. His sister is Liz Mitchell (right),  lead singer of the 1970s band Boney M . Syrian-born 48-year-old Abdul Hadi Arwani (pictured) was found dead in his car on Tuesday. One man has been charged with his murder while Mitchell is held on suspicion of conspiracy to murder . Mr Mitchell, who founded An Noor Mosque in Acton where Mr Arwani was a preacher until 2011, was arrested on Wednesday night on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. On Thursday afternoon Scotland Yard revealed they had further arrested the Jamaican national on suspicion of terrorism offences. His sister is the singer Liz Mitchell who fronted the 1970s band Boney M and whose hits include Rasputin and Daddy Cool. A spokesman for the singer declined to comment today. The siblings were raised in Britain as strict Christians, having fled the Caribbean as children. Last night Mr Mitchell's home was searched at the same time as An-Noor Mosque which he founded more than 20 years ago because 'he and his Muslim friends had nowhere to go'. They are investigating the death of Mr Arwani, a 48-year-old Syrian national who was found killed in his car last week. Search: Police visited the Wembley home of Burnell Mitchell, a director of the mosque where Mr Arwani used to preach regularly . Leslie Cooper, left, has appeared in court charged with murdering iman Abdul Hadi Arwani, right. The 61-year-old is a businessman from Jamaica . Within days of Mr Arwani's body being found last week, Metropolitan Police drafted in the help of Counter Terrorism officers 'because of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad'. Today a spokesman confirmed searches were ongoing at the An Noor mosque. 'Officers are fully aware of the sensitivities of conducting this search at this time and would like to thank the local Muslim community for their support and patience thus far in the necessary investigations that have occurred to date,' a Scotland Yard spokesman said. 'This remains a murder investigation and a search for the truth; it is therefore vital that the investigation is thorough which includes a detailed searches of premises.' Today the Old Bailey heard how Mr Arwani  he was killed  after being lured to north London to meet a potential client for his building company. It was then the 48-year-old was murdered by 36-year-old Leslie Cooper, a prosecutor told a judge during a pre-trial hearing. The Jamaican businessman, who was arrested while his family enjoyed a barbecue, did not enter a plea, appearing via video link from prison. ‘A member of the public noticed he had collapsed at the wheel and the car was running that morning’, prosecutor Oliver Glasgow said. Mr Arwani was described as 'the most peaceful man you could wish to meet' by his family last week . Police pictured outside the An Noor mosque in north west London while searching the premises. Mitchell was listed as a director of the mosque where Mr Arwani used to preach . Mr Arwani was found dead last week in this Volkswagen Passat on a street in Wembley. Police believed he visited the scene in the days before his death . ‘Concerned for his health, they contact police and paramedics who discovered Mr Arwani had been shot five times and was already dead.’ Mr Glasgow said Mr Arwani and his son, who was also part of the building firm, had met a man called ‘John’ two days earlier over a possible renovation job. ‘They collected the individual on April 5 and were taken to the property in Wembley but he explain they couldn’t get access to the premises because his wife was not there’, he said. ‘Arrangements were made to come back and view the property some days later..’ Hassan Anyabwile (pictured last week) was brought in to replace Mr Arwani at An Noor Mosque . Mr Arwani rearranged the viewing for April 7, said Mr Glasgow, and was last seen alive leaving his family home at 9.30am to go to meet the man called John. ‘There was no further contact with the deceased and his family’, he added. Cooper did not speak during the hearing other than to confirm his name. He has not yet entered a plea to one charge of murder. He is one of three people to have been arrested in connection with Mr Arwani’s death. Alongside Mr Mitchell is a 53-year-old woman arrested on Thursday morning on suspicion of terrorism offences. Mr Arwani was a preacher at An Noor mosque in Acton until 2011 when he left under reportedly frayed tensions. The father of six was described by relatives as 'the most peaceful man you could wish to meet' upon the news of his death last week. One of his sons said he 'actively' fought extremism while friends added he was a vocal critic of the President Assad's government. He is thought to have fled Syria as a teenager after being told he would face violence to photographing damage in his home city of Hama. Speaking after his father's murder, Murhaf Arwani said: 'He just loved to help people. He did not care what your background, race or status was. 'He did not care if you were rich or poor. He just wanted to help people in need. 'He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it. He was an advocate of peace for all and he showed us this in the way he lived his life from day to day.' Last week the Caribbean preacher who replaced Mr Arwani at An Noor Mosque denied claims the 48-year-old had left under strained relationships. Hassan Anyabwile, who was involved in an attempted coup d'etat in his native Trinidad and Tobago 25 years ago with the Muslim group Jamaat al Muslimeem, told MailOnline he knew nothing of a reported dispute between Mr Arwani and the mosque. Asked about the 48-year-old's death he said: 'All I can say is from Allah we come, and to Allah we return.' He was assisted into the mosque - which currently remains closed as officers search its premises - by a bodyguard after becoming partially disabled.

"Ricky Hatton’s former trainer has been charged with sexually assaulting a girl under the age of 16. Bob Shannon, 59, helped prepare Hatton for his comeback fight against Vyacheslav Senchenko in November 2012, which the former two-weight world champion lost and promptly retired. The Manchester-based trainer’s stable includes Hatton’s brother, Matthew, the European welterweight champion, and fighters who have won British and European titles. Bob Shannon (right) with Ricky Hatton in September 2012 after the boxer confirmed his ill-fated comeback. He has been charged with a sexual assault on an underage girl after police received a complaint last year . Manchester-based Shannon trained Hatton for just one fight, against Vyacheslav Senchenko of Russia . Shannon has been charged with a sexual assault against a girl under the age of 16 . Greater Manchester Police confirmed that Shannon, from Glossop, Derbyshire, would appear before magistrates next week. Shannon landed a three-fight deal to train Hatton through his ill-fated comeback after guiding Matthew Hatton to a world title shot. But when The Hitman lost to Senchenko, Shannon lost his marquee fighter. Recently, his most high-profile boxer has been welterweight Denton Vassell, who fought and lost in a British welterweight title eliminator last September. Shannon’s charge came after a report a girl had been sexually assaulted last June. Hatton (second right) shows the pain after losing his comeback fight against Senchenko in November 2012 . Shannon has also trained Hatton's brother, Matthew (right), to a European title and world title shot . ‘Robert Shannon of Derbyshire was charged with sexual assault and due before Manchester and Salford Magistrates on 22 April 2015,’ said a police statement. Hatton became British boxing’s biggest star when he became light-welterweight world champion after an epic victory over Kostya Tszyu in 2005. The larger-than-life character went on to win the welterweight world title, under the tutelage of long-term trainer Billy Graham. Hatton’s weight fluctuations between fights eventually caught up with him and he lost super-fights against Floyd Mayweather in 2007 and Manny Pacquiao two years later, before retiring for the first time. He turned to Shannon to guide his comeback in 2012 but the Senchenko defeat was their only fight together.

"A former High Court judge who led the inquiry into the Bradford stadium fire which killed 56 football fans has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident saying they are 'nonsense'. A new book by author Martin Fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. The official inquiry into the blaze, led by Mr Justice Oliver Popplewell, concluded that the fire was an accident, probably caused by a spectator dropping a cigarette into rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand at the Valley Parade ground. Former Bradford City chairman Stafford Heginbotham, left, with Mr Justice Popplewell in the aftermath of the Bradford City fire. Today, the former judge has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident . The stand at the Valley Parade ground burns after a fire in 1985. 56 football fans were killed in the tragedy . Today Sir Oliver was asked about the new allegations in an interview on BBC Radio Leeds, where he rubbished Mr Fletcher's claims. The retired judge said the main flaw in the argument that the fire was arson was that the stand involved had no insurance value as it was due for demolition. He also added that the fire was examined by experienced and thorough investigators, who found nothing suspicious and that no question of arson was ever raised in civil legal proceedings. He explained: 'I'm sorry to spoil what is obviously a very good story but I'm afraid it's nonsense for a number of reasons.' Sir Oliver also rejected claims his inquiry was held too quickly, three weeks after the fire. He added: 'I can quite understand after having previous fires some suspicion being raised but, as far as I’m concerned, we conducted our inquiry perfectly properly and I have no reason believe it was other than an accident.' The new claims about the fire at Valley Parade are contained in the book Fifty-Six by Mr Fletcher, who was 12 at the time and escaped the blaze. Author Martin Fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. He is pictured here with his mother Susan as a 12-year-old . The fire broke out near to half-time during Bradford's game against Lincoln City on May 11, 1985 and within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. Mr Fletcher lost three generations of his family in the tragedy, including his 11-year-old brother Andrew, the fire's youngest victim, as well as his father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63. The book, published today and being serialised in The Guardian, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Mr Heginbotham’s history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around £27 million in today’s terms, warranted further investigation. He asks: 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?' The disaster also occurred at a time, according to Mr Fletcher’s evidence, when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it would cost £2million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford’s promotion from the old Third Division. The fire at the ground broke out close to half-time during Bradford's home game against Lincoln City on May, 11, 1985 . An official inquiry found that the fire was started by accidentally when a fan discarded a cigarette on to rubbish below the timber stand . Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, which took place three weeks after the fire . Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. Meanwhile Mr Heginbotham’s son James, 47, has defended his father, who died in 1995. He told told the Daily Mirror: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. 'He’s no longer here to defend himself. It’s a real shame it has come to this.' Meanwhile, yesterday former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster. The remains of the stand after the fire. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the blaze, which also injured 265 people . Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Valley Parade to survey the damage to the stand and pay her respects with her husband Dennis . Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City Council at the time of the tragedy, said he knew Mr Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club, but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure. 'However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty’s Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.' A minute’s silence is due to be held at every Premier League and Football League match on Saturday, April 25 to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary of the fire. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land . The fire was spotted at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade.","Mr Justice Popplewell says he has no reason to believe fire wasn't accident .

"Manchester United players hung a fake bird above Ashley Young's peg in the dressing room after a bird pooed in his mouth during a top-flight match, Luke Shaw has revealed. As United kicked off their Premier League season with a match against  Swansea in August, Young received a surprise delivery from a bird mid-match, much to the amusement of his team-mates, who took advantage of the situation. Speaking exclusively to Match of the Day magazine, Shaw said: 'Ashley Young is the joker in the dressing room. We still laugh about the time he got bird poo in his mouth against Swansea. Manchester United left back Luke Shaw (second left) trains at the club's Aon Complex on Friday . Shaw admits that Ashley Young is the biggest joker in the Manchester United dressing room . He says the players still laugh at the time Young got bird poo in his mouth during a match against Swansea . 'If you ask him now, he'll say it wasn't bird poo. In the changing room we hung a fake bird above his place as a joke which he didn't like.' Shaw's revelations come as he nears the end of his first season at Old Trafford. His transition from Southampton star to £31.5million United man has been more difficult than he would have liked, with the left back making just 17 appearances this season. He has suffered a number of injuries, limiting his time on the pitch, but still appears to have settled into his new surroundings well. He admits he picks up tips from goalkeeper David de Gea, who has been in impressive form on the pitch for Louis van Gaal's side. According to Shaw, he is not just a top goalkeeper, but is approachable off the pitch when players need advice too. According to Shaw, United goalkeeper David de Gea is the 'nicest guy in football' and is always approachable . Louis van Gaal's stern demeanour is not limited to the touchline; at training he is equally as focused . Shaw has struggled with a number of injuries since arriving at Manchester United from Southampton . 'David de Gea is funny, he’s kind, if you want to talk to him you can talk to him – he’s the nicest guy in football! 'He’s been unbelievable for us this season and kept us in so many games, he’s starting to become the best goalkeeper in the world.” 'We’ve got a few Spanish-speaking players and they’re always playing their music and dancing around – the English lads hate it. Sometimes we can’t understand them, they say stuff to us and we’re like ‘What?’” After a disappointing campaign under David Moyes last season, Shaw's arrival coincided with that of Van Gaal, who has turned things around at Old Trafford. Now, United look certain to be heading towards a top-four finish, and Shaw admits that Van Gaal's pitch-side focus isn't limited to match-days; at training he is just as stern. 'The manager is always focused on his job, and his job is to win games. I haven’t seen a cheeky side to him yet, but you could say he has one. 'When we’re on the training pitch it’s like a game day, 100 per cent focus, nothing will change his mind or his focus, he’s always on the ball.'

"Spanish police have killed a man in his 70s who barricaded himself into his home after shooting his daughter's boyfriend and a police officer last night. Following a night of failed negotiations, the shooter opened fire on the the armed police unit that stormed the house at 8am this morning. The man who has been named as Jose Luis by Spanish daily El Pais yelled 'enter if you have the balls' before an intense firefight ensued. Wounded: A Spanish man who shot and wounded his daughter's boyfriend (both pictured) and barricaded himself into his own home has been shot dead . He shot at the officers who raided the home in the north-eastern city of Zaragoza and seriously wounded one before they shot him dead. His daughter has been been pictured lying next to her injured partner outside the house in Ejea de los Caballeros. The 50-year-old man is in a serious condition at Hospital Clinico in Zaragoza after being shot twice in the shoulder with a shotgun, according to The Local. 15 minutes after the first attack, the now-dead shooter also shot a police officer who approached the house. A police spokesman has said said the man holed up in his own house for over 12 hours after shooting the two men who both needed medical treatment. An officer gave these details to el Periodico on the condition of anonymity because force regulations prevent him from being identified publicly. Forced entry: After a night of failed negotiations in Zaragoza, an elite police unit stormed the man's house this morning (pictured) and killed him . Agents tried to coax the man into leaving his home throughout the night without success - and had to return early this morning with armed officers. The Civil Guard finally decided to enter the house and confront the man who was shot dead when they slammed open the front door. Locals in the town, which has around 10,000 inhabitants, told El País that the man has three daughters and is usually 'calm' keeping himself to himself.","He retreated to his house after shooting daughter's partner and a policeman .

"Andre Ayew is keen on a move to Liverpool this summer. The Ghana international will be a free agent as he is out of contract at Marseille and wants to join the Anfield club who he supported as a boy. Everton, Newcastle and Swansea have all shown interest while Ayew's representatives have held talks with Roma. Wolfsburg, Borussia Dortmund and Napoli are also keen to speak to him. Ayew, 25, was born in France but followed his father Abedi Pele by playing for Ghana where he has become one of their star performers notably scoring in the World Cup finals last summer against USA and eventual winners Germany. Andre Ayew is out of contract at Marseille in the summer and is keen on a move to England . The Ghana international admits he supported Liverpool as a boy and would like to play for the Anfield club . Although emotionally attached to Marseille, he admits he is seeking a new challenge and is ready to test himself in the Premier League. Talking to Sportsmail, he said: 'I'm a Marseille boy, I love Marseille, the club, the fans, the area, it's a great place to play football and I will continue to speak to them but it's true I'd like to play in England.' Ayew, who is represented in England by agent Mark McKay of ExcelFoot, added: 'I grew up watching English football and I support Liverpool. Steven Gerrard is my favourite player. They have always had exciting teams and now they are a club that likes to play with pace and give chances to young players. Ayew's favourite player growing up was Steven Gerrard, who will leave Liverpool at the end of the season . A player he knew from their time together at Marseille, Ayew speaks regularly to Joey Barton (right) 'I'm 25 now and it is a good age for me to take the next step in my career. I have offers from England, Italy and Germany but it would be unfair to say who from. I speak to my friends such as Morgan Amalfitano at West Ham and Joey Barton at QPR and they always talk well about the league and the atmosphere. 'I have been fortunate to experience Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford in the Champions League but I want to play at Anfield and other grounds. 'I know my quality. I have shown I can play at Marseille and I have taken on responsibility with my country. It's important that you always strive to be better. You see with players such as Eden Hazard how hard they work and I believe in hard work to get better. It's easy to talk though, what is important is that I do it.' The Ghana international is also being looked at by Swansea, Newcastle and Everton in the Premier League . Liverpool have already secured the signing of Divock Origi (left), who will move to Anfield in the summer . Ayew's ideal is to help Marseille win the French league but it will be difficult as they trail leaders Paris Saint-Germain by five points. 'I will fight to the end for Marseille then I will make my decision. It is an important step for me.' Liverpool already have Divock Origi in the bag and are keen on Burnley's Danny Ings but will be enthused that a player of Ayew's pedigree has such desire to play for them. Failure to reach the Champions League could also mean he falls within their budget as a free transfer. Brendan Rodgers wants a goalkeeper, midfielder and a full-back as well as a forward. He likes Memphis Depay at PSV Eindhoven but the Holland international is expected to join Manchester United.","Marseille forward Andre Ayew is out of contract in the summer .

"The first lady of North Korea has appeared in public for the first time since December as part of celebrations marking the birthday of the country's founding leader Kim Il-Sung. A grinning Ri Sol-Ju, wearing what appeared to be a wedding ring on her left hand, was pictured clapping next to her smiling husband Kim Jong-un during a men's football match at Kim Il Sung Stadium on Monday, the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. The images of the couple at a podium flanked by top party officials were published in state media. Scroll down for video . Laughing with her husband, Kim Jong-un, as the pair watch a celebratory football match, Ri Sol-Ju is seen for the first time since December . The match was being held as part of a lavish series of events celebrating the 103rd birthday of Kim Il-Sung, the young leader's grandfather, which falls on Wednesday. North Korea designates the 'Day of the Sun' as a rare two-day national holiday, with art performances, exhibitions and sporting events, and pilgrimages to the late leader's birthplace in Pyongyang. A former member of the North's Unhasu Orchestra, Ri was last seen in public in December 2014, when she and her husband attended a ceremony to commemorate the third anniversary of the death of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-Il. Their marriage was only revealed in July 2012 when pictures emerged of a young woman accompanying Kim at official events in a break from the past, when the North's first ladies were kept out of the limelight. She was pictured wearing stylish, expensive-looking outfits and on one occasion sported what appeared to be a Christian Dior handbag, in a country plagued by chronic poverty. Their marriage was only revealed in July 2012 when pictures emerged of a young woman accompanying Kim at official events . But Ri has been out of the spotlight since December for unknown reasons. The Kim dynasty has ruled the isolated state for nearly seven decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult. Kim Il-Sung led North Korea from its establishment in 1948 until his death on July 8, 1994. He was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-Il, who also ruled until his death in December 2011 when power was transferred to his son and current leader Kim Jong-un. KCNA said 'an endless stream of people' was visiting, Mangyongdae, the birthplace of Kim Il-Sung, as the 'Day of the Sun' draws near. The images of the couple at a podium flanked by top party officials were published in state media . On Sunday more than 800 runners took place in an international marathon watched by hundreds of fans, including some 600 from abroad, as part of the celebrations. 'Attending the race were more than 600 marathon fans from dozens of countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Sweden, Finland, UK and Italy,' KCNA said. The North announced in February that the April 12 marathon would only be open to domestic runners this year, because of lingering concerns over the Ebola epidemic in west Africa. But it last month reversed a ban on foreigners taking part in the annual run, after lifting strict travel restrictions aimed at keeping out the Ebola virus. Ri Sol-ju here is seen wearing a wedding ring and her husband Kim Jong-un an expensive watch.  Last week he appeared to be wearing a bandage on the same wrist after sustaining an injury. It has now been removed .","Ri Sol-Ju appears in public with her husband for first time since December .

"The news that Jurgen Klopp will leave Borussia Dortmund in the summer has raised the probability that key members of his squad will depart too. Klopp has painstakingly built a team in his image during his seven-year tenure at the Westfalenstadion and achieved considerable success. Dortmund were Bundesliga champions in 2011 and 2012 before they reached the final of the Champions League in 2013. Jurgen Klopp has announced he is to quit Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season . Klopp has enjoyed seven successful seasons at the Westfalenstadion but has decided to call time . But the signings of Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski helped Bayern Munich re-establish their dominance and Klopp's exit is the end of an era. It could signal the break-up of the Dortmund squad and we take a look at four players who could follow Klopp out of the club this summer. MATS HUMMELS . Even before Klopp's shock announcement, it looked highly likely that Hummels would be leaving at the end of the season, most likely to Manchester United. The Germany World Cup-winner is considered one of the best defenders in the game and would add steel to any back line. Klopp revealed recently that Hummels, 26, had been 'thinking things over,' adding that he believed he was good enough for United. Defender Mats Hummels has been linked with a move to Manchester United this summer . ILKAY GUNDOGAN . The 24-year-old midfielder has also been linked with a summer move to the Premier League, with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City among those interested. At his best, Gundogan can take control of a midfield battle and is more than capable of unlocking defences with his range of passing. He hinted in February that he was ready to sign a new contract but then stalled and Klopp's departure could make up his mind for him. Midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has been linked with a number of Premier League sides . CIRO IMMOBILE . The Italian striker only arrived at the Westfalenstadion from Torino last summer but hasn't lived up to expectations as Lewandowski's replacement. A measly return of 10 goals for the season has hardly compensated for the loss of their star striker to Bayern last summer. There have been suggestions that Dortmund will listen to offers for Immobile and he would most likely return home to Italy, perhaps to AC Milan. Ciro Immobile (left) has struggled to compensate for Robert Lewandowski's departure to Bayern Munich . NEVEN SUBOTIC . The Serbian defender had ears burning in the Premier League when he said last week that he won't decide his Dortmund future until after his summer holidays. He also added they he yearns to play in a league that is more physical, saying: 'How can I do my work when my opponent starts crying without contact?' Subotic has been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal, offering a possible alternative if Hummels doesn't want to make the move.

"Newcastle United have upset supporters after dumping pictures of Sir Bobby Robson’s title-chasing team in a skip outside St James’ Park. Framed squad photographs of Sir Bobby alongside the likes of Alan Shearer, Gary Speed, Nobby Solano and Shay Given have been found discarded alongside grass cuttings, cardboard boxes and bin bags. The pictures were removed from corporate boxes inside the stadium and have been replaced by more recent images. Framed photographs of Sir Bobby Robson's title-chasing side were found thrown in a skip outside the stadium . The skip was situated outside St James' Park where fans were able to spot the disgraceful move by the club . Steve Wraith, of NUFC Fans United, told the Chronicle: ‘They could have auctioned them for charity, but just to put these things in the bin is awful. Now fans are talking about going and helping themselves. ‘They are pictures of club legends. I don’t think the club want people to be reminded of a time when they were doing well because they are doing so badly at the moment.’ Robson’s team finished fourth in 2002 and qualified for the Champions League, where they memorably made it to the second group phase after a last-gasp victory in Feyenoord. Alan Shearer, Gary Speed and Nolberto Solano are some of the legends who are included in the photos . Sir Bobby, who passed away in 2009, is still fondly remembered and has a statue outside of the stadium . In 2003 they topped the table for a period before finishing third, a return which has not been bettered in the years since. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the club said the images were ‘old and not being used anymore’. But the ‘AshleyOut.com’ group, who are behind Sunday’s planned boycott of Newcastle’s home match with Spurs, tweeted: ‘Our proud history in the skip outside SJP along with ambition and hope’. Newcastle fan David Crosier tweeted: 'As a metaphor for the club this could not be more apt. Classless. There is nothing left to support at NUFC under this regime'. Former club captain Shearer (left) flourished under Sir Bobby and was instrumental in qualifying for Europe . Gary Speed (right), who died in 2011, was another player who loved playing for his former manager . Nolberto Solano (right) was a key figure in Newcastle's title challenge and is also seen as a club legend .

"The England C team is facing the axe after 36 years as part of Greg Dyke’s spending review at the Football Association. FA chairman Dyke must find £30million to fund his masterplan to reform grassroots football with more 3G pitches in urban coaching hubs, and has identified the non-league national team as an area of potential saving. England C, which has operated under different names since it was formed in 1979, is managed by former Barnet boss Paul Fairclough, who selects from players outside the Football League, aged 23 and under. FA chairman Greg Dyke could axe the England C team to save money to help improve grassroots football . The team normally plays only three or four times a season, but some friendly fixtures have attracted attention inside the organisation because of the elaborate travel involved. England won 6-1 in Bermuda, in June 2013, and won 1-0 in Jordan, in March last year. Fairclough’s team also compete in the International Challenge Trophy, a competition for European semi-pro national teams, but did not qualify for the semi-finals of this year’s tournament from a home-and-away qualifying group featuring Turkey, Slovakia and Estonia. They were beaten by Cyprus U21s in friendly in Larnaca, in February, but there are no more fixtures planned and, since a meeting last week, fears have increased about the long-term future for a team which has been known since its formation as the National Game XI, England Semi-Pro and England Non-League. Paul Fairclough (left) is the current manager of the team and he selects non-league players under 23 . Those capped at this level include George Boyd of Burnley, Craig Mackail-Smith of Brighton and Steve Morison of Leeds, who all went on to play at full international level, although not for England. Boyd and Mackail-Smith won caps for Scotland and Morison for Wales. Former Leicester winger Steve Guppy won one senior England cap after playing once for his country at non-league level. Guppy also won one cap for the U21s and one for England B, which could make him the ultimate one-cap wonder. Barnsley manager Lee Johnson was also capped at non-league level.

Fairy tale: The Banyan looks like enchanted trees found in children’s books . Uprooted: The original tree roots grew up against a wall, before it was moved to a nearby park . Originally the roots of the tree grew up against a wall, but when the wall was demolished the tree was carefully uprooted to its new location Northern Gulf Marine and Cultural Park in Fangchenggang city.

It is truly remarkable that the web of overlapping roots can support the weight of the tree above. Banyan trees are found in hot climates and known for their extensive roots. Sometimes the roots grow so out of control that they eventually engulf the tree and kill it.

"Meet Suma, one of Melbourne Zoo's aging orangutans who suffers from arthritis. She was first diagnosed with the condition in 2013 where she was initially given daily medication to help relieve the pain. But on Thursday, amazing photographs were captured of the primate's thorough health examination by surgeons. Although is not unusual for middle-aged orangutans to have arthritis, doctors had to anaesthetise Suma in order to check how her condition has progressed over the past two years. Suma was treated by orthopaedic surgeon and associate professor Marino Pirpiris, who usually treats humans, and senior vet Dr Helen McCracken.

"An independent panel of concussion experts formed by the Football Association will meet for the first time in May. The panel of eight medical professionals will advise the FA on what can be done to make the game safer. Head injuries have been under greater scrutiny since Hugo Lloris refused to be substituted following a clash with Romelu Lukaku in 2013, with new rules introduced at the start of the current Barclays Premier League season stating a player suffering a head injury must leave the pitch and only be allowed to return if cleared by a club doctor. The FA have formed a concussion experts panel to help figure out how to make the game safer for players . Recently, the Jeff Astle Foundation has been raising awareness of the danger of long-term head injuries from playing football, with former West Brom player Astle having died in 2002 of a brain trauma caused by heading heavy leather footballs during his career. This weekend saw West Brom wear retro kits against Leicester on Saturday as the foundation was officially launched on Jeff Astle Day at The Hawthorns. The FA's head of performance services Dave Reddin believes the panel will help take safety in the sport to the next level. Jeff Astle died in 2002 after suffering a number of heavy blows to his head during his footballing career . 'The role of the expert panel is to monitor and advise the FA and other football bodies on the appropriate guidelines for all levels of the game,' he told www.thefa.com. 'We have seen an improvement in guidance and communication in this area of sports medicine but we are conscious there is potentially much more to do. 'The group will also be asked to help advise on how football's world governing body should examine and research any long-term effects on the brain through head injury or repeated concussion episodes. George North has been under the spotlight in recent months after suffering a number of concussions . 'I genuinely believe we now have the right people on board to be able to provide the right level of insight for such an important issue.' Reddin, the FA's head of medical services Dr Ian Beasley and representatives of the Premier League, Football League and Professional Footballers' Association will all observe the panel.","Football Association have created a panel made up of concussion experts .

"Dundee have vowed to stand by Paul McGowan after the bad boy midfielder was spared jail for a third assault on a policeman. But the Dens Park bad boy will miss two forthcoming games against former club Celtic because he is under house arrest. The 27-year-old has been placed on a 16-week restriction of liberty order which confines him to home between the hours of 7pm and 7am. And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night – before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman . Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week . 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added. Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court. McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.'

"As seasons go, this one has been pretty close to perfect for Bristol City. Runaway leaders in Sky Bet League One, they became the first team in the Football League to mathematically secure promotion on Tuesday night - and in sensational style. Hitting Bradford City for six of the best in their own backyard saw them triumphantly over the finishing line, although given their free-wheeling and free-scoring form the result really came as little surprise. Aden Flint celebrates with a bottle of Sky Bet champagne following Bristol City's promotion . City players are sprayed with champagne after securing promotion from League One . And there’s more. Add to that their memorable Johnstone’s Paint Trophy victory at Wembley last month - when Walsall were comfortably beaten 2-0 in the final - and you have a truly historic campaign for Steve Cotterill’s team. The season has been a personal triumph for tall, tattooed defender Aden Flint, who has played a central role in returning City to the Championship after two seasons away. His uncompromising defensive style has been combined with a knack of scoring from set-pieces, leading to 11 goals this season. Flint was on target at Wembley, fulfilling a childhood dream in the process, and also at Valley Parade on Tuesday. The Robins stars shower each other in their isotonic drinks following victory against Bradford City on Tuesday . Flint scores his side's fourth goal of the game as City earn an impressive 6-0 at Valley Parade . ‘When the players and the manager sat down at the start of the season, we had three aims,’ he tells Sportsmail. ‘The first was to win promotion back to the Championship, the second was to go up as champions and the third was to win the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. ‘We've managed to do two of the three and hopefully on Saturday we can achieve the other.’ That’s because City need another win to make absolutely sure they will be promoted as champions. The 25-year-old defender celebrates as the Robins earned promotion to the Championship in style . City manager Steve Cotterill celebrates promotion with a commemorative bottle of champagne . They currently lead Preston North End by 10 points but the Lancashire side have a game in hand and so three points are required against Coventry City at Ashton Gate this weekend. ‘Nobody wants that runners-up medal. The aim was always to go up as champions and we’re close to achieving that,’ Flint says. ‘We’ve had that winning habit and it’s a good one to get in to. We’ve been top of the league for most of the season and to drop down to second now would be disappointing.’ Seldom does one team dominate a division in this way. The lowest City have been placed is fifth and that was after their opening day fixture. The Robins have enjoyed a memorable season which has included lifting the Johnstone's Paint Trophy . Once again, Flint (right) made a huge contribution, giving City the lead against Walsall on March 22 . Flint wheels away in celebration after sending his side on their way to another memorable victory . Cotterill (left) and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas look delighted as they celebrate with the trophy at Wembley . They kicked on from there and set a ferocious pace throughout the autumn. Since September 13th, there has only been one week when they haven’t been top of the pile and they have lost just three games in all competitions since the New Year. Not that success has been reserved for the league. They reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, losing narrowly to Premier League West Ham, and claimed the Trophy too in front of over 40,000 of their fans at Wembley. Flint said: ‘I think any player dreams of scoring and winning at Wembley. There really isn't a better feeling in football. It is right up there with the highlights in my career but I would say that if we win on Saturday and go up as champions, that will push Wembley out.’ The defender’s goalscoring exploits have come as a surprise but he’s quick to credit his team-mates for the service: ‘I didn't expect to score as many as five to be honest! Flint holds the JPT with pride as he celebrates the 2-0 victory against Walsall last month . The defender was also named the Sky Bet League 1 Player of the Month for March . ‘I've just found myself in the right place at the right time to get on the end of all those set-pieces that have been delivered by the lads. ‘Aaron Wilbraham has bags of experience with him and has scored over 20 goals this season. Luke Freeman and Marlon Pack have been providing plenty of assists, not just for me but for everyone. ‘But everyone has chipped in, it has been a collective effort. The team spirit here has been the best I've ever experienced and it's been an enjoyable season.’ Promotion back to the Championship could be just the beginning of an exciting chapter in the club’s 118-year history.

Billionaire owner Steve Lansdown, who made his fortune in financial services, is funding a renovation of the club’s Ashton Gate home to expand the capacity to 27,000 and make it Premier League-ready. And, according to Flint, that’s precisely where the club is aiming: ‘We aim high and should be in the Championship, if not higher than that. ‘It's a massive city, I didn't realise how big it is until I moved here. It's surprising that the place hasn't got a Premier League team and maybe we can change that. ‘The chairman and the manager certainly have the ambition to achieve that. Seeing Bournemouth and Brentford doing so well in the Championship, nobody expected that and, who knows what will happen when we get there next season.’","Bristol City have earned promotion to the Championship .

"Damning footage has revealed the moment a Florida police officer shouted: 'Get on the f****** ground or you're dead,' moments before he shot a mentally ill man as he was running away. The family of Lavall Hall, released the shocking video which calls into question the Miami Gardens police department's account of the incident on February 15. The clip captured from the police car at the scene shows shell cases flying as a police officer shot the 25-year-old schizophrenic, who was black, on February 15. The police department said the officers were forced to shoot because Hall 'attacked' them with 'deadly force' using the broom - but the video footage appears to show him trying to flee the officers before he was fatally shot. Footage captured from within a police car at the scene show shell cases flying as police officer Eddie Trimino fatally shot schizophrenic 25-year-old Lavall Hall, who was black, outside his home in Miami Gardens . Attorneys for Hall's family released the 19 minutes of dash-cam video yesterday afternoon at a press conference and claim it shows Hall was being chased by police before he was shot at five times. Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week earlier and was suffering from a psychotic episode when his mother, Catherine Daniels, called police to take him to a mental health unit, reports Fusion. Hall's family have now filed a wrongful death lawsuit  in federal court in Miami against the city of Miami Gardens and the two police officers, Peter Ehrlich and Eddo Trimino. According to the complaint Ms Daniels had previously called police for help with her son, and the department was aware of his condition, alleging excessive use of force by police and wrongful death. An officer can be heard shouting 'Get on the f****** ground or you're dead' on the police car footage . Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week before the shooting . The footage shot from inside the car appears to show Hall running past the car with two officers in pursuit . 'Hall was unable to communicate, clearly did not understand what was going on, and was visibly scared,' it said. Two of the five bullets fired hit Hall Miami Gardens police told reporters in the days after the incident - explaining that Hall had attacked officers with the broom. But Hall's lawyers argue that the police used 'excessive force' after he ran away from them. His lawyers said Hall was holding the broomstick and dressed only in his underpants but the video shows he can be seen running from the police. Ms Daniels said at a news conference yesterday: 'I never thought they [were] going to kill my child, murder my child,' adding she was 'devastated' when she first saw the video. Catherine Daniels, Lavall's mother, is hugged by her cousin Alfonzo Hill at the news conference yesterday . 'He was standing outside just holding the broomstick in his hand,' Daniels said. 'And I told him, 'Baby, come back inside, it's cold.' As the video played at the news conference, one of the attorneys for the family said Ms Daniels can be heard telling police before the shooting, 'Please don't hurt my child, please' ABC news reported. Her attorney added: 'The officers had made up their minds that they were going to kill Lavall before this incident took place.' 'They killed him, murdered him,' said Melissa Edwards, the mother of Hall's daughter, at the news conference. An attorney for Eddo Trimino, the officer involved, told the Miami Herald the video indicated that the officer had shot out of fear. The lawyer for the officers argues they acted appropriately and claims Hall attacked them with deadly force . The video was released amid national protests over a series of deaths resulting from police use of force, most recently with another video showing a white South Carolina police officer shooting an apparently unarmed black man in the back. 'People are saddened and angered but also exasperated that we're again seeing the devaluation of black lives on streets of the United States,' said Muhammed Malik, organizer of the Miami Committee on State Violence. A spokesman for Florida State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told ABC News that the investigation is ongoing but they have concerns the video may endanger the investigation. Oscar Marrero, attorney for the officers, told ABC News: 'The officers were faced with a dangerous situation. 'They have already given statements to investigators indicating Mr. Hall struck them with a weapon and deadly force was used. 'The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene. The reliable evidence will establish Officers Trimino and Ehrlich acted appropriately.'","Lavall Hall, 25, was suffering psychotic episode when fatally shot by police .

"Terry Richardson is both one of the most famous and most controversial photographers in the fashion industry. Known as much for his racy - often pornographic - photo shoots as he is for the sexual assault allegations that have been made against him. And this week he faced accusations from the model Kate Upton that he had released footage of her dancing in a bikini without her permission. Scroll down for video . In a new interview with Vogue Kate Upton has revealed that the photographer Terry Richardson released footage of her dancing in a bikini in a video called 'Cat Daddy' without her permission . In an excerpt from an interview Kate did with Vogue in June 2014, it was claimed that Kate was not happy with Terry for releasing the 'Cat Daddy' footage which has been viewed more than 22 million times. In the one-minute-long film, which played a huge part in Kate's rise to fame, and which was uploaded to YouTube two years ago, Kate is seen dancing seductively in a tiny red string bikini - the model says the film was not meant to be for public consumption. Alexa Chung writes in Vogue: 'Terry Richardson found himself on the receiving end of her wrath in May 2012, when he uploaded his now infamous video of Upton in a teeny-weeny bikini doing the Cat Daddy, a dance craze that appears to involve a lot of grinding, ""paws"" aloft. 'The video received millions of hits on YouTube - not to mention a number of slow-motion versions for the more discerning customer - but, at the time, Upton was horrified because the behind-the-scenes video had been filmed for fun, not something she expected would make the final cut.' Terry has worked with Miley Cyrus (left) and Kim Kardashian (right) shooting them in his New York studio . Terry sat front row at the Alexander Wang fashion show in September 2013 alongside Kanye West . When asked about the situation Kate said: 'I was like, ""That was disrespectful, you could have told me!''.' But Upton also adds that there's no bad blood over the YouTube video anymore. 'Now, obviously, it's fine.' However this is not the first time that the 49-year-old photographer who has shot everyone from Miley Cyrus to Kim Kardashian in his New York studio has faced controversy. In fact, to say Richarson's reputation precedes him would be an understatement. He is the man who the Guardian once referred to as 'fashion's shameful secret'. Known to many as 'Uncle Terry,' one of his more controversial shots includes a woman giving a man - thought to be Terry - fellatio whilst he is dressed as a horse. Further sexual shots show Richardson completely nude dressed as the devil and with models who are sexually stimulating him with their hands or mouths. Terry is a regular on the red carpet at some of the biggest event sin the world, he is pictured here heading into the Vanity Fair Oscar's party . Indeed it's been more than ten years since Terry first hit the headlines for his questionable behaviour. In 2004 an intern named 'Alex' was photographed performing oral sex on the photographer while wearing a tiara labelled 'slut', something which the Terry described at the time as, 'It's Sesame Street!' Then in 2009, a model called Sena Cech claimed that Terry's assistant had asked her to give him a handjob, apparently telling her: 'Sena, can you grab his c*** and twist it real hard? He likes it when you squeeze it real hard and twist it.' In 2010 a model named Rie Rasmussen confronted Terry at a party in Paris after he placed pictures of her next to underage models in his book - in America, models under the age of 18 are considered underage. She said: 'He takes girls who are young, manipulates them to take their clothes off and takes pictures of them they will be ashamed of. 'They are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves.' Terry poses with Pharrell Williams (left) and James Franco (right) doing his signature thumbs up pose . Terry is good friends with Lady Gaga who has previously starred in his risque shoots - the pair were spotted hanging out together in New York in 2010 . Furthermore in 2010 one of the most disturbing allegations was made against Richardson. One model named Jamie Peck revealed that when she was 19 she worked with the photographer on two separate occasions. Jamie said that the second time she had her period and Terry asked 'to take my tampon out for him to play with. ""I love tampons!"" he said, in that psychotically upbeat way that temporarily convinces so many girls that what's fun for Uncle Terry is fun for them.' She refers to the fact that Terry wanted to make 'Tampon tea,' with her used sanitary product. Jamie revealed that she also sexually stimulated the photographer with her hand and was encouraged to do so not only by Terry but by his team after he took all of his clothes off. Terry once told the Observer of his shoots: 'A lot of it starts with me saying to a girl, ""Do you want to do nudes?"" And they're like, ""I don't want to be naked"". 'So I say, ""I'll be naked and you take the pictures. You can have the camera. You can have the phallus"".' Despite the allegations which have been levied against him Terry remains popular within the fashion industry pictured here with Ralph Lauren and Emmanuelle Alt . Last year model Sara Ziff spoke to Huffington Post Live about working with Terry and said: 'You are going to a casting to possibly shoot with him for Harper's Bazaar, whose one of his clients. 'That's a legitimate job, and he will ask you to take your clothes off for the casting and in some cases give him sexual favors. 'I have spoken with other models who have been in these situations, and he makes you feel like you're being a prude or you are somehow weird if you are not willing to just go with the flow because it's all cool. It's all fine.' She also revealed that there is a, 'ring of silence,' in the fashion industry as young women feel pressured to keep quite in order to further their careers. Richardson rarely responds to the allegations levied against him, but in March 2014 - after a model posted a piece on Reddit including a string of sexual assault accusations he wrote an open letter for Page Six. Charlotte Waters claimed that during her shoot Terry became aggressive and it 'became sexual act after sexual act.' Terry poses with Hilton sisters Paris (left) and Nicky (right) at the opening of his Terrywood exhibition in 2012 . In the letter, posted by the US gossip website, Richardson said that the accusations were 'false,' 'hate filled libelous tales.' He said: 'Enabled and protected by the freewheeling and often times anonymous nature of the Internet, people have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales about my professional and personal lives. 'In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors, because I have come to realize that absent my voice in the conversation, all that remain are the lies.' He said: 'I have never used an offer of work or a threat of rebuke to coerce someone into something that they did not want to do. 'I give everyone that I work with enough respect to view them as having ownership of their free will and making their decisions accordingly, and as such, it has been difficult to see myself as a target of revisionist history.' The model Daisy Lowe has previously defended Terry saying: 'He just exudes this sexual energy, so he doesn't need to ask girls to take off their clothes. Honestly, they just do it.' Terry poses with troubled actress Lindsay Lohan . Terry's lost numerous over the years and there are many people in the fashion industry who no longer work with him. These include shopping giants Target and H&M and brands such as Vogue, the New York Times and Equinox. The model Coco Rocha said in 2010: 'I've shot with [Terry Richardson], but I didn't feel comfortable and I won't do it again.' However Richardson remains popular within the celebrity circuit and is often seen partying with the likes of Kanye West and Pharrell Williams. And he still works with the likes of Harper's Bazaar and brands such as Supreme and Yves Saint Laurent. Designer Marc Jacobs once defended Terry as being, 'not ill-spirited.' Terry's career as a photographer came after he failed to make it as a punk rock musician. He got his first big break in 1994 with a shoot for Vibe magazine. Since then he has enjoyed a stint living in London working for publications such as The Face and Arena but now shoots mainly from his studio in New York. The photographer has also directly music videos in his time. One of the most controversial was for Lady Gaga. Terry shot the video for Do What U Want a collaboration between Gaga and R Kelly last year, however, the project was later scrapped. TMZ later obtained a clip of the highly sexualised film which one anonymous source told the New York Post was, 'literally an ad for rape.' The clip shows Gaga lying on a hospital bed, she is put under anesthetic by R Kelly who then fondles her body along with a series of models. MailOnline have contacted a representative for Terry for comment.","Terry Richardson is accused of releasing film without model permission .

"Lewis Hamilton has described his ongoing contract issues as 'a pain in the backside' as the reigning Formula One world champion has become mired in paperwork. Following the Malaysian Grand Prix 11 days ago Hamilton claimed his new deal with Mercedes, worth an estimated £21million per year, was '99.6 per cent done' and was now in the hands of his lawyers. But the fine print of the terms and conditions means the 30-year-old, who opted on this occasion - and for the first time in his career - to negotiate for himself without an agent, is becoming frustrated. Lewis Hamilton, who leads the world championship after two races, is pictured in the Shanghai paddock . The British sporting star was sporting two gold chains ahead of this week's Chinese Grand Prix . Lewis Hamilton, pictured at a Hugo Boss promotional event, says his Mercedes contract has not been sorted . The British world champion admits issues with paperwork has been 'a pain in the backside' According to Hamilton it now means 'it is unlikely' the contract will be signed ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. Speaking to Sky Sports News, Hamilton added: 'Obviously at the last race I said it would be done within a week. 'This is my first time negotiating myself and you don't know how many times I've had to read about 80 pages. 'It is so much reading and it is all in lawyer jargon, so it has been quite a pain in the backside to be honest.' Despite the issues with the new deal, Hamilton is favourite to return to the top step of the podium on Sunday at the Shanghai International Circuit. Hamilton is a three-time winner at the venue - including last year - whilst he has finished in the top three on three other occasions. Hamilton is surrounded by the media at the Hugo Boss event in Shanghai on Wednesday . Mercedes driver Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg (right) were beaten by Sebastian Vettel in Malaysia . Despite Ferrari winning their first race for almost two years last time out in Malaysia, with Sebastian Vettel at the wheel, the much cooler conditions in China should play into Mercedes' hands. 'Malaysia was a tough weekend,' said Hamilton. 'It always is with the heat, but with car problems on Friday, rain during qualifying on Saturday and a race which didn't go to plan on Sunday, that one was particularly challenging. 'Ultimately we made the best choices we could, but there is always room for improvement and we've been working hard to analyse everything for this next race in China. 'The circuit is one I really enjoy and it suits my driving style quite well. 'I won the race last year and have only finished outside of the podium places twice, so the target is definitely to build on that and get back to the front.'

"A magnitude 3.1 earthquake caused a sharp jolt to be felt across a well-populated area just north of Los Angeles. The US Geological Survey said in a preliminary report that the quake with a depth of about five miles happened just before 9pm last night, according to the Associated Press. It was centered about four miles north of San Fernando near Interstate 210. The epicentre of the quake was around four miles north of San Fernando near Interstate 210, according to the US Geological Survey . The earthquake caused a 'sharp jolt' to be felt in the San Fernando Valley (pictured) north of Los Angeles . The jolt was felt widely in the San Fernando Valley and parts of northern Los Angeles County. There was no reported damage or injuries and police and fire departments say there were no problems reported. The quake came three days after a magnitude 3.5 earthquake hit the west Los Angeles neighborhood of Baldwin Hills. It happened around 9.17pm and reverberated across the city. Residents on social media described it as a 'quick jolt'. Earlier in the day at 4.35pm a smaller 2.5 magnitude quake hit the same area. That quake was initially reported as a 2.9 magnitude tremor, but was later downgraded by the US Geological Survey. There were no reports of injuries or damages from either incident. Los Angelenos are used to such small tremors, due to the city's positioning on several fault lines.","US Geological Survey said quake just before 9pm had depth of five miles .

"Matej Vydra's superb volley helped keep Watford on the trail for automatic promotion as they recorded a 2-0 victory over a spirited Millwall side, who sank further into relegation trouble. Millwall were on top for much of the first half but a stunning hit from Vydra saw the Hornets take in a slender advantage at half-time. Aiden O'Brien was a constant menace for the hosts - who had an early penalty shout turned down - but Watford were far too clinical, as Adlene Guedioura slotted a vital second goal shortly after the break. Matej Vydra fires home his stunning volley from the edge of the box to put Watford into the lead . Vydra is congratulated by his Watford team-mates as his goal moved the club towards automatic promotion . Millwall keeper David Forde was called into action in the first minute, doing well to deny Troy Deeney after the striker had broken the offside trap. The Lions quickly gathered momentum and despite some promising approach play - with O'Brien at the heart of much of it - failed to create any meaningful opportunities. And the home side had a legitimate penalty shout after Ben Watson bundled over of Ed Upson, as the midfielder jinked in from the right, but that went unpunished. After Watford weathered the storm, Vydra produced his moment of inspiration by volleying in from just outside the box in the 26th minute. Forde was helpless as the Czech thumped the ball into the far corner from Ikechi Anya's cross. Millwall, playing with renewed hope of survival after a first win in 10 on Good Friday, then squandered a golden opportunity when Martyn Woolford failed to pick out O'Brien lurking unmarked two yards from goal. Adlene Guedioura celebrates in front of the travelling fans after making it 2-0 and sealing the three points . Troy Deeney, who went close early on, is tackled by Millwall's Shaun Williams during the Championship clash . The hosts also ended the half in the ascendency as Jimmy Abdou's scuffed shot was well saved by Heurelho Gomes. Millwall huffed and puffed as they had in the first-half, but created few chances of any note. They came closest to boosting their slim survival hopes when O'Brien robbed Matthew Connolly of possession, but Gomes saved well. In the 54th minute, Anya - as he did for Vydra's opener - created Watford's second. The Scottish winger combined with Troy Deeney to outfox Shaun Cummings and Sid Nelson before squaring for Guedioura, who tucked away a six-yard tap-in. Deeney dives in to stop Dan Harding getting past, as Millwall slipped closer to relegation . It was a goal that Watford's second-half performance deserved, as they overcame Millwall's superiority before the break to showcase the quality that puts them on the brink of the Premier League. They twice came close to adding to the lead, as first Vydra then Odion Ighalo ran free on goal. Forde managed to gather the ball at Vydra's feet and then saved agilely from substitute Ighalo. Avoiding defeat would have equalled their longest unbeaten run of the season at four games, but the Lions more than likely need to go without a loss in all five of their remaining fixtures to stand any chance of beating the drop.","Matej Vydra converts Ikechi Anya cross after 26 mintues .

"A youngster admiring his catch was left surprised when the fish jumped up and slapped him in the face. Quinn Patrick was on a fishing trip with his dad at Snow Lake, Indiana when the pair caught a bowfin, videoed lying lifeless on a concrete dock. Crouching over the fish, Quinn deliberates whether someone should put it back in the water. When suddenly the Bowfin propels itself from the ground and slaps the youngster straight in the face with its large tail. The sound of the fish making impact with the youngster’s face is not dissimilar to a sound effect used in a cartoon. Recoiling, Quinn stumbles backwards in shock as his dad begins laughing – prompting the youngster to laugh along with him. Quinn Patrick was on a fishing trip with his dad at Snow Lake, Indiana when the pair caught a Bowfin . The young boy then states: ‘Dad there’s blood on him,’ and his father replies by gently explaining that the fish got hurt. Worried, the youngster replies rather sweetly: ‘By me?’ Before his dad reassures him that he is not to blame. The video concludes with the father discussing the size of the Bowfin’s teeth. The Bowfin propels itself from the ground and slaps the youngster straight in the face with its large tail . Bowfin are native to North America and are commonly found in east America, south Ontario and Quebec. They are demersal freshwater fish, which means they live and feed at the bottom of lakes and seas. And are piscivore, which means they are carnivorous and predominately eat other fish. Common names for the fish include mudfish, dogfish, mud pike, griddle, grinnel, cypress trout and choupique.

"An exotic bird in Brazil was recorded making incredible sounds that wouldn’t be out of place on a video game. The Curl-crested Jay, which resides at the Criadouro Onca Pintada breeding centre, is native to South America and is known to be a good mimic of other birds and man-made sounds. With the ever-growing presence of human’s in their natural habitats, the bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song. Videoed behind a fence, the bird initially makes a sinister noise like a distorted voice before creating an almost digital sound. Following this the bird makes a noise that sounds like running water before a Space Invaders style tune emerges from it. Discussing the video, companion parrot behavioural expert Greg Glendell spoke with MailOnline about the various theories regarding the function of these sounds. The Curl-crested Jay is native to South America and resides at the Criadouro Onca Pintada breeding centre . ‘Several groups of birds have a lifelong ability to learn to reproduce new sounds; notably parrots, starlings and crows,’ said Mr Glendell. The particular Jay belongs to the Crow/Corvidae family. ‘Some birds may use them to impress a mate or their peers within their flock,’ he added. ‘Most birds using mimicry are highly social species, with a complex vocal repertoire, which includes innate calls and learnt calls. The bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song . ‘As social species they use their calls as language. There are often regional dialects within bird groups. So the same species shows differences in its calls across its range.’ Mr Glendell also noted that sometimes captive birds confined to cages use their ability to mimic to relieve their boredom and ensure responses from their owners. The original video was uploaded to YouTube account: Swiatoczamigoski by a Polish-based blogger who has spent some time volunteering at the Brazilian breeding centre.

"The stage was set for the coronation of King Jimmy on Tuesday but West Indies stubbornly refused to hurry him to his throne. The perfect script for this first Test saw Anderson taking the four wickets he needed to become the most prolific bowler in England’s history in his 100th game with record holder Sir Ian Botham here and waiting to crown his successor. But West Indies made Anderson wait on an attritional day that was in sharp contrast to the excitement provided by the first of this crucial series. Certainly Anderson would not have expected to play a more significant role with bat than ball on the second day of this first Test as West Indies did much to make up for their profligacy in the last two sessions of the first. When Anderson, watched by his wife, two daughters and parents, strode out to bat England had lost five wickets for 20 runs and were in danger of wasting the initiative handed to them largely by Ian Bell’s century. But ‘the Burnley Lara’, of course, is a more than useful No 11 these days and came within 19 runs of a Test century at Trent Bridge last year, so it should not have been a surprise to see him sticking around with Chris Jordan. When the pair were separated after a last-wicket stand of 38 England had moved to within a run of the score of 400 that should have been their minimum target when they were well placed on 341 for four on the first evening. Then it was a question of whether this unassuming Lancastrian could move from 380 wickets to 384 and overtake Botham, who was on hand apparently with a nice bottle of red wine waiting to celebrate, at the top of England’s Test tree. Only it was not quite as simple as that. Modern Test pitches in the Caribbean are notoriously slow and turgid and it was never going to be a case of simply sitting back and waiting for a West Indian collapse. Jimmy Anderson (right) is still three wickets away from breaking Sir Ian Botham's England record . Ben Stokes was England's first man to be dismissed on day two when he edged to Jason Holder in the slips . Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Stokes to take West Indies' first wicket of the day in Antigua . James Tredwell edges a delivery from Holder behind as he is dismissed for eight . Anderson had surprisingly chosen to bowl from the Curtly Ambrose End where the strong cross-wind that blows across this ground would in theory assist in-swing more than his more dangerous out-swinger. But Anderson, who had led England out on to the field in his landmark Test, generally knows what he is doing and successfully targeted the outside edge of the left-handed Devon Smith’s bat with a beauty. It was to prove his only success of a frustrating day. Anderson could make no further inroads and was surprisingly limited to just four overs after tea as the other England bowlers were forced to share the load and three more wickets. Jordan had looked good in making an unbeaten 21 and now he was to again prove himself an all-round cricketer of rich but raw promise, taking the wicket of Darren Bravo and later claiming an outstanding diving slip catch off James Tredwell to send back his old Barbados schoolmate Kraigg Brathwaite. Stuart Broad, who has not been at his best since returning from injury at the World Cup, had earlier ended Marlon Samuels hopes of extending his purple patch against England and West Indies were on the back foot at 99 for four. Jos Buttler fell for a duck despite facing 22 deliveries on the second morning at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium . West Indies fast bowler celebrates after dismissing Buttler for a duck on day two of the first Test . Stuart Broad was England's ninth wicket to fall before Anderson fell for 20 with the score on 399 . Anderson celebrates after seeing Devon Smith edge behind to Buttler to take England's first wicket . Buttler makes the catch from Anderson's bowling to dismiss Smith for 11 and leave West Indies 19 for one . Yet the evergreen Shiv Chanderpaul, who could easily have gone to his first ball, settled in to his old idiosyncratic routine and hung on to the close with the far less secure Jermaine Blackwood, who had a major escape when Stokes had him well caught at slip only to be denied because he had over-stepped. Stokes has previous in this regard, having been denied his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide when he snared Brad Haddin only to overstep again and there is simply no excuse to lose a wicket in this way. The Durham hot-head was clearly ticking afterwards and it can only be hoped that he did not encounter any lockers when he returned to the dressing room, having broken his wrist punching one in Barbados last year. West Indies finished on 155 for four having had the better of the second day and leaving England with much to do if they are to secure the win here that would be so important to them. West Indies were batting earlier than expected because of a poor performance from England in the morning as they replicated their struggles of the first session of the match and crumbled against good pace bowling. Chris Jordan celebrates after dismissing Darren Bravo, who edged behind to Buttler, for 10 . Broad celebrates dismissing Marlon Samuels for 33 to leave West Indies on 89 for three . Tredwell celebrates after seeing Jordan hold onto a catch at first slip to dismiss Kraigg Brathwaite . Stokes was perfectly placed to score his second Test hundred but once he had steered Jerome Taylor straight to gully England worryingly had no answer to what remains a more than useful West Indies pace trio. Most disturbing of all was the performance of Broad, who was once a good enough batsman to score a Test hundred at Lord’s against Pakistan. Now he looks a shadow of a player once thought of as a potential No 7 for England and again looked like he had been affected by being hit in the face by India’s Varun Aaron at Old Trafford last summer. Broad was honest enough to admit during the World Cup that he had had nightmares about the incident that left his nose broken but he was also confident that he was getting back to his best with the bat. It did not seem that way here as he ducked a couple of short balls from Kemar Roach and then, caught on the back foot, slapped a fuller ball to gully. When he fell and England had slumped to 361 for nine the Test was back in the balance but Anderson and Jordan kept England’s noses in front until the wait for Anderson’s big moment began. We are all still waiting. England, meanwhile, should confirm on Wednesday that Moeen Ali will join the squad in time for the second Test in Grenada after successfully coming through his return after injury with Worcestershire. It could mean that Adil Rashid, disappointing in the warm-up in St Kitts, is released to return to Yorkshire, who have been frustrated by the sight of four of their players being in the England party but not included in this first Test.","West Indies reach 155 for four at stumps on day two of first Test .

They are big and a bit different to what I have been used to but I have improved with every game.’ Denayer has been an instant hit at the club and formed a formidable partnership with Virgil van Dijk .","Ronny Deila confirms Jason Denayer won't play in Champions League .

"A seller on eBay has claimed that he has former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez's jailhouse identification card - and he's trying to auction it off. The eBay listing, posted Friday, showed a laminated badge featuring a photo of Hernandez, 25, and identifying information, including his height, weight and birth date. Hernandez is currently in prison during his trial for the the June 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister. Lloyd was shot six times in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home. Scroll down for video . An eBay user posted what appears to be laminated badge that featured a photo of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez and identifying information about the 25-year-old . The listing on eBay claimed that it was selling Hernandez's Suffolk County jail ID card, according to CBS Boston. 'I was in jail with Aaron Hernandez the for patriot super star.. I happen to com across his jail id (sic),' the user posted. The starting price for the card was $500, though there were no bids on the item when the auction was removed from the site on Saturday. It is unclear whether the user or eBay staff removed the auction item from the site. The listing, which was deleted on Saturday and had zero bids, was posted by a user who claimed he was in jail with Hernandez . Jurors in Hernandez's trial deliberated for nearly 20 hours over the last week considering whether to convict the former football player. They return to court on Monday. In addition to the murder charge, they must decide whether to convict him on charges of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. Two friends of Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, are also charged with murder and will be tried separately. Hernandez is currently in prison during his trial for the the June 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister . Prosecutors contend that the three men, in the early hours of June 17, 2013, picked Lloyd up at his home in Boston and drove him to the industrial park where his body was found riddled with bullets later that day. During the trial, which began in January and featured more than 130 witnesses, prosecutors showed video footage of Hernandez coming and going from his home around the time of Lloyd's death. Investigators did not recover the gun that was used to shoot Lloyd, a .45-caliber Glock pistol. Hernandez faces a charge of murder and two firearms-related violations. If convicted of first-degree murder, he would be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. A second-degree murder conviction would lead to a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 15 years. Hernandez had been a rising star in the National Football League with a $41million contract when he was arrested on June 26, 2013. The Patriots dropped him within hours.","An eBay listing posted Friday showed a laminated badge featuring a photo of Hernandez and identifying information including height and weight .

"Think you've got a good memory? Think again. Drawing a world map from scratch would already be considered a difficult feat, let alone taking on the near-impossible task of doing it from memory. Yet, images have gone viral of a New Yorker accomplishing exactly that, and it just so happens that it's an 11-year-old boy. The 11-year-old boy with autism is seen drawing the intricate map of the world from scratch . A professor in New York invited her 11-year-old autistic son to one of her classes, during which he got up on a chair and drew the world map from memory. A student took the photos and her father posted them on the online community, Reddit, as user Bobitis. Bobitis explained: 'He is the son of one of my daughter's professors. He came into the classroom today and did this.' In the images, the youth is seen kneeling on a chair in order to reach the whiteboard, with his pen held to the extremely detailed map. The world map was highly accurate and even included details such as political borders and tiny coastal islands . Not only is the map accurate, with some major countries labelled, but the high level of detail extends to the inclusion of political borders and even tiny coastal islands.

"All eyes were on John Terry this afternoon as he made the short trip across London to face QPR in the west London derby. Loftus Road was the place where the Chelsea skipper racially abused then QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in October 2011. Ferdinand's brother Rio was injured for Sunday's match. Terry, who has been a crucial part of Jose Mourinho's Premier League title bid this season, played the full 90 minutes however as Chelsea scraped a 1-0 win, but how did he get on... John Terry (centre) celebrates at the final whistle with Didier Drogba (left) and Branislav Ivanovic . Reception . There was a hostile introduction for Terry as the teams lined up, before a cacophony of boos rang out around the ground as he touched the ball in the opening minute. There was, however, no noticeable reaction from any of Chris Ramsey's players until Charlie Austin made himself known to the centre-back late in the first half with a robust challenge. Terry experienced a hostile atmosphere at Loftus Road, but put in a good display at the back for Chelsea . Temperament . It was a moment to cherish for the QPR fans as Austin responded to an arm across the chest by shoving Terry to the ground off the ball. The Chelsea skipper momentarily lost his cool and berated the assistant referee to the delight of the crowd. His battle with the striker continued into the second half, with the pair taken aside for a word after squaring up to each other but it was Terry who had the last laugh as Cesc Fabregas' late equaliser sealed three points. The Chelsea captain rises above Bobby Zamora to head the ball away as he dominated at the back . Performance . The former England captain was rarely troubled by Bobby Zamora and Charlie Austin. Although the pair were prominent throughout, a lack of pace meant Terry and partner Gary Cahill were able to deal with everything thrown at them even though they were bailed out by Thibaut Cortouis at times. There was a nervy moment in the first half when a long ball over the top caught out the 34-year-old, and he was lucky his misjudged touch didn't cost the side as Cahill covered, but it was a fairly comfortable day for the defender. The Chelsea captain was made to stretch occasionally, but he and Gary Cahil dealt with QPR's threat well . Conduct . Despite an obvious attempt from Austin to get under the skin of Terry, he largely ignored the attention surrounding him and focused solely on leading his side to an important win while handling the occasion with maturity. There were wild celebrations from Terry at the final whistle as he responded to the constant jeers. Terry's combative encounter with Charlie Austin attracted the attention of referee Andre Marriner .","John Terry racially abused Anton Ferdinand at the ground in October 2011 .

"Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich, a period Jose Mourinho says has been positive not only for the club but for English football as a whole. Some would quibble with the second part of that statement, but Mourinho says that too will change. If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich’s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea’s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich . Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005 . The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012 . Mourinho also believes Chelsea’s adherence to FFP — ‘compared with other clubs and owners who didn’t want to play under the rules’, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City — positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for £140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich’s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge . The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004 . ‘He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,’ said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. ‘Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that’s very, very good. I think it’s important and I think it’s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. ‘The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn’t accept the rules and didn’t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003 . ‘Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. ‘Now we are going through a period where it’s just about Gary Cahill. But we have some young boys coming into the first-team. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is already here. Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].’ Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad . Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come . Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England’s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season’s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March . Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club . He added: ‘Don’t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don’t want to speak again about that game. ‘Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. ‘Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don’t have to be watching Man City against Man United. We don’t have to be waiting for what they are going to do. It’s just us.’ Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the winning goal during Sunderland's 2-1 win against Chelsea last season .

"UEFA have set a potentially dangerous precedent by ruling that the final 18 seconds of England Women's U19 European Championships qualifier against Norway will be replayed after a refereeing mistake. The Elite Round Group 4 qualifier will be restarted at 9:45pm at Seaview stadium in Belfast on Thursday with the match resuming with England retaking a penalty in the 96th minute at 2-1 down. England's 3-1 Group 4 victory against Switzerland on Thursday afternoon means the Young Lionesses will qualify for the European Championships if the penalty is scored and the match is drawn 2-2. England are awarded a penalty during their European U19 Women's Championships qualifier in Belfast . Referee Marija Kurtes points to the spot as England are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute . Leah Williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against Norway . Williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team-mate Rosella Ayane (circled) has entered the box . Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner . German referee Marija Kurtes officiating a women's Bundesliga match in Munich last month . Jenna Dear scored twice at the Seaview Stadium while Leah Williamson, who is set to take the last minute spot-kick against Norway, earned some practice as she scored past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot from 12-yards. Norway are second in the group following an impressive 8-1 win against Northern Ireland, but crucially have a slightly inferior goal difference meaning the spot-kick will give England a place in the European Championship finals in Israel. The astonishing decision has been taken for the first time in a UEFA competition following an FA appeal after the referee had wrongly denied England the opportunity to retake the penalty during Saturday's match following encroachment. England midfielder Williamson thought she had equalised after slotting the ball into the bottom-right corner but team-mate Rosella Ayane had entered the box too early and German referee Marija Kurtes disallowed the goal. However, instead of ordering it to be retaken, 28-year-old Kurtes - who was named Referee of the Year by the German Football Association (DFB) in 2014 - wrongly awarded an indirect free-kick to Norway. According to the laws of the game, a penalty should be retaken if it entered the goal after encroachment by team-mates of the player taking the kick. England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway . But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short . Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake . But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating . German referee Kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on Saturday . April 4 - England 1-2 Norway (Match to be replayed from 96th min on April 9 at 9:45pm) April 4 - Switzerland 1-0 Northern Ireland . April 6 - Norway 2-0 Switzerland . April 6 - England 9-1 Northern Ireland . April 9 - Switzerland 1-3 England . April 9 - Northern Ireland 1-8 Norway . A scene of apparent confusion followed England's wild celebrations as Kurtes explained her decision. Williamson had grabbed back the ball to retake the penalty and placed it on the penalty spot before realising an indirect free-kick had been awarded. Two Norwegian players then embraced as they celebrated the decision. A UEFA statement read: 'The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body has ordered the match to be replayed. 'The replay of the match should be carried out as follows: . 'The match will be replayed from the minute the penalty kick was awarded to the Football Association at the European Women's Under-19 Championship 2015 match between England vs Norway played on April 4, 2015, and extended according to the discretion of the referee. 'The penalty kick shall be retaken by the Football Association. 'According to the Laws of the Game (Law 14), a team-mate of the player taking the kick infringes the Laws of the Game: . - the referee allows the kick to be taken . - if the ball enters the goal, the kick is retaken . - if the ball does not enter the goal, the referee stops play and the match is restarted with an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the infringement occurred . 'As the ball entered the goal, the kick should have been re-taken. Thus the CDEB ordered that the remaining time of the match should be replayed in accordance with article 6 (e) and 7 (2) of the disciplinary regulations. Williamson scored from the penalty spot during England's 3-1 victory against Switzerland on Thursday . Jenna Dear (right) scores with a header as England inched closer to European Championship qualification . 'The match is scheduled to take place at the Seaview Stadium in Belfast on Thursday at 9:45pm local time with another referee. 'Teams must field the same players which were on the pitch at that moment. Any of these players can take the penalty kick.' An FA spokesperson said: 'After England Women U19s' match against Norway on Saturday, April 4, the FA lodged an appeal to UEFA following a disallowed penalty. 'Due to an incorrect application of the game's laws by the match referee, UEFA have ordered the match to be replayed from the point of the penalty. 'The remainder of the match will be played on Thursday at 9.45pm at the same stadium – Seaview, Belfast.' Williamson is congratulated by her England team-mates after scoring past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot . Former Everton and England captain Mo Marley is head coach of the national women's U19 team . Although it will only last 18 seconds, officials, stewards and paramedics will all be required to attend. Admission is free. England, coached by former national captain Mo Marley, were 2-0 down to Norway on Saturday before substitute Ayane pulled one back in the 87th minute to give her side hope of claiming a point. However, Wiliiamson's penalty was disallowed and the match ended in defeat. England brushed off the disappointment on Monday, though, with a 9-1 win against Northern Ireland. Both England and Norway must start the match with the same 11 players who finished Saturday's match. However, a different player can take the penalty. The decision further complicates the already complex qualification process for July's finals after UEFA had announced that Norway had sealed their place. After an initial qualifying round last year, the Elite Round is comprised of six groups of four teams playing at locations across Europe. The six group winners and best-placed runner-up - decided by the best record against the first and third-placed teams in the groups - go through to join hosts Israel at the showpiece event in July. England women's senior head coach Mark Sampson tweeted: 'Difficult circumstances for our @england U19. I have been proud that in challenging circumstances you have conducted yourselves superbly & represented your country with great pride. 'Regardless of final outcome you should be very proud. We are very proud of you.' September 2005 - World Cup qualifier - Uzbekistan vs Bahrain . Uzbekistan had won the opening leg of the Asian zone fourth-round play-off 1-0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching. Rather than retaking the penalty, an indirect free-kick was wrongly awarded by Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida to Bahrain and the game ended with a one-goal margin. Uzbekistan called for an investigation but were left furious after FIFA ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid. It proved to have a major impact as it was Bahrain who eventually went through with a 1-1 away goals victory, though they were later beaten in the AFC-CONCACAF play-off.

The footage shows the mysterious dictator waving and smiling to the crowds, with his right-hand wrist wrapped up in a white bandage. Scroll down for video . Pictures from state-controlled media show the dictator smiling and waving, with his right wrist in bandages . It is the latest in a string of presumed health problems for the North Korean dictator, aged 32 . According to a South Korean official, quoted in Sky News, Jong-Un must have suffered the injury in the recent past. 'He didn't have the injury when he inspected a military unit on April 4,' the government spokesman said, 'so it must be recent.' Doctors who have examined the photos say it is unlikely that he has fractured his wrist, and judged it to be a minor injury. The state of Kim Jong-Un's health is the subject of fascination around the globe, as he presides over the world's most secretive state.

Louis van Gaal's side have performed admirably this season and are all but guaranteed Champions League . 'The performances from United in the past month have been absolutely outstanding in any season. 'Forget the fact that in this season they are not going to win the league, in any season the level of performance they have shown in this last month has been of a hard standard.'

'We were always very fixed in our formation,' the England coach said of his time at Old Trafford. 'Louis van Gaal through necessity has had to change his formation to get different people in at different times. In the last four weeks he has settled into a 4-3-3. It has worked really well and the players looked comfortable in the system. 'He said at the start of the season that his team would get better, they always get better and he has stuck to his word. He said they would be in the Champions League and I think he will be correct.'","Gary Neville believes Manchester United can get a result at Chelsea .

The St. Louis freshman men’s crew were captured on video rowing under a bridge by filmmaker Benjamin Rosenbaum, as he walks up the dock to greet them. The first year students at Washington University were rowing at Creve Coeur Lake in Missouri . Initially everything appears to be calm, until slight splashes can be seen rippling in the water around the boat. The filmmaker lets out a laugh as the ripples get larger and more frequent and fish can be seen leaping from the water. Suddenly all hell breaks loose and without any real warning hundreds of fish jump from the water and hurl themselves at the boat.

The filmmaker continues to laugh as the students on the boat scream and the shield themselves from the carp. Fish can also be seen jumping into a small boat that overtakes the rowers and quickly speeds out of shot. Eventually the water begins calming once again and less of the fish emerge from the water as the boat comes in to dock. Asian carp are known for getting easily frightened by boats and leaping from water . The water becomes calm again as the majority of fish stop jumping when the boat reaches the dock .

"Jack Colback admits Newcastle United's supporters are being left short-changed as the club's sorry season threatens to plunge new depths. The 25-year-old says he is already looking forward to next term given the slump in form which has seen the Magpies lose five on the spin and score just one goal in eight hours. But before this season is out Colback and his team-mates will have to endure planned protests with a boycott of Sunday's match against Spurs set to see thousands stay away from St James’ Park. Jack Colback (left) says the Newcastle United fans deserve more following another disappointing defeat . Newcastle lost six in a row at the same stage 12 months ago and the atmosphere inside the ground was toxic during the final home game as fans targeted manager Alan Pardew and owner Mike Ashley. One year on and John Carver’s threadbare squad is in real danger of being sucked into a relegation scrap should their ruinous run continue. And Colback accepts that their current effort is far from the standard required. The midfielder was one of the only players who deserves credit this season and put in a shift against Liverpool . ‘This is a huge club which deserves more than it is getting at the moment,’ said the midfielder, who was part of another lacklustre display during Monday’s 2-0 defeat at Liverpool. ‘It’s a difficult situation we’re in – we’ve not got a lot of players. ‘But we can’t feel sorry for ourselves. We’ve got to make sure we perform this weekend. ‘If we play like we did in spells (at Liverpool) then we can pick up the wins we need to get this season out of the way and look to progress next year.’ Carver says Ashley has promised him that the squad will undergo major renovation work this summer. Moussa Sissoko was sent off for a terrible tackle on Lucas Leiva to add to John Carver's woes . The head coach has raised concerns about the character of the players after they lost a fifth straight Tyne-Wear derby last weekend. But Colback said: ‘The character is there in the team, even though we didn’t show it last week (at Sunderland). ‘We had to show a reaction at Liverpool because last week was nowhere near good enough. ‘The minimum we could do is be better than the last game and I thought we were. ‘We should have done better with their first goal and it was a shame we took until then to react. We created the odd chance. ‘The penalty decision (Ayoze Perez was fouled by Dejan Lovren with the score at 1-0) was massive, it might have been a different game if we’d got that. Nothing seems to be going our way at the moment. Ayoze Perez (centre) was denied a stonewell penalty by under-fire referee Lee Mason in the first half . ‘But we’re not going to get any sympathy, we’ve still lost the game.’ Carver, meanwhile, will turn to Siem de Jong in a bid to save the season. The £6million signing was only days away from returning after a five-month layoff with a torn thigh muscle when he suffered a collapsed lung in February. De Jong – who has made just one Premier League start – was expected to miss the remainder of the campaign given that it was the second time he had fallen victim to the problem. However, the 26-year-old returned to training earlier this month and will now feature for United’s reserves when they entertain Derby County this evening. Siem de Jong is in line to feature for the under-21's on Wednesday and his return would be a welcome boost .","Jack Colback admits he feels sorry for the Newcastle United supporters .

"Graeme McDowell insisted he would never consider not playing the Masters despite another frustrating experience at Augusta National. McDowell carded a final round of 73 on Sunday to finish six over par and is now a combined 24 over for his eight appearances in the year's first major championship.

'You have to be a 'front-edge' putter like Bubba (Watson), I've never seen anyone roll in putts from six feet slower than Bubba. You have to drop them in and I have to adapt to do that round here.' McDowell's score could have been even worse after he was initially given a one-shot penalty for moving his marker as he attempted to swat a bee away from his ball on the third green. However, European Tour chief referee John Paramor rescinded the penalty a few holes later and McDowell added: 'I said could he follow me the rest of the day because he was the first guy who has saved me a shot in a while.'

"Andy Lee will leave New York with his head held high and a burgeoning reputation firmly intact. A dramatic, frenetic 12 rounds here saw the Irishman sent sprawling in the very first against the dangerous Peter Quillin, the man who vacated the WBO middleweight title Lee won so gloriously in Las Vegas last December before the result was deemed a draw. It was the first time the reigning champion had gone the distance. No mean feat considering he fought for a lengthy period with a strained biceps muscle in his left arm. Peter Quillin (left) and Andy Lee stand with the referee after the judges declared their bout a draw . The two fighters embrace following their exciting 12-round contest in Brooklyn on Saturday night . Lee retains his WBO belt after Quillin failed to make the required 160lbs weight on Friday . Quillin's unbeaten record remains intact following the tie though he threw fewer punches than Lee . The two fighters congratulate each other at the end of the 12 rounds, which were judged to be a draw . With Quillin dramatically failing to make the required weight of 160lbs on Friday, Lee strode out in front of a healthy crowd knowing whatever happens, his belt wasn't going anywhere. Yet this was still one hell of a contest and when the judges correctly called it a tie, no-one was really arguing. While it was scored 113-112, 112-113, 113-113, the statistics told a different story . Lee threw more punches (299-267) and connected with greater frequency (113-103). It was a warrior-like display. Not maybe enough to have destroyed Quillin's unbeaten record, but impressively solid and energetic. Lee, however, was hard on himself. 'It was a tough fight, he dropped me at the start because I was lazy, ' he said. 'I had the momentum late on. I understand with two knockdowns people may have thought he won but I could have done better.' Billy Joe Saunders is the mandatory challenger and looks the likeliest next opponent. Another meeting with Quillin, although intriguing with the title on the line, is highly unlikely. Lee was knocked to the canvas by Quillin during the very first round of the contest in New York . Lee admitted he had been 'lazy' in the early stages of the fight, leading to his knockdown and standing count . Quillin is ordered to the corner after Lee falls later in the bout . 'If my next fight is Quillin it should be in Ireland. He has an Irish surname. Maybe he has some ancestors there,' smiled Lee, who will now look forward to a few weeks off to recharge the batteries before making his next move. Only the American will know how, even though he last fought a year ago, his team somehow allowed their man to miss the weight so spectacularly. The 31-year-old was over by almost a pound-and-a-half. Trainer Adam Booth thought he looked over the limit in the build-up. Lee would never display such a lack of professionalism. The 30-year-old in the form and shape of his life. Title fight or not, this was the Irishman's chance to show he belongs at boxing's top table. A polished display was the order of the evening to ensure his rapier-like trajectory continues this year. Quillin insisted before the clash it would be like a chess match. He was right, yet playing with Kings or Queens don't often lead to the explosion of power which sent Lee spiralling to the canvas at the end of the first round. Quillin's right connects with Lee's right shoulder during the Middleweight bout . Lee and Quillin exchange punches at close quarters during the tight contest . Lee is put onto the pack foot as Quillin lines up a punch with his right . Quillin's right hook rocked the Irishman who was given a standing count. It was just the second time he'd hit the floor, taking in both his amateur and professional career. No wonder Lee looked dazed. The American was quickly showing why he's the proud owner of an unblemished record. A razor-sharp combination had Lee reeling again but the Limerick man is a true warrior. A far better third saw Quillin on the backfoot for the first time as, after such a frenetic start, everything began to calm somewhat. Lee went down again and although it was originally scored as a knockdown it later emerged Quillin had stepped on his foot. If the scorecard had taken that into account, a draw could well have turned into an Irish win. Nevertheless, Lee needed some respite. The Brooklyn crowd unleashed some booing to display their displeasure at both fighters standing their ground. Yet the Irishman, who won his last two fights by coming from behind to land the killer blow, wouldn't have care a jot. Heading into the sixth, Quillin was ahead in the eyes of the judges. Lee, the master of coming from behind to snatch victory, needed something special. Quillin connects with Lee's cheek with a crunching right . Quillin again makes contact but over the course of the whole fight, he landed fewer punches . The comeback came at the end of the seventh, a crunching right leaving a very open Quillin tumbling. It was the first time he'd been down in his career. Lee, though, needed more heading into the tenth. The final rounds were dramatic without ever really looking terminal for either fighter. And when the last bell rang, Lee and the amiable Quillin hugged and showed a deep admiration towards each other which has been evident all week. 'The judges see it their way and I respect the decision, ' said the American. 'There is a first time for everything, I got knocked down and thankfully I got up. There is no perfect story, I come from nothing so to have something is a blessing as is going home to a family I love. 'Respect to Andy Lee though.'","Judges scored the contest 113-112, 112-113, 113-113 - a tie .

"If Jermain Defoe wasn't already sure how much football meant to the people of the north east, he found out on Thursday evening. Just days after scoring the winner for Sunderland in the Tyne/Wear derby, the striker received a somewhat mixed reception when he was introduced to the crowd at a wrestling event in Newcastle. The 32-year-old waved to the crowd at the WWE event, but the response he received was full of boos. The WWE's show in Newcastle was their latest on their tour of the UK after WrestleMania.

On Sunday Defoe scored a stunning volley from outside the penalty area to send Sunderland to a 1-0 victory over Newcastle in a feisty derby at the Stadium of Light. Perhaps it was a mistake by staff from the wrestling company to parade the Sunderland striker so close after the event.

"Newcastle stand-in skipper Moussa Sissoko is facing disciplinary action after he was sent off following a reckless challenge on Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva during Monday's 2-0 defeat at Anfield. The France international was given a second yellow card for the offence, but head coach John Carver feels it should have been a straight red.

'He knows he was wrong. He was fortunate not to get a straight red and he agreed with me. 'He apologised afterwards to Lucas, which was important. 'But you think captains would lead by example. We have to improve our discipline. I will be looking at that.' Meanwhile, Carver says Newcastle cannot rely on the shortcomings of others to preserve their Premier League status.

'These two home games (Spurs followed by Swansea) are massive for us. I'm not bothered about performances, we need results,' he said. 'I'm not worrying about that (relegation) at the moment, and the good thing is we have four games at home. 'But we need to start winning now. We can't rely on others teams. We can't afford to ease off, I have always said that. 'We have gone through a rough spell. It's down to me now to get players in right frame of mind.'

However, you don't have to go to far before talk returns to the England team again as Kevin Pietersen cut a range of emotions as he posed for the Surrey team photo before the start of the new campaign.

As team-mates turn their attention to other matters, Pietersen looks ahead in deep thought . The batsman joked with photographers at the KIA Oval for the photo session, with Surrey set to begin their campaign at Glamorgan on April 19. Downton's sacking on Wednesday has paved the way for the 34-year-old to return to the international set-up having been controversially axed by the former managing director in 2014. It was during the last Ashes tour for England in Australia last year when Pietersen last featured at international level, in a disastrous trip which saw his side suffer a whitewash series defeat. With England hoping to regain the urn this summer on home soil, Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in an attempt to force his way back into the Test set-up.

In the rear view mirror I could see absolute carnage. 'A car swerved out of the way and went completely into the barrier and the next car did the same. About four cars must have crashed before she finally stopped. 'It was just chaos and it was shocking to see all these cars swerving out of control. It was surreal and if I hadn't changed lanes a few seconds earlier it could have been much worse for us.'

"Jose Mourinho believes that the Ballon d’or, the trophy awarded to the world’s best footballer, should be scrapped. The Chelsea manager has sided with Arsene Wenger in calling into the question the legitimacy of the award. Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo is the current holder of the trophy which is voted for by national team managers and captains. Jose Mourinho, pictured on the Chelsea bench during their win against Stoke, has sided with Arsene Wenger . Cristiano Ronaldo, winner of the Ballon d'Or on three occasions, is presented with last year's award . Lionel Messi, who finished runner-up to Ronaldo in 2014, has previously won the compeition three times . Speaking last year, Wenger said he was ‘totally against’ the Ballon d’Or, and in a wide-ranging interview with the Telegraph, Mourinho moved to side with his great Premier League rival. ‘I think Wenger said something that is interesting; he is against the Ballon d’Or, and I think he’s right, because in this moment football is losing a little bit the concept of the team to focus more on the individual,’ said Mourinho. ‘We are always looking at the individual performance, the individual stat, the player that runs more. Because you run 11km in a game and I run nine you did a better job than I did? Maybe not! Maybe my 9km were more important than your 11.’ Arsene Wenger and Mourinho have clashed on a number of occasions during their managerial careers . Eden Hazard is congratulated by his Chelsea team-mates after scoring in their victory against Stoke City . Ronaldo beat Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer, of Bayern Munich, to this year’s award which was presented to the former Manchester United star in December. It is the third time he has been honoured with the gong. The second of his triumphs came when he was playing under Mourinho at Madrid. ‘For me, football is collective,' added Mourinho, whose Chelsea team travel to Loftus Road on Sunday as they bid to be crowned Premier League champions. 'The individual is welcome if you want to make our group better. But you have to work for us, not we have to work for you. 'When the top player arrives, the team is already there. It’s not him who comes to discover the team, like Columbus discovering America. No, no, you are coming now to help us be better.

"Boy, would Tiger like to find a fairway here,’ said former professional David Feherty. ‘Preferably one attached to this hole.’ It was that sort of day. Tiger Woods had worked so hard on his short game, the other quality needed to take a safe passage through these parts had been forgotten. He chipped like a champion; he drove like a boy racer. Somewhere in the ether, golf’s gods pointed and mocked. So Tiger’s short game is killing him? Opposite. There has been so much yip yap these last few weeks it was forgotten that Woods was becoming more erratic off the tee, long before his chipping went west. From the first, when he drifted into a bunker on the right, to the final par five, when he fired one into the crowd, castigating himself as a ‘dumbass’ — although a shout of ‘fore’ might have been more helpful — Woods took the long road around Augusta. The galleries were packed as crowd favourite Tiger Woods struggled on his first round at Augusta . Woods reacts to a poor chip shot on the third hole as the pressure begins to tell . Woods feels the heat at Augusta with the world No 111 struggling to get under par during the opening round . That he recorded a relatively respectable score — some significant distance off the lead, but certainly in the ball park of what would have been considered a reasonable number given that this was his first competitive golf for two months — was testament to his cussedness as much as his talent. Tiger dug deep and his play around the greens saved him. It was remarkable, really, considering his crisis of confidence. On the sixth, a par three, Woods missed the green again. He looked more than irritated, he looked worn down, fed up with a sport he once held on a string. He no doubt remembers how it used to be, too. How he must miss that old Tiger. He walked to the ball, perched at the top of a small incline to the right of the green. And he putted it. Rolled it down the slope, got it near enough. Settled. But, even so, it was a tell. The best poker players don’t have tells and Tiger likes Las Vegas as much as any high roller. But he saw his hand and, on that occasion, he blinked. It was still a Tiger gallery, of course. Still the biggest, still primed to applaud even the tiniest glimmer of his genius. But they would have recognised this as Tiger bluffing. Rewind through a decade and he would have conjured something small and miraculous with a short iron, made the ball pitch and spit and stop almost at his command. He would have shown the mastery of a charmer with a mesmerised snake. Putting from off the green? That was for the old guys and the also-rans, those without the bravery or the genius to make the ball obey. So Tiger got it close and made the solid up and down. Sure, they’re part of the game and every pro relies on them, even the all-time greats. But he was coming to need them, more and more. He won’t be entirely comfortable with that. He couldn’t putt at the 11th, when he again missed right and left himself a rascal of a chip. If Tiger’s short game was as bad as it had looked last time, the ball could easily have taken a bath. Instead, he recovered, just like old times. Then put it in the water at the 12th instead. Golf’s gods thumbed their noses and pulled faces behind his back. ‘I made two dumb mistakes,’ said Woods. ‘That apart, it was a good day. The short game was my strength, it was the reason I worked my butt off — to make it my strength again.’ Even so, dramatic saves weren’t all the old Tiger was about. There was a shot on the seventh that would have been a contender for play of the day. That is why they continue to hurry when he has played, no matter the needs of his patient partners. Tiger hits and off they go to see Tiger hit again. But Tiger is hitting more and more. Not the 82 times he hit at the Waste Management Phoenix Open in January perhaps, but more times than he would have hit in such benign conditions at Augusta in the old days, when he wouldn’t have been so pleased to tie for 41st place after 18 holes. Still, the seventh. Boy it was a beauty. He was behind a tree, left of the fairway, barely in sight of the green. He took a giant hit, dug it out but with such power and ferocity. The crowd lost the flight, the cameraman too, but Woods didn’t. He skipped and peered around the forestry to see the ball drop out of the sky, onto the green to a Sunday afternoon reception. Momentarily it was 1997 all over again. And then it was 2015 again and he left his 25 footer short. Par. Woods was not impressed with his approach shot to the 10th, but he managed to salvage par on the hole . Woods' beau Lindsey Vonn was in attendance as her other half mopped his sopping brow with a towel . Woods, Jimmy Walker and Jamie Donaldson walk to the 6th green during an absorbing day's play . Increasingly, his gallery writes cheques the man in the arena cannot cash. They were 14 rows deep just to watch him walk the ten strides from putting green to first tee. Eight on one side, six on the other, five marshals, wrestling with rope, and several baseball-hatted G4 security men. A local sheriff marched past, perspiring through his regulation white shirt. Even for Augusta in April it was unseasonably warm: 89, according to the Weather Channel. It was approaching 1.48pm Eastern Time. Tiger o’clock. The 14 rows fidgeted expectantly. Tiger breezed through, to applause, cheers and the odd whoop; the love of the common people. He nodded in appreciation once, mouthed a noiseless thank you, smiled a tight anti-smile. And then he was gone. Swallowed up as the ropes dropped and the crowd fell in behind him. Will he, won’t he? Could he, couldn’t he? They had seen the man, but would they ever see The Man? He was coming here with a new game, and a new mindset, but was this a new Tiger? Woods lines up his putt on the par three sixth as the 15-time major winner had a solid start to the day . Woods shows his fury at a chip from a bunker on the fourth,  but he managed to steady the ship . Woods patrols the Augusta fairways on a largely frustrating round for the former world No 1 . No. Not a new Tiger like the old Tiger anyway. Too much, too soon. He was better than the Tiger that departed Torrey Pines in February, with fears for his long-term future. Better for all that graft, that sun up to sun down perseverance. But he was still the 111th ranked golfer in the world. A bit rusty, a bit erratic, a bit brilliant, a bit fallible. There were fine moments, but they were fleeting. He got better through the round, but he would have eaten this place alive in the good old days. And that is Tiger’s problem. It’s a bit like Al Pacino in Carlito’s Way. Every time he tries to get out, they pull him back in. The creaks, the chunks, the odd crisis of confidence that just wasn’t there before. He starts to get going, he works his ass off, but it is hard. He three-putted the first, birdied the second. Hit a tree off the tee on the third, but got a lucky kick onto the fairway. Found a bunker, then missed the green on the par three fourth, played a quite stunning second from a poor fairway lie on the fifth. It was the golf of a competitor still battling against the years, and the aches of a creaking back and — whisper it — maybe yips that could resurface at any time. He won’t go quietly, the competitor remains, but he is vulnerable now. If it is isn’t one thing, it’s the other. Woods wills his second shot from the 14th on with the galleries gripped on the unfolding soap opera . Woods looks anxiously as his tee shot from the 15th sails into the still Georgia skies on a perfect day for golf .

"Rory McIlroy expressed his satisfaction after keeping his dreams of the career grand slam on track with a battling display on the opening day of the 79th Masters. Seeking to become just the sixth player in history to win all four major titles, McIlroy was one over par after 11 holes before recording birdies on the 13th and 15th to card a one-under-par 71. That left the world No 1 four shots off the clubhouse lead of Justin Rose and Charley Hoffman, but it could have been a lot worse as the 25-year-old was forced to scramble for par a number of times on the front nine.Rory McIlroy .

'It was a tricky day, the wind was swirling a little bit, the pin positions were tough. Anything under par was a pretty good score. 'It was nice to pick off a couple of birdies on the back nine on the par fives and I'm pretty satisfied with the day's work.' McIlroy has recorded a score of 77 or worse on each of his past five appearances at Augusta National and admitted it could have happened again. The four-time major winner hooked his drive on the second into the trees and ended up in a narrow creek, but after taking a penalty drop was able to pitch out to the fairway and hit a superb approach to save par. He did well just to bogey the sixth after his chip from short of the green rolled back down a slope to his feet and scrambled a par on the ninth after his approach span back off the green. 'It could have been a round that got away from me,' he admitted. 'I bogeyed 11 but I just kept telling myself to stay patient, realising it's a 72-hole golf tournament and I don't need to press too much.

"It may come as a surprise to some - particularly Arsene Wenger and Pep Guardiola - but Jose Mourinho has revealed how Sir Alex Ferguson inspired him to try to be a gracious manager. The Chelsea boss said in a wide-ranging interview with the Telegraph that the legendary Manchester United manager showed him 'two faces' during their first competitive meeting in 2004 - the first one of a steely rival and the second one of a sporting loser. Mourinho had just made his first impression on the Champions League by knocking out United with unfancied Porto. The Portuguese sprinted down the touchline at Old Trafford in an unforgettable celebration of Porto's last-gasp goal that sealed qualification and a seismic shock. Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho formed a firm friendship despite being fierce rivals . Fergie's Manchester United were stunned by Mourinho's Porto in the Champions League in 2004 . Mourinho sprinted down the touchline in celebration at Porto's last-gasp goal that sealed qualification . 'That was when I felt the two faces of such a big man,' said Mourinho. 'The first face was the competitor, the man that tried everything to win. And after that I found the man with principles, with the respect for the opponent, with the fair play – I found these two faces in that period, and that was very important for me. 'In my culture, the Portuguese and the Latin culture, we don’t have that culture of the second face; we are in football to win and when we don’t there is not a second face most of the time. But when we beat United in the Champions League I got that beautiful face of a manager which I try to have myself. I try.' Mourinho has attracted controversy like no other manager in the modern game. His many spats with Wenger have seen him form a bitter rivalry with the Arsenal boss, with Mourinho's accusation in 2005 that the Frenchman is like 'a voyeur' perhaps being the moment their relationship hit an all-time low, from which it has never recovered. Mourinho claims to have learned respect from Ferguson, but he has had many spats with Arsene Wenger . He also had a frosty relationship with Pep Guardiola when the pair were rival managers in Spain . The 52-year-old, who looks set to claim his third Barclays Premier League title with Chelsea this season, also formed a spiteful relationship with Guardiola while the pair duelled for honours in Spain. Arguably Mourinho's lowest moment came in gouging the eye of Guardiola's assistant, Tito Vilanova, in the closing stages of a Spanish Super Cup defeat for Real Madrid against Barcelona. After the match he referred to 'Pito' Vilanova - using the Spanish slang for penis. A less surprising Mourinho revelation is that he has no close friends in English football. 'Some, we like each other and have some communication, but I cannot say so close,' he said.","Jose Mourinho has spoken about his first meeting with Sir Alex Ferguson .

"Michael Vaughan will become the most powerful man in English cricket if he is confirmed as Paul Downton’s successor at the helm of the national team. It emerged on Thursday that the former England captain has already held talks with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison and is in pole position to become the new director of cricket ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart. Yet Vaughan will demand almost unprecedented responsibility if he is to head up the revolution that Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves have begun with Wednesday’s sacking of Downton as managing director. Clearly, if the ECB are going to land the man who appears to be their first choice then they will have to make him a supremo with powers not seen since Ray Illingworth’s controversial reign in the early 1990s. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket . Vaughan was understood to be talking to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No1 choice . The exact terms of the new position were discussed at Thursday’s meeting of the ECB management board but if the director is to be Vaughan then he will command overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Vaughan is one of the busiest men in cricket, earning close to £1million a year through his various media roles with the BBC, Sky, Channel 5 and the Daily Telegraph and his involvement with sponsors and the ISM management group. If he is to give up all of that — and it would be a clear conflict of interests if he continues his involvement in an agency that represents Stuart Broad, Joe Root and Jos Buttler — then he will want a massive salary and ultimate control of the team. On the day that both Strauss and Stewart threw their hats into the ring for the new job, one source told Sportsmail that Vaughan’s appointment was already a done deal and that he could even be unveiled before Monday’s first Test in the West Indies. Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday . Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators . Ultimately the decision will be taken by Harrison and particularly Graves, who is close to Vaughan and is clearly keen to implement huge and rapid change in the national team as he did at Yorkshire. The implications of the return to the England set-up of the 2005 Ashes-winning captain would be significant for the leading figures in the domestic game. If Vaughan becomes supremo then there may not even be the need for a head coach and, if the position does remain, it is impossible to envisage Peter Moores surviving even if England win their Test series against West Indies. Vaughan has been a constant critic of the coach in his second coming, saying he would be better off working with young players. There is no doubt that Graves — and Vaughan — would love Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie to succeed Moores, but convincing the Australian to throw in his lot with England will be challenging. Gillespie is happy at Headingley and with his Big Bash role with Adelaide. Vaughan, who has been an outspoken pundit, would have to build some bridges were he to take the role. Alastair Cook has often been a target of Vaughan’s sometimes inconsistent criticisms and would be on borrowed time as England captain under him unless he scores big runs and wins lots of Test matches quickly. Vaughan was particularly critical of Jonathan Trott for his departure from last year's Ashes tour of Australia . Also, Vaughan would have to provide an explanation to Jonathan Trott for his strongly-worded column on his departure from the last Ashes tour with what was eventually diagnosed as ‘situational anxiety.’ Vaughan said he felt ‘conned’ by Trott, who he accused of ‘doing a runner’ from Australia. One man who would greet Vaughan’s succession more warmly than most would undoubtedly be Kevin Pietersen, who would be handed a clear route back into the England team by the appointment of the captain he got on best with. If Pietersen scores heavily for Surrey and Vaughan is at the helm of the England team then a comeback that appeared impossible just a few months ago after the publication of his bitter autobiography really would be on. There is no doubt that if the job description had remained the same to that of Downton’s then Strauss, who said  that he would be interested in the job, would be the outstanding candidate. Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role . Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket . Strauss is widely respected by the England team and management but would be far more comfortable in a suit with distance between him and the players rather than in a tracksuit at the heart of the dressing room. The apparent moving of the goalposts, with the business side of Downton’s role now disappearing, would seem to favour Vaughan over Strauss. The third man on the shortlist, Stewart, remains the outsider of the trio. These are clearly seismic times for English cricket with Graves and Harrison apparently dismantling everything created by ex-chairman Giles Clarke, who was  confirmed in a new role as ECB president. The bottom line is, with national selector James Whitaker in danger of becoming the next to follow Downton out of the door, the whole senior structure of the England team could change before this year’s Ashes. If the dominoes keep crashing down, Vaughan could be at the helm of an England team this summer with Gillespie as his coach, Joe Root as captain and Pietersen back in the team. And that, following 15 months of turmoil since the England team unravelled so dramatically by losing the Ashes 5-0, would be truly remarkable. Alec Stewart (Age 52) CURRENT JOB: Director of cricket at Surrey. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Played 133 Tests, more than any England cricketer. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Has established a rapport at Surrey with the out-of-favour Kevin Pietersen — says English cricket needs to be bold. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He’s only interested if there’s a clear line of accountability. May demand a say in selection. Andrew Strauss (Age 38) CURRENT JOB: Sky commentator. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Captained England to home-and-away Ashes triumphs. PLAYERS HE LIKES: A big fan of his former opening partner Alastair Cook, who he insists will score plenty of Test runs this summer. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Widely respected within English cricket for taking the team to the top of the Test rankings. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: Strauss is still in the early days of his career as a commentator – and is enjoying it. Michael Vaughan (Age 40) CURRENT JOB: Broadcaster and columnist. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Famously led England to the 2005 Ashes — and 26 Test wins overall, a national record. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Joe Root is a particular favourite — he is next in line to replace Alastair Cook as Test captain. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Vaughan is interested in the job in principle, and is close to incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He may decide he’s enjoying his media career too much to risk entering firing line.","Michael Vaughan was understood to be talking to the ECB on Thursday .

"At 11:20pm, former world champion Ken Doherty potted a final black and extinguished, for now, the dream of Reanne Evans to become the first women player to play the hallowed baize of Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in the world snooker championship. In every other respect however, 29-year-old Evans, a single mum from Dudley, was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that won't be bettered in this year's qualifying tournament. Snooker's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport's blue-chip event on April 18 - something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10-8 victory at Ponds Forge . Evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against Doherty . Doherty, who won the World Championship title back in 1997, took out the first frame 71-15 . Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10-8 . Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short-priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10-8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards: 'She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match, a different kind of pressure to what I've ever experienced. 'I don't usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I don't know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9-9, I'd have been a million-to-one to win it.' Evans, cheered on by her eight-year-old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield, admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10-time ladies' champion, Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5-4 in front . The 10-time ladies world champion collected just £400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013, and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. 'It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had, I just had to dig in,' she said. 'Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just couldn't take advantage in the end. 'I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can't return and beat Ken or even players above him. I have the women's game on my shoulders. I just hope I get some help and am allowed to play in more big tournaments to give me experience. 'Next week, I will playing the ladies in the club again. It's a lovely club don't get me wrong but I don't think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I'd taken it to 9-9.' The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans' participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield . She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves didn't show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row, led 4-3 and once Doherty went in front, pegged him back to 5-5 and 6-6. The Irishman, now ranked No 46 in the world, started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right-handed or left-handed, as O'Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9-7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame – and he got it. Doherty, now ranked No 46 in the world, showed his experience to close out the contest . He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it's doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. 'They should let her play in more competitions,' he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women's sport. Her purple and silver waistcoats drew admiring glances from the swimmers and trampolinists who turned up at the leisure centre as normal as she walked through reception to the basketball hall, where 10 snooker tables had been set up. Next time they will know exactly who she is, and what she can do.","Reanne Evans faced Ken Doherty in World Championship qualifier .

"A 15-year-old boy has been cautioned after posting a racist tweet aimed at Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck. The teenager took to social media after Welbeck scored the winner to knock his former club Manchester United out of the FA Cup on March 9. He posted a vile, racist rant under the username @angeIsleftfoot which read: 'Welbeck is dead to me, the f****** c***…’ Danny Welbeck scored the winner as Arsenal beat Manchester United in the FA Cup quarter-final in March . The tweet, posted after Welbeck's decisive role in Arsenal's victory at Old Trafford, continued with sickening references that are too offensive to publish here. After a fellow Twitter user complained, officers from Greater Manchester Police launched a probe. They identified the user and passed on the information to Wiltshire Police, who made an arrest. Welbeck was the subject of a racist tweet after the game by a 15-year-old boy, who has now been cautioned . The teenager has now been given a caution and warned about his behaviour. A spokesman for Wiltshere Police said: 'A 15-year-old boy, from the Salisbury area, has been given a youth caution following the appearance of a racist tweet aimed at a former Manchester United player placed on social media on the evening of Monday, March 9.'

"The huge build-up to England women's Under 19 replay against Norway was truly bizarre and unprecedented. And it was a game only supposed to last for 18 seconds. Leah Williamson held incredible nerve to retake a penalty which she ought to have taken on Saturday, were it not for German referee Marjia Kurtes' terrific blunder. Kurtes disallowed Williamson's penalty for encroachment from England players at the weekend, but instead of ordering her back to the spot, awarded a free-kick to Norway. Leah Williamson (centre) stepped up again to take the penalty during the 18-second rematch against Norway . Williamson went the same way as her successful spot-kick last Saturday and found the net once again . Norwegian goalkeeper Oda Marie Hove Bogstad was unable to stop Williamson's brilliant effort . The England captain wheels away in celebration after handing her side a crucial 2-2 draw . But England were given a lifeline when UEFA chiefs ruled it should be replayed. All match details from Saturday, including the time of day the penalty was awarded, the venue, the players who were on the pitch, were ticked off by the Swiss blazers and the game was restarted at 9.45pm. And that was a whole FIVE hours after both had played their final Elite Round games in Northern Ireland. Only Kurtes was replaced, by referee Kateryna Zora. It began in what would have been the 96th minute, and ended 65 seconds later. Leah said: 'They were the longest 24 hours of my life, I hadn't slept. I think I was just excited, I went through so many emotions and just felt excitement, so I thought 'yep, that's how I am going to feel'! 'We had a conversation just before I came out which was quite emotional, we have been through a bigger journey than some people go through in their whole careers because of what happened, it was never about me, it was about the team. The England players celebrate Williamson's penalty which earned them a 2-2 draw in Belfast . England held on in the final moments to secure the draw and, with it, a place in this summer's finals in Israel . Williamson blows a kiss to the crowd as Mo Marley's side look ahead to this summer's tournament . Number of seconds played: 65.18 after the players returned to the centre circle . Number of England players on the pitch: Norway were already down to 10 outfield players, but England brought on a sub to replace one injured in the game vs Switzerland . Days between spot-kicks: Five days between Saturday's clash and the controversial rematch . Number of goals scored: 1 - the infamous penalty . 'When something is taken away from you like that, you realise just how much you want it, and that's what happened. Qualifying is such a huge deal for us, it's massive.' Norway discovered minutes before the penalty was retaken they would qualify for the July finals in Israel, as best runners-up across all Elite Round groups. Had the penalty been missed, Norway would have finished table-toppers, and the Dutch would have progressed as best second-placed team. It was the most surreal football you could imagine, starting from the penalty spot, with none of the regular pomp of a competitive international, yet much more attention than a girls' game normally yields. Under-age women's games in Northern Ireland, if the passionate hosts aren't playing, are usually lucky to attract treble figures. England are awarded a penalty during their European U19 Women's Championships qualifier on Saturday . Referee Marija Kurtes points to the spot as England are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute . Williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against Norway in Belfast . Williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team-mate Rosella Ayane (circled) has entered the box . Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner . German referee Marija Kurtes officiating a women's Bundesliga match in Munich last month . England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway . But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short . Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake . While the disgraced Kurtes, who was sent home after her blunder, will be keen to shelve her nightmare, Williamson's name will crop up in pub quizzes for generations. England coach Mo Marley said: 'Obviously the tournament has been tough and pretty much it's about following through in the right way. We are happy we gave ourselves a chance to qualify and everything has turned out the way we wanted it, for Norway as well. 'I know how hard these players have worked, credit to all of the other teams, and credit to Norway, we deserve to be in the finals. 'It's ironic because a lot of the hard work we did at the start of the week was about a long journey, handling the intense pressure of a tournament and tests to our resolve, which helped a lot. But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating . German referee Kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on Saturday . 'Everyone was aware of the possible outcomes, we may not have scored the penalty, we know that. 'We may not have got through. But we are just so tremendously happy.' Since this odd chain of events stemmed from an infringement of the game's laws, UEFA's disciplinary committee did exactly the right thing in instructing for it to be replayed. But it sets a dangerous precedent. England's appeal cost just £750, which is repayable to the FA as it was successful, but was it lodged just because it's arguably a lower level of football? It triggers questions concerning how many more appeals of this nature could happen in the future. In a men's senior England international, one presumes one of the tens of thousands of people would correct the referee, whereas perhaps the same can't be guaranteed with a three-figure crowd. Indeed, would you have that inexcusable refereeing in the first place? September 2005 - World Cup qualifier - Uzbekistan vs Bahrain . Uzbekistan had won the opening leg of the Asian zone fourth-round play-off 1-0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching. Rather than retaking the penalty, an indirect free-kick was wrongly awarded by Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida to Bahrain and the game ended with a one-goal margin. Uzbekistan called for an investigation but were left furious after FIFA ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid. It proved to have a major impact as it was Bahrain who eventually went through with a 1-1 away goals victory, though they were later beaten in the AFC-CONCACAF play-off.

"Sergio Aguero wants to put pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea by claiming victory in the Manchester derby on Sunday. City go into the derby at Old Trafford in fourth place, one point behind their neighbours after a 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday. Manuel Pellegrini's team are nine points behind Chelsea, who have a match in hand against bottom side Leicester, but Aguero knows better than most that City are not averse to an 11th-hour comeback. Sergio Aguero insists Manchester City can retain the Premier League despite defeat by Crystal Palace . The Argentina international has struggled for form and fitness as City have slipped this season . The Argentinian scored a 94th minute winner to wrest the title from United's grasp in 2012 and he is not giving up on the top prize again just yet. 'Of course we can still win it,' the City striker told Sky Sports News. 'In football, anything can happen - as soon as you think something is certain, then everything changes, we have seen it so many times before and we'll see it again. 'We only focus on ourselves, try to win every game we play and keep pressure on Chelsea.' City have beaten United in the last four Manchester derbies: . 8 April 2013         United 1-2 City . 22 Sept 2013       City 4-1 United . 25 March 2014    United 0-3 City . 2 Nov 2014          City 1-0 United . Pellegrini's team were level with Chelsea on New Year's Day, but the Blues have pulled away recently after City lost three of their last five league games. United, in contrast, have won their last five matches, and Aguero is wary of the threat Louis van Gaal's team will pose at Old Trafford. He added: 'They are a team with a lot of great individual players, who can form an incredible unit when they work well together. But this season that has not always been the case. 'Some matches they don't seem to play at the maximum, with the attacking qualities that they have in the team. But then in other games, they have really shown that those qualities, so they are a bit unpredictable. We know we will have to be at our very best to beat them - there's no doubt about that.' The champions face Manchester United on Sunday, having won the last four derbies . Aguero has scored six times against United, including this one at the Etihad in September 2013 . Van Gaal came in for criticism at the start of the campaign after winning just three of his opening 11 matches in all competitions. Radamel Falcao was one of many new signings to struggle under the Dutchman. Seven months after signing the Colombian on a deadline-day loan deal from Monaco, he has scored just four goals for the club. Aguero remains a fan of the former Porto and Atletico Madrid forward, though. Aguero said: 'They have a number of very talented strikers. The one who in his career has been the most predatory is Falcao. 'He isn't having an easy time this season, but I really admire his commitment and his class and qualities are permanent. 'He is probably one of the most naturally-gifted strikers in football at the moment.' Aguero came face-to-face with 'one of the world's most gifted strikers' Radamel Falcao at a Puma event . Falcao has struggled to cement a starting place since arriving at Old Trafford on an expensive loan deal . Aguero has also struggled in front of goal recently, failing to find the net in the last five league games. However, he has scored six times against United and is aiming to add to that tally this weekend. 'I always love to score, but of course it is even more special to score in the big games,' he said. 'If you score against United at Old Trafford it almost give you shivers, because you can feel the tense atmosphere with most of the stadium being really quiet, but the away end going crazy. 'At home at it is different, when the City supporters are really loud in these games, it sometimes gives me goose bumps when they sing my name.'","Manchester City can still  mount a title challenge, insists Sergio Aguero .

"Andy Murray’s coach has announced she is pregnant – two days before the British tennis star’s wedding to Kim Sears. Former world No 1 Amelie Mauresmo is expecting her baby in August, and will be heavily pregnant as she guides Murray through Wimbledon. The openly gay 35-year-old broke the news on social media on Thursday night. Amelie Mauresmo was appointed as Andy Murray's coach last summer . Mauresmo revealed on Twitter: ‘Baby will be here in august! #pregnant So happy.’ Murray, 27, marries long-time fiancee Kim Sears at Dunblane Cathedral on Saturday and the news is likely to overshadow their preparations. Mauresmo, who won Wimbledon and the Australian Open titles in 2006, came out as gay at the 1999 Australian Open. Mauresmo roars on Murray during his Australian Open quarter-final clash with Nick Kyrgios in January . Thursday’s Tweet was accompanied by a photo of a pair of baby-sized blue All Star trainers next to a pair of adult shoes. Mauresmo was appointed as Murray’s coach in June 2014 following his split from Ivan Lendl three months earlier. Much of the initial debate around Mauresmo’s appointment centred on whether she could instil a more aggressive attitude in Murray. But it also focused on whether he could rediscover the self-control that became so evident under Lendl. Mauresmo,  a former world number one,  won Wimbledon and Australian Open singles titles back in 2006 . Mauresmo celebrates beating Justine Henin-Hardenne to win Wimbledon in 2006 . Mauresmo also won the Australian Open in 2006 . Away from the court, on which he is ferociously competitive, Murray is said to be thoughtful, with a gentle and sensitive side, similar to softly spoken Mauresmo. He was forced to defend her appointment, saying: ‘She was someone who struggled with nerves and conquered them later in her career. Someone like that can help more than someone who hasn’t had those issues before. ‘You can talk about Amelie’s accomplishments, she won a lot. She was No 1 in the world, she won multiple Grand Slams, she had a creative game style. As a person, she is very nice, very easy to communicate with, but she is firm as well. So those are the reasons I wanted to give it a shot.’ Murray insisted his coaching liaison with Mauresmo was long-term after he surrendered his Wimbledon crown last summer. The Scot arrived back in Britain on Monday as world No 3 in the new rankings. Despite his recent tournament finishes getting him back near the top of his game, Murray has had to put tennis aside this week as he and Kim Sears make last-minute preparations for their wedding on Saturday.","Andy Murray appointed Amelie Mauresmo as his coach last summer .

'I've done my job by winning two out of two, and I played well - importantly I finished well tonight. I felt good up on stage but I've put a lot of practice in and it's all working out. 'This time last year I was on seven points, so it's a big improvement to be up to 17 already.' Chisnall is second in the Premier League table behind the only unbeaten man in the tournament Michael van Gerwen, who snatched a 7-5 victory against Stephen Bunting for his eighth win in 10. Raymond van Barneveld beat Phil Taylor 7-2 to inflict The Power's fourth defeat in five . Michael van Gerwen saw off Stephen Bunting 7-5 to maintain his place at the top of the table .

"Arsenal are trying to find a cure for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's persistent groin problems in a bid to prevent surgery. Arsene Wenger revealed the attacking midfielder has suffered a setback in his bid to return from a hamstring strain that has sidelined him since the FA Cup win over Manchester United on March 9. However, it is the recurrence of a long-standing groin problem that has caused the delay in Chamberlain's return to action, not the hamstring. Arsenal are trying to find a cure for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s persistent groin problems . Oxlade-Chamberlain has been struggling with an ongoing groin problem for several months . The groin injury has been an ongoing problem for the England international for several months, but he, together with the club's medical staff, have managed it throughout the season. The root cause of the complaint remains unclear, with club doctors trying to establish a permanent cure for the problem. Arsenal are keen to surgery and are exploring other treatment methods to rid the former Southampton man of his groin discomfort. However, the option of an operation isn't being ruled out, though any procedure would only take place in the summer. Arsene Wenger has revealed the attacking midfielder has suffered a setback in his bid to return to fitness . The 21-year-old should play again this season but the fear is that the problem could recur . Oxlade-Chamberlain will miss at least two more weeks, meaning he will not be available for next weekend's FA Cup semi-final against Reading. The 21-year-old should play again this season, but the fear is that the problem could recur. Surgery would mean another busy summer for Oxlade-Chamberlain as he'd be required to complete a rehabilitation programme before pre-season. He was involved in Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad last year, but didn't feature owing to a knee injury. Fitness permitting, Oxlade-Chamberlain is also likely to be part of Hodgson's squad for Euro 2016 at the end of next season. Arsenal are close to signing 16-year-old Maxi Romero from Velez Sarsfield for £4.5million . 'It is taking a bit longer than I thought because he has a groin inflammation,' confirmed Wenger. 'I hope it does not become a long-term problem but he faces a hurdle this week in training. 'We will see if he has recovered, so the end of the week and the start of next week are important to see if he got rid of that inflammation. Meanwhile, Arsenal's chief negotiator Dick Law has flown to Argentina in an attempt to rubber-stamp the £4.5million capture of 16-year-old forward Maxi Romero from Velez Sarsfield. The deal has been held up by third-party ownership issues - and Law has travelled to South America to resolve the problem.","Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been out of action since March 9 .

"Mark one up for the future of golf over its past and present as 21-year-old Jordan Spieth took the first-day honours with a stunning opening round of 64 on a spectacular day of scoring at the sun-baked 79th Masters. For much of the day it looked as if he might have to share top billing with 34-year-old Justin Rose and 45-year-old Ernie Els, as the Englishman and the South African posted scores of 67 to tie Charley Hoffman, an American representative of the rank and file. Last man out Jason Day would join them in the evening shadows. But by then Spieth had separated himself from the field to become the youngest first-round leader in Masters history with a fabulous run of six birdies in seven holes before adding a wonderful flourish at the 18th, where he brushed in a 25-foot birdie putt. Runner-up on his debut last year, he now owns a three-shot lead going into day two. Jordan Spieth sinks his birdie put on the 18th at Augusta to take a three-shot lead into the second round . Justin Rose made the early running with an impressive five-under-par 67 . Rose consoles Gunn Yang after the amateur finished his round on 13 over . Most of the favoured names left Augusta National feeling reasonably content, as Rory McIlroy and defending champion Bubba Watson shot 71, while Dustin Johnson and Masters specialist Phil Mickelson opened with rounds of 70. Whether they will be feeling quite so content at falling so far behind such an awesome talent as the brilliant Texan is another matter. Spieth has barely been off a leader-board all year and there was no chance of him being off this one during this round where he hit flagsticks, holed putts from everywhere and enjoyed the requisite amount of fortune as well as a wayward drive at the 13th bounced off the Georgia pines into the middle of the fairway. It meant when he stood on the par-five 15th tee he was eight under after a scarcely credible 10 single putts on these treacherous greens. At that moment anything seemed possible — even a 62, thereby setting a new standard for scoring in the 155-year history of majors. Only once all day did he act his age and it was here on this risk-reward par five, as he ran up a six. Naturally, Spieth was not about to get greedy. ‘I made a mistake but a 64, my first score in the sixties on this course, I have nothing to complain about,’ he said. A packed crowd watch Rose on the 10th green during the first round . Rose and Charley Hoffman (above) made the early running at Augusta with a 67 . South African Ernie Els rolled back the years with a superb 67 on Thursday . Rose in full bloom on day one is a sight as familiar as the glorious azaleas. In nine previous starts Rose has led on three occasions after the first round. Here he equalled his best Masters score, recorded on the opening day in 2004. That year he went on to hold the 36-hole lead as well, while in 2007 he was lying tied second going into the final round, eventually finishing tied fifth. Add all those memories of good days here to the fact he’s now a proven major champion following his US Open triumph in 2013, and there must be the hope this will prove rather more than an excellent opening gambit. Certainly that is how he is seeing it. ‘I’ve learned plenty from those previous occasions, like not getting ahead of yourself,’ he said. ‘I’ve learned that the hard way and now I can’t see any reason why I shouldn’t keep executing the gameplan. You’ve got to believe in yourself, especially when you’re a major winner.’ Els used his ball-striking skills to get out of trouble on the 17th hole during the first round . Rory McIlroy appeared relaxed as he walked down the ninth fairway with Phil Mickelson, right, . McIlroy recovered from a shaky start to finish the first round on one-under-par . Rose wasn’t the only Englishman to prosper, as in-form Paul Casey shot 69. ‘I played with Paul last week and he strikes me as a man with something to prove,’ said Rose. After Greg Norman, Els might be the great hard-luck story when it comes to fabulous players who never quite got it done here. Given how good he was at 25, he represents a cautionary tale for those who believe it inevitable McIlroy will win the Masters one day. Els is still trying, at 45, and what a joy to see one of the great ball-strikers roll back a decade or two rather than the years to post his five-under score. A wonderful eagle three at the 15th was followed by a superlative sand save from a buried lie at the 17th. Only at the last was there a modicum of disappointment. Two putts and it would have been his lowest score in 71 rounds at Augusta. But he took three. McIlroy recovered from a nervously played front nine with some familiar Augusta failings resurfacing as he failed to birdie either par five. Two clunked chip shots at the third and sixth also betrayed a level of tension that illustrated fully the momentous nature of the achievement he is trying to complete in shooting for the career grand slam. American Jordan Spieth celebrates with his caddie Michael Greller on the 18th . Defending champion Bubba Watson struggled to find his rhythm in opening round . Tiger Woods feels the heat with the world No 111 struggling to get under par during the opening round . Woods reacts to a poor chip shot on the third hole as the pressure begins to tell . There were also two encouraging moments during that front nine, however, when he turned what would have been double bogeys in the past into mere bogeys. At the par-five second he drove into a hazard and was staring an ugly seven in the face for openers until he got down in two blows from 100 yards. At the sixth, his mis-hit chip came back down the steep slope but he didn’t panic. He decided to take his putter for the second attempt and got down in two. The value of limiting the damage was emphasised further when he notched his first birdie of the day at the next. On the back nine, it was more like it from the 25-year-old. Over the front nine he had given up three shots on the par fives alone to playing partner Mickelson, but here he got the two birdies on offer at the 13th and the 15th. ‘I left myself in some awkward spots but I holed some good putts on the back nine,’ he said. ‘I was a little nervous on the front nine but mostly just too excited. It was a decent opener.’ The day as a whole was a lot better than that. One to savour, in fact.","Jordan Spieth carded a 64 to claim the lead on -8 after the first round .

The pair were dicing for 13th place when Button hit the back of Maldonado’s Lotus as they battled for position on the run down to Turn 1.

While Button limped to finish 13th, Maldonado retired following rear-end damage sustained in the crash. The incident on lap 49 was referred to the race stewards and Button was given a five-second penalty after the race, which dropped the British driver to 14th. He was also given two penalty points on his superlicence. ‘I thought there was room on the inside and, yeah, I can't really say anything else’, said a downbeat Button. ‘An incident you never want to happen, but just a misjudgement I guess.’ Jenson Button appeared in a relaxed mood before Sunday's race but had an afternoon to forget in China .

"Sport's propensity to play mind games with its protagonists was rarely more obviously stated than after qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix, when Nico Rosberg cursed his Mercedes team. Hamilton, the world champion, was relaxed and delighted having taken pole but Rosberg, his team-mate, was grim-faced, demoralised and made his first public criticism of his team. Nico Rosberg will start behind pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel third on the grid in China . Rosberg cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to Hamilton by just 0.042secs . Rosberg was only four-hundredths of a second behind the Briton and will start second on the grid. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari is third, nearly a second adrift of Hamilton. But Rosberg was visibly angry after the Mercedes pit-wall brains put him under unnecessary ‘pressure’. The German was the last driver out for his final flying lap, meaning he had to rush to get in a competitive time. Rosberg, who is customarily gracious in defeat, fell slightly short of Hamilton’s mark and was grumpy afterwards. He said: ‘It was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don’t think it cost me anything, but even the mind-set to know that I have to speed up a bit — we need to look into that. Sparks fly off the back of Rosberg's Mercedes during qualifying for Sunday's race in Shanghai . The German has now been out-qualified by Hamilton at each of the three races this season . ‘Other than that the lap was good  and it is very annoying as the lap is never perfect, so four hundredths is always in it. Tyre degradation is going to be a big issue for the race as we are going to take the tyres right to the limit. So there are many opportunities.’ Poor old Rosberg was cock of the walk in the early and middle parts of last season, but he seems terribly lacklustre since Hamilton won the title. Even his Mercedes boss, Niki Lauda, said he should ‘sort himself out’ — a statement on Rosberg’s psyche rather than his work ethic. Whether he has the speed to match Hamilton may be at the centre of his anger. The Briton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently. McLaren will again be towards the back of the grid with Jenson Button 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the former champions. Button said: ‘I guess we hoped we might be just a bit closer than we were today. In practice, we’d looked a bit more competitive, certainly. ‘We’d found a reasonably good balance with the car, in fact, but the lap-time isn’t quite there yet.’ Hamilton will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in China .","Nico Rosberg was the last driver out of the pit-lane and was forced to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked ahead of his final shot at pole .

"Leicester boss Richard Cockerill believes that this season's Aviva Premiership play-off race will run until the final day of regular league season action. The Tigers tackle Saracens at Allianz Park on Saturday, separated by just two points and two places with only four games left. While Northampton are clear at the top, it is a different story for the three remaining play-off positions, with Saracens, Bath, Leicester and Exeter all bunched up behind Saints, and mid-table Wasps and Sale Sharks also cannot be discounted. Leicester Tigers rugby director Richard Cockerill believes the Premiership title race will go to the wire . The 22-game Premiership campaign concludes on May 16, with play-offs a week later, and the stakes are high. 'We've got some tough games coming up, but we are up there in the mix,' said Tigers rugby director Cockerill, whose team's run-in features appointments with Saracens, London Welsh, Wasps and Northampton. 'The top four was our target at the start of the season, and that is still our target now, but we have to keep going. 'With being out of Europe, we brought our internationals straight back into the squad against Exeter (two weeks ago) because we knew they could have some down-time after that.

"Jason Gillespie has been appointed the new coach of Big Bash League side Adelaide Strikers in a move that will see him combine the role with his duties at Yorkshire. The 39-year-old has been an influential figure at Headingley since joining the county as first-team coach in November 2011, and led them to the LV= County Championship title last year. While his coaching position with the White Rose is unaffected, he has signed a two-year deal with the South Australian franchise in a move that had been widely anticipated. Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie has taken up a role with Big Bash team Adelaide Strikers . He will begin his role there in December, when the next edition of the BBL gets under way. Gillespie, who played for South Australia during the entirety of his playing career, said: 'I would like to place on record my gratitude to Yorkshire County Cricket Club for allowing me to coach in the Big Bash League. 'I am looking forward to bringing back some knowledge and experiences to Yorkshire, which will improve our T20 cricket going forward. Jono Dean in action for the Adelaide Strikers during the 2014 edition of the Big Bash . 'I am excited to be taking charge of my hometown team in the Adelaide Strikers.

'The opportunity to coach and build on the Strikers' recent success is a great challenge.' Gillespie will take up his new post with the full blessing of Yorkshire, who have never won England's domestic Twenty20 competition. Gillespie played in 71 Tests and 97 one-day internationals for Australia . Chief executive Mark Arthur said: 'I want to make it absolutely clear that Jason (Gillespie) is primarily our senior coach and he will join Adelaide Strikers with our blessing for a short period at the end of the year. It will advance his own skill-set, which ultimately will benefit Yorkshire. 'Over the last 10 to 12 years we have underperformed in the T20 competition. This year we have made it a priority.

"Scotland winger Sean Maitland is facing a race against time to be fit for the Rugby World Cup after it emerged he has undergone surgery on his injured shoulder. It was hoped the London Irish-bound star might yet return to play a part in the Pro12 run-in for Glasgow Warriors after being out of action since January — but head coach Gregor Townsend reported on Thursday that he had suffered a setback and has now played his last game for the club. With the news that the 26-year-old will miss the rest of the season, national boss Vern Cotter will naturally be concerned he is fit in time for the World Cup which starts in September. Sean Maitland is leaving Glasgow Warriors to play in the Aviva Premiership with London Irish next season . Townsend said: 'Sean got some tough news last week when it became clear his shoulder would require surgery. 'But the operation at Spire Murrayfield Hospital was a success and he's targeting to be back for the World Cup.' Maitland, who has 15 caps for Scotland and toured with the British & Irish Lions in 2013, picked up the injury when the Warriors lost at Bath in the European Rugby Champions Cup and was subsequently ruled out of the Six Nations. With the New Zealand-born player leaving Scotstoun for the English Premiership in the summer, his operation has denied Glasgow fans a final opportunity to see him play in their colours. Townsend said: 'I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Sean for his contribution to the club, he's been an excellent player for us.' Former Canterbury Crusaders player Maitland has won 15 caps for Scotland . Meanwhile, Townsend believes there is a real determination in his squad to secure a win over Cardiff Blues tonight for team-mates Al Kellock and Dougie Hall who retire at the end of the season. The veteran pair have been included in the starting line-up at Scotstoun with Warriors needing victory to edge closer to a top-four finish for the fourth year in a row. 'This week is really important for the club because we have only have four league matches left,' said the head coach. 'I have also seen the players really focus in on the win because they want to pay tribute to Al and Dougie. 'Tonight we want to celebrate what they have done for the club.' Glasgow coach Gregor Townsend has been able to call upon the services of star fly half Finn Russll once more . Townsend has made a number of changes from the side that drew 34-34 away to Leinster a fortnight ago. In the backs, fit-again duo Henry Pyrgos and Finn Russell come in as does Peter Murchie at full-back. Four changes in the pack sees props Jerry Yanuyanutawa and Mike Cusack start alongside Hall while Adam Ashe replaces Josh Strauss at No 8. Scotland trio Gordon Reid, Jon Welsh and Duncan Weir are on the bench after returning from injury. The Blues, currently in 10th place, will be without injured prop Gethin Jenkins but still have talent like Sam Warburton, Alex Cuthbert, Gareth Anscombe and Josh Navidi in the starting XV. Wales captain Sam Warburton has been named to start for Cardiff against Glasgow at Scotstoun . Townsend is not taking their challenge lightly. 'Cardiff look to keep the ball alive at all times and if you look at the stats from the league, they are the ones who pass the ball the most,' he said. 'When your game-plan is to go out and attack and keep hold of the ball and you have nothing to lose, then they could be really dangerous opponents. 'We need our defence to be putting them under pressure if they are moving the ball a lot. 'On paper they have some fantastic individuals in their side like Warburton and other internationals and now that they are out of Europe they will want to finish the season on a high.' Young Warriors prop D'arcy Rae, 20, has joined London Scottish on loan until the end of the season. He has already been on loan at Treviso this term but is set to have a big future at Scotstoun from 2015/16 onwards.","Sean Maitland has undergone surgery on his injured shoulder .

"England's premier bowler Jimmy Anderson suffered a frustrating day in his bid to become his country's all-time leading wicket taker in his 100th Test appearance in Antigua. But pace attack colleague Chris Jordan believes the Anderson family celebration party is 'just around the corner' as West Indies fell to 155 for four in response to England's first-innings total of 399. Anderson, watched by his parents, wife, two daughters and agent and needing four wickets to overtake the great Sir Ian Botham's haul of 383, claimed only one early victim in West Indies opener Devon Smith in his 13 overs, which went for 24 runs and eight maidens. Jimmy Anderson moved to within two wickets of Sir Ian Botham's record of 383 Test wickets . Anderson could only take the one wicket on day two of the first Test in Antigua . But even the England back-room staff were surprised that Anderson bowled just four overs in the last session of play with team-mates Jordan, Stuart Broad and James Tredwell sharing the other wickets to fall. It could have been better but a Ben Stokes wicket was ruled a no ball. Jordan took a stunning slip catch off Tredwell to dismiss West Indies vice-captain Kraigg Brathwaite, who claimed after play that he thought Anderson ' looked tired'. But Jordan said: 'Jimmy got us off and running with the first wicket and the rest of us tried to back that up, which I thought we did pretty well. If he keeps doing that and bowling the way he does those wickets are just around the corner. Chris Jordan jumps for joy after taking the wicket of Darren Bravo on the second afternoon . Jordan appeals for an lbw against West Indian batsman Kraigg Brathwaite, but it was unsuccessful . 'The stat is obviously there but I don't think Jimmy or any of us are going about our cricket or thinking about things differently. 'We're just trying to group balls as a bowling unit and create pressure. 'As a group we try and win every session, so we'll come back as hard as we can to break this partnership then make inroads into the tail.' Ironically, No 11 Anderson and Jordan were the pick of the lower-order England batsman in a last-wicket partnership of 38 as the West Indies bowling attack, inspired by a talk from bowling coach Sir Curtly Ambrose, captured the last five wickets for 58. West Indies opener Brathwaite did a good job of seeing off Anderson in a challenging first spell and though he eventually fell for 39, he enjoyed the test. Jordan later took a stunning catch at first slip off Tredwell's bowling to dismiss Brathwaite . 'Obviously when Anderson started with the new ball it was moving a lot, so facing him then was a little more challenging. 'But obviously he bowled a couple of overs before lunch as well so I don't know if maybe he was a little bit tired. 'It was a good challenge facing him when the ball is swinging both ways. The key is to keep as still as possible.' Brathwaite's knock would probably have lasted longer had anyone other than the athletic Jordan been stationed at slip, where he claimed a superb one-handed catch inches off the ground. Jordan is, of course, Barbados born - a fact not lost on Brathwaite. 'It was CJ who caught me, a fella from here, so it was quite unlucky.' About his catch, Jordan said: ' It was a reaction one but it rivals my best at this level.'","Jimmy Anderson claimed his 381st Test wicket on Tuesday in Antigua .

"Curtly’s war cry . West Indies received an animated pep talk from bowling coach and legendary paceman Curtly Ambrose. Ambrose, who terrorised many a batsman during the 1990s, looked to have roused his charges as they took five for 58 in the morning session. But Alastair Cook and Co will be happy to see the big man beyond the boundary rope rather than thundering down the wicket towards them himself. Curtly Ambrose's pep talk to West Indies bowlers must have worked on day two as they rolled over the tail . Battling Jordan . England’s ninth man in Chris Jordan played out an interesting duel with former Barbados team-mate Justin Holder - a close-fought battle which yielded nine runs from 27 balls, including two boundaries. Aside from Jordan’s knock and Anderson’s quickfire 20, England’s tail suffered a torrid morning — they began the day on 341 for five and were all out for 399 by lunch. West Indies bowler Jason Holder used to be a Barbados team-mate with Chris Jordan . Viv’s verdict . As well as a good morning with the bat, Jordan had a decent time with the ball after lunch.

Shiv Chanderpaul’s Test career has now lasted 21 years and 28 days — the 40-year-old has spent more of his life as a cricketer than not.

Shiv Chanderpaul's Test career for the West Indies has lasted over 21 years . Confusing review . The Decision Review System at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium caused prolonged confusion on Tuesday. Umpire Billy Bowden was unmoved by protests after Jordan was struck on the knee-roll by Holder, so the decision was reviewed. Without Hot Spot or Snicko, the third umpire spent a few minutes examining the replay before deciding Jordan had the finest of edges — only for the ball-tracker graphic to finally appear and show it was completely missing the stumps. KP worry . Kevin Pietersen had an injury scare when he was struck on the right hand while fielding at leg slip and fell to the ground.

"Ben Stokes thought he had claimed his 23rd Test wicket when Jermaine Blackwood slashed his short delivery straight to Alastair Cook at slip. But the Durham all-rounder’s front foot had crossed the line and the batsman earned a reprieve. It’s not the first time this has happened to Stokes, of course — a similar error saw him denied his first Test wicket against Australia in Adelaide in 2013. Ben Stokes was denied the wicket of Jermaine Blackwood after overstepping the crease . Stokes overstepped the line when he thought he had England's fifth wicket of the day in Antigua . Stokes celebrated wildly when Brad Haddin was caught behind on that occasion, and the pair clashed when the decision was overturned. Michael Vaughan, while commentating on BBC’s Test Match Special, thinks the 23-year-old should return to his natural style of bowling. ‘Stokes is trying to be a very English-type bowler,’ Vaughan said. ‘But when I’ve seen him bowl really well, I’ve seen him bowl short spells: really fast, with lots of bouncers.’ England gather in celebration of Stokes' wicket, only for it to be overturned by the umpire . Vaughan’s BBC colleague, Jonathan Agnew, thinks England will rue Tuesday’s showing. ‘England will look back on today as a missed opportunity in terms of batting,’ he said. ‘They still have the advantage, they’ve kept chipping away with wickets and they’ve kept things very tight, but they could have done with that Blackwood wicket.’","Ben Stokes was denied a wicket after bowling a no-ball .

Sharpe also expressed sympathy for Walter Scott's (above) family, noting this event has caused them both to 'change forever' 'I just can't,' Sharpe told ABC News. 'Maybe to some people, ""Well, you're being in denial,"" but I'm sorry I just can't. I just - I know how Michael is.' She went on to say her son loved being an officer. 'I can't imagine him doing something, it's just not like him,' she said of the shooting. 'That's just not his character. It's not.' As for Slager's wife, she said that earlier that day the two women had to go for a checkup together to see how her baby is doing. 'She was just so sad because he was not there and I know that he would not do something purposeful to not be able to be with his wife during the delivery,' Sharpe said of the doctor's appointment. 'They just tried so hard for this.' She then added; 'He has a little baby on the way, due next month, and they worked so hard for this baby.' The city had previously stated it would continue paying for Mrs. Slager's health insurance until she gives birth. Ms Sharpe also spoke about the Scott family as she said; 'Their life will never be the same again and my life will never be the same again. 'Even though they're not the same things that have happened, I know there are changes in both their family and my family ... and that's the part that bothers me. They've changed forever.' Ultimately, she is putting her trust in her faith, and refuses to believe that she might never see her son a free man again. 'I just have to let it be and hope God takes care of everybody involved -- not only my family but the Scott's family - because I know they're grieving just like I'm grieving,' she said. The shooting death of Scott by Slager occurred on Saturday morning . At the time, Slager said that Scott was going for his Taser and that he used necessary force . Video footage taken by an eyewitness soon refuted Slager's claims . Then, when asked about the video footage and if she had seen it yet, Sharpe said:  'No I have not and I have purposely not watched it.' She continued: 'I have purposely not heard people's comments about it. I just, I can't watch it.' She also said she is avoiding reading the papers of watching the news. 'I know who Michael is,' she explained. 'And I don't know what is being portrayed of him because I haven't listened to them, but he's a very good person.' Slager was charged with Scott's murder on Tuesday and could face the death penalty. He was terminated from the North Charleston police department the following day, with Chief Eddie Riggers telling a press conference that he had watched the video and found it 'sickening'. Slager has not entered a plea to the murder charge nor commented publicly on the killing last Saturday. This after the shooting was caught on camera by an eyewitness. Slager had reported that Scott was going for his Taser at the time, a claim the video footage refuted. He claimed to have stopped the man for a broken brake light.","The mother of North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager is speaking out as her son is behind bars for the the shooting death of Walter Scott .

"Michael Vaughan, who is favourite to become England’s cricket supremo, was quick to condemn the openers after West Indies got them both out early on. With Jonathan Trott out without scoring in the first over and captain Alastair Cook failing again Vaughan said: ‘Their footwork and their mindset has been about looking to survive rather than getting on top.’ Geoff Boycott was also critical of the pair, saying: ‘Opening batsmen are supposed to face the new ball when it’s doing a little bit. If you can’t play that, you’re in the wrong job.’ Michael Vaughan criticised the footwork and mindset of England's top order for just looking to survive . Jonathan Trott was out for a duck on his return to the Test match side in Antigua . Alastair Cook was clean bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 as England struggled on the first morning . Former fast bowler Bob Willis said: ‘England’s top three looked constipated and need a good dose of syrup of figs.’ West Indies’ early success after putting England into bat appeared at that stage to make a mockery of the comment by Colin Graves, the new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, who labelled the opposition ‘mediocre’.","England's top order collapsed on the first morning in Antigua .

"Roberto Martinez complained Seamus Coleman should have been awarded a free-kick before the Everton defender conceded the penalty that allowed Swansea to pinch a 1-1 draw at the Liberty Stadium. Everton manager Martinez felt Coleman had been barged by home striker Marvin Emnes before the Irish right-back scooped away the ball with his hands. And Martinez claimed referee Michael Oliver should have risen above the appeals from the Swansea faithful and used 'common sense' to rule in favour of Everton. Seamus Coleman falls over under the challenge from Marvin Emnes and handles the ball . Coleman appears to apologise to the visiting fans at the full-time whistle, but his manager says he was fouled . Martinez said on BT Sport 1: 'My thoughts are that straight away there is contact. Seamus tells me straight away there is contact and he gets unbalanced. 'Sometimes you need to apply a little bit of common sense. 'Clearly there's contact. I've seen it many times given as a free-kick. 'The whole action for me is too soft. I don't think that there's enough threat or a goalscoring threat to give a penalty. 'He's trying to protect the ball and gets unbalanced and from that point he expects the free-kick to be given. The Everton players protest but Michael Oliver deemed Coleman's handball deliberate, and gave a penalty . Jonjo Shelvey made no mistake from the spot as the former Liverpool midfielder equalised for Swansea . 'It's one of those actions where you expect the referee to be a little bit more above the occasion. 'You felt the crowd were asking for two or three decisions and it was building up to a decision and unfortunately we were on the receiving end.' Martinez labelled the result 'a real disappointment', after Aaron Lennon's first-half strike had looked set to give the visitors all three points. Jonjo Shelvey tucked away the penalty equaliser in the 69th minute. Martinez added: 'The only criticism is we had a period of 10, 15, 20 minutes where we were too comfortable in the second half and didn't find that final shot or try to score the second goal, but apart from that I do feel the draw doesn't reflect what happened.' Roberto Martinez was clearly angry with the referee's decision as his current side were held by his old club .","Seamus Coleman was penalised for handling in the penalty aread .

"Newcastle United had more than £34million sitting in the bank at the end of the last financial year, the club's full accounts have revealed. The club announced record profits last month of £18.7million for the 2013/14 season, but the full accounts registered with Companies House on Monday show that £38.6million was transferred into Newcastle's bank account as a cash-flow sum - paying off a £4.5million overdraft and leaving £34.1million available. The revelation has infuriated Newcastle fans who claim owner Mike Ashley has little ambition beyond remaining in the top flight and benefiting from the lucrative Premier League TV deals. Mike Ashley pictured  previously at Stamford Bridge as Newcastle United faced Chelsea in January . Newcastle had more than £34m in the bank at the end of the last financial year, the club's accounts  reveal . A protest, backed by the Newcastle United Supporters' Trust, is planned for Sunday with fans being urged to boycott the home match against Tottenham. The protest comes with the Magpies having lost their last five Premier League matches, including a painful 1-0 defeat at north-east rivals Sunderland. Mark Jensen, editor of online Newcastle fanzine themag.co.uk, said: 'The accounts show that all this cash was generated and the question a lot of fans would ask (is) why was a significant portion of that not spent on team strengthening? 'The idea of a boycott has been building for a long time and you can't blame the fans, and I'm all in favour of it. It's a starting point where fans may feel empowered and make their feelings known. 'The frustrating thing for them is the money is there but the club won't spend it. 'Newcastle United are a club that should be in the top eight every season - that's the size of the club with the support base it has and the benefit of being a city with one club. John Carver has taken over as manager of the North East club but is struggling to get them in form . The struggling Premier League club announced record profits last month of £18.7m for the 2013/14 season . 'We are going to fall well short of that this season and that equals failure in lots of fans' eyes. 'It seems that every transfer window the squad keeps weakening. People talk about Newcastle being a well-run business - that may be so in the short term but in the long term we have a squad which needs massive investment.' The accounts say owner Ashley still has £129million in interest-free loans outstanding but the money in the bank means the club's net debt is down to £94.8million. The accounts also reveal that £29.8million was spent on signings after June 30, with £12.6million coming in player sales - mainly from Mathieu Debuchy's move to Arsenal. The reported income from player sales does not appear to cover the January departures of Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa and Davide Santon, whose sales brought in around a further £8million. Newcastle's salary bill rose to £78.3million from £61.7million, a 27 per cent increase, but that was more than covered by the increase in income from the new Premier League television deal and sponsorship income - the ratio of wages to turnover dropped from 64 per cent to 60 per cent.

"Branislav Ivanovic was hit on the head by a lighter thrown by a fan as Chelsea edged closer to the title with a ‘lucky’ win over Queens Park Rangers. The Football Association will wait for referee Andre Marriner’s report before deciding whether to launch an investigation into crowd control after other missiles rained down on the Loftus Road pitch. QPR manager Chris Ramsey condemned the behaviour. ‘We don’t want any objects thrown on the pitch,’ he said. ‘Hostilities between fans can go too far. If that’s the case, we’ll encourage them not to come back.’ Jubilant Chelsea celebrations were marred by objects being thrown onto the pitch by the crowd . Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic hands over a coin to referee Andre Marriner during the match on Sunday . Jose Mourinho, who admitted Chelsea ‘were lucky’, refused to be drawn into the controversy. ‘The game was correct. Correct on the pitch, correct in the stands. Hopefully correct outside,’ he said. ‘If somebody throws a pound, put the pound in your pocket and go. If it’s a chocolate, eat it. No problem. ‘It’s not easy, because emotionally it’s a big game for them and us. The referee also helped, a very stable man who solves, not creates, problems in the game.’ During the Chelsea celebrations at Loftus Road, the Blues were targeted by objects thrown from the crowd . The Loftus Road pitch was covered in litter and objects following the west London derby contest on Sunday . Chelsea duo Nemanja Matic (left) and Branislav Ivanovic react after being struck with objects . Chelsea extended their lead over Arsenal to seven points, with a game in hand, and Mourinho added: ‘This was a typical game for 0-0. So, obviously, very happy with my team because we kept always good emotional control. We never lost balance, we were not under pressure; if we’d had to go home with a point, we would have.’ Mourinho said Loic Remy should be available for next weekend’s home game with Manchester United after sitting this one out with a calf strain. Meanwhile, Ramsey refused to blame Green for Sunday's loss, despite the goalkeeper's crucial mistake. Cesc Fabregas' low strike, Chelsea's first shot on target, was enough to secure the win at Loftus Road . 'I'm not blaming Robert Green. It wasn't one of his best kicks, but we had a long time to defend that properly and we didn't, for the first time in the game,' said the QPR boss. 'You have to defend it better. Rob is going to be down because he's a top player. We all make mistakes. 'Why didn't we score? That's a mistake in itself. ‘Rob has been fantastic for this club this season. If he had not been in the form he has been, we wouldn't be anywhere near. I'm hoping he doesn't internalise it as his fault why we lost.'

"Harry Panayiotou has scooped the Barclays Premier League Player of the Month award after impressing for an in-form Leicester City side in March. The striker, 20, scored three goals, including those in impressive victories against Sunderland and reigning champions Chelsea, and has been chosen ahead of all the players in Division 1 and 2 based on his performance statistics. Panayiotou also netted a hat-trick in his third game for St Kitts and Nevis on international duty, and is looking to make an impression under Nigel Pearson at the King Power Stadium. Sportsmail held an exclusive Q&A with the forward after he found out about the accolade. Harry Panayiotou has scooped the Barclays Premier League U21 Player of the Month award for March . Congratulations, Harry. How would you describe your style of play at Leicester? Hold up play, roll the defender. And I've got a good burst of acceleration! Who do you look up to in the first team? Jeff (Schlupp). I grew up with Jeff so to see him come through the youth ranks, he's definitely my role model. Do you train with them often? I do, but not as much as I'd like to. Your record at Leicester reads one game, one goal. How did that come about? I was a first year and I scored 20 goals that season. They had nothing to play for [against Leeds] so they chucked me up there, and I came on and scored! How often do you speak to Nigel Pearson? Not too much this season, he's a busy guy! But when he has a chance to come talk to me, he comes and talks to me. Is your goal to make it at Leicester next season, or go out on loan? I'm Leicester born and bred and my goal is to make the first team, that's all I've ever wanted to do, it's not about going anywhere else to me. I'd love for us to stay in the Premier League, and I believe I can handle it. Panayiotou hopes to make Leicester City's first team in the Premier League and has grown up nearby . How do you relax away from football? Chill with my friends, I'm around some really good people. On to that international hat-trick... how did you get to play for St Kitts? My mum and grandma are from St Kitts, and my grandma passed away when I was younger - so making the choice to play for them came from the heart. What was the reaction when you came back? Everyone's jealous when I go away (laughs), but they were still really happy. U21 manager Steve [Beaglehole] couldn't stop looking at me for a week! Where did you play, and what was it like? Turks and Caicos. It was really hot!  When you go to the Caribbean, you either have to train at 7am or at night time. The players in the Caribbean are much stronger and really quick, so you have to think quick - that's all it is. Some of them aren't the best players but they have certainly got a lot of strength so you've got to adapt to that. Any St Kitts players you would tip to make it? Romaine Sawyers from Walsall, he's technically brilliant. I think he'll get a move this summer because he's really good. And our captain is doing great with FC Dallas in the MLS right now, Atiba Harris. There's a few others from England, who could definitely be higher up but they just haven't been seen. Panayiotou posted this picture on Twitter with the caption 'motherland' while he was away on international duty . Last album you listened to? I went to the Nicki Minaj concert the other day [in Nottingham[ so has to be The Pink Print . Last film? Fast and furious 7... emotional to be fair. Last holiday (apart from your international break!)? Egypt . A player you would tip to make it at Leicester? Ben Chilwell (England U19 international) Best advice you've received from a first team player? I remember Andy King once speaking to me. He said when you come and make an impression, don't worry about what anyone has to say and just make sure you're seen. Keep working hard, going to the gym, keep practicing. Best player you've ever played against? Sammy Ameobi, he's got great feet, we played him a tournament a couple of years ago. For how tall he is it's actually amazing, and his finishing is on point! What would you be doing if you weren't a footballer? I've always seen myself as a footballer. Nothing else. Maybe I'd be in the Caribbean, it's just peaceful. The striker battles with Everton's Ryan Ledson during an Under 21 Premier League game in January . The award has been established to recognise the next generation of players coming through, coinciding with Barclays' own work to encourage the next generation of fans, which will see thousands of tickets and unique football experiences given away via the Barclays Spirit of the Game website. A winner will be selected every month for the rest of the season, as well as the Barclays Under 21 Premier League Player of the Season being unveiled in May.","Harry Panayiotou selected from 24 teams in Division One and Two .

"Rangers boss Stuart McCall  ordered his side to end their stuttering away form at Dumbarton on Saturday to ramp up the pressure on play-off rivals Hibs. The Ibrox boss watched his side drop two points against bottom side Livingston in West Lothian but insisted the 1-1 draw — with Myles Hippolyte and Marius Zaliukas trading goals — could end up being crucial in the quest to finish second. Rangers have only won once in their last five away matches and McCall insists nothing less than a victory will do at the Bet Butler Stadium this weekend as his side aim to go four clear in second while Hibs face Falkirk in the Scottish Cup semi finals. Stuart McCall wants his side to put their away-day blues behind them at Dumbarton on Saturday . ‘We could be four ahead on Saturday night so that might be a very important point for us tonight,’ said McCall on a night when Rangers fans let off a series of fireworks in the Energy Assets Arena. ‘It’s still in our hands — but we have got to go and win on Saturday! ‘Of course I’m disappointed not to win the game. We didn’t deserve any more but this wasn’t a case of us blowing hot and cold. We’ve no divine right to come here and win. ‘I said before the game this would be a tough place to come. OK, we didn’t play as fluently as we would have liked but Livvy were fighting for their lives. They are a physical side and Hibs and Queen of the South have still to come here. Rangers dropped two points at Championship bottom side Livingston in their bid for promotion . Myles Hippolyte gave Livingston the lead early in the second half and threatened to upset Rangers . ‘It was a game that panned out the way I expected on a tight park, dry and bumpy. It was a fair result. You can’t stop a free kick like that (by Hippolyte).’ Meanwhile, Mark Burchill was left ruing a first half ‘goal’ by Hippolyte that was chalked off after a supposed foul by Jordan White on Cammy Bell. But the Livvy boss was also left lamenting his team’s dire defending 120 seconds after taking the lead through Hippolyte’s fine freekick. ‘I think everyone here knows it should have been a goal by Myles in the first half,’ he sighed. Marius Zaliukas equalised a couple of minutes later for Rangers at the Energy Assets Arena . ‘I’m just really disappointed. It was a terrible goal for us to lose. If you go ahead in a match you really want to do better than that. When you’ve taken the lead that’s your most vulnerable time as a team. And I just feel if we had weathered that then Rangers would have run out of ideas. ‘It was not the best we have played but I felt we more than matched Rangers tonight. I watched them on Sunday against Raith and I thought we could get three points from them and I’m disappointed we never managed to do that.’","Rangers held to a 1-1 draw by bottom side Livingston on Wednesday .

"West Ham have been dealt a blow by the news that Diafra Sakho could be out for the rest of the season with a thigh injury. The 25-year-old striker came off after 58 minutes of Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Stoke with a thigh strain. He was sent for scans on Monday amid fears he may have a minor tear and club physios are hopeful it is not as severe as first thought.
