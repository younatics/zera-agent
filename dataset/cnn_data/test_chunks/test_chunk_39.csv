"A pensioner who went into hospital and came home to find her possessions had been cleared out has criticised her son who she says 'didn't think I was going to make it'. Pamela Clothier was admitted to hospital forcing her to leave her bungalow in Battle, Sussex. But the 92-year-old's family was under the impression she planned to sell the house and allowed charity Age UK to clear it out. Her beloved dog Mitzy was also taken to a local animal sanctuary and later re-homed. After returning to find the house empty, the great-grandmother has criticised the charity and her family. Scroll down for video . Pamela Clothier had to retrieve her possessions after she returned from hospital to find her house cleared . The 92-year-old says the worst thing was losing her dog, Mitzy, who was given to a local animal sanctuary . Mrs Clothier said: 'My son Peter didn't think I was going to make it, so he just upped and tried to sell everything. I can't believe he could be so cruel.' She added: 'They left me with nothing. All my furniture was gone, all my diaries, books, clothes, everything. The worst thing is that I can't get my dog back either.' She spoke about the incident after Age UK offered her an 'insulting' £1,000 compensation. She said: 'They did get me some of my furniture back, and I have been able to get more things from my friends, but I still feel like it's not my home any more. 'In my day I would have knocked the spots off anybody, but now I'm absolutely demolished.' Mrs Clothier has lived alone since her Bomber Command hero husband Clyde passed away in 1991. The fiercely independent nonagenarian added: 'I loved my home - it had masses of memories. I've got nothing now, not even my dog. 'Peter made up his mind that selling my property was the thing to do, and he got rid of the furniture that was clogging up the place. I was left effectively having to start my life over again.' Pamela Clothier says she was horrified when a charity cleared out her belongings without her permission . She said she did not explicitly permit the organisation to remove her belongings and wanted them back. The pensioner is calling for a change in the law to make it more difficult for charities to act in such a way without the homeowner's permission. 'I'm 92-years-old and I'm in a house which is almost empty,' said Mrs Clothier told the BBC's South East Today. 'All the work I've done, all the knitting and sewing I've done,all the things I've made are gone. It's just like I didn't exist,' she added through tears. Mrs Clothier's son Peter  insists she knew what was happening and he saved many of her things . She said she was horrified the charity had carried out her son's instruction without checking with her first. 'I think they should be absolutely certain that the person who's holding the key has the right to be doing what they're doing.' Her son, Peter Clothier, said his mother knew to expect her things would be cleared as they had made arrangements for her to move out of the home. 'Everything was done in negotiation with her, while she was in hospital I would visit with an iPad to show her the rooms and we negotiated what was going to be done, what would be kept and thrown out,' Mr Clothier told MailOnline. 'She was going to move into a home temporarily and then she was going to move into a flat. 'While she was in hospital I redecorated the house and she put it on the market but when she returned she decided she would rather stay. I did in fact save a lot of her things.' While Mrs Clothier was in care two years ago a driver from Age UK visited the property to collect her things. The charity has apologised for her ordeal and said it had reviewed its procedures since. 'We were advised that Mrs Clothier wanted to make a donation of furniture, small items and clothing, as she was moving into a nursing home and her property was to be sold,' a spokesman told MailOnline. When they learned she wanted her possessions back, Age UK say they invited her to collect them. 'Mrs Clothier attended our premises and took back the items she wanted. We feel we acted fairly in this situation and received donations in good faith at the request of her family member. 'We have never had an incident like this before or since. However, since this incident we have reviewed our procedures to minimise this happening again.' The 92-year-old said her home in Battle, East Sussex now feels empty with so few of her possessions left . Charities are legally able to remove the contents of an elderly person's home without checking with them if they have been expressly told to do so by a relative. But critics say more should be done to protect the elderly and their assets. 'We share Ms Clothier's outrage that her lifelong possessions have been stripped from her home without her permission,' said John Beer, chairman of Action on Elder Abuse. 'This is yet another example  of the sickening financial abuse that older people in the United Kingdom face day in, day out.'","Pamela Clothier was admitted to hospital for a short stint last year .

"Britain could face another devastating economic crash unless more jobs are created outside the M25, David Cameron warned today. The Conservative leader set out an ambition that three in five new jobs should be created outside London and the South East to prevent a ‘reckless’ economy booming in the capital. He said that the recovery must be seen in every part of the country and not just ‘on the screens of the traders in the City of London’. Tory leader David Cameron says that the recovery must be seen in every part of the country and not just ‘on the screens of the traders in the City of London’ Chancellor George Osborne joined Mr Cameron to launch a North West manifesto at a train depot in Crewe . Latest figures show that there are 2million more people in work than in 2010, and the Tories have promised to create another 2million by 2020. Mr Cameron used a speech in Crewer to insist that the economy is the key issue in the general election. ‘I’m clear – our economy isn’t just about the nation’s statistics, it’s about the nation’s families. ‘It’s about the job you do, the chances your children have, the funding we have for our NHS and schools, the hope we have for our future – everything.’ He warns that as well as securing growth, he wants to rebalance the economy to ensure that ‘success is felt from North, to South, to East, to West’. Mr Cameron said: ‘I didn’t come into this to create some reckless, booming economy just within the M25. ‘That’s what we had before. In Labour’s Britain, where for every ten private sector jobs created in the South, just one was created in the North and the Midlands. ‘In Labour’s Britain, where the whole weight of our economy rested on massive public borrowing, unsustainable financial services, out-of-control immigration…a house of cards – ready to be blown away should any crisis hit.’ The Conservatives are pledging to ‘back business to create 2 million new jobs’,Mr Cameron said. Mr Cameron added: ‘This is my goal – that more than 60 per cent of these will be outside London and the South East. That is what we’ve done in the last Parliament. ‘Because my vision has always been of a truly balanced economy, one built to last, one which is seen not just on the screens of the traders in the City of London. ‘But in the great manufacturing plants of the West Midlands and North East, in tech start-ups from Dundee to Manchester, in the tourist and defence industries of the South West and Wales, the life sciences labs of the East of England: a truly national recovery.’ Speaking in Crewe, Mr Osborne said that Britain's future cannot depend on 'placing all our bets on the success of the City of London almost 200 miles to the South' Mr Cameron set out an ambition that three in five new jobs should be created outside London and the South East to prevent a ‘reckless’ economy booming in the capital. Mr Cameron was joined by Chancellor George Osborne to launch the Tories' plan for the North West. In a speech at a train depot in Crewe, Mr Osborne said reiterated his commitment to the Northern Powerhouse, which includes bringing together high speed rail links, faster county services, new train carriages, extended metrolinks, port facilities, expanded motorways and new roads. He added: 'That Northern Powerhouse is rooted in the idea that there is nothing inevitable about the gap between the North and South in our country growing ever wider. 'It’s part of a vision that our nation’s future no longer depends on placing all our bets on the success of the City of London almost 200 miles to the South – but that we draw on the skills and ingenuity and wealth-creating potential of all of our country. 'And it’s based on the insight that great as the towns and cities of the North are, they can be greater still as the sum of their parts – if we invest in the communication links, the science, the industry, the education, and we trust our great northern communities with control of their own affairs.' The Tories have been boosted by a string of positive economic news in recent weeks, but it has failed to trigger an uptick in their poll ratings. The employment rate is higher in regions like the South West and East of England than it is in London, according to the Office for National Statistics . Unemployment has continued to fall and a record 31 million people are in work, the last jobless figures before the general election showed last week. The jobless total has fallen by 76,000 to 1.84 million in the quarter to February, the lowest for almost seven years. The International Monetary Fund predicts the UK economy will grow by 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent in 2016, beaten only by the United States. IMF chief Chrstine Lagarage heaped praise on Chancellor George Osborne, telling a press conference in Washington: 'When we look at the comparative growth rates delivered by various countries in Europe it's obvious that what is happening in the UK has actually worked.' And German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Mr Osborne had done 'a wonderful job' in the past two years after strong economic growth.","Conservative leader promises to help create 2million new jobs by 2020 .

"A convicted California serial killer who went on a nine-day rampage that claimed the lives of four people has been denied parole and cannot reapply for seven years. Brett Matthew Paul Thomas, now 56, and his friend, Mark Titch, were convicted in 1977 after committing the murders during robbery or burglary attempts in Orange County. Thomas, who was 18 at the time, and Titch, who was 17, were both sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. Titch died behind bars last year. Scroll down for video . Denied parole: Brett Matthew Paul Thomas(pictured), who was 18 (left) at the time of his nine-day killing spree and who is now 56 (right), was denied parole and cannot reapply for seven years . Took her family: Lynette Duncan waits before giving a statement for the denial of parole for Brett Thomas, one of two teenagers who murdered her father and sister 33 years ago . The two were neighbors at a Stanton apartment complex that the police had dubbed 'The Zoo' because of the criminal activity there, City News Service reported. Their first victim was Laura Stoughton, 20, who interrupted the pair on Jan. 21, 1977, as they were breaking into her home. They abducted her and drove to an abandoned field, where Titch shot her at close range with a stolen .22-caliber rifle. Three days later, the two killed Ephraim Jacob Christian, 35, during a botched robbery at Rockview Dairy. Five days after that, Thomas and Titch followed the owner of a billiards hall to his home with a plan to rob him. They gunned down Aubrey Duncan at his home, and then shot his 18-year-old daughter, Denise, in the heart after her mother opened the door to find out what was going on. Horrified: Lynette Duncan, one of the surviving daughters of Aubrey Duncan, still remembers telling her sister that her father and Denise were dead, she said . Duncan's wife and two other daughters survived, as did an 11-year-old daughter who was at a neighbor's house. Police caught up with Thomas and Titch the following month in neighboring San Bernardino County, where they were driving around in a stolen car. At a press conference before Friday's parole hearing, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said Thomas was 'a serial murderer who has not and cannot reform.' Lynette Duncan, one of the surviving daughters of Aubrey Duncan, still remembers telling her sister that her father and Denise were dead, she said. 'That was the day she learned that the boogeyman was real and evil really did exist, and its name is Brett Thomas,' Duncan said, according to the Orange County Register. Dead:  Mark Titch (pictured), who was 17 (left) at the time of the killing was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole but died behind bars last year at the age of 55 (right) On Friday, Prosecutors and relatives of the victims headed to a San Diego courthouse for the hearing to urge the parole board to grant a 15-year window before Thomas can apply for parole. 'When you do this, you relive all the pain, it comes right out onto the page,' Duncan said on Friday. 'Then I've gotta sit 15 feet from evil and be in the same room as evil ... It's hard,' she said. Duncan said attending the parole hearing is not as hard as seeing her family's murderer on the street. 'This is hard, but living with him out on the street is going to be a whole lot harder,' Lynette Duncan said of Brett Matthew Paul Thomas. 'So I will continue to appear at every parole hearing until he dies or I do,' Duncan said as she joined prosecutors in court.","Convicted killer Brett Matthew Paul Thomas, now 56, has been denied parole and cannot reapply for seven years .

"The hunt for missing flight MH370 will be extended, with government officials from Australia, China and Malaysia deciding to double the search area. The airplane, which spectacularly vanished last year with 239 people on board, is believed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean off Australia's west coast. By expanding the search area for the downed plane, the mission to recover it could go on for another 12 months, according to government officials. Scroll down for video . Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on-board . The expanded search will 'cover the entire highest probability area identified by expert analysis', Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss. He made the announcement after meeting with Malaysian transport minister Liow Tiong Lai and Chinese transport minister Yang Chuantang on Thursday. 'We're confident we're searching in the right area,' Mr Truss told a press conference. 'I'm very confident that we have the best search equipment in the world and if the aircraft is in the area that we're looking, we will find it. 'The high resolution of the pictures that the ministers have been shown today gives us a high level of confidence that, if there is any piece of the aircraft that's within the range of these vehicles, they will pick it up and be able to identify it.' Mr Truss added all those involved in the search were determined to do everything possible 'to give answers to the families of the loves ones who've been lost'. The news came weeks after fresh testimonies from a small island community in the Maldives reignited reports the plane could have crashed more than 5,000 kilometres away from the official search led by Australian authorities. Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss (L), Malaysia's Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai (C) and Chinese Transport Minister Yang Chuantan (R) shake hands after the MH370 joint press conference at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur . Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo, located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives, reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year. They believed they had identified red and blue markings, similar to those of the missing plane, on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the MH370's disappearance, according to the Weekend Australian. 'I'm very sure of what I saw on a very clear and bright day, and what I saw was not normal- the plane was very big, and low,' Ahmed Shiyaam said. Mr Truss added that all those involved in the search were determined to do everything possible 'to give answers to the families of the loves ones who've been lost' The search zone for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 will be doubled if nothing is found in the huge undersea area now being scanned for wreckage . Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year when MH370 disappeared . Kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll, in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean . 'I did not know until later that other people saw it too. I don't know if it's the Malaysia plane.' Abdu Rasheed Ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water, and did not know at the time that it could be the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 'I didn't know that a plane was missing,' Mr Ibrahim said. The search has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia . The search for the missing plane has been headed up by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre . The expanded search will 'cover the entire highest probability area identified by expert analysis', Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss . 'I went straight home and told my wife about it. I told my family, 'I saw this strange plane'. 'This is the biggest plane I have ever seen from this island...I have seen pictures of the missing plane- I believe I saw the plane...I strongly felt those people who were searching should come here.' Acoustic scientists from Curtin University refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean. A detailed map of the search was released by the Australian government . Dr Alec Duncan and his associates from the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of Rottnest Island just after 1:30 am UTC on March 8. 'Data from one of the IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of MH370,' Dr Duncan said in a statement released by Curtin University. 'The crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds.' Curtin University Centre for Marine Science and Technology's Dr Alec Duncan began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal . Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman declared the crash an accident . Dr Duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event, including a small earth tremor, but the timing piqued the interest of his research team. The crash was officially declared an accident by Malaysia civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman earlier this year. 'Based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely. It is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 an accident,' Mr Rahman said. It is more than one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events since the plane disappeared. 2014 . March 8 . The Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 takes off from Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am local time bound for Beijing, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew. The plane is last seen on military radar at 2.14am, heading west over the Strait of Malacca. Half an hour later the airline reveals to the public that it has lost contact with the plane. The plane was due to land at around 6.30am. March 10 . Vietnamese aircraft search for a plane door spotted in their waters but find nothing. A day later the hunt is widened to cover a 115-nautical mile radius involving 34 aircraft and 40 ships from several countries. March 13 . Malaysian authorities expand their search for the missing jet into the Andaman Sea and beyond after acknowledging it could have flown for several more hours after its last contact with the ground. March 15 . Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak says the missing airliner was deliberately diverted and continued flying for more than six hours after losing contact with the ground. March 8 to April 24 . The search area covers the South China Sea, the Straits of Malacca, the Andaman Sea and the southern Indian Ocean. April 24 . The search and rescue phase becomes a search and recovery phase, with it moving a few days later to an underwater phase using an autonomous underwater vehicle and a bathymetry survey covering an area around 430 miles (692km) long and 50 miles (80km) wide. June 2014 . Australian authorities issue a preliminary report in which they theorise that MH370's crew became incapacitated, possibly due to oxygen starvation, with the plane continuing on autopilot. August 28 . Australia's deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, says the aircraft 'might have turned south a little earlier than we have previously expected'. September 19 . After a four-month lull, it is announced that the underwater search, involving depths of up to 3.7 miles (6km), would resume at the end of September. October 2014 . The new underwater search involves ships dragging sonar devices called towfish through the water about 330ft (100m) above the seabed to hunt for wreckage. The towfish are equipped with jet fuel sensors and can transmit data to those on board the vessels. 2015 . January . Senior Boeing 777 captain Simon Hardy suggests the missing aircraft's final resting place is in the Indian Ocean just outside the far south-western edge of the core search area. January 28 . Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) officially declares the incident 'an accident'. The DCA says it had concluded the aircraft exhausted its fuel 'over a defined area of the southern Indian Ocean'. The DCA adds that efforts to find the plane will continue. March 7 . Malaysia's transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, says data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of May. April 14 .

"From the dry, relentless heat of Alice Springs to the icy cold hills of Canberra, a university student will push his body to the limit, running a marathon in each of Australia’s eight states and territories to honour the memory of his late, treasured childhood friend. Although he had never run a marathon before, Callum Ryan, 21, committed himself to the daunting challenge of running eight of them between January and September 2015 - covering a total distance of 337.5 kilometres. His ‘Eight Great States’ campaign is driven by his passion to make a difference after the loss of his friend, Malachy Frawley who died from heart disease in 2013 when he was just 14 years old. Callum is preparing to battle vastly different weather conditions and diverse terrains as he pounds the pavement right around Australia, raising funds for not-for-profit organisation HeartKids Australia - supporting thousands of children living with heart defects. Callum posing like international running champion Usain Bolt at the finish line after the Canberra Times Marathon on April 12, with his little sister Josie and brother Henrik . Callum Ryan poses with his treasured friend Malachy Frawley, who sadly passed away when he was 14 . Malachy Frawley brought laughter to the world in his short but wonderful life, showing great courage through his lifelong battle with the severe heart condition Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome . The University of Sydney student has committed himself to the incredible endeavour in memory of a Malachy, who brought laughter to the world in his short but wonderful life, showing great courage through his lifelong battle with the severe heart condition Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome. Callum is inspired by the incredible strength and resilience Malachy displayed as he faced the challenges of a Congenital Heart Disease, which severely affected his mobility. Since January, Callum has already faced his first three marathons: kicking it all off with a 22 degree race in Hobart, sweating through the 28 degree heat in the Victoria town of Wangaratta and freezing through an icy seven degree start in Canberra. With each race, Callum has improved on his previous time by at least ten minutes. This comes despite his muscle fatigue with the quick turnaround as he pushes his body to recover and do it all again! The worst is yet to come, as Callum is scheduled to run a marathon in Darwin and then summon the strength to run another in Perth just 14 days later - and another 21 days after that in Sydney. Despite Malachy being five years Callum's junior, they forged a truly special friendship . 'Finished first! (out of all the people running to raise money for HeartKids obviously)' Callum joked after he finishing the Wangaratta marathon in sweltering, 35 degree heat . Eight Great States: One man, eight marathons, eight states and territories, nine months, 337.56 kilometres . Every step of the way, the memory of Malachy is never far from Callum's mind – helping him to find the mental strength to make it to the finish line. ‘At times during the race I thought “it’d be easier to stop now, no one would think any worse of you because a marathon is a tough thing to try”,' Callum said. ‘But I set out to do this. As I run, I sometimes think of Malachy and the thousands and thousands of other kids in that situation.' 'While I was running I thought about kids with Congenital Heart Disease and their families.' Callum is conscious of how lucky he is to be healthy and able to complete a marathon. Every step of the way, the memory of Malachy is never far from Callum's mind – helping him to find the mental strength to make it to the finish line . Malachy was the beloved younger brother of Niamh, Imogen and Seamus, growing up in NSW's Nowra . HeartKids made incredible changes to Malachy's life (pictured with his father Dom and mother Maggie). They supplied him with a segway so he could be more mobile and have his own independence . Hobart was the perfect location for Callum to embark on his first ever marathon - an ideal 22 degrees . ‘Children with CHD struggle to walk around in their day to day lives because their bodies aren't equipped. ‘I had to stick to my challenge because they find that strength every day.’ ‘I disappeared into those types of thoughts and the kilometres fell away.’ ‘With the personal connection none of it feels like a chore or a risk.’ He hopes to make people aware of the plight of children with heart disease and the need to support the children and their families. Every day in Australia, eight babies are born with a heart defect. Every week, four precious lives are lost and vital research needs to take place to work out of how to save them. ‘‘I first came across HeartKids through Malachy. I’d raised money for them before but I wanted to do something significant for Heartkids.’ Every day in Australia, eight babies are born with a heart defect. Every week, four precious lives are lost and vital research needs to take place to work out of how to save them . When Malachy (left) was in kindergarten the pair were excited to discover Callum (right) had also been allocated as Malachy’s Year Six buddy – a mentor and friendly face across the playground . Callum grew up in Nowra in New South Wales’ South Coast, where he formed a close bond with Malachy Frawley (second from left, with his siblings), a family friend five years his junior . ‘The most frightening thing about CHD is that there is no cure at the moment. If you’re born with it, then it’s with you for life. Lives are sadly cut short by it.’ Callum grew up in Nowra in New South Wales’ South Coast, where he formed a close bond with Malachy Frawley, a family friend five years his junior. When Malachy was in kindergarten the pair were excited to discover Callum had also been allocated as Malachy’s Year Six buddy – a mentor and friendly face across the playground. Despite Malachy being five years his junior, they forged a truly special friendship. ‘They had a very lovely friendship. They had the chance to get to know each other despite being five years apart,’ explained Malachy’s father, Dr Dom Frawley. ‘Lucky enough for Callum and Malachy they were paired up and their personalities really gelled. Although he had never run a marathon before, Callum Ryan, 21, committed himself to the daunting challenge of running eight of them between January and September 2015 . Since January, Callum has already faced his first three marathons: including sweating through the 28 degree heat in the Victoria town of Wangaratta (r) and freezing through a seven degree start in Canberra (l) ‘Malachy looked up to Callum a lot as a mentor and Callum took that role seriously and invested a lot of time in Malachy. ‘They got the chance to discover they had a lot in common in the way they saw and thought about things, particularly in the way they were so creative.’ In his fourteen short years, Malachy left his mark on the world – creating, daydreaming and making people smile. Malachy has been remembered as ‘an author, film director, comedian, drummer, raconteur and HeartKids.’ He was adored for his ‘wit and loving nature.’ Malachy was affected by one of the most serious heart conditions, which greatly affected his mobility. Although Callum will be travelling to many marathons alone during his Eight States campaign, he travelled via Camry with his great mate Nick Peters to his third marathon in the ACT . Dom and his family have been greatly touched by Callum’s (third from left) commitment to making a change in the life of other children . He had needed to rely on others to drive or piggyback up from place to place, until HeartKids gifted him with a Segway. ‘The Segway completely transformed his life,’ said his father Dom. ‘He could suddenly get places without having to rely on people to carry him, which was quite a dramatic change from what he’d always been able to do.’ Their boy with a quick wit and limitless imagination now had the freedom of movement and increased independence, able to travel around his neighbourhood and to and from school. ‘I left the training a bit late before my first marathon, frankly. I felt really nervous before my first marathon, thinking “have I done enough?”’. Dom and his family have been greatly touched by Callum’s commitment to making a change in the life of other children. ‘We’re very gratified and we’re touched by it. Hopefully it will help a lot of people with the sickness to raise funds and awareness. ‘It’s great for him to have that awareness. Callum cares a lot about people.’ You can donate to Callum's Eight Great States campaign to help HeartKids here .

'I just want to say to you, you might not know, but you are very loved in this country,' Prime Minster Simpson Miller told President Obama. 'So I just wanted to say you're well-loved in Jamaica. Well, first of all I can say to you publicly, 'I love you.'' Simpson Miller said she hoped Obama understood how important his visit is to Jamaica.

"Nigel Farage, pictured after Reckless's defection to Ukip, is likely to look a little less smug after it was revealed the Rochester and Strood MP is facing an uphill struggle to keep his seat . The Tory MP who defected to Ukip to trigger the Rochester and Strood by-election is on course to lose the seat at the General Election. According to the latest secret polling bombshell to hit Nigel Farage’s party, Mark Reckless, who became Ukip’s second MP last November, faces an uphill battle to hold on to his 2,920 majority on May 7. The disclosure comes after Ukip was thrown into turmoil by last week’s leak to The Mail on Sunday of a survey showing Mr Farage trailing the Tories in his target seat of Thanet South. The private Rochester data is understood to put Mr Reckless narrowly behind the Conservative candidate Kelly Tolhurst, who he defeated in November’s by-election. When Mr Reckless stood for the Tories at the 2010 Election he had a majority of just under 10,000 votes. As with the Thanet South poll, the party has decided against publicising the figures in case supporters are demoralised. A senior Ukip source said: ‘It is not looking easy for Mark, but we are hopeful the figures are misleading.’ However, another source added: ‘We aren’t that bothered because Reckless isn’t particularly popular.’ Some analysts think Ukip could be left with just one MP – Douglas Carswell, who won Clacton in a byelection with a 12,000 majority. Last night Ukip denied the party had itself commissioned polling in Rochester but said: ‘We always knew it would be a tough fight.’ Ukip convert Mark Reckless faces an uphill battle to hold on to his 2,920 majority in Rochester and Strood .","Reckless' by-election majority of 2,920 in Rochester and Strood my be lost .

"A New Jersey school teacher took the mic at a town hall meeting Tuesday to tell presumptive 2016 presidential candidate Chris Christie that he needs to check his attitude at the door. 'I really feel that you need to tone it down a little bit,' said kindergarten teacher Cheryl Meyer, 'if you want to become president of the United States.' Meyer said it would be difficult for her to explain to her young students why it's okay for a presidential figure to say 'shut up' and 'idiot.' Cool it: New Jersey schoolteacher Cheryl Meyer told Chris Christie to cool it with the attitude at a town hall meeting Tuesday . 'I really feel that you need to tone it down a little bit,' said Meyer (left), 'if you want to become president of the United States' Christie was careful to choose his answer calmly as cameras rolled. 'There are always going to be differences of opinion in style,' he said before explaining, to applause, that he doesn't believe public figures must answer politely no matter how nasty a question or comment might be. 'Sometimes I just want to do it,' when people have pushed his buttons, he said. Whereas, other times, 'you just have a bad day.' Christie's response seemed to please many in the audience, who clapped each chance they got to affirm Christie's no-nonsense attitude. However, according to NBC New York, one member of the audience was sure to see things a little differently. Watching the Matawan town hall meeting was Jim Keady, who Christie famously told to 'sit down and shut up' for heckling him over the disbursement of Superstorm Sandy funds. Christie was careful to choose his answer calmly as cameras rolled.'There are always going to be differences of opinion in style' he said before explaining, to applause, that he doesn't believe public figures must answer politely no matter how nasty a question or comment might be . 'Of course you have the urge. You're a human being. ... But it's called self-control, it's called respect for your office,' said Keady, who is now running for state assembly. Whether its his nice side or temperamental side, what seems certain is that we'll all be seeing a lot of Chris Christie in the coming weeks and months. The potential Republican presidential contender will be kicking off what his team has dubbed a 'Tell it like it is' town hall tour in Londonderry, New Hampshire on April 15. A spokeswoman for his political action committee says a second town hall will he held on April 17. He’ll also hold events in Manchester and Newmarket and speak at a New Hampshire GOP-organized summit in Nashua. The trip will be Christie’s first extended swing through the early voting state that is seen a place where his blunt style could play well with voters. Christie’s office says he’s held over 130 town hall events during his tenure as governor.

"A Georgia woman is speaking out about her refusal to follow doctors' advice and pull the plug on her husband of just seven months following a devastating motorcycle crash. Danielle Davis says she looked to her faith when she was faced with the prospect of losing her husband Brian in 2011, just seven months after they were married. 'I knew that God could get us through that,' she said, in an interview at the couple's Georgetown home Tuesday. 'I didn't think that it was too big for God.' Scroll down for video . Tragic: Danielle Davis says she looked to her faith when she was faced with the prospect of losing her husband Brian in 2011, just seven months after they were married when he was involved in a near fatal motorcycle crash . Davis tells WTOC that doctors told her they would have chosen to pull the plug had they been in her position. 'That's what they'd want their family to do,' she recalls hearing them say. But she refused to give up and Brian was eventually released into her care. Weeks went by and one day, miraculously, Brian spoke. 'I'm trying,' he told her. Danielle would soon come to the painful conclusion that Brian had no idea she was his wife. Brian tells WTOC that he also had no clue his father was dead or that he'd been married to begin with. Three years had been wiped from his memory for good. Though, finding out Danielle was his wife was a happy moment among many struggles. 'I saw her, and I was like, 'yeah,'' he recalls. Hopeless: Brian's motorcycle was split in two and doctors initially urged his wife to take him off life support . Danielle refused to give up on Brian and took him into her full time care as he was still bedridden and hooked to a feeding tube . Miracle: Eventually, Brian started to improve and miraculously spoke the words 'I'm trying' one day weeks after Danielle took him home with dismal prospects . Now, he and Danielle work on his rehabilitation daily and use yoga to help him sharpen his mind and regain control of his body. While Danielle is thrilled that Brian has improved to the point he no longer requires medications, she says on a GoFundMe page started for the cause that the couple is too strapped to pay for all the rehabilitative care Brian still requires. And insurance will no longer cover it. 'People with Traumatic Brain Injury need a lot of rehab, people continue to make improvements even 10 years after their injury,' she writes. 'Insurance doesn't pay for the amount of therapy they need so often times that person doesn't reach their full potential.' Thankfully, after just one month, the fundraiser has received some $11,000 in donations. As Brian continues to make great strides, most recently with his commitment to learning to walk the way he once did, he wants others to know how good they've got it. 'People don't realize how much they can actually do with their bodies,' he said. 'They take it for granted.' Improvements: Now Danielle says Brian is improving all the time and has gone from requiring 20 medications per day to requiring none .","Danielle Davis of Savannah, Georgia looked to her faith after her husband Brian nearly died seven months after they were married in 2011 .

"A British former supermarket security guard, who left his parents house and became an ISIS jihadist in Syria, has been busy writing advice about  'dealing' with wannabe jihadi brides. Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, first came to prominence when he appeared in a ISIS propaganda video, urging the West to send troops to fight ISIS, vowing 'we'll send them back one by one in coffins.' Now the fighter has been promoting himself as an amateur Islamic thinker, regularly attempting to write about daily issues faced by jihadists. Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, used to live at home with his mother and work as a security guard at Morrisons before he travelled to Syria. Entitled 'Dealing with sisters and social media', the lazy fighter dishes out his best advice for handling the ladies. The fighter, who still hasn't managed to find himself a jihadi bride, encourages fighters not to be disheartened by the other fighters who get married via social media. The extremist warns of jihadi brides becoming jealous of other women liking their husband's social media account too much. He wrote: 'No pious sister would be pleased to see her husband getting so many likes from other sisters. Not to mention how glamorous some of these niqabi sisters try to look in their poses of their profile pics. The 27-year-old claimed: 'Even a simple word of praise from a sister online can damage your intention. Always keep yourself in check.' Hussain initially joined Jabhat al-Nusra but switched to ISIS after just four months. He spends most of his time writing and taking photographs from his home in Raqqa, Syria. Creepy jihadi Omar Hussain also has a cat, known as Lucy, whom he adopted from the streets. The bachelor has been keen to dish out advice on securing jihadi brides. When he is not furiously trying to write advice about Islam, Hussain seems to enjoy eating plenty of unhealthy snacks and attempting to cook. The hapless self styled hitch wrote: 'You may see some brothers with so many sisters following them, with sisters praising them, writing on their page etc. But just ignore the temptations.' Hussain also describes women as 'the adornment of this world, and man is constantly tempted to seek a woman's attention.' Whilst he loves giving out advice on social media, Hussain appears to struggle with life outside the cyber world. Unable to fight, Hussain finds even the most basic tasks in life difficult and even recently admitted it took him an astonishing 50 minutes to peel just 10 minuscule potatoes. The failed fighter wrote: 'Life can't go on like this, I need a Sabi (servant) :(' He confessed that he had to cut up the potatoes the next morning after tiring himself out with the peeling process. Unable to fight, Hussain finds even the most basic tasks in life difficult and even admitted it even took him an astonishing 50 minutes to peel just 10 minuscule potatoes. The fighter recently claimed he had been a terror camp trainer whilst he was with Jabhat al-Nusra. He also posted a picture of a gym which he appears to have briefly visited. The calamitous jihadi initially joined the Al Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra, before switching to the more popular ISIS after just four months. Surprisingly, the fighter recently claimed he had been a terror camp trainer whilst he was with Jabhat al-Nusra. He wrote: 'Initially I was with Jabhat An-Nusrah, so all my training was done with them, and due to my physique at the time, I was appointed to stay in the training camp and train the new set of brothers.' Whilst it is difficult to verify Hussain's claims, it is possible that he was involved in the training of other fighters. Last August, Hussain appeared on BBC2's Newsnight, saying: 'I hate the UK, the only reason why I would intend to return to the UK is when I want to come and plant a bomb somewhere.'","The lonely jihadi has been attempting to give advice on relationships with jihadi brides .

"This is the dramatic moment a fireman risked his own life to grab the arm of a woman who was attempting to throw herself off the ledge of a 10-storey Chinese tower block. The video - filmed by a passer-by in Shanghai - shows the young woman dangling off the ledge having apparently threatened to jump, reports People's Daily Online. Police had failed to convince the woman - who was depressed after being dumped by her boyfriend - to climb back into a nearby apartment while firefighters on the street below prepared a ladder to try to reach her. Video footage captured the moment fireman Xu Weiguo grabbed the suicidal woman's arm just in time . But before the ladder could be used the woman became more agitated and suddenly lowered herself on to the edge of the concrete ledge. Fireman Xu Weiguo, who was also inside the apartment, immediately climbed out on to the ledge and video shows him grabbing her arm just as she appears to be pushing herself away. He holds on to her right arm and is seen calling for someone to assist him before a colleague also clambers out on to the ledge to help to haul the woman to safety. She was then pushed kicking and screaming back in through the window by the firemen before being restrained by police officers and taken to hospital. He had clambered out on to the ledge when police failed to talk her down . Having held on to her arm, a colleague then joined him to help pull her back on to the ledge . The woman reportedly said she'd felt depressed after being dumped by her boyfriend . She was eventually bundled back through the window kicking and screaming by the firemen . Xu has been widely praised for his actions but insisted he was only doing his job. He told ThePaper.cn 'At the time I hadn't even put on my safety rope or even my helmet when I heard someone outside shout, ""She's going to jump"". 'I didn't have time to think - I just ran through the apartment and seeing her hanging on the ledge I jumped through the window and grabbed her arm. 'As the ledge is narrow and difficult for me to get good leverage I had to flatten myself out and wait for my colleagues to help. Luckily we were able to save the woman. 'There was no time to think, the entire rescue took 2-3 minutes. Any hesitation by me and she may have fallen off the ledge so I didn't have any of my safety apparatus in place when I grabbed her. 'It was quite dangerous. Under normal operational procedures I would have to wear my helmet as well as my safety ropes.'","Woman threatened to jump off Shanghai tower block after being dumped .

"Fifteen years ago, Jennifer Lopez' shimmering, navel-baring Versace gown captivated the world . Fifteen years ago, Jennifer Lopez' shimmering, navel-baring Versace gown captivated the world. So much so that, long before Kim Kardashian was breaking the internet, J Lo's 2000 red carpet appearance set the web ablaze. It even caught the attention of Google executive, Eric Schmidt, who has revealed that the plunging dress was his inspiration for creating Google Images. 'When Google was launched, people were amazed that they were able to find out about almost anything by typing just a few words into a computer,' he told project-syndicate.com. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin – like all other successful inventors – kept iterating, said Schmidt. They started with images, because people wanted more than just text. 'This first became apparent after the 2000 Grammy Awards, where Jennifer Lopez wore a green dress that, well, caught the world's attention,' added Schmidt. 'At the time, it was the most popular search query we had ever seen. 'But we had no surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted: J Lo wearing that dress. Google Image Search was born.' Before Google Image Search, web surfers could only search through a page of text divided by 10 blue links. This meant they first had to click on these links before finding out if J Lo's dress was featured. When Google Images was launched in July 2001, the site offered access to 250 million images. Just ten year later, that figure reached more than 10 billion. The dress is one of the few articles of specific clothing to be honoured its own Wikipedia page. After hearing the news, the 45-year-old singer shared an old picture of her in that dress on Instagram. She added: 'WHO KNEW!! #onepersoncanchangetheworld #onedresscanchangetheworld #jlo+versace=history #positivechange #funfacts LOL' The dress caught the attention of Google executive, Eric Schmidt (pictured), who recently revealed that it was his inspiration for creating Google Images . Google has big plans for its image search. A team of Google researchers recently developed an advanced image classification and detection algorithm called GoogLeNet, which is twice as effective than previous programs. It is so accurate it can locate and distinguish between a range of object sizes within a single image, and it can also determine an object within, or on top of, an object, within the photo. The software recently placed first in the ImageNet large-scale visual recognition challenge (ILSVRC). Google has made the software open to other developers, to help increase its accuracy, and in the future, the technology could be used to improve Google Image searches. It could also scour YouTube videos for specific objects or shapes. He may have helped to build the internet, but Dr Vinton ‘Vint’ Cerf has urged computer users to print out their most treasured photographs, or risk losing them. The Google vice president warned that as operating systems and software become more sophisticated, documents and images stored using older technology will become increasingly inaccessible. He went on to say that our dependence on technology could lead to the 21st century being a new dark age in history, with any evidence of our culture lost in a digital 'black hole'. In centuries to come, future historians looking back on the current era could be confronted by a digital desert comparable with the dark ages - the post-Roman period in Western Europe about which relatively little is known because of the scarcity of written records. Dr Cerf, who also has the title of Chief Internet Evangelist at Google, said: ‘If we’re thinking 1,000 years, 3,000 years ahead in the future, we have to ask ourselves, how do we preserve all the bits that we need in order to correctly interpret the digital objects we create? ‘We are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realising it.'","The now 45-year-old singer wore the dress at the 2000 Grammy Awards .

"A pregnant model whose sexy selfies featuring her tight abs turned her into an overnight internet sensation has given birth to a healthy baby boy. Sarah Stage, a 30-year-old underwear model and animal rights activist from Los Angeles, welcomed James Hunter into the world on Tuesday afternoon. And despite her critics' claims that her unusually trim figure could be damage to to her unborn child, it seems their fears were unfounded. Sarah confirmed to E! that baby James weighed in at a healthy eight pounds, seven ounces and was 22 inches long at the time of his birth, adding: 'He's a big healthy boy and he got an APGAR score of eight to nine.' Scroll down for video . Ready to go: Sarah Stage took her last pregnancy selfie (pictured) on Monday, writing: 'Still waiting'.  The 30-year-old gave birth to a healthy baby boy named James Hunter the next day . Feeling hungry: Sarah shared this photo of two In-N-Out burgers on Tuesday afternoon, although its not clear as to whether or not she enjoyed the meal before or after she gave birth . An APGAR score, which stands for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration, is a quick method for assessing the health of a newborn, with scores of seven or above being considered normal. Sarah famously documented her changing figure via her Instagram page throughout her pregnancy, earning herself a huge number of fans - as well as a fair share of critics - in the process. Although the mother-to-be came under fire last month as more and more critics spoke out against her unusually trim and toned figure, claiming it could be harmful to her unborn child, their comments never stopped the model from sharing numerous photos of her tight abs with her 1.6 million Instagram followers. Almost there: Sarah cradled her baby bump to in a 'sexy' purple dress to celebrate her 39th week of pregnancy . 'Yesterday afternoon, Sarah shared a photo of two In-N-Out burgers, writing, 'Cravings,' although its not clear as to whether or not she enjoyed the meal before or after she gave birth. The lingerie-clad model snapped her last pregnancy selfie on Monday, which she captioned: 'Still waiting #9months [sic].' The snapshot of her in a black bra and thong underwear has been liked nearly 40,000 times since it was posted, and has earned nearly 4,000 comments. And Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent, took to Instagram last week to share a photo of growing belly during her ninth month of pregnancy, writing: '10 days until we meet #BabyJames.' Many women noted that they found Sarah's pregnancy body to be motivation to work out and live a healthy lifestyle. So soon: Pregnant model Sarah Stage snapped this photo of herself flaunting her barely-there baby bump 10 days before she was supposed to give birth to her son . Haters gonna hate: Sarah, who came under fire for her being tiny and toned throughout her pregnancy, told her critics to unfollow her if they have a problem with her pictures . Proud of her bump: Sarah struck various photos for these selfies of herself in her underwear . 'I'm completely inspired to go to the gym first thing in the morning. You look absolutely gorgeous @sarahstage #amazing [sic],' one fan wrote. 'You look absolutely lovely. Hats off to you for being fit and taking care of yourself!' another added. 'If I ever have children, I'm inspired by you to treat my pregnancy the very same way. I'm sure James will be amazing! Congratulations.' Others compared their figures to pregnant Sarah's pregnancy body, with one woman writing: '10 days before giving birth?! Lord Jesus help us all! I look like this after dinner [sic].' 'I look like that after a good meal or two,' someone else commented. Meanwhile, some people suggested that her son would be as tiny as she is - although now it seems that their fears about the young boy's size were unfounded. Bump to bump: Sarah and her friend compared their growing bellies for this playful picture . Just like dad: Sarah shared this adorable photo of matching father and son Timberland boots . 'Baby James will come out the size of her phone case,' one person commented, referencing the model's bear-shaped cell phone cover. And when she's not sharing lingerie selfies, the new mother regularly shared pictures of her son's nursery and his future wardrobe. Last week, Sarah shared an adorable photo of matching father and baby sized Timberland boots, writing: 'Daddy & baby shoe game [sic].' And despite her critics, Sarah refused to hide her then-eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes. Stylish mom: Sarah refused to wear baggy clothes during her pregnancy and instead opts for figure-hugging dresses like the one she is wearing in this picture . Looking good: Sarah wore this sexy black dress on a 'date night' when she was 37 weeks pregnant, two weeks before James was born . She shunned baggy dresses and instead dressed her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa,spinach and chicken. Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah continued to proudly model whilst carrying. Two weeks ago, she shared a sexy snapshot of herself in black underwear and responded to her haters. 'BTW If you don't like my pics then unfollow me,' she wrote. 'I'm excited, happy and enjoying every second of my pregnancy. Can't wait to meet James! #NFG #37weeks [sic].'","Sarah Stage, 30, welcomed James Hunter into the world on Tuesday afternoon .

"These images show the world's smallest working gun - which is shorter than a matchstick and fires purpose-made bullets just 2.34mm in diameter.

The discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on Earth are not unique to our solar system. Scientists detected the complex organic molecules in a disc of gas around an infant star 455 light years away where planets are likely to be forming. The discovery is a boost for finding alien organisms and suggests the conditions that spawned life on Earth are not unique to our solar system . Radio telescope observations showed the disk surrounding the million-year-old star MWC 480 to be 'brimming' with the complex carbon-based molecule methyl cyanide. Both this molecule and its simpler organic cousin hydrogen cyanide were identified in the cold outer reaches of the newly formed disc. The region can be compared with our solar system's Kuiper Belt, a realm of icy mini-worlds and comets beyond Neptune. Experts believe comets and asteroids from the outer solar system seeded the young Earth with water and organic molecules to set the stage for life to evolve. Astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (Alma), a powerful suit of interacting radio telescopes in Chile's Atacama desert, to investigate MWC 480. Alma's high sensitivity antennae have now shown that such molecules not only form and survive, but thrive . Astronomer Dr Karin Oberg, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Massachusetts, said: 'Studies of comets and asteroids show that the solar nebula that spawned our sun and planets was rich in water and complex organic compounds. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade,' said Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, (pictured) There at least 200 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy – and now Nasa officials claim we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington yesterday, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' said Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa. 'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Jeffery Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' Stofan said. 'We are talking about little microbes.' 'We now have evidence that this same chemistry exists elsewhere in the universe, in regions that could form solar systems not unlike our own.' The molecules surrounding MWC 480 have been detected in similar concentrations in our own solar system's comets, she pointed out. The star, which is about twice as massive as the sun, lies in a well-studied star-forming region in the constellation Taurus. Astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (Alma), a powerful suit of interacting radio telescopes in Chile's Atacama desert, to investigate MWC 480. Previously it was unclear whether complex organic molecules commonly survive the shocks and radiation levels found in a newly forming solar system . Alma's high sensitivity antennae have now shown that such molecules not only form and survive, but thrive. The findings, reported in the journal Nature, reveal that there is enough methyl cyanide around MWC 480 to fill all of the Earth's oceans. Among complex organic molecules, cyanides - especially methyl cyanide - are important because they contain carbon-nitrogen bonds essential for the formation of amino acids, the components of proteins. As the MWC 480 system evolves it is likely that organic molecules locked away in comets and other icy bodies will be ferried closer to the star where conditions may be suitable for life, the scientists believe. Dr Oberg added: 'From the study of exoplanets, we know our solar system isn't unique in having rocky planets and an abundance of water. 'Now we know we're not unique in organic chemistry. Once more, we have learned that we're not special. From a life in the universe point of view, this is great news.'","Million-year-old star MWC 480 is 'brimming' with carbon-based molecules .

As MWC 480 evolves it is likely the molecules will move closer to the star .

"The naked bodies of a young couple were found stuffed in boxes in India after becoming victims of a suspected honour killing. Locals discovered the dead pair, believed to be in their mid to late 20s, in separate metal trunks in a public park in Haryana state, around 30 miles south of New Delhi. Police said the man's legs had been chopped off and put inside the trunk, while his partner was found wearing a set of glass bangles traditionally worn by newlywed women. Macabre: The naked bodies of a young couple are found stuffed in boxes in a northern Indian state, the suspected victims of an honour killing . 'It appears they were strangulated and dumped here later. They are yet to be identified,' the chief investigating officer, Praveen Kumar, told AFP. 'It seems like a case of honour killing because the woman is wearing wedding bangles but we are not ruling out other motives,' he added. India has witnessed honour killings - where couples are targeted because their families or communities disapprove of their relationships - for centuries, especially in rural areas. They are carried out by close relatives or village elders to protect what is seen as the family's reputation and pride in a hereditary-based caste system. The latest incident comes two days after Haryana police arrested a man and his son for killing his teenage daughter over an inter-caste relationship with a boy. In 2013, a man was beheaded and his wife was killed by her own family for eloping within the same clan.

The actress, who starred in  O Lucky Man! in 1973 - when she was in her thirties - and The Long Good Friday in 1980, went on to explain that the ten years after the sexual revolution but before feminism was 'perilous' for women. 'Men saw that as a sort of, ""Oh, fantastic! We can f*** anything, however we like, whenever we like! They're up for grabs, boys!"" It was that kind of attitude', she said. Mirren also said  revelations about celebrities from that era, such as Jimmy Savile, did not come as a surprise. 'I’m sure that if that f****** bastard was alive today he would be utterly confused. He would think, ""They liked it, they loved me, I was a big star, so they wanted it"",' she said.

Indeed, the 38-year-old's eyes were fixed on the 69-year-old's decolletage as they posed for photos at their film's Berlin premiere. And the actor's wife, Blake Lively, shared a snap of the flirty moment with her Instagram fans - joking that she had reason to feel jealous. 'Should I be concerned that my husband's never looked at me this way?...' the 27-year-old quipped in the photo's caption on Saturday. Mirren, pictured in the mid 1970s, was speaking ahead of the release of her new film, Woman In Gold . In her Instagram post she called the Oscar-winning actress 'sexy' and noted that her husband of two years took a gander at her cleavage, writing: '#WhereAreThoseEyesWanderingReynolds #HelenMirrenIStheSexiestWomanAlive #WomanInGold.' Speaking to People, Mirren confessed that she was taken by Reynold's charming manner while filming their forthcoming drama. 'You know, he makes a girl feel good,' she explained. 'Some guys don't. They're macho and attractive, but they make you feel awkward. 'Ryan just makes you feel so great. He's just so generous in his masculinity. He happens to be hunky and gorgeous and everything as well, but when you get a beautiful combination of the two? He is wonderful.' Mirren confessed that she was taken by Reynold's charming manner while filming their forthcoming drama. In Woman In Gold, their on-screen chemistry is apparent as well. It is a real-life story about a Jewish refugee’s battle against the Austrian government to reclaim a family painting stolen by Nazis. The biopic chronicles the heir's 60-year pursuit of Gustav Klimt's painting The Lady in Gold - which now ranks as the fifth most expensive painting ever sold at $135 million . Helen plays Maria Altmann, a woman who was forced to flee her home and life as a socialite in Vienna amid World War II. She enlists young lawyer Randol Schoenberg, played by Ryan, to help her restore her family's past. Considered the Mona Lisa of Austria, Klimt's 1907 The Lady In Gold painting is a portrait of Altmann's aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer, a friend of the famed artist.

"Denial: Al Sharpton today slammed a report claiming he was banner from the funeral of Walter Scott . Al Sharpton has denied that the family of police shooting victim Walter Scott have barred him from attending his funeral because it would cause a 'circus' of media attention. The controversial preacher and civil rights campaigner said a report that the family wanted him gone to avoid 'another Ferguson type of circus' is 'bogus'. He also announced that he would head to North Charleston, South Carolina, to preach and attend a vigil on Sunday, the day after the funeral. Allegations that Scott's family wanted nothing to do with Sharpton were published by the New York Daily News. In response, Sharpton said: 'There has never been a discussion about me attending or participating in the funeral on Saturday, since everyone knows that [National Action Network’s] convention with thousands of delegates is happening in New York and doesn't end until Saturday night.' Anthony Scott, the victim's brother, said today that the National Action Network has been working with the family since Walter Scott was shot on Saturday April 4. Incendiary cell phone footage showed Scott being gunned down from behind by Slager after he was pulled over for having a broken tail light. Slager was fired, arrested and charged with murder when the video came to light, reigniting tensions around policing which took center stage in Ferguson, Missouri, after teenager Michael Brown was killed. Family: The New York Daily News claimed that Sharpton's family asked him to stay away to avoid a 'circus'. He has said it is untrue . Incendiary: Scott was shot dead by Officer Michael Slager, right, in North Charleston, South Carolina. After video footage, above, emerged of the killing, Slager was charged with murder . Sharpton said the incident proves that a new law is necessary to compel all police officers in the country to wear body cameras while on patrol. He confirmed his intention Friday morning to preach at North Charleston's Charity Missionary Baptist Church. He said his message will be that justice should be pursued 'in a peaceful, legal way'. After giving a service, he said he will attend a vigil at the spot where Scott was killed. Sharpton's involvement comes after dashcam footage from Slager's patrol car was released, showing the traffic stop moments before the shooting. From before: This footage shows Scott running away from Slager after being pulled over in his car . Slager is seen confronting Scott over his busted tail light and asking for documentation, which Scott says he does not have. When Slager returns to his patrol car, Scott flees and the officer gives chase. It is not clear what happened in the time between the dashcam footage and the cell phone video. After the shooting it emerged that Scott was some $7,500 behind in child support payments. It had been reported that a warrant was out for his arrest for this reason - but that was later shown to be false. Vigil: Sympathizers laid flowers at a makeshift memorial in North Charleston at the spot where Scott was killed . Tributes: A man is pictured above adjusting flower displays and condolence messages in the grassy lot where Scott was killed . Records show that he last paid child support in July 2012. But there was no bench warrant directing officers to bring him in to face a family court judge. Scott had been in jail three times over child support. In 2008, after a traffic stop in which he was charged with an open-container violation and driving under suspension, he was sent to jail in Charleston for six months for failing to pay about $6,800. In 2011, bench warrants ordered deputies to bring him in, and Scott spent a night in jail when he was $7,500 behind. In 2012, he spent another night in jail when he owed $3,500. Family members have said he may have run from Saturday's traffic stop because he feared going back to jail over more back child support.","Preacher and civil rights leader said reports of a funeral ban are 'bogus'

"It has long been thought that Stone Age man abandoned their dead with little thought or respect. But the discovery of cremated bone, thought to be the earliest ever identified in Britain, could re-write the history of Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age burial practices. The deposit containing the bone was discovered during excavations ahead of a new pipeline in Landford, Essex and is thought to date to 5,600 BC. The discovery of cremated bone (pictured), thought to be the earliest ever identified in Britain, could re-write the history of Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age burial practices . The burnt material, which includes approximately just over four ounces (118g) of cremated bone, was uncovered by Oxford Archaeology. It was placed into a pit with a diameter of about three feet (one metre) and then backfilled with soil. Three radiocarbon dates, two from bone fragments and one from charcoal, have confirmed the remains are around 7,614 years old and fall within the the late Mesolithic, between 6,000 BC and 4,000 BC. Nick Gilmour, who lead the excavation, said ‘We were expecting this cremation to date to the Bronze Age - we were so surprised when the first radiocarbon date came back as Mesolithic that we did two more to double-check.’ The burnt material, which includes approximately just over four ounces (118g) of cremated bone, was uncovered by Oxford Archaeology. It was placed into a pit (pictured) with a diameter of about three feet (one metre) and then backfilled with soil . Little is known about Mesolithic man's beliefs, but the pit shows that ancient people understood how to create a pyre that was hot enough at over 600 °C to completely burn a corpse and appeared to respect the dead. This image is a still from a TV show called Meet the Ancestors showing what a Mesolithic hut may have looked like . The find is significant because it sheds light on early human society in Mesolithic Britain, when people were largely nomadic hunter gatherers before the arrival of farming. While little is known about their beliefs, the pit shows that ancient people understood how to create a pyre that was hot enough - at over 600 °C - to completely burn a corpse. It hints that people respected the dead enough to cremate them and not simply abandon them, as has been previously believed. Time and resources were invested in funerary practices despite a mobile hand-to-mouth existence, the experts explained. Dr Louise Loe, head of burials at Oxford Archaeology, analysed the bone to find that it represents the remains of at least one adult, despite the total weight being around seven per cent of what would be expected from a complete individual. Taken alongside evidence of a large amount of charcoal in the pit, it’s thought the material represents a deposit of some of the remains from a pyre, and not all of the cremated bone from it.

Before the discovery, just 20 examples of human bone dating from the British Mesolithic, which spans from 10,000 to 4,000BC, were found – and none of them had been cremated. But a group of three cremations from the period have been found in Ireland, so the ‘new’ site seems to fit into a wider European pattern of behaviour. Three Mesolithic flints were also discivered in the pit and while none are finished tools, they are sharp enough to have been used for cutting. More flints were found nearby, as well as a Bronze Age barrow, Early Roman site, Saxon settlement and a medieval building all where the Essex and Suffolk Water pipeline is planned. The find is significant because it sheds light on early human society in Mesolithic Britain, when people were largely nomadic hunter gatherers before the arrival of farming.

"A robot has been 'arrested' by Swiss police after it bought a supply of illegal drugs on a hidden region of the internet known as the 'dark net'. The automated computer program was designed as an online shopping system that would spend up to $100 each week by randomly purchasing an item offered for sale on the deep web. The robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of St Gallen, in north east Switzerland. The Random Darknet Shopper purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web (pictured) including trainers, jeans, cigarettes, a set of masterkeys and a DVD case (far left) containing 10 ecstasy tablets . The items it bought included a pair of Nike trainers, counterfeit designer jeans, the scan of a Hungarian passport and a set of UK Fire Brigade masterkeys. However, it seems the Random Darknet Shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 Ecstasy tablets, which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a DVD case. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines, which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea, missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins, the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs, hacked information, credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router (TOR), which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. Police seized the drugs, the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased. Tests on the tablets later revealed they contained 90mg of the class-A drug MDMA, which the police then destroyed. The computer and the empty bag the ecstasy came in have now been returned to the group behind the bot, !Mediengruppe Bitnik, along with the other items it bought. They described the police's actions as an 'unjustified intervention into the freedom of art'. Writing on their blog, London based artists Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo, who were behind the project, said: 'Random Darknet Shopper has finally been released and is now back in our possession. 'At the same time we also received the order for withdrawal of prosecution. 'In the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of Ecstasy was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition. 'The public prosecution also asserts that the overweighing interest in the questions raised by the art work Random Darknet Shopper justify the exhibition of the drugs as artefacts, even if the exhibition does hold a small risk of endangerment of third parties through the drugs exhibited. 'We as well as the Random Darknet Shopper have been cleared of all charges. This is a great day for the bot, for us and for freedom of art!' The Random Darknet Shopper project was set up as an attempt to highlight some of the dilemmas that can be thrown up by dark net markets and anonymous internet use. It used Bitcoin to randomly purchase items that were offered for sail in the darknet. The tablets, pictured above, were sent from Germany inside a DVD case and a vacuum sealed foil bag . They were delivered to the artists by mail and then put on display in an exhibition at the Kunst Halle in St Gallen. During the weeks it had been running it also purchased a fake Louis Vuitton handbag, a baseball cap with a hidden camera and 200 Chesterfield cigarettes. The darknet market features more than 16,000 items that are sold in a way that allows the seller to remain anonymous. The ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of MDMA and were destroyed by the Swiss authorities . It has become notorious as a place to buy illegal pornography, drugs and weapons. The robot software bought the ecstasy in October. It was sent from Germany to Switzerland and apparently crossed the border hidden in a DVD case without being intercepted by the authorities. The drugs were allowed to remain on show in the exhibition until it ended in January. However, the police raided the exhibition when it came to an end and seized the computer and its purchases on the grounds the drugs were an endangerment of third parties. Speaking to the Guardian, Mr Smoljo said that they had been told although the computer had purchased the drugs itself, they were the legal owners of the drugs as they had executed the code behind the software. The case has raised important questions about the use of automatic shopping bots and the use of the darknet. In the past the artists have used technology to intercept CCTV images and sent a package to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Mr Smoljo and Miss Weisskopf said: 'The Random Darknet Shopper is a live Mail Art piece, an exploration of the deep web via the goods traded there.'","Random Darknet Shopper is a computer bot that randomly purchases an item every week from a hidden part of the internet called the dark net .

This is a senseless loss of life.' He added: 'Currently we're investigating where this firearm came from. We're also investigating how this tragedy actually happened. A three-year-old can't be held accountable for a tragedy like this. 'There have to be adults that either supplied the weapons, had charge of the weapons or knew the weapons were there and didn't do anything to safeguard them.'

"Arrested: Doug Hughes was put under arrest for his gyro-copter stunt and charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace . The postal carrier who flew a gyrocopter onto the lawn of the U.S. Capitol is facing two criminal charges. But he's being released from federal custody to return to Florida. Doug Hughes made his initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Washington on Thursday. That's one day after he steered his tiny aircraft onto the Capitol's West Lawn after flying through restricted airspace around the National Mall. He was charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace. Hughes said it was a political protest. Hughes was released on his own recognizance afterward and instructed to check in weekly with authorities in Tampa starting next week. In a soft voice, Hughes appeared to ask the judge a clarifying question about that obligation but otherwise he did not say anything significant. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why. Johnson said it's too soon to say whether Wednesday's incident should prompt changes in security procedures. 'I want to know all the facts before I reach an assessment of what can and should be done about gyrocopters in the future,' he said. But lawmakers said the incident exposed a gap in security, especially amid revelations that the pilot, Florida postal worker Doug Hughes, was interviewed by the Secret Service almost two years ago. The agency apparently determined he did not pose a threat, said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Cummings spoke Thursday with the Secret Service director. 'I think that there's absolutely a gap, and it's a very dangerous gap, with regard to our airspace,' Cummings said. 'I don't want people to get a message that they can just land anywhere. Suppose there was a bomb or an explosive device on that air vehicle? That could have been a major catastrophe.' How'd it happen? Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why . Approach: The small gyro-copter (circled in red) lands on the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington as members of the public walk by. The stunt hasn't cost him his freedom, yet, but means he must check in with authorities every week as he awaits trial . Johnson said the Secret Service passed along the information from the interview with Hughes, who was to appear in court Thursday afternoon, to 'all of the appropriate law enforcement agencies.' House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the incident 'stunning.' 'What safeguards can we use? We don't want to be a place where we're saying `This is an iron-clad Capitol.' And have such restrictions on people having access to it,' Pelosi told reporters. 'Nonetheless, we have to ensure the safety of those people.' The tiny, open-air aircraft landed without injuries to anyone, but the incident raises questions about how someone could be allowed to fly all the way from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, right up to the Capitol. Hughes has said he was making the flight to publicize his concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics, and deliver letters to all 535 members of Congress on the topic. 'We are a democracy. We don't have fences around our airspace, so we've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society and security and the protection of federal buildings,' Johnson told reporters on Capitol Hill. 'And so we want to stay one step ahead of every incident like this, but then again, you don't want to overreact, either.' Still, lawmakers questioned why, if authorities had been in touch with Hughes, no action was taken to stop him. Practice run: Doug Hughes flies his gyrocopter near the Wauchula Municipal Airport in Wauchula, Florida prior to his 'insane' stunt on Wednesday . Before Doug Hughes made headlines by flying his open air helicopter onto the U.S. Capitol grounds, he blogged about his intention to undertake the 'non-violent demonstration.' Though, it may have been a demonstration years in the making. In a post dated September 2013 on the democracyclub.org, a writer called Tampadoug47 wrote: . Let me say first – this is a non-violent demonstration. I have no intention of hurting anyone – I have taken every precaution to prevent any injury to anyone, including me. There is no way I can prevent over-reaction by the authorities, but I have given them as much information and advance warning as my fuel supply allows. When I took off, I was over an hour away from the no-fly zone. The demonstration is about restoring democracy. Corruption in Washington DC has robbed the US citizens of the representative government that is our birthright. Polls show that the public is aware of the problem and VERY concerned, but they are largely uninformed that there is a solution and there are organizations prepared to make reform a reality. As a result of this flight, two things will happen. (I hope.) First, we’re going to change the narrative – the story. Voters are going to quit being played like suckers with divisive hot-button issues and come together on a single issue. Honest government. Congress won’t start working for you or me when their big paycheck is from big business. Lobbyists, Special Interests, Unions. We have to make this happen. The political parties won’t. Congress sure won’t. Lobbyists love the status quo. The mainstream media (not the local media) is making a financial killing with mega-elections. It’s up to us. Second, in every Congressional race in 2016, I want every candidate to take a stand on corruption. After this flight, we’re going to define exactly what reform means – set a written standard – and it’s that standard which candidates will have to endorse. Or the candidate will have to defend to voters why he took a lesser position. The candidate who only wants to talk ‘reform’ but won’t endorse the real deal will be facing someone who will endorse real reform. That may be in the primary or the general election. Giving you a choice is our job. The clear choice, establishment or reform, will be in place in just a year for just over 460 congressional races. You get to choose (That’s your job as a voter.) but for the first time in decades, you will have a meaningful choice. What do I want from you? Look over your options on the previous screen or the ‘Honor Roll’ on the sidebar to the right. Rootstrikers or Wolf PAC or Represent.US. My favorite group isn’t listed there – it’s my own startup group:‘The Civilist Papers‘. Find a group (or groups) that you are comfortable with and sign up. We’re not after money – we want to know who you are and where you are so we can keep you informed. Protest flight: Doug Hughes took off from an undisclosed location in Washington D.C. and landed his gyro-copter on the West Front lawn of the US Capitol building . 'My concerns are the prior notice that he was going to do this and the lack of response,' said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. 'These small aircraft or UAV devices concern me because they could go undetected and cause damage, so that's something we're taking a look at,' McCaul said, adding he might hold hearings on the issue. Cummings and others also complained that they were not notified of the incident and that many first learned of it from the news media. Johnson defended existing protocols for dealing with the restricted airspace over Washington, D.C., federal buildings and monuments. 'We've got a well-coordinated federal response to dealing with issues of those who penetrate the restricted airspace without permission,' he said. He said his first reaction on hearing of the incident was to ask, 'What's a gyrocopter?' It's not unusual for a small aircraft like a gyrocopter to go undetected by conventional radar. Unlike most larger aircraft, a gyrocopter doesn't have a transponder that identifies the aircraft, its altitude and heading. Even without a transponder, radar can detect 'primary targets' - planes, flocks of birds, rain and other objects. But how well it can detect those objects depends upon several factors. The landing on the Capitol grounds 'just illustrates how hard it is to have an impermeable barrier. It's very hard to hermetically seal airspace,' said John Hansman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics professor.

"Defence Minister Kevin Andrews has failed to name the leader of terrorist organisation the Islamic State on the same day the Federal Government announced they would be sending more than 300 Australian troops to Iraq. Australian soldiers are embarking on a two-year mission in Iraq, but will be spending it 'behind the wire' not engaging in combat, Mr Andrews said. But during an embarrassing interview on the ABC's 7.30 program, the Mr Andrews  declined to reveal the brutal regime's leader. Scroll down for video . Defence Minister Kevin Andrew was unable to name the leader of Islamic State on ABC's 7.30 . When host Leigh Sales asked him to name the terror group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Mr Andrews claimed he was unable to do so for 'operational reasons'. 'Can you name the leader of IS?' Sales asked. Mr Andrews replied: 'I'm not going to go into operational matters.' But Sales would not let him off the hook, saying: 'I don't think that's operational, I think it's a matter of public record.' Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is leader of notorious terrorist organisation Islamic State, which is wrestling to take power in Syria and Iraq . Sales continued, saying given the U.S. government had a $10 million bounty on his head, she was 'surprised' he couldn't name the terrorist leader. Mr Andrews argued I.S. did not just have one leader because it was made of many groups and there was not just one individual involved. Earlier that day, the Prime Minister announced Australian troops would return to Iraq with the aim to provide Iraqi security forces with the skills and training to defend their country, to degrade and ultimately defeat the forces of Islamic State or Daesh. Mr Andrews said Australian troops would not accompany the Iraqi forces they train into battle. 'No, they stay, to use the expression, inside the wire. They won't be going outside the Taji base. All the training will take place there,' he told ABC television. Mr Andrews was appearing on 7.30 following the Federal Government's announcement 330 troops would be leaving for Iraq . This is a stark contrast with deployments over the past decade when troops conducted sweeping patrols across southern Iraq, occasionally contacting insurgent forces. Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced on Tuesday his cabinet had given the go-ahead for deployment of Task Force Taji, 330 Australian and 100 new Zealand troops to train Iraqi soldiers for the next two years. Mr Abbott said Iraq was a dangerous place and the mission was not risk-free. The joint force deployment this week coincides with the centenary of Anzac. Mr Andrews said the mission would be reviewed continually but there would be a formal review after 12 months. He said there had been an improvement with Iraqi forces ousting Daesh from the city of Tikrit. 'So we are confident that there will be more gains over the next year to two and that's what we've made a commitment to,' he said. Mr Andrews said 5,000 Iraqi troops had already been trained by four international training missions.","Defence Minister Kevin Andrew was unable to name leader of Islamic State .

"Police are hunting Peter Fox, 26, (pictured) after his mother and sister were found dead half a mile apart in an alleged double murder . A 26-year-old man wanted for the murder of his mother and sister has been arrested after being spotted by a member of the public. Peter Fox, from Liverpool, was arrested at Euston Station in London this morning on suspicion of the murders of Bernadette, 57, and Sarah Fox, 27, following a nationwide manhunt. Detectives released CCTV images of the 26-year-old  leaving Liverpool Lime Street at 8.18pm on Wednesday and arriving at Euston railway station in the capital at 10.57pm. The body of his sister  was found by police on Thursday night, just hours before her 57-year-old mother Bernadette was found dead at sheltered accommodation just half a mile away in Bootle, Merseyside. Merseyside Police said Mrs Fox died of asphyxiation, while her daughter was repeatedly stabbed. Bernadette and Sarah's family today said they are 'absolutely devastated' at their loss. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Rooney from Merseyside Police said: 'I can confirm that a 26-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murders of Bernadette and Sarah Fox this morning and is being brought back to Merseyside. 'A significant amount of work has been carried out over the weekend with the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police and I would like to thank them for their assistance. 'I would also like to thank the media and the public for their support during the weekend, which has helped us enormously.' In a statement issued through police, a spokesman for the Fox family said: 'We are absolutely devastated following the loss of Bernadette and Sarah and are still trying to come to terms with what has happened to them both. The family of Bernadette (left) and Sarah (right) have said they are 'absolutely devastated' at their loss . 'Bernadette, who was a mother of three and grandmother of three, was a very outgoing and lovely person who wouldn't harm anyone. In fact she only ever had nice things to say about people. She was so caring and would help anyone. 'And Sarah was loved by her family and well-liked by her friends and neighbours. She was a fantastic aunty and was a cheeky, bubbly and outgoing person who loved her dog. They will both be greatly missed. 'We would ask that people appreciate that this is a sad and tragic time for the family and that we are left alone to grieve in peace, whilst we try to understand what has happened.' The family urged anyone with information about the incident to contact police to help them 'find justice for Bernadette and Sarah'. Sarah Fox's body was found around 9pm on Thursday night after police received a phone call about her welfare. A neighbour had reportedly raised the alarm after seeing a dog loose on the streets. Detectives released CCTV images of Peter Fox arriving at Euston Station (right) in the capital at around 10.57pm on Wednesday night after leaving Liverpool Lime Street at 8.18pm (left) Another neighbour living close to the flat, who did not want to be named, said: 'I saw one of my neighbours in the street who said he was worried after he noticed the dog from the flat roaming the streets, he had seen it a few times so he knocked on the door but got no answer. 'He called to the house last night and noticed there was a downstairs window open and the back door was ajar.' It was then that the police were called and officers found Sarah Fox's body, who they said had suffered 'multiple injuries'. 'It's so shocking. I've spoken to the girl from those flats before two or three times, she seemed a nice girl,' the neighbour added. Bernadette Fox was found when police arrived at her address through other enquiries. One neighbour near the sheltered housing property, who did wish to be named, said: 'The girl's name was Sarah - people called her Foxy - and her mum was Bernie. Police launched a double murder inquiry after the bodies of two women were found at separate addresses in Bootle, Merseyside. Pictured, officers outside a property in Worcester Road . Sarah Fox, 27, was found dead with multiple injuries at around 9pm on Thursday evening, after police were called to Worcester Road (pictured) over concerns for her welfare . 'Bernie was harmless and Sarah I think had worked at a solicitors nearby, Bernie had a son as well. 'The place where Bernie lived was sheltered accommodation and it had cameras all over the place. 'There's a camera over the intercom so anyone letting someone in would see them. It's a hard place to get into.' Martin Stevenson, Director of Older People's Services at Your Housing Group, said yesterday: 'Tragically a body was discovered at one of our Roger Arden Court sheltered scheme apartments in Bootle this morning. 'Merseyside Police attended the incident and we are continuing to support them with their investigations. 'Our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the deceased at this difficult time.' Patricia Doragh, who lives in a property near the flat, said: 'It is quite a rough area around here especially up the side streets. 'The police are always up and down the main road it's not a rare thing, it's a street quite well known for alcohol. 'When I took my grandsons out earlier about 12 o'clock there was nothing here and now all the cordons are up.'

"The oldest human footprints left behind on a muddy lakeside 1.5 million years ago appear to have been made by prehistoric hunting parties. Researchers examining the site where a series of tracks left by a barefooted early human in Ileret, northwest Kenya, have now found a total of 99 prints. They now believe that they belong to groups who all passed over the soft mud at the same time - perhaps even stalking some of the other animals whose prints are also preserved in the mud. The distinct tracks found at Ileret in Kenya (like the one above) are the oldest human footprints in the world . It provides some of the strongest evidence yet that the human ancestors that left the prints - Homo erectus - were sophisticated hunters. While their ancestors before them may have eaten meat they scavenged or from small prey they were able to catch, hunting parties suggests Homo erectus went after larger prey. Early human ancestors may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago, a new study has suggested. Research by Dr Neil Roach has shown that the that the skeletons of Homo erectus had shoulders and collar bones that would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully. This would have enabled Homo erectus to become a proficient hunter, able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey. Dr Neil Roach, a palaeoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York who led the study, said the prints appeared to have been made by adult males. He said that the tracks represent groups hunting for antelope or wildebeest. Speaking to Nature, Dr Roach said: 'What we can say is that we have a number of individuals, probably males, that are moving across a lake shore in a way that is consistent with how carnivores move. The researchers, who presented their findings at the annual meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society in San Francisco, hope to test their conclusions by studying the movement patterns of modern day subsistence hunters in Africa. The tracks in Ileret were first revealed in 2009 after researchers at Bournemouth University and Rutgers’ Koobi Fora Field School in Kenya, announced they had discovered a collection of 22 human prints. This deep print appears to have been left by a male Homo erectus that may have been part of a hunting party . Analysis of the print tracks (above) showed they had been made by a early human that walked much like we do . The prints were preserved in sediment that had once been the shoreline of an ancient lake. Alongside the human prints were those of birds including storks, pelicans as well as crocodiles, antelope, hippos, bovids and other predators. Professor Matthew Bennett, who was part of the team that originally studied the footprints, is shown above crouching in front of the ancient human tracks . Analysis of the footprints by Professor Matthew Bennett at Bournemouth University revealed the human prints had been made by a species with a similar bipedal stance and gait to modern humans, with a pronounced arch and short toes. He concluded that the prints had probably been left by Homo erectus - an extinct species of early human that disappeared around 200,000 years ago. They were among the longest surviving of all the human species - surviving for around 1.5 million years. There is some evidence that they may have also been able to control fire and cooked food. Footprints this old are extremely rare as they tend to erode away in a few thousand years, but are also valuable as they can give clues about behaviour. Dr Roach and his colleagues decided to study the prints in more detail in order to get a snapshot of the life led by Homo erectus. Over a four year excavation period a total of 483 prints in the Ileret sediment have now been uncovered - 99 of which were human. Unlike the grass-eating antelope and other hooved tracks preserved in the stone - whose tracks led from grasslands to the shore - the human prints all walked in one direction along the shoreline. This matched the behaviour of other hunting animals whose prints were also preserved. Previous work by Dr Roach has also shown that Homo erectus had developed the physic needed to be a deadly hunter. Homo erectus, shown in the reconstruction above, may have hunted large prey in groups or hunting parties . Fossilised skeletons how their shoulders and collar bones would have allowed them to throw sticks or spears both accurately and powerfully. Dr Roach said: 'There’s starting to be a consensus that around 2 million years ago we see more carnivory that has to do with hunting.' Curtis Marean, a palaeoanthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe, said it was hard to tell from the prints exactly what had made them. He told Nature: 'It could be a group hunt, but it could also be lake shore foraging.' Tucking into meat for dinner helped early humans spread more quickly across the world and had a profound effect on human evolution, scientists say. The high-quality diet allowed mothers to wean babies earlier and have more children, meaning that human communities grew faster, according to researchers from Lund University in Sweden. The research compared 67 species of mammals, including humans, apes, mice and killer whales, and found a clear correlation between eating meat and earlier weaning. They found young of all species stop suckling when their brains have developed to a particular stage, but that carnivores reached this point more quickly than herbivores or omnivores. Eating meat enabled the breast-feeding periods and thereby the time between births to be shortened, according tot he researchers. Among natural fertility societies, the average duration of breast-feeding is 2 years and 4 months. This is not much in relation to the maximum lifespan of our species, around 120 years. It is even less if compared to our closest relatives: female chimpanzees suckle their young for 4 to 5 years, whereas the maximum lifespan for chimpanzees is only 60 years.","Researchers at the American Museum of Natural History in New York have found 99 footprints that appear to have been left by male Homo erectus .

"Incredible satellite images have shown a massive sandstorm almost as large as the United States billowing across the Arabian Peninsula. The sandstorm wrecked havoc across the area last week, causing traffic accidents, the cancellation of hundreds of flights and triggering breathing difficulties among residents. Images show the vast sandstorm sweeping its way across Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates and reaching as far east as India and Pakistan over a period of seven days. Scroll down for video . On April 1, the sandstorm could be seen enveloping much of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . The following day, it pushed further east to cause flight cancellations in Dubai . By April 4, it was beginning to stretch across the Arabia Sea towards Pakistan and India . A final image taken on April 7 shows much of it had dispersed across the sea while some remained over Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Oman . It began on April 1, when high winds whipped up the sandstorm in northern Saudi Arabia before it consolidated and began moving southeastward across the peninsula to eventually cover an area almost as large as the United States, Discover Magazine reported. Along the way it caused chaos across the area's major cities including Riyadh and Dubai, where some locations were reduced to zero visibility, streets turned a shade of orange and schools were forced shut. The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies said: 'The blowing sand reduced surface visibility to near zero at some locations, disrupting ground transportation, air traffic, and also closing schools. 'Visibility was reduced to 0.1 mile for several hours at Dubai International Airport, which is one of the world’s busiest in terms of volume of flights.' More than 450 Saudi Arabian Airlines flights were cancelled between Wednesday and Friday - which equals 33 per cent of the carrier's 1,526 scheduled flights, the Saudi Gazette reported. On top of this, 678 flights were delayed and another 19 rerouted from airports in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam. According to the BBC, strong winds aggravated the problem, causing a 'near complete lack of vision in daylight', the UAE National Centre for Meteorology and Seismology said. Despite sandstorms being a relatively common occurrence in that part of the world, they are not generally so big and rarely wreak so much havoc. In this instance, the storm also blew across Saudi Arabia's Empty Quarter - the world's second largest desert which reaches into Yemen and Oman. Many people took to social media to upload the images they had taken of the sandstorm and share their experiences.

"The warmth of a sun has long been thought to be a key ingredient to life. But astronomers say 'rogue', sun-less planets that wander the stars  could still harbour extra-terrestrials. While it sounds like science fiction, these planets may offer scientists a new avenue in their search for alien life. The warmth of a sun has long been thought to be a key ingredient to life. But astronomers say 'rogue', sun-less planets that wander the stars could still harbour extra-terrestrials . This is according to Sean Raymond, an astrophysicist with the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux in France, who has taken a look at how life can form on rogue planets. Writing in Aeon, he says: 'To have any chance of life – at least life like our own – a free-floating Earth would need liquid water.' A planet needs to keep warm for liquid water to form, and without the sun, this heat would have to come from its interior. 'A layer of ice on a planet's surface can act as a strong insulator, locking in a planet's heat,' claims Raymond. Globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make rogue more common than first thought. Rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star . PSO J318.5-22 was detected 80 light years away from Earth and it is estimated to have a mass six times that of Jupiter . Several years ago, an international team of astronomers discovered a large planet floating freely through space with no star to orbit. Planets traditionally travel in a uniform, singular direction, around a star. However, the free-floating planet, named PSO J318.5-22, was found without a host. Its movement isn't structured, and scientists do not understand how it formed and they are baffled by what - if anything - controls it. PSO J318.5-22 was detected 80 light years away from Earth and it is estimated to have a mass six times that of Jupiter. Astronomers believe it formed 12 million years ago, and is considered a newborn in planetary terms - Earth is thought to be around 4.5 billion years old. Dr Michael Liu of the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii identified the rogue planet from its 'faint and unique heat signature'. We have never before seen an object free-floating in space that that looks like this. 'It has all the characteristics of young planets found around other stars, but it is drifting out there all alone,' explained Liu. 'If the ice layer is thick enough, then a planet can maintain an ocean of liquid water beneath the ice.' He calculates that the ice layer needs to be at least 10 km (6 miles) thick to prevent it from freezing for billions of years. Raymonds comments echo a similar conclusion reached by scientists in Chicago several years ago. They calculated that life can cling on to a planet for billions of years without a star to provide a direct source of warmth. Research by astrophysicists Dorian Abbot and Eric Switzer from the city's university discovered that heat would come from the breakdown of radioactive elements inside the planet's core. The scientists named their discovery a 'Steppenwolf' planet because they claimed any life found there would 'exist like a lone wolf wandering the galactic steppe'. However the pair refused to speculate on what life forms would be discovered, but agreed that they would me microscopic in size. As well as internal heat, Raymond says another way a planet can keep warm is using a thick atmosphere. 'A free-floating Earth with a thick hydrogen atmosphere could keep its surface temperature above the freezing point of water,' writes Raymond. 'The planet could have lakes and oceans (and possibly life) on its surface.' Rogue planets are hard to find because, without orbiting a star, they reflect very little light. But 50 have now been found in the past 15 years, leading some to suggest they may be abundant in the universe. Rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star. Brown dwarfs, for example, are substellar objects that are not massive enough to sustain fusion, but are still more than 13 times the mass of Jupiter. The exact boundary between a giant planet and a low-mass brown dwarf is still being debated, but finding more rogue planets could shed light on this mystery. And this could indicate that there are more rogue planets than we know of in the cosmos.","Comments were made by Sean Raymond, an astrophysicist in France .

"A Florida woman who fled with her 4-year-old son to keep his circumcision from going forward has filed a civil rights lawsuit on behalf of the boy. Heather Hironimus, who filed the complaint late Monday, is hoping a federal judge might intervene where state judges haven't. The complaint is repeating her claims that surgery on her 4-year-old son isn't necessary, that the boy doesn't want it, and that his constitutional rights are being violated. Aside from seeking to stop the procedure, Hironimus is trying to avoid her own arrest. Her arrest was ordered after she fled in February and ignored a judge's demand that she appear in court and allow the circumcision to go forward. Mother: Heather Hironimus fled with her son despite a judge's order to appear in court and to allow the circumcision favored by the child's father, Dennis Nebus, to go forward . Father: Dennis Nebus right, sits in court with his lawyers May Cain and William Snihur, Jr., in a continuing legal battle with Hironimus over circumcision (March 10, 2015 file photo) Hironimus and the boy's father, Dennis Nebus, have been warring since her pregnancy. They were never married but share custody of their child. In a parenting agreement filed in court, the two agreed to the boy's circumcision. Hironimus later changed her mind, giving way to a long court battle. Circuit and appellate judges have sided with Nebus, but potential surgeons have backed out after failing to get the mother's consent and becoming the target of anti-circumcision protesters. Though circumcision remains popular in Judeo-Christian tradition, religion had not been a driver in seeking the cutting of the boy's foreskin in this case. Nebus called it 'just the normal thing to do.' Supporters of Heather Hironiumus, Anthony Mollical and Zeresh Altork, gather outside of the South County Courthouse in Delray Beach where Hironiumus was meant to appear with her child (March 10, 2015 file photo) Fight: Supporters backing Heather Hironimus are seen outside a courthouse on March 10 . In the new filing, though, Hironimus tries to use the child's faith as a defense against the surgery, saying he is a Christian and citing New Testament passages to bolster her case that the practice is discouraged by their beliefs. Both parents have been under a gag order since December. Hironimus' attorney, Thomas Hunker, told the Associated Press that he couldn't reveal where his client was, but that she was fighting on behalf of a child who is frightened by the idea of undergoing surgery. Given the boy's age and the fact that he has voiced his own opposition to circumcision, Hunker said, the procedure could be particularly scarring. 'This could have a profound negative impact, a long-lasting if not permanent negative impact, on the child's psychological condition,' he said Tuesday. Hunker did not return a message seeking comment from Daily Mail Online. Attorneys representing Nebus declined to comment to Daily Mail Online, citing the order. An attorney for Nebus did not return a call seeking comment from the Associated Press. Circumcision rates have fallen in the U.S., but a majority of boys still undergo the procedure. Meantime, a bubbling movement of so-called anti-circumcision 'intactivists' has made the case a rallying cry against a surgery they view as barbaric.","Heather Hironimus and the boy's father, Dennis Nebus, have been warring since her pregnancy .

"Being underweight in mid-life could increase your risk of dementia, claim researchers. A new study shows you are a third more likely to be diagnosed with diseases such as Alzheimer's than those of a healthy weight. Obese people appear to be protected against dementia, with a risk around 30 per cent lower than those of healthy weight. The findings contradict many previous studies which have suggested that being fat – with a high Body Mass Index (BMI) - could raise the risk. A new study shows underweight people are a third more likely to be diagnosed with diseases such as Alzheimer's than those of a healthy weight (file photo) Study author, Professor Stuart Pocock, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said doctors and policymakers may have to re-think how to best identify those at high risk of dementia. He said 'We also need to pay attention to the causes and public health consequences of the link between underweight and increased dementia risk which our research has established.' 'However, our results also open up an intriguing new avenue in the search for protective factors for dementia - if we can understand why people with a high BMI have a reduced risk of dementia, it's possible that further down the line, researchers might be able to use these insights to develop new treatments for dementia.' Other experts said more research was needed, and the way GPs used to diagnose dementia may have skewed the results. Researchers based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Oxon Epidemiology, also in London, analysed patient information recorded during routine general practice over nearly two decades. Data on 1,958,191 patients aged 55 on average with a BMI of 26.5 on average - just within the range usually classed as overweight - were examined. BMI is assessed by comparing height to weight, in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared. A healthy score is between 18.5 and 24.99 – above is overweight and obese. The study regarded BMI of less than 20 as underweight. After nine years follow-up, 45,507 people were diagnosed with dementia. Researchers found people who were underweight in middle age were 34 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than those of a healthy weight. The findings contradict many previous studies which have suggested that being fat – with a high Body Mass Index (BMI) - could raise the risk (file photo) As people's BMI increased, the risk of dementia fell, with very obese people having a BMI greater than 40 less likely to develop the condition than those of normal weight. The link was not affected by the decade in which patients were born, age at diagnosis, alcohol use or smoking. The new research was published in The Lancet Diabetes And Endocrinology journal (must credit). Dr Nawab Qizilbash, from Oxon Epidemiology in London, said the reasons why high BMI might lead to a lower risk of dementia are not clear. 'Many different issues related to diet, exercise, frailty, genetic factors and weight change could play a part' he said. Prof Tom Dening, Professor of Dementia Research, University of Nottingham, said limitations of the study included poor dementia diagnosis rates by GPs at the time. He said 'It is plausible that faced with a grossly obese patient, the average GP may have concentrated on the obvious medical risks and paid less attention to the cognitive issues than they might have done with a comparable patient of normal weight. 'Or maybe the GP didn't refer them to a memory clinic but sent them to see a gastroenterologist or diabetologist instead. 'In other words, the study may be telling us something about the diagnostic practices of GPs, as much about the natural history of metabolic disease and dementia.' Dr Doug Brown, Director of Research and Development at Alzheimer's Society, said 'Previous research has suggested that being overweight in midlife increases risk of developing the condition and yet this study suggests that it may actually be protective. 'This mixed picture highlights the difficulty of conducting studies into the complex lifestyle risk factors for dementia and reinforces the need for further research. Dr Simon Ridley, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said 'There is currently no sure-fire way to prevent dementia. 'In the meantime, evidence suggests that we can reduce the risk by eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising regularly, not smoking, and keeping blood pressure in check.","Underweight people are also more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimers .

"Corporal Christian Walmsley was found dead in his flat in Bolton after struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder following tours of duty abroad . A soldier who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after a series of tours abroad wrote suicide notes before taking a fatal overdose, an inquest has heard. Corporal Christian Walmsley was found dead in his flat in Bolton, Greater Manchester wearing five war medals after struggling to adapt to civilian life, a coroner was told. The father-of-three had served in the First Gulf War, Bosnia, Angola and Northern Ireland in the Royal Engineers from 1989 until 2000. The 42-year-old had witnessed the 'significant violence only soldiers experience', the hearing at Bolton Coroners Court was told. After retiring from the army, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and Fibromyalgia, a chronic condition causing deep muscle pain. His family members told the court that Cpl Walmsley's two marriages had ended divorce. He had spent some time in Germany over the last decade before returning to the UK to rebuild relationships with his family, relatives said. Stepfather Michael Richards told the hearing: 'He'd always been such a fit lad. But when he came back he had to use a stick because he was so fatigued.' Mr Richards said his stepson had questioned the support given to former servicemen and women. The inquest heard he had previously taken an overdose and told his family he had tried to take his own life. But he discharged himself from the hospital before he had a mental health assessment. In the weeks leading up to his death, his family said Cpl Walmsley had seemed optimistic. Yet on November 4 last year, he had appeared distressed to friends and sent text messages to his mother telling her he was in pain. He was discovered dead on November 6. Police officers found a notebook with several suicide notes inside, the hearing was told. Cpl Walmsley was among British troops in the First Gulf War (pictured in file photo), as well touring Bosnia . The coroner ruled that, without dates on the notes, he could not be certain Cpl Walmsley had attempted suicide. Recording misadventure as a verdict, Coroner Alan Walsh said: 'During his service he would have experienced things only soldiers go through. 'I hope his children are reminded of the bravery he showed in serving his country.' On PTSD among soldiers, the coroner added: 'I do believe it is important that we acknowledge the stress the disorder causes and the total change it causes to someone's life. Those who do serve in the armed forces witness experiences beyond their imagination.'

"Alastair Campbell famously said the Blair government ‘didn't do God’. But David Cameron and wife Samantha have made a colourful visit to a Sikh temple as part of a general election tour. The Prime Minister, wearing a traditional orange patka, and Mrs Cameron, in a blue headscarf, chatted and posed for selfies at the Gravesend Gurdwara in Kent earlier today. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister and his wife joined worshippers at the Gravesend Gurdwara in Kent today in traditional Sikh dress . Mrs Cameron chatted with a young boy and his mother at the temple. The visit was designed to reach out to a wider community with just three weeks until the election . They briefly joined thousands of people in a parade carrying the Sikh holy book to the temple before Mr Cameron gave a speech. It comes just a day after the Conservative leader attended one of the largest gatherings of Christians in the UK. His speeches are designed to reach out to a wider community with just three weeks to go before voting. But as he was about to arrive at the temple today a senior priest apparently objected to prayers being interrupted. There were some heated scenes before the address was moved to a side room. The Tory leader told the audience the Vaisakhi festival, which is one of the most important events in the Sikh calendar, was a 'big, bold' sign of their devotion. He said: 'I wanted to make sure Downing Street was part of this too and I'm proud to be the first Prime Minister to host a Vaisakhi reception at Number 10.

Women including Mrs Cameron (centre) and children sit on the floor alongside parliamentary candidate Priti Patel (second left) during the outing . He also delivered a campaign speech during the Festival of Life in London yesterday. He told the 45,000-strong audience: 'It is an honour to be here and I'm proud of this festival which started as a camp just off the Lagos expressway and set the world alight. 'I believe in aspiration. I believe the only limit to someone's potential is their own ambition and talent. 'I look out to this crowd and I see someone who will take my role and become Prime Minister for this great country. 'I hope you can hold off for a while just yet.' He added on Twitter later that night: 'It was an honour to address the Festival of Life - now a great British tradition - at midnight last night.' CLAIM: Jesse Norman and the chocolate cake he allegedly gave out while campaigning for re-election . Police are investigating a Tory MP over claims he attempted to bribe voters with chocolate cake. Jesse Norman allegedly gave out cake while campaigning for re-election at an Asda supermarket in his Hereford constituency. West Mercia Police last night said it was investigating reports of a breach of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which bans Election candidates from providing food, drink or entertainment in a bid to win votes. The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year. Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2. He described the allegations as ‘nonsense’, saying: ‘We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children, who are not even voters.’ COUNTRY LIFE: A 'beater' at work and below,  a bottle of Sipsmith Dry Gin . The Prime Minister indulged his love of country sports by taking part in a secret country shoot near his Oxfordshire constituency home. And he celebrated with a nip of a specially prepared ‘Chipping Norton’ cocktail. But witnesses say that David Cameron did not himself use a gun – despite his reputation as a skilled marksman. Instead, he acted as a ‘beater’ to flush out the game. The event took place on New Year’s Eve but until now has been kept a closely guarded secret. It took place near Chipping Norton, the Oxfordshire town which has given its name to the ‘Chipping Norton set’ of high-profile local residents from the world of politics, media and showbusiness such as Mr Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson. Last night, the man who served Mr Cameron the cocktail said other people on what he described as a ‘country walk’ had no idea there would be a VIP guest. Jared Brown, master distiller at the West London ‘artisanal’ gin company Sipsmith, said: ‘No one but the landowner knew the Prime Minister would be joining us.’ He fought shy of describing the event as a shoot, but added: ‘I can say with utter certainty that Mr Cameron did not handle a gun.’ Mr Brown confirmed, though, that the PM did sample the cocktail, based on Sipsmith London Dry Gin. Last night, the drink, also containing manuka honey, raspberry tea and extract of echinacea, was being dubbed the ‘Chipping Norton cocktail’.","David Cameron and wife Samantha made a visit to a temple in Kent .

"Zara Phillips has revealed how she got her fitness back after the birth of her first child Mia - by hitting the exercise bike every morning before her daughter even woke up. The 33-year-old, who is vying for a place on Team GB at the Rio Olympics, welcomed Mia Grace with husband Mike Tindall last year. But after finding herself 'surprised' by how her fitness dropped during pregnancy, the Queen's granddaughter has committed to a strict exercise and diet regime to get back in shape. Scroll down for video . Zara Phillips has told of how she was surprised at how difficult it was to regain her fitness after the birth of her daughter, Mia, one (pictured left in January and right, last July when Mia was six months old) 'What surprised me about having a baby is losing all your fitness and how tough it is to get it back to that level again,' she said in an interview with The Sunday Time Magazine. Starting her morning at 7am, Zara has a breakfast of Greek yogurt and honey and tries to get in a stint on the exercise bike at her home, Gatcombe Park, before Mia wakes at 8am. Her day is then typically spent with the horses kept at her mother, Princess Anne's stables, before squeezing in another workout. 'Lunch is quick and simple, like soup and a sandwich or eggs and toast. I don't diet but I try to eat well and not to eat too many carbohydrates or sugary things. Zara (pictured competing in the 2012 London Games) said she is keen to win a place on Team GB in 2016 . The 33-year-old (pictured with Jessica Ennis-Hill with their medals in 2012) is yet to qualify for the forthcoming Olympics . 'In the afternoon I'll do extra exercise like swimming or cycling.' Zara helped take home team silver at the 2012 London Olympics and is keen to compete int he 2016 games. The Queen's granddaughter when she was pregnant in 2013 . 'I hope to be part of the eventing team that goes to the Olympics in Rio, but first I need to qualify.' A keen eventer, she said she is eager for daughter Mia to spend time around horses as she grows up. 'I expect Mia will grow up with horses all around her, just like her mum did,' she added. The one-year-old's father previously revealed the couple had 'three Shetland ponies waiting for her'. Speaking in an interview in January, Mr Tindall, who has recently taken part in the reality skiing show The Jump, said: 'Eventing children have to be very relaxed. 'You are going to travel around a lot.' Earlier this year Zara told of how little Mia enjoyed playing with her royal relatives Prince George and her cousins, Savannah and Isla. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia at Magic Millions Race Day in January she said of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge: 'We've all got small ones now so it's great fun.' Prince William and his wife are expecting their second child this week, with palace sources confirming Kate's due date to be April 25.

"Los Angeles' most famous cougar has 'left the building' after taking up residence in an unsuspecting family's crawl space. The mountain lion, known as P-22, left the Los Feliz home in the early hours of Tuesday, having created quite the media circus in the affluent Hollywood suburb. His departure was announced on Twitter by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which tweeted 'the cougar has left the building' at 9.28am. New home: The lion - known as P-22 - was found by workers in the crawl space at midday on Monday . Courageous: On Tuesday morning, after the cougar's signal moved away from the area, a couple of brave animal welfare officers decided to conduct a thorough search of the area under the Los Feliz home . Gone: Luckily for them, P-22 had moved away overnight, and was moving back towards the park . 'Likes': The incident has made P-22 even more famous, with another 1,400 people liking his Facebook page . The lion usually lives in nearby Griffith Park, but on Monday was discovered in the crawl space of Jason and Paula Archinac's home by an unsuspecting alarm technician. 'He came out white as a ghost,' Animal Service's Armando Navarrete told KTLA. The house was soon surrounded by a host of media outlets - including a circling helicopter - while a live stream meant Los Angeles' residents could keep an eye on animal services' attempts to move the lion. But P-22 was not prepared to be moved, despite being poked gently with a long prod — which only led to welfare officers temporarily losing the pricey GoPro camera they'd attached to the end of it that fell off. Welfare officers then attempted to fire a tennis ball cannon into the crawl space with hopes that at least the noise and commotion would scare him out, a tactic that often works with coyotes. Next, they fired small bean bags, the same kind police sometimes use for human crowd control, toward the cat. Resident: The beautiful animal may have been living in the crawlspace for some time before being discovered . Rescue: Attempts to get the lion to move out - including firing tennis balls - were unsuccessful . None of it worked, so they asked everyone to clear the area, in the hope that P-22 might move on his own accord. And the tactic worked: the mountain lion, who crossed two freeways when he travelled from the Santa Monica Mountains to the park more than three years ago, was gone when they returned in the morning. But even though the animal's tracking device - fitted some years ago - was no longer sounding in the area, it was decided it was still best to double check the area was cougar-free. So a couple of brave souls entered the crawl space just to make sure. Fame: P-22 is best-known for being pictured in front of the Hollywood sign in 2013 . Hiding: It is thought the lion crossed two freeways to get to his home in Griffin Park, but it is not known how long he has been living in the crawl space in the Los Feliz hills . Luckily for them, P-22 was heading home - and the most recent tweets reveal he was heading deeper into Griffith Park. '#LosFeliz adventure is (literally) behind him,' California's wildlife department tweeted. It isn't the first time P-22 has been the centre of attention, however. After he arrived in the 4,000 acre park, National Geographic photographer Steve Winter set about trying to capture his picture - finally managing to photograph him walking in front of the Hollywood sign in 2013, making P-22 an overnight celebrity. Indeed, the big cat - who survived mange and a meal of rat poison to become apparently healthy again just last year - even has a Facebook page in his honour, which has got more than 1,400 more 'likes' since his recent appearance on TV. Beanbags: The animal rescue workers have even resorted to using beanbags to move the lion . Live feed: The incident has created quite a furore - with people watching it unfold live on television (pictured)","P-22 left his new den underneath a house in Los Feliz overnight Tuesday .

"An investigation spanning almost three years into the yearly cost of gun violence covered by U.S. taxpayers has determined the figure to be over $229 billion. The new study, by independent political magazine Mother Jones, was spawned by the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012 during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight rises, in which 12 people were killed and 70 injured. The magazine says it set out to determine the amount of money the survivors and victims' families from that one incident would need, based on medical expenses, lost wages, court costs, therapy and impact on quality of life. The legal proceedings alone cost $5.5 million before the trial of the shooter, James Eagan Holmes, had even started. Shocking: A new report into the annual economic toll of gun violence in the US determined that taxpayers fork out $229 billion annually because of shootings, which is more than $700 per person. That figure is more than Apple's annual revenue of $174 billion and the cost of the obesity epidemic, which is $224 billion . The investigation subsequently expanded to account for all the victims of gun-related violence in the U.S. based on yearly figures from 2012. At least 750,000 Americans have been injured by guns over the last 10 years. While gun-related deaths seem to be decreasing, with 33,000 each year, gun-related violence is increasing, with 80,000 injured in 2012. Mother Jones reported the rise of gun-related violence to be up 11 percent since 2011. Despite this increase, no studies have been undertaken to document the cost to society that such shootings demand. Last month, a team doctors noted in the Annals of Internal Medicine that the issue is 'a public health crisis'. The medical journal also noted that such studies have been avoided because of the influence that the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun groups have on political leaders. The Annals of Internal Medicine called this 'suppression of science'. Gun violence: Although homicides are on the decline across the US, Mother Jones found 80,000 people were injured by guns in 2012. The yearly cost to send someone to prison for gun-related homicide is $414,000 . Mother Jones added: 'Political forces had effectively banned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other scientific agencies from funding research on gun-related injury and death. The ban worked: A recent systematic review of studies evaluating access to guns and its association with suicide and homicide identified no relevant studies published since 2005.' To set about its own study, Mother Jones enlisted Ted Miller at the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. Miller had undertaken similar investigations since the 1980s. They identified two major costs stemming from gun-related violence: direct and indirect. Direct costs referred to the expenses of someone actually being shot, from emergency service, to police investigations and medical bills, as well as court and prison costs for the assailant. Taxpayers account for about 87 percent of the direct costs involved in gun-related violence, Mother Jones reported. Based on Miller's findings and the 2012 data, it was determined the yearly total of direct costs is about $8.6 billion. About $5.2 billion of this relates to prison costs. 'The average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in America is nearly $400,000,' the study determined. 'And we pay for 32 of them every single day.' For each homicide caused by a gun, the largest direct cost is prison, which costs about $414,000 for each person who committed the crime, according to Mother Jones. There are 32 of these paid out every day . The second, and vastly more expensive category, is indirect costs, such as loss of income, impact on quality of life and payouts to survivors, victims and their families. Indirect costs amount to at least $221 billion each year, it was determined. Lost wages alone counts for $49 billion of that figure. However the $229 billion total could be well be higher, because there are factors related to gun violence that could not be counted. This includes the massive increase in security at schools across the country since the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. The federal government has spent over $811 million equipping schools with security guards and providing other surveillance-based equipment. Adding up: The Mother Jones study used 2012 data of  homicides, suicides, police shootings, and massacres to quantify the effects of gun violence . Mother Jones included a case study in the investigation, showing the life-long costs of and effects that a random shooting had on Arizona woman Jennifer Longdon. Longdon and her husband, both martial artists, were at a drive-thru in Phoenix on November 15, 2004, when another vehicle side-swiped their car. The driver of the other vehicle got out and fired five shots into the truck that Longdon and her husband David were in. David was shot in the head, causing him severe neurological damage and sending him blind. He required around-the-clock care. Jennifer was shot in the spine and permanently paralyzed from the chest down. The shooter or shooters were never caught. Activist: Jennifer Longdon was paralyzed following a random shooting in Phoenix in 2044. She estimates the total financial toll the shooting has had on her since the incident to be around $5 million. Adding to that cost, the shooter was never caught and her husband suffered severe brain damage . After five months in hospital, Jennifer's hospital bills totaled almost $1 million. She was dumped by her health insurance provider following the shooting, based on a pre-existing condition, and had to file for bankruptcy. She has been hospitalized over 20 times since the shooting and estimates her total bills since 2004, including wheelchair modifications to her home, a van that she was able to drive with just her hands and physical therapy, to about $5 million. She is now a high-profile gun control activist. 'It's an ongoing battle every day—choosing to stay alive, and to continue to fight,' she told Mother Jones.","Investigation by Mother Jones said gun violence costs $700 per American each year, with a total of $229 billion .
The cost of the obesity epidemic is $224 billion .

"Kelly Ripa has been grief stricken following the sad news that her friend, cosmetic surgeon Dr Fredric Brandt, was found dead by suicide at his Miami mansion on Sunday. So it's understandable that 44-year-old TV star was looking morose as she left her New York City apartment on Tuesday. The Live With Kelly & Michael co-host, who is usually seen smiling, wore a frown as she left the building alone. When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life.' Sad day: Kelly Ripa looked to be in mourning on Tuesday as she left her NYC apartment; on Sunday it was announced her surgeon friend Dr Fredric Brandt had died . The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice.' The former soap opera actress was dressed casually in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on. The beauty was carrying her coat as well as some papers, a cell phone and her purse. Casual look: The former soap opera actress was dressed down in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look.

Madonna and Stephanie Seymour were clients. 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer,' the star wrote. Her husband Mark Consuelos, retweeted choreographer Isaac Calpito's post, which read: 'Devastated over the loss of our dear friend @drfredricbrandt. You are missed. You are loved. The world has lost one of its kindest souls.' They were close: Dr  Brandt was remembered by  Ripa (left with the surgeon in 2011) in a tweet on Monday following his tragic suicide at his Miami home on Sunday . Comedian and former The View star, Joy Behar, tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed.' The City of Miami Police Department confirmed that Dr Brandt's death on Sunday was a suicide by hanging. An autopsy was scheduled on Monday, the coroner confirmed. Miami Herald columnist, Lesley Abravanel had said Brandt had been 'devastated' recently over rumors comparing him to a character on the Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Her note: The 44-year-old beauty's tweet said, 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer' Abravanel, a Miami Herald columnist, posted a series of tweets on Sunday claiming that he had been 'devastated' by unflattering comparisons to Dr Franff on the  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, according to  sources close to the doctor. The doctor's longtime publicist Jacquie Tractenberg told The New York Post on Monday: 'The show definitely deeply hurt him, he was being made fun of because of the way he looks. 'It is mean, and it was bullying. But the show was not the reason for his depression, and it was not the reason he would take his own life.' The Tractenberg & Co PR agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online. Was he bullied?: Dr  Brandt (left) has a resemblance to Dr Franff (right), a character on Tina Fey's Netflix show, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He was reportedly 'devastated' by the portrayal . His colleague, Dr Robert Anolik, who worked with Brandt at his practice, posted a moving tribute on Monday. The acclaimed dermatologist wrote: 'Dr. Fredric Brandt died yesterday. For nearly 5 years, Fred and I worked side by side. He was far more than a colleague to me. He was a close friend. I will miss him every day.' The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami by his housekeeper where he lived alone. She called 911 at 9.17am, according to a police statement. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department confirmed that an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. The New York Post also wrote a column last month comparing the real-life doctor to the fictional doctor on Tina Fey's hit comedy. 'Sources: Dr Fredric Brandt was ""devastated"" over comparisons to the protagonist on Tina Fey’s new Netflix show, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"",' Abravanel tweeted. Behar tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed' An eye for art: Dr Brandt, a cosmetic dermatologist and well-known art collector pictured in front of a piece from his collection at his apartment in New York City on March 7, 2014 . Dr Franff only appears in one episode, titled 'Kimmy Goes To The Doctor!', of the first season. The character shares Dr Brandt’s smooth skin, platinum blond hair and enthusiasm for plastic surgery, but his door sign claims he’s a ‘board certified D, DS, DDSOBGYN’, rather than a cosmetic dermatologist. The Dr Franff character is depicted on the Netflix show with a high-pitched laugh and unable to speak certain words due to his plastic surgery. He is also seen drinking  from a surgical bag and reinflates his own face after being punched. Netflix had no comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones. Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy.","Cosmetic dermatologist to the stars Fredric Brandt was found dead at his Coconut Grove home in Miami on Sunday, aged 65 .

"It had seemed fake tan was here to stay after becoming a beauty staple for many women who wanted to emulate their favourite celebrities’ bronzed looks. But their determination to achieve the perfect glow appears to be fading away in favour of adopting a lighter look. The number of bottles of fake tan sold in 2014 fell by nearly a quarter (24.1 per cent) from the year before, bringing the value of sales down by 19.3 per cent to £14.5million. The number of bottles of fake tan sold in 2014 fell by nearly a quarter from last year. The product used to be a favourite of many celebrities including Victoria Beckham (left) and Sam Faiers (right) Georgia Percy, of retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel, which gathered the data, said it suggests women are ‘tending towards a more natural look’. She added that artificial tanning products were the hardest hit sub-sector of the sun care market. And Sandra Vaughan, a beauty consultant for artificial tan brand Fake Bake, said the pale look is now more fashionable. Fake tanning had become part of many women’s regular beauty regime thanks to its popularity among celebrities such as former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, the stars on Strictly Come Dancing and the cast – both male and female – of reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex. But even the TOWIE crew themselves admit the look can easily go wrong. Sam Faiers, who was a brand ambassador for Fake Bake, has described her horror at looking unnaturally orange on occasion. Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, pictured (above) at the 87th annual Academy Awards, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow . She said: ‘Just before Christmas I overdid it with the fake tan. I made my legs too dark and I just thought, what have I done?!’ Other TOWIE performers have admitted similar errors, including Lauren Goodger, who was a particularly vivid colour when attending a Woman’s Own event last year. Even the programme itself has ridiculed the dangers of fake tan. Charlie Sims became a laughing stock after emerging from a spay tan session designed to improve his appearance and self-esteem only to look like an orange extra from the famous Tango TV commercials. His sister, Chloe Sims, famously stripped off to be the face and body of Montana Tan’s Starship Range. Georgia Percy, from Kantar Worldpanel, said sales of artificial tanning products were the hardest hit sub-sector of the suncare market in 2014. ‘As with total suncare, the key contributor to decline was fewer shoppers, suggesting women are tending towards a more natural look,’ she said. Lou Ellerton, of consultants the Value Engineers, told The Grocer magazine: ‘Reality TV shows were effectively ongoing ads for fake tan but they passed their peak. 'It’s like fake tan has been off the air for a while.’ Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow. The weather has also played a part, she said. ‘If skin is not on show, why dress it up?’","The value of sales fell by 19.3 per cent to around £14.5million last year .

"Kingsley Burrell, 29, died in police custody on March 31 2011, four days after he was arrested and sectioned in Birmingham city centre . A mentally ill father-of-three who died in police custody was handcuffed for six hours, wet himself after being denied access to a toilet, and was repeatedly punched by officers, it was claimed today. Kingsley Burrell, 29, was taken into custody on March 27 2011 after calling police to say he was being threatened with a gun while out shopping in the centre of Birmingham, a court has heard. However, when CCTV showed that in fact nobody had approached him, he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act, and died four days later at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QE). An inquest into his death at Birmingham Coroner's Court heard that he was arrested in the Haymer corner shop in Winson Green while he was going swimming with his son, four, and niece. Trainee security guard Mr Burrell called police himself, saying two men had threatened to shoot him, but when they arrived he was handcuffed and taken to the QE hospital. Today, Kadisha Brown-Burrell, the victim's sister, described the moment she saw Mr Burrell following his arrest. She said: 'When he walked out he walked over stiff. He couldn’t move his head, couldn’t move his body, couldn’t move his shoulders. 'Kingsley had three lumps, one on his forehead. I said to Chantelle, ""Take a picture of that"". 'Kingsley said to me, ""I can’t move"". He couldn’t move the upper part of his body. He was barefoot and had pyjama bottoms on. 'I could see that he was really upset, saying, ""How can they put me in here knowing I was calling for help because there were a couple of guys after me?""' When she and Mr Burrell's partner Chantelle Graham returned to see him the following day, he told them he had been handcuffed for a number of hours after being taken to the hospital. Ms Brown-Burrell said: 'He said that while he was in the QE during assessment he was on the floor, and all he wanted was a glass of water. Mr Burrell was taken into custody after calling officers and claiming three men had threatened him with a machine gun. When CCTV showed that nobody had approached Mr Burrell, he was sectioned . Today an inquest into Mr Burrell's death was told his claims that police beat him, and left him handcuffed for six hours  pictured left to right, his family Janet Burrell, Lorraine Burell and Kadisha Burrell) 'They had made him incontinent and he had wet himself. He was on the floor for five or six hours and all he wanted was water and for them to release the cuffs.' Mr Burrell told her a police officer had offered to loosen the cuffs for him, but 'instead he tightened them', she told the court. Mr Burrell also told her he had been involved in a struggle in the back of the ambulance, and that three members of hospital staff had watched while police officers 'injected me into my brain'. She said: 'When I went to see Kingsley he said the police gave him injections into the top of his head, while three mental health staff looked through a window.' Ms Brown-Burrell described her brother, as 'calm, collected and outgoing', but said that he had been worried about a paternity issue with an ex-girlfriend. The woman, Charmaine Clarke, had been claiming that her son was not Mr Burrell's, and had named the child after another man. The inquest heard that Mr Burrell had been trying to get his former partner to take a DNA test to confirm whether he was the father. Mr Burrell believed that the two men had come into the shop to threaten him over the issue, adding that the only reason he wasn't shot was because he had his son with him . Mr Burrell's sister Kadisha (front right) also told the inquest her brother's allegations that police had left him without access to a toilet so he had wet himself . Among Mr Burrell's other allegations, related to the court by his sister and former partner, were that police had kept him in uncomfortably tight handcuffs, and had injected him three times in the head . In a 999 call played to the jury Mr Burrell repeatedly said that 'two black youths and one Asian' put a 'Mach 10' machine gun to his head, and were waiting for him outside the shop. Mr Burrell also claimed that one of the men was the leader of the Burger Bar Crew, a notorious Birmingham gang. But CCTV footage played to the court showed no sign of armed men in the shop. Instead all it showed was Mr Brown looking agitated and gesticulating wildly near the counter. Andy Gillespie, a firefighter who was one of the first on the scene, said Mr Burrell was 'very distressed', struggled to make eye contact was gesticulating and animated while on the phone. In a previous statement Mr Gillespie said that when he approached Mr Burrell he told him he was a 'f****** dead man', adding: 'Two people are trying to kill me. I will be dead in 24 hours.' He said Mr Burrell told him: 'I want everyone here for protection, I am a dead man. Somebody put a gun to my head, there is guys down the road, I am a dead man.' Footage showed Mr Burrell repeatedly pressing his hands together in prayer, and Mr Gillespie said he was saying: 'Praise God, praise Allah'. He said: 'It was almost that he felt relieved that he hadn't been shot.' Kadisha Brown-Burrell (pictured) said that on the first day she went to visit her brother in hospital, after he was arrested, he was 'walking stiff' and couldn't move the upper part of his body . Mr Burrell's partner, Chantelle Graham, said her son, who was with Mr Burrell as he was arrested, repeated 'the black police officer hit my daddy' after she took him home . Ms Graham told the inquest that when she went to pick up her son from a police station an officer told her Mr Burrell had 'gone berserk' in the ambulance . The officer alleged that Mr Burrell had banged his son's head against the wall and that he had to be restrained in order to get the boy away from him. But her son told her a black police officer had started hitting Mr Burrell, the court heard. Ms Graham said: 'Kayden just kept saying, ""The black police officer hit my daddy"" to anyone who would listen. That is what he told everyone, even at school.' Ms Brown-Burrell also said that in the days after Mr Burrell's death, Kayden had said, 'The naughty black policeman did that to daddy.' The inquest also heard that Mr Burrell had been carrying a CS canister on the day he was detained, as well as claims that he was a gang member and drug dealer. The inquest continues tomorrow and is expected to last six weeks.

"One of Hollywood’s most respected PRs claimed that the Oscars judges did not want to give 12 Years A Slave the Best Picture Award because it was not patriotic enough to America. According to hacked Sony emails, Peggy Siegal said that the voting panel objected to having a British director paint their country in a bad light. She said that Steve McQueen would not win as the Academy did not want such a dark message about the US to be ‘sent around the world’. The emails also reveal that a Hollywood blockbuster of Dr Who is in the works - but not for a few years. Scroll down for video . Controversial: A hacked Sony email revealed respected Hollywood PR Peggy Siegal believed the Oscar voting panel did not want 12 Years A Slave to win because it was not patriotic enough towards America and were concerned a victory for British director Steve McQueen (right) would paint the US in a bad light . The details were included in a database of 30,287 documents and 173,132 emails that was uploaded to the WikiLeaks website after hackers stole them from Sony Pictures Entertainment, the company’s movie division, last November. The database is the first time the information has been made available in one place in a searchable format. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said that the documents ‘show the inner workings of an influential multinational corporation’ and should be in the public domain. But Sony reacted with fury and a spokesman said that the company wanted to ‘strongly condemn’ Assange’s actions. The email from Siegal, who has been called the most powerful PR on the East coast of America, was sent to former Sony Pictures Entertainment chair Amy Pascal in October 2013. Global perception She wrote in the email: 'This film is made by a Brit that exposes the darkest ""hidden history"" of America, exposing a cruel and brutal segment of our white society.' She added the plantation owners are as 'terrible as the Nazis' She wrote: ‘The Academy consists of approximately 6,000 white 60-year-old men who are educated, experienced filmmakers who take their voting power seriously. ‘They are all fiercely patriotic and very aware of our day by day international standing politically and culturally. ‘This film is made by a Brit that exposes the darkest ""hidden history"" of America, exposing a cruel and brutal segment of our white society. These plantation owners are as terrible as the Nazis, who are the only ""acceptable"" cinematic villains. ‘As powerful as Brad Pitt is as a producer/spokesman, he will not over expose himself in the states.’ She added that the Academy’s experience of watching the film was ‘not pleasant’ and that some might fast forward or turn it off because of the violence. She wrote: ‘Many others who have seen it tout the brilliant filmmaking but are a bit embarrassed by the story and more importantly did not ""enjoy"" watching it. ‘My point is.... is this the story American cultural bell ringers want to send around the world as the ""best story"" in the best picture?’ Two members of the voting panel later admitted to not watching 12 Years A Slave, giving some credence to the claims. But in another twist, by January last year Siegal had changed her tune and organised a lunch for the film, photos of which are still on her website. She was also wrong about the film and 12 Years A Slave did win the Best Picture Oscar. The tranche of emails were stolen last year by group calling itself Guardians of Peace, though it later emerged that it was the work of North Korea in response to the release of the Sony film: ‘The Interview’, a parody about the secretive communist nation. When North Korea threatened to carry out further attacks at screenings Sony cancelled the opening but changed its mind after pressure from the White House. She said that  McQueen would not win as the Academy did not want such a dark message about the US to be ‘sent around the world’. The details were included in a database of 30,287 documents and 173,132 emails that was uploaded to the WikiLeaks website after hackers stole them from Sony Pictures Entertainment . The film eventually came out on limited release in December and on the Internet at the same time. But by then the damage to Sony’s reputation was already done. Among the new revelations is that there will be a Hollywood movie of Dr Who - but not for a few years. An email sent in January last year from Andrea Wong, president of International Production for Sony, to the company’s chief executive Michael Lynton explains the plans. Wong writes that she has spoken to Danny Cohen, the Director of BBC Television and that negotiations are underway. The email says: ‘He said that while there has been tremendous interest (and pressure from BBCWW) (BBC Worldwide) to do a Dr Who film, the show runners feel very clear that they don’t want to do one at this moment. ‘That said, over the course of the coming months, the show running team is coming up with an 8 year timeline for the brand – laying out all that will happen with it. ‘He says that a film will certainly be a part of that timeline. ‘So the answer is that a film won’t happen in the next year to 18 months, but it is expected that it will happen after that within the 8 year horizon.’ Pascal has already been fired by Sony and is due to formally leave the company next month to set up her own production company. She has apologised over the affair and in a statement said that the emails were ‘insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am’. Among the revelations previously made public was that Pascal called Leonardo DiCaprio ‘despicable’ after he refused to star in a Steve Jobs biopic. Renowned Hollywood producer Scott Rudin complained about Angelina Jolie’s ‘insanity and rampaging ego’ and called her a ‘minimally talented spoiled brat’. There were also racially insensitive emails between Pascal and Rudin joking that President Obama’s favorite films are black-themed movies like Django Unchained and 12 Years a Slave. Victorious: The film went on to win the award in 2014. The cast is pictured behind McQueen as he makes his speech . Discussing an upcoming fundraiser for the president, Rudin wrote: “Would he like to finance some movies?’ Pascal wrote back: ‘I doubt it. Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?’ It also emerged that Jennifer Lawrence got paid less than her male co-stars in American Hustle. An early script for the forthcoming James Bond film was made public too along with celebrities’ personal information including Social Security numbers. The Sony statement said: ‘The cyber-attack on Sony Pictures was a malicious criminal act, and we strongly condemn the indexing of stolen employee and other private and privileged information on WikiLeaks. ‘The attackers used the dissemination of stolen information to try to harm Sony Pictures Entertainment and its employees, and now WikiLeaks regrettably is assisting them in that effort. ‘We vehemently disagree with WikiLeaks’ assertion that this material belongs in the public domain and will continue to fight for the safety, security, and privacy of our company and its more than 6,000 employees’.","Peggy Siegal said panel did not want British director Steve McQueen to win .

"British scientists are developing a treatment which could significantly boost patients’ ability to fight off cancer, they revealed last night. A team led by Imperial College London has already applied to patent the therapy, which they say could be ready for human trials within three years. The scientists discovered a protein which helps boost the body’s immune system ten-fold, an astonishing effect which could help patients fight off cancers and viruses. The protein promotes the production of immune cells called cytotoxic T-cells, which have the ability to detect cancerous cells, hunt them down, and destroy them . The protein promotes the production of immune cells called cytotoxic T-cells, which have the ability to detect cancerous cells, hunt them down, and destroy them. In a chance discovery in mice, it was found that a previously unknown protein - which they named the lymphocyte expansion molecule or LEM - dramatically boosted the body’s number of T-cells. They are now developing a gene therapy that would boost the production of LEM proteins, in turn increasing the number of T-cells available to attack cancer cells. The therapy, revealed in the international journal Science last night, would use the existing T-cells taken from individual patients. The patient’s cells would be removed, modified with the insertion of LEM-producing genes, and then infused back into the patients via a drip, probably on four occasions over two months. It might also be used to treat other viruses, they said. The development, which also involved researchers from Queen Mary University of London, ETH Zurich in Switzerland and Harvard Medical School in the US, has already been six years in the making. Cytotoxic T-cells are an important component of the immune system, but when faced with serious infections or advanced cancer, they are usually unable to mobilise in large enough quantities to fight the disease. In a chance discovery in mice, it was found that a previously unknown protein - which they named the lymphocyte expansion molecule or LEM - dramatically boosted the body’s number of T-cells . By screening mice with genetic mutations, the Imperial team discovered a strain of mice that produced ten times as many cytotoxic T-cells when infected with a virus, compared with normal mice. The discovery was unexpected because the new protein had no known function and resembles no other protein known to science. But the mice suppressed infections more effectively and were far more resistant to cancer. They also produced more of a second type of T-cells, memory cells, enabling them to recognise infections they have encountered previously and launch a rapid response. In further experiments the scientists went on to show that the LEM molecule had a similar impact on the human immune system. A team led by Imperial College London (pictured) has already applied to patent the therapy, which they say could be ready for human trials within three years . Study leader Professor Philip Ashton-Rickardt of Imperial College, said: ‘Cancer cells have ways to suppress T-cell activity, helping them to escape the immune system. ‘Genetically engineering T cells to augment their ability to fight cancer has been a goal for some time and techniques for modifying them already exist. ‘By introducing an active version of the LEM gene into the T-cells of cancer patients, we hope we can provide a robust treatment for patients. ‘Next we will test the therapy in mice, make sure it is safe and see if it can be combined with other therapies. The treatment would be relatively expensive because it would effectively be personalised each time, relying on an extraction of the patient’s own cells . ‘If all goes well, we hope to be ready to carry out human trials in about three years.’ He said gene therapy would initially be used to treat patients with advanced cancer. The treatment would be relatively expensive because it would effectively be personalised each time, relying on an extraction of the patient’s own cells. But he insisted the cost would be manageable, given the significant benefits it could bring. Imperial College has already filed two patents for the technology, and a spin-off company called ImmunarT has been formed with the aim of commercialising the therapy. Dr Mike Turner of the Wellcome Trust, which helped fund the research, said: ‘The discovery of a protein that could boost the immune response to not only cancer, but also to viruses, is a fascinating one. ‘Further investigation in animal models is needed before human trials can commence, but there is potential for a new type of treatment that capitalises on the immune system’s innate ability to detect and kill abnormal cells.’","Treatment developed by British team could boost ability to fight cancer .

"Police in Florida are investigating a possible road rage incident after a woman filmed a man throwing a bottle of liquid at her vehicle while driving his van. Michelle, a 32-year-old mother who has asked for her surname not to be used, said the white van drove through a red light at about 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday and almost hit her vehicle. She said she followed the man and taped him after he swerved in and out of traffic while speeding on a stretch of road that has two school crossings. Scroll down for video . Cell phone footage recorded by a mom in Jacksonville, Florida, on Tuesday shows a 28-year-old man, Dan Frank, throw a bottle of liquid at her vehicle while he was driving his van . When she pulled up next to the man, he threw the bottle at her car, she told Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. Further down the road, she said, the driver got out of his van in traffic and made rude hand gestures at her. Michelle said she followed him to his nearby home, where he ran inside before coming outside again to confront her. 'I didn't know if he stashed something or was returning with a weapon,' Michelle told ActionNewsJax. She left at that point and met with police at another location. Police have identified the driver as Daniel Robert Frank, 28, who was arrested earlier this month for an unrelated offence. Frank is helping police who are investigating the case as misdemeanor criminal mischief and his attorney says there is more to the case than simply the video footage. A woman named Michelle, right, told police that the white van drove through a red light at about 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday and almost hit her vehicle . 'We feel that Mr. Frank was the victim here and things spiraled out of control,' Lewis Fusco told ActionNewsJax. Fusco said his client went through a yellow light, and that the trailer he was hauling could have crossed the line when the light turned red. 'She then threw some kind of a large object at his front window that put a crack in my client's window,' said Fusco. 'At that point, that's when he became angry and did something that he is not proud of and retaliated as shown in the video.' Frank refused to an on-camera interview, but showed local reporters a dent on the hood and small cracks in the windshield of his vehicle. According to his attorney, Frank had a passenger in the van with him during this attack who has made a written statement corroborating his claims.","A woman named Michelle told police that the white van drove through a red light at about 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday and almost hit her vehicle .

"Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of £20,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers . The Conservatives yesterday returned a donation of £50,000 from a wealthy hotelier who the American authorities once wanted to extradite to face tax fraud charges. Beatrice Tollman, founder of a luxury hotel chain, made her most recent donation of £20,000 to the Tories earlier this month to boost the party's General Election campaign coffers. But last night it emerged that she has previously been charged with conspiracy to evade millions of dollars in tax before the charges were dismissed by a judge. However on the same day in 2008 her husband Stanley Tollman pleaded guilty to tax evasion. Mr Tollman repaid more than 100 million US dollars to America after the couple spent five years fighting off attempts to extradite Mrs Tollman from the UK over claims the South African couple had millions stashed in the Channel Islands. The Tollman's son, Brett, pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 2003 and was sentenced to more than two years in prison, as well as a $3.5 million penalty. The revelation by the Independent newspaper will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe. Last week his party's manifesto pledged to raise £5 billion from clamping down on tax avoidance during the next Parliament. A Conservative spokesman said: 'We were not aware of this issue but in light of these findings we will be returning donations from the Tollmans. Donations from the Tollmans were fully declared and in strict accordance with electoral law.' Since 2011, Mrs Tollman has donated more than £50,000 to the Conservatives. She and her husband were close friends of Margaret Thatcher and were guests of the Reagans at the White House. In his memoirs, her husband said he only pleaded guilty to get the US authorities to leave his family in peace. The revelation  will prove embarrassing for David Cameron, who recently admitted he got angry over aggressive tax avoidance and people who did not pay what they owe . He wrote: 'It was galling to listen to these vast sums of money being referred to as though they were merely numbers and to the fact that I had agreed to hand all this money to the US Government. 'But the future peace and security of the family which this agreement would secure meant that I could see advantage in what I was about to do. But that did not make it right.' A spokesman for Mr and Mrs Tollman told the Independent: 'In so far as Mrs Tollman is concerned you will see she is of good character and was acquitted of all charges.' Responding to Mr Tollman's guilty plea, a spokesman said: 'Stanley Tollman admitted to having failed to report on his US tax return two bank accounts situated outside the US. It was that omission for which he was sentenced to one day's unsupervised probation. 'The reality is that the financial settlement was the only means through which his family were going to be able to get on and lead their lives without being coerced by the Americans.'","Tories returned donation from Beatrice Tollman, founder of hotel chain .

Mr Brockie details in the lawsuit, cited by the Courthouse News Service, how in the months following his son's death, his bandmates allegedly swiped his guitars, artwork, a gold record, tour souvenirs and even his ashes. According to court documents, the surviving members of GWAR hauled the loot to the headquarters of their management company, Slave Pit Inc, and locked it in an office. When William Brockie arrived demanding to have his son's cremains back, the lawsuit alleges that his son's friends forced him to wait outside and then brought him only a small portion of Dave's ashes in a used plastic bag with Discover credit card logo on it. Morbid: William Brockie claims that when he demanded to have his son's ashes back, GWAR members refused to let him inside their offices and  then brought him only a small portion of Dave's ashes in a used plastic bag . The suit accuses the heavy metal band of using Dave Brockie's image without consent on GWAR merchandise and and trying to take over his estate . Defendant: The lawsuit names drummer Brad Roberts, better known by his stage name Jizmak Da Gusha (second right), as the leader of the alleged conspiracy . The lawsuit names drummer Brad Roberts, better known by his stage name, Jizmak Da Gusha, as the leader of the alleged plot to capitalize on Dave Brockie's death by using his name and likeness on T-shirts and other merchandise without authorization. William Brockie also claims in his suit that his son was never paid for taking part in the band's 2014 Far East tour across Asia and Australia . Immediately following Brockie’s passing, the lawsuit contends, GWAR went to work trying to take over his estate and started a charity in his name without his father's consent. Dave Brockie remained a constant in GWAR over the course of its 30-year-history, though it has had a revolving door of members. In 2011, 34-year-old lead guitarist Cory Smoot was found dead on the band's tour bus. Accidental overdose: Richmond, Virginia medical examiners ruled last June that Dave Brockie's cause of death was acute heroin intoxication . The 50-year-old, who went by Oderus Urungus onstage, was found dead in a chair in his Richmond home on March 23, 2014 . GWAR, who described themselves as 'Scumdogs of the Universe', released their 13th album last year and recently toured Australia and Japan. Brockie always appeared on stage as an intergalactic humanoid barbarian with devil horns and a meaty-looking face, carrying a long sword called an 'Unt Lick'. The heavy metal band gained international fame for their outrageous stage show and wild personas, with GWAR members creating their own gory costumes. Their video clips were also a staple of TV show 'Beavis and Butt-Head'. Rawwwr: The Grammy-nominated band GWAR was founded in 1984 and is known for its comically grotesque costumes, stage antics and vulgar lyrics . Top dog: The Richmond, Virginia-based band had a constant revolving cast of demonic characters, but founder and mastermind Brockie was a staple . 'Anyone who has seen GWAR knows it’s an adult comedy rock musical,' Brockie told CBS 6 reporter Mark Holmberg in 2011. Style Weekly reported Brockie was a devoted fan of the Washington Redskins and a World War II buff, who had recently fulfilled his lifelong dreams of visiting Stalingrad and playing shows in Japan.","Dave Brockie, 50, was found dead on March 23, 2014, at his Richmond, Virginia home .

"She was the most hated woman in Britain, loathed for her role in the break-up of the Prince and Princess of Wales' marriage and vilified for everything from her dress sense to her looks. But 10 years on from the sunny April day that saw Camilla Parker-Bowles become the Duchess of Cornwall, things are looking very different for the 67-year-old royal. Indeed, so popular has Camilla become, a recent poll revealed that not only is the Duchess loved by 50 per cent of Britons, 56 per cent credit her with Charles' own increasing popularity. Scroll down for video . Relaxed: The Prince of Wales has cut an increasingly relaxed figure since marrying Camilla . Still in love: An intimate photo released today to mark their 10th wedding anniversary . More to the point, she has also become a much-loved member of the Royal Family, adored by her step-sons William and Harry and noticeably close to her mother-in-law, the Queen. That her relationship with the rest of the Firm is so good is due, in no small part, to her 'charm and charisma', both of which got an appreciative mention from her husband during a recent interview with CNN. The natural warmth she displays during public appearances has helped cement her place in the Royal Family, with courtiers impressed by her knack of creating an instant rapport with members of the public. Most recently, she pulled off a tour of the US with aplomb, charming locals with her approachability and winning admiring headlines at home. Her relaxed approach to life was in evidence once again during last month's Cheltenham Festival where, accosted by ex-glamour model Katie Price in the paddock, she posed obligingly for a selfie. A few minutes later, she was seen engrossed in conversation with author Jilly Cooper, who memorably based the caddish Rupert Campbell-Black, the star of the much-loved Rutshire Chronicles, on Camilla's ex-husband Andrew Parker-Bowles. Sharing a joke: Camilla and Prince William share a joke at the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games . Natural warmth: Camilla's success is due to her charm - on display here during last month's Cheltenham . Involved: Camilla's granddaughter Eliza Lopes was a bridesmaid at the 2011 Royal Wedding . 'She is warm, smiley and sincere,' reveals one Royal insider. 'If you were going to use five words to describe her, they would be funny, down-to-earth, opinionated, family-orientated and hearty.' But Camilla's new-found confidence is hard-won. A salt-of-the-earth countrywoman who, given the opportunity, would happily go make-up free and avoid set-piece events, taking on the very public life of a senior royal hasn't been easy. That she has managed it, apparently without breaking a sweat, hasn't gone unnoticed - not least by Prince Charles himself. 'You can imagine it is a real, real challenge,’ said the prince in the same CNN interview, adding: 'But she's, I think, been brilliant in the way she's tackled these things . insiders say the transformation is less about careful PR work and more about Camilla herself - in particular, the way she has thrown herself into championing the charities closest to her heart. One of the first to benefit was the National Osteoporosis Society, with whom the Duchess has been involved for more than 19 years. 'Throughout our association with the Duchess, she has been unwavering in her support,' says Chief Executive Claire Severgnini. 'She is personable, knowledgeable and compassionate.' All smiles: The Duchess of Cornwall enjoys a chat with the Duchess of Cambridge during the 2012 Jubilee . All together: The Duchess of Cornwall in the family photo released after Prince George's christening . Close: The Duchess of Cornwall now enjoys a close relationship with the Queen . Approval: A clear sign of approval is the regularity with which the Duchess appears alongside the Queen . Shared interests: Both Camilla and the Queen share a passion for all things equestrian . Her interest in osteoporosis comes as no surprise to those who know the Duchess. In 1994, aged 47, she was forced to watch as her 'beloved Mama' Rosalind Shand died, slowly and in agony, as a result of the disease. Indeed, the Camilla's association with the charity pre-dates her marriage, with the Duchess first getting involved while still Mrs Parker-Bowles. Asked to join forces with the charity while at the height of her infamy, biographer Penny Junor writes that she was initially reluctant, fearing she might do more harm than good, before agreeing to get involved. Although her first attempt at fundraising was curtailed by Princess Diana's tragic death, she never stopped supporting the organisation and still gets involved in events. She has also made a name for herself as a champion of women's rights, becoming deeply involved in the UK's rape crisis centres and making a visit to a local women's refuge part of every international tour. While visiting Colombian capital Bogota last November, she cut a sympathetic figure as she chatted to rape victims over a cup of tea at the Memory, Peace and Reconciliation Center. Having a laugh: Camilla, Harry and Kate share a joke on the balcony of Buckingham Palace in June 2013 . Friendly: The Duchess of Cornwall enjoys a friendly relationship with the Duchess of Cambridge . All smiles: The pair were frequently spotted together during the London 2012 Olympic Games . In Washington last month, the Duchess left Prince Charles to his own devices for a couple of hours while she met detectives working for the District of Colombia's Sexual Assault Response Team. Camilla's increasing confidence has also shown itself in the ensembles she wears, with the frumpy get-ups of old swapped for elegant tailored dresses designed to flatter her still-trim waist. Like the Duchess of Cambridge, she's never far from a delicate cream dress and accessorises nearly everything she wears with one of her trademark five-strand pearl chokers. In the country, she likes tailored tweed suits by Roy Allen, one of her favourite couturiers, cosy coats by Swiss label Moncler and flattering hats by London-based milliner, Lock & Co. But as the Duchess of Cornwall prepares to celebrate her 10th wedding anniversary, it is the sea-change in her family life as much as her public image that ought to leave her smiling. Mirror image: The two also share a similar sense of style - including a penchant for nude pumps . Cheers! Meanwhile Camilla's relationship with Prince Charles has gone from strength to strength . Charm: The Prince spoke glowingly of his wife's 'charm and charisma' in an interview last month . Not only is she close to the Queen, who was once reported as wishing she 'would just go away', Camilla is also adored by Diana's sons William and Harry - as photos of the trio laughing together at the opening ceremony of September's Invictus Games made only too clear. 'Having initially loathed her, the Queen gets on well with Camilla now,' adds the insider. 'She isn't as close to the Queen as Sophie [Countess of Wessex] is but that is partly because the Queen's relationship with Charles is a bit complicated anyway.' What certainly isn't complicated is Camilla's relationship with Charles. Despite such quirks  as maintaining separate country homes, after 10 years, the royal couple are closer - and happier - than ever. Born Camilla Rosemary Shand on the 17th July 1947, the Duchess of Cornwall's 67 years have undoubtedly been interesting ones. The daughter of Major Bruce Middleton Hope Shand and his wife Rosalind, the Duchess was born in London but spent much of her childhood in Sussex along with her siblings, Annabel and Mark. According to her biographer Giles Brandreth, her upbringing, although not royal, was certainly a grand one. 'Camilla is often described as having had an ""Enid Blyton sort of Childhood"",' he writes. 'In fact, it was much grander than that. 'The Shands had position and they had help – help in the house, help in the garden, help with children. 'They were gentry. They opened their garden for the local Conservative Party Association summer fête. Enough said.' After a stint at a Swiss finishing school, Camilla burst onto the London social scene as a debutante on the 25th March 1965. But it wasn't all fun, with the future Duchess of Cornwall working as a secretary for a succession of London firms to pay for her Belgravia flat, which she shared with Lady Moyra Campbell. In the late 1960s, Camilla met the man who was to become her first husband, cavalry officer Andrew Parker-Bowles, with the couple dating off and on for several years - with Mr Parker-Bowles striking up a relationship with Princess Anne at one point. Camilla, meanwhile, had struck up a relationship with Prince Charles, who was first introduced to her sometime in 1971. When the couple split following an overseas posting for Charles in 1973, Camilla reconciled with Parker-Bowles and the couple announced their engagement and married the same year. Two children followed. Tom in 1974 and Laura in 1978. But it was her continuing relationship with Prince Charles that would come to define her, with the former couple remaining close friends even after both had married other people. In 1992, claims that the two had remained an item throughout both marriages emerged when Diana: Her True Story was published, followed, a year later by the 'Camillagate' scandal. By 1995, both marriages had come to an end and Charles and Camilla were unofficially back together, with the future Duchess often seen attending events with the prince. Royal acceptance soon followed with the Queen making Camilla part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002. A year later, the Duchess moved into Clarence House and on the 10th February 2005, Charles and Camilla's engagement was announced. The couple married just under two months later in Windsor, with Camilla taking the title of the Duchess of Cornwall.","Camilla is now one of the most popular members of the Royal Family .

He said detectives from the homicide squad and the sex crime squad are 'vigorously perusing that line of inquiry and this investigation is moving at a very fast pace.' 'We are perusing every lead that we get,' Detective Willing said. The news comes as the parents of the missing toddler have begged for his return in a heart-wrenching video made seven months after he vanished from his home on the NSW mid-north coast.

Investigators believe he was snatched during a very short window of time when he was out of sight of his family as he played outside. Legal restrictions have prevented William's parents from speaking publicly throughout the ordeal, and their identities are not revealed in the video. The home videos of William were released on Friday. William's father choked back tears as he remembered his son, who was infatuated with the Spider-Man superhero. '(He loved) anything that related to Spider-Man and superheroes,' William's father said in the video. 'He's a cheeky, vibrant little boy ... full of energy. I mean he's my little boy.'

She said the family was struggling with not knowing where William is or what happened to him. 'We need to know what happened to him ... `cause we can't live forever ... like this.' She said she hoped whoever had him was looking after him. 'I want him to be safe, I want him to be feeling loved and I want someone to be looking after him because to imagine that something else is going on ... we can't live like that.'

Police searched the 63-year-old's home and business in nearby Laurieton in January, seizing various items, including cars, a mattress and computer, for forensic examination.

"David Cameron has called on people to 'feel proud to say this is a Christian country', in his annual Easter message. As the election campaign slowed to mark the Easter weekend, the Prime Minister hailed the work of the Church and condemned the persecution of Christians following the massacre in  Kenya. Mr Cameron's praise for the Church comes after he criticised bishops  for a controversial election letter calling for a 'fresh moral vision of the kind of country we want to be' which was widely seen as an attack on the Coalition's welfare cuts. Scroll down for video . David Cameron feeds orphaned lambs on Dean Lane farm near the village of Chadlington in the Cotswolds . Mr Cameron took a break from the campaign trail to visit the orphaned lambs in the nearby farm in his constituency . Mr Cameron was taken t visit the lambs with farmer Julian Tustian at Dean Lane farm just outside the village of Chadlington . The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, has condemned certain welfare reforms as part of  a series of interventions by church leaders raising concerns about the shape of the economy. In his video message the Prime Minister, who has defended the right of the Church to intervene in political debate, said Easter was ' time to reflect on the part that Christianity plays in our national life'. 'The Church is not just a collection of beautiful old buildings;  it is a living, active force doing great works across our country,' he said. 'When people are homeless, the Church is there with hot meals and shelter.  When people are addicted or in debt; when people are suffering, or grieving - the Church is there.' 'Across Britain, Christians don't just talk about 'loving thy neighbour', they live it out ...  in faith schools, in prisons, in community groups. 'And it's for all these reasons that we should feel proud to say: this is a Christian country. 'Yes, we are a nation that embraces, welcomes and accepts all faiths and none  but we are still a Christian country.' Prime Minister David Cameron said Easter was 'time to reflect on the part that Christianity plays' in the UK . The PM, whose severely disabled son Ivan died in 2009, said that he knew ' from the most difficult times in my own life, that the kindness of the church can be a huge comfort'. The slaughter at Garissa University College in Kenya, where al Qaida-affiliated al-Shabab gunmen specifically sought out and killed Christian students, has been condemned by the Pope and other leaders as they mark Easter. 'We have a duty to speak out about the persecution of Christians around the world too,' Mr Cameron said. 'It is truly shocking to know that in 2015, there are still Christians being threatened, tortured - even killed - because of their faith... 'I n the coming months, we must continue to speak as one voice for freedom of belief. 'So this Easter, we should keep in our thoughts all those Christians facing persecution abroad  and give thanks for all those Christians who are making a real difference here at home.' Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said: ' While politicians in the UK are busy on the campaign trail, we must not forget the cruel and barbaric killings that took place in Kenya. 'The thoughts of people here are very much with the families and friends of the murdered students in Garissa University.' Mr Cameron and his wife  attended an Easter Sunday service at St Nicholas church in  Chadlington, near Chipping Norton . The Prime Minister has hailed the Church as a 'living active force doing great works' for the poor and homeless . Labour leader Ed Miliband said 'fear and uncertainty' were issues for Christians both in the UK and abroad. 'In the midst of the Easter celebrations our hearts go out to those who face difficult times both overseas and closer to home. My thoughts are particularly with Christians in Syria, Iraq and other countries where the church suffers terrible persecution,' he wrote in a post on Facebook. 'According to the International Society for Human Rights, Christians are the victims of 80% of all acts of religious discrimination in the world today. We must all do everything we can to speak out against this evil and work to alleviate the suffering of those who are persecuted simply for their creed. 'But we don't need to travel far to find families facing fear and uncertainty. Over two million children are now living in poverty in the UK. I have admiration for those church members and Christian charities that provide support and hope to those in need. 'Over the Easter weekend millions of Christians will attend Easter services and events up and down the country. Through such gatherings, the Church shares the story of the resurrection, and spreads the good news of Easter. 'In the months to come I hope that we will all stand up for justice, serve the most vulnerable and work to positively transform our communities together.'","Prime Minister hailed charity work of the Church across the country .

"Abandoned, rusting and desolate, the hulking remnants of these old bangers have been claimed by nature. German photographer Dieter Klein travelled the world to find vintage cars left to crumble in leafy forests and fields. He came across a range of mysterious graveyards hosting all sorts of vehicles, including a rare Jaguar XK120, which, if restored, could be worth £82,000, and a fleet of vehicles used by the Allies in the Second World War. Many of the cars, often with doors, tires or windows missing, are parked on forest floors where nature has taken them over. Dieter, 57, from Cologne, first came across a Citroen truck that had been dumped in a bush six years ago. After witnessing how the foliage had grown in and around the man-made machine, he was hooked and began to track down other unusual resting places.

Dieter said: 'In Belgium I came across a place with about 250 cars, untouched in a little wood. The cars have rusted over time and the paintwork has dulled . 'The place was founded by the Allies after WW2. They left these cars in a little wood, but they did not take them when they went back home.' 'Other graveyards are not as rich in history but make for eerie and stunning places to explore. 'While in many cases I cannot retrace the history of the vessels, some sites are more discernible and conspicuous than others. 'In Sweden, for instance, I visited a car yard where vehicles had been disassembled during the 1950s. 'Because the site stood a mere two miles from Norwegian border, the car parts were then taken piece-by-piece over into the neighbouring country, where the importation of whole cars was forbidden. 'The automobiles were reassembled - this was not prohibited. Only 30 miles from my hometown, Cologne, I discovered a special collection. 'A car dealer had a funny idea. When he turned 50 in 2000 he arranged 50 cars from 1950 as a sculpture park in his garden and made a big party. 'Some friends got really angry when they saw, for instance, an extraordinary Jaguar XK120 left alone on purpose. 'In restored condition this car could fetch $120,000 (£82,000).'

"The Australian descendants of eight ANZAC veterans have proudly showed off their relatives' wartime medals and photographs in a moving commemorative photo series. Photographer Mark Kolbe travelled around Australia to meet the grandchildren, great-grandchildren, sons and daughters of just some of the brave members of the Australian armed forces who landed in Gallipoli nearly 100 years ago. Amongst the keepsakes held by the relatives are letters sent by soldiers informing their loved ones of their discharge from the Australian Imperial Force, while black and white photos show the servicemen on horseback and playing with their army football teams. The soldiers' medals remain glistening inside their descendants' homes after a century of being treasured. Jan Gardner (left) the granddaughter of Sergeant W.S.

"The Earth experienced its hottest month of March since record-keeping began in 1880. There's been no break from the globe's record heat - the first three months of 2015 have all set new high temperature marks. Last month's average temperature soared to 56.4°F (13.6°C), which is 1.5°F (0.85°C) above the average for the 20th century. Last month's average temperature of 56.4°F (13.6°C) was the hottest March on record, averaging 1.5°F (0.85°C) above the average for the 20th century. This was the highest for March in the 1880–2015 record, surpassing the previous record of 2010 by 0.09°F (0.05°C). Pictured is how the high temperatures affected different regions of the world . The data, released today by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) takes into account global averages across land and sea surfaces. It follows earlier announcements from US government scientists that 2014 was the hottest year in modern history. Scientists warn that fossil fuel burning is pushing more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, leading to increased temperatures, melting of polar ice and glaciers, and rising seas. 'This was the highest for March in the 1880-2015 record, surpassing the previous record of 2010 by 0.09°F (0.05°C),' said the report. The warmth was spread fairly evenly across the hemispheres. Most land areas were warmer to much warmer than average, as shown by the Temperature Percentiles map on the right, with record warmth in parts of the western United States and Canada, various regions in eastern Africa, parts of Scandinavia and northwestern Russia, part of south central China, and an area of northeastern Australia . NOAA scientist Jessica Blunden blames the heat on El Niño and climate change. El Niño is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the Pacific Ocean. Usually the wind blows strongly from east to west, due to the rotation of the Earth, causing water to pile up in the western part of the Pacific. This pulls up colder water from the deep ocean in the eastern Pacific. However, in an El Niño, the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east. This causes the eastern Pacific to get warmer. But as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents, this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer, meaning the El Niño grows. This change in air and ocean currents around the equator can have a major impact on the weather patterns around the globe by creating pressure anomalies in the atmosphere. Last month, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance El Niño will continue through the summer. For the first three months of the year, the average temperature worldwide was 1.48°F (0.82°C) above the 20th-century average. That marked the highest ever recorded for that period, surpassing the previous record in 2002 by 0.09°F (0.05°C). Also of concern was the finding that Arctic sea ice was the lowest on record for March. 'The average Arctic sea ice extent for March was 430,000 square miles (7.2 percent) below the 1981–2010 average,' said the report. 'This was the smallest March extent since records began in 1979.' NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden said 2015 probably will break 2014's hottest year mark if conditions persist. The first three months of 2015 were nearly a tenth of a degree higher than the old record and four-tenths of a degree warmer than January through March of last year. Much of the most abnormal heat has been in the Pacific Ocean and places near it. Seven western U.S. states set records for their hottest first three months of the year, while New York and Vermont set records for the coldest start of a year. The northeastern United States has been one of the few colder-than-normal spots on the globe with entire continents of Asia, Europe, Africa and Australia coming in solidly warmer than normal. Blunden blames the record heat on a combination of El Niño, a blob of record hot water in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and human-caused climate change. Last month, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance El Niño will continue through the summer. Some meteorologists, however, have warned that this El Niño could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the Pacific Ocean called the Pacific Decadal Osciallation (PDO). The PDO reached record levels in December last year and January this year, and should it stay strong, it may combine with El Niño to increase global temperatures. The maps below represent rainfall per cent of normal (left, using a base period of 1961–1990) and precipitation (right, using the period of record). As is typical, precipitation anomalies during March 2015 varied significantly around the world . Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Centre, said: 'Based on the persistent observations of above-average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial Pacific Ocean and consistent pattern of sea level pressure, we can now say that El Niño is here. 'Many climate prediction models show this weak El Niño continuing into summer.' The arrival of this El Niño is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year, but the conditions failed to materialise. El Niño is one of the most powerful climate altering phenonoma on the planet. It is the result of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the Pacific Ocean. This cycle occurs at intervals of between two to seven years and can last for nine months to two years. When the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months, the NOAA officially classes it as El Niño conditions. Record warm temperatures continued to dominate in the northeast Pacific Ocean and were also notable in the southwest Pacific and parts of the Arctic Seas to the north and northwest of Scandinavia. This graph shos the March average surface temperatures on ocean and land .","World experience average temperatures of 56.4°F (13.6°C) last month - 1.5°F above average for the 20th century .

"Jameela spent £3,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you'd expect of a television presenter and former model. Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. 'From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. 'My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted. Occasionally, I would even faint. There were days when I'd arrive at work and the make-up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible.' After several months of this, she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests. Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. In fact, the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury. After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out, it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she'd had as a child. So she spent £3,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years, and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain. Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper. Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together. Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system, causing muscle tremors. Long-term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys. But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. 'In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury,' he says. Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour. This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine. Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . But the amounts taken in from fillings is 'minuscule', says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins. Indeed, a review by the EU Commission's Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam, says Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser. Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health, adds Professor Walmsley. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out. This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases. A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition. But fillings aren't the only source of mercury. It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people. However, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. That's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish and marlin. Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium-sized cans a week. And yet dental amalgam (pictured, posed by model) is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk . But Jameela doesn't eat fish, so knew the mercury levels couldn't be due to her diet. She's allergic to peanuts, shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten, found in wheat, barley and rye. Following blood tests, it was discovered that she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. 'All I could think of was I had to get rid of them,' says Jameela. But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed, they continued to affect her over the next few years. 'I hated the fatigue, the headaches, the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time,' Jameela says. 'I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop, but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. 'I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system.' Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they're concerned about the potential health issues. But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this. 'Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe, every time a dentist drills a tooth, they remove a little dental tissue. So you are essentially damaging the tooth,' he says. The number of fillings in the average adult's mouth . Still struggling, Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day. These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it. She did this for two years, and tried various diets to tackle the 'inflammation' linked to the mercury that was making her ill. 'For my 25th birthday, my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it - cake was out of the question,' she says. 'It took about a year before I started to feel better. It's all had a massive impact on my life.' However, Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London, is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way. 'You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected,' he says. 'Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings. 'In fact, I see patients whose gut symptoms, ironically, seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems, when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders.' But Jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems. 'There is so much we don't know about amalgam fillings. I know I feel much better now,' she says. Private clinics offer mercury testing. But Dr Mahendra says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic's laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation (CPA) to ensure that the tests are carried out properly. Jameela is supporting Allergy UK to raise awareness of food allergies and is ambassador for Holland & Barrett’s Free From range .","Jameela Jamil, 29, is convinced dental work triggered health problems .

"They are already talented actresses, one a Hollywood star. But now Aussies Rose Byrne and Gracie Otto are about to add another string to their bow. The Bridesmaids star and daughter of famed Australian actor Barry Otto have, along with fellow actress Krey Boylan, film director Shannon Murphy and PR maven Jessica Carrerea, have launched their very own all female film production company called The Doll House Collective . Byrne believes, in an age where Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Arianna Huffington of Huffington Post and Marissa Mayer of Yahoo dominating powerful positions, it's about time they become strong, female leaders in film. Dolled up: Rose Byrne and Gracie Otto have joined up in new film-making collaboration 'The Doll House' Byrne says when Bridesmaids came out, people's first reaction was to be surprised that women could be so funny. Her hope down the track is that they can bring more gender equality in. 'I'd love to get to a day when  people didn't say 'Wow, we didn't know women were so funny' and we have to be like, 'What? We're not a group of dolphins!' Byrne said in an interview with Vogue Australia. Byrne believes Sheryl Sandberg is a pioneer for women, and said the speech she gave in a TED talk about  the benefits of having women in companies was inspirational. Film feminism: The five Australian women want to bring a female body to the film-making industry . Referencing Sandberg, Byrne said it is not only better for your home life, sex life and for the company to have woman in positions of power, both in terms of decision-making, collaborating or delegating. 'Cate Blanchett put it so beautifully in her Oscar's speech about women being consumers - women want to see women doing stunts - there is a market for that!' The quintet will collaborate together on films, share ideas and creative advice, and even provide financial support to each other's projects. Powerful people: Rose Byrne wants new production company to follow in feminist foot steps of Arianna Huffington (left) and Sheryl Sandberg (right) The women liken it to the female equivalent of Blue-Tongue Films, four men who have collaborated to produce a film-making company. Instead of there being only one actor, one director, if they are working on a short film, they all look out for each other, says Otto, so that is there hope for The Doll House. According to Boylan, they were all supporting each other anyway, so they thought it was time they made it official. Fierce and funny: Referencing Bridesmaids,  Byrne says women  can be funny and intelligent, not just dolphins . And the ball is already rolling, with Byrne set to be the executive producer in Boylan's next film project 'Seriously Red.' 'I've never done anything in a producer capacity before but have long had the desire...It can be a lonely business, especially as an actor. 'And I'm tired of talking about how it's lonely instead of taking the reigns and producing and creating my own work,' said Byrne. In vogue: 'The Doll House Collective' girls feature in exclusive May issue of Vogue Australia . And with their collective talents combined, these leading Australian women are a force to be reckoned with. Otto says with all their own established work and contacts internationally, they will definitely be taken seriously.

"An alcohol-fuelled 14-year-old boy killed a father-of-two in an unprovoked street attack after wishing him 'Happy New Year'. Kyle Major, from Blackpool, Lancashire, followed his victim - who had just asked his group of friends for directions - and felled him from behind with a punch to the back of the head. Paul Walker, 52, was thought to be unconscious before his chin hit the ground and died shortly afterwards in hospital. Kyle Major, 14, punched father-of-two Paul Walker (right) in the back of the head after wishing him a happy New Year. The court heard the boy had been 'allowed to run wild' The court heard how he had been found face down in a pool of blood by a passerby in the early hours of New Year’s Day this year, and that his hands were still in his pockets when paramedics arrived. Sentenced at Preston Crown Court today, Major, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter at an earlier hearing, was ordered to be detained for three years. The Recorder of Preston, Judge Anthony Russell QC, lifted reporting restrictions on naming the juvenile following an application that the public interest in identifying him outweighed the child’s welfare. Teenager Kyle Major cowardly killed father of two Paul Walker in the early hours of New Year's Day . Major followed his victim who had just asked his group of friends for directions and felled him from behind with a single punch to the back of the head. The court heard that Mr Walker, described by his family as 'a lovely man with a big heart', had lost his way in the resort after leaving his sister’s New Year’s Eve party 'in good spirits'. He came across a group of youths in the street in Sutton Place who told him where he was, including Major who was heard to wish him 'Happy New Year'. Moments later the defendant and a male friend followed Mr Walker. Major ran off after felling Mr Walker and later texted another friend: 'I’m scared. Don’t want to go to jail. Two/four years. Don’t say anything.' He initially denied any involvement in the attack when arrested. Mr Walker was described by his family in the court room as a 'lovely man with a big heart' The court heard that Major, of Devonshire Road, had consumed six bottles of Budweiser lager and a quarter of a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey on the night. He regularly drank to excess and was also an habitual user of cannabis. The teenager already had seven previous convictions for non-violent offences such as burglary and theft. Major consumed six bottles of Budweiser lager and a quarter of a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey on the night . Major regularly drank to excess, smoked cannabis, was in foster care and had seven previous convictions . He had been under the supervision of a youth offending team since December 2013 following various court orders but his response was said to have been “poor” and he was described in reports as acting in 'a reckless and carefree manner' with no regard to the consequences to himself or others. Currently in foster care, Major’s parenting was said to be 'out-of-control'. Judge Russell said that Mr Walker had been 'vulnerable' and possibly unsteady on his feet. 'The blow was of significant force to knock a large man down. You had no thought for what you were doing at the time. 'You have a criminal record and you have shown until this matter came to light no inclination to mend your ways or respond positively. 'You were responsible for the loss of this decent man, a loss for which the family will never recover. Your upbringing has been unfortunate and you have been allowed to run wild.'","Kyle Major killed Paul Walker with a single punch to the back of his head .

"In the past year solar power in the UK has more than doubled while in the US it has grown by 30 per cent. But many current systems fail to solve the problem of how energy is managed and used overnight when the sun sets. Traditionally, energy gathered during the day is sent back to the grid, but this can prove costly if you need to buy it back - unless you have a smart battery that stores the excess energy in your home. Sonnenspeicher (pictured) uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store energy harnessed by solar panels. This energy can be used throughout the day, and any excess is stored for when the sun goes down. Rather than selling this excess electricity back to the grid, homeowners can then use their stored supply for power . With this in mind, German firm Automatic Storage Device (ASD) and designer Wolfram Walter have created the Sonnenspeicher. It uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store the energy harvested during the day by solar panels fitted to a roof. This energy is used throughout the day, and any excess is stored for when the sun goes down. Rather than selling this excess electricity to the grid, and potentially having to buy it back at a later date or time, homeowners can use this stored supply to power their home until the sun rises again. Sonnenspeicher features an intelligent management system that automatically controls the charging and discharging current, to make it easier to manage how much energy is being used. Sonnenspeicher features an intelligent management system that automatically controls the charging and discharging current, to make it easier to manage how much energy is being used. It additionally has a Sleep mode that ensures the storage system never runs low and will automatically go into standby when not in use . Although it is designed to be completely independent of the national power grid, it can equally be wired up in the case of emergency. For example, whenever there is energy in the battery available, the connection to the grid is locked.

Sonnenspeicher features an intelligent management system that automatically controls the charging and discharging current, to make it easier to manage how much energy is being used. It additionally has a Sleep mode that ensures that the storage system never runs low and will automatically go into standby when its not being used to increase efficiency. The system comes in different sizes ranging from the Sonnenspeicher 300, which is 4.8 kWh, to the Sonnenspeicher 600 at 8.06 kWh up to the 1000 model which offers 13.44 kWh. Prices start at €8,450 (£6,170). It additionally has a Sleep mode that ensures the storage system never runs low, and will automatically go into standby when its not being used to increase efficiency. And although it is designed to be completely independent of the national power grid, it can equally be wired up in the case of emergency. For example, whenever there is energy in the battery available, the connection to the grid is locked. When this energy runs out, the Sonnenspeicher connects to the grid 'in a millisecond'. This switchover works the other way too. If a home is predominantly powered by the grid, the Sonnenspeicher will still store energy and instead act like a generator during a power cut. 'We wanted to create a storage system that makes you truly independent of the national power grid, that adequately supplies all of your household appliances at all times, and that remains efficient and trouble-free for at least 20 years, so that you can have the peace of mind that your investment really is worth every penny,' said the firm. The system comes in different sizes ranging from the Sonnenspeicher 300, which is 4.8 kWh, to the Sonnenspeicher 600 at 8.06 kWh up to the 1000 model which offers 13.44 kWh. Prices start at €8,450 (£6,170). The firm said an average home can save around €1,200 a year (£876), so it would still take around seven years to recoup the costs, but the system will last for 20 years.","Sonnenspeicher was designed by Wolfram Walter and German firm ASD .

"In cities that are as well-known for their burgeoning fashion scene as they are their must-see monuments and ever-evolving culture, it's perhaps no surprise that hotel staff are as well-dressed as their chic visitors. The Park Hyatt New York, for example, recently hired First Lady Michelle Obama's favourite designer, Narcisco Rodriguez, to re-design the staff's uniforms. While the Shangri La Hotel in Toronto opted for local designer, Sunny Fong, when overhauling their lobby lounge dresses and champagne room uniforms. The result was a sleek, sophisticated style, inspired by the Asian artwork in the property's common spaces. And that's just the beginning. MailOnline Travel looks at most well-dressed hotel staffs around the world. JW Marriott Houston Downtown hired American designer, David Peck, for its recent uniform overhaul .

The Houston-based designer first launched his own line at age 21 and quickly became known for his classic shapes, structured pieces and tailored silhouettes. A first of its kind collaboration, Peck and Marriott took inspiration from the city's 104-year-old skyscraper, as well as the local Houston aesthetic in designing the ready-to-wear pieces. Evoking an East Coast high-society sensibility, the designs rely heavily on fair-trade tweed, sharp suits, and accessories, such as bowties.

"A four-year-old boy has returned home after being mauled by their family's newly adopted pit bull. Gavin Tobeck of Lacey, Washington suffered from a broken cheekbone, jaw and nose bridge, and needed sections of a rib to repair his eye sockets after the attack by their dog Smash on April 1. The boy also lost five baby teeth and three permanent tooth buds. In an effort to save her son, 29-year-old Alissa Evans' friend threw hot coffee on the dog which led to the animal releasing his grip on Gavin. Doctors thought that the young boy would not make it, but after spending six days at Harborview Medical Center, he was released late on Tuesday and has begun returning to a normal life, according to KOMO News. Following a ten-day quarantine to check for rabies, Smash is scheduled to be euthanized by Thurston County Animal Service on Saturday at the Tobecks' request. Scroll down for video . Gavin Tobeck (pictured left with his mom Alissa Evans) was left with a broken cheekbone, jaw and nose bridge, in addition to needing sections of a rib to repair his eye sockets after the attack . The family had adopted the pit bull Smash from friend of their neighbor on March 16 and said there were no previous signs of aggression (above Smash and Gavin) Following the attack earlier this month, Gavin told KOMO: 'He ate me.' His mother said that they both were lucky. Evans said: 'I got lucky, he got lucky. He still has his lips, he still has his eyes. He has five teeth.' 'He is a walking miracle,' she added. 'If it was one millimeter to the left he would have died instantly.' The Tobecks had adopted the one-and-a-half-year-old puppy on March 16 from a friend of their neighbor, according to the Olympian. Evans said there were no previous signs of aggression from Smash. 'I hate to see him put down, but I would not trust that dog,' said Evans. 'I wouldn't trust him with an adult no matter what people say.' Gavin and Smash were playing in the backyard when the dog attacked the child. His mother tried to stop the animal but he bit her and then pushed her to the ground before going for the boy, she said. Gavin was hospitalized at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle for six days following the attack on April 1 and was released late on Tuesday . Following a ten-day quarantine to check for rabies, Smash is scheduled to be euthanized by Thurston County Animal Service on Saturday at the family's request . Once her friend was able to get the dog to stop, they called the police. 'It was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my entire life,' Evans said. 'I literally thought that my son...I was watching him die.' Since Gavin's release from hospital, he has been reunited at home with his sister Serenity, six, and brother David, seven. His mother has also made a point to cover the mirrors in her apartment to keep Gavin from seeing the injuries on his face. Evans has also started a GoFundMe page to help raise money to replace his baby teeth, as she said his insurance will not cover all of the repairs because he can eat soft food. She wrote on the page that she wants nothing more than for Gavin to grow up as normal as possible following the tragic experience. 'I appreciate all of the people who have help support Gavin in his road to recovery,' she wrote on the GoFundMe page. Evans said her son is a 'walking miracle' and that they are both lucky following the attack . 'I want everyone to know that everything that has been donated on this site is strictly for Gavin. 'If the dental work is done at no cost then it will be put in a savings account to later be used on the permanent teeth or it will be kept there for when he turns 18 and he can do what he wants with it. 'I want to make it clear that this site was created for Gavin and it will be used solely on him. 'I know a lot of people are concerned that this is a publicity stunt but it has never been about that and will never be about that.' As of Saturday, the GoFundMe page had raised $1,360 in donations out of a $10,000 goal. No charges will be filed against the previous owner of Smash since Evans said the dog showed no earlier signs of aggression, according to KOMO.","Gavin Tobeck of Washington was attacked by one-and-a-half-year-old Smash while in his backyard on April 1; he was released late on Tuesday .

"Arrested: Doug Hughes (photographed) was arrested after landing his gyrocopter on the U.S. Capitol lawn to protest campaign finance laws . The wife of a Florida postal worker who landed a gyrocopter on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol to protest campaign finance laws says her husband is a patriot. After more than two years of planning, 61-year-old Doug Hughes made it through restricted airspace and a no-fly zone in a gyrocopter Wednesday carrying 535 letters -- one for each member of Congress -- and landed the aircraft on the Capitol lawn. Although Hughes was promptly arrested for the stunt and charged Thursday with violating restricted airspace and operating an unregistered aircraft, Hughes' wife Alena says she is proud of her husband. 'From the public point of view this is very brave,' Alena told WFLA. 'I think he's patriot and I'm proud of him.'

"Three reportedly inexperienced abalone divers died after jumping into rough seas off the coast of northern California on Sunday. The men were part of a group of five divers from the East Coast and San Francisco. Ten friends, including the dead men, had rented a house on Caspar Cove 160 miles north of San Francisco to hunt for abalone, a rare and expensive mollusk that is prized as a delicacy. The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reports that the accident in Mendocino County is the deadliest single incident involving abalone divers in recent memory. Witnesses said at least some of the men appeared to be inexperienced abalone divers who chose rough, choppy waters near several dangerous rock outcroppings to dive - instead of entering the water at the soft beach nearby. Abalone is a prized delicacy that sells for up to $70 per pound. The annual abalone season brings divers out into the rough waters of northern California (stock image) The three men died after diving into rough waters off of rocky coastline in Mendocino County, California, on Sunday in search of abalone (stock imagine of abalone diver) Firefighters said the men dove into water in Caspar Cove and found themselves immediately in trouble. An off-duty firefighter who happened to be fishing nearby spotted the men and called for help. The three men who drowned were overcome by the churning water and crushed against the sharp rocks on shore. Rescuers managed to pull the two survivors and one of the dead men from the water immediately after arriving on scene. A Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office helicopter plucked the second victim from the sea and brought him to shore. Ten friends from the East Coast and San Francisco rented a house on Caspar Cove to dive for abalone, locals said. Five of them went out on Sunday - three died . Firefighters performed CPR on the two drowned men on the beach as his horrified friends watched - but both were pronounced dead on Sunday afternoon. The third man's body was found after a five-hour search that involved aircraft and boats from several fire departments and sheriff's offices, as well as the US Coast Guard. He was smashed against rocks in a cove, which required rescuers to hoist his body up the cliff with a winch because they couldn't get to him by water. Local authorities say the abalone season, which started April 1, is always marred by several rescues and often a few death. Abalone, a snail-like mollusk with a beautiful shiny shell, sells for up to $70 a pound.","Three victims were part of a group of ten friends from San Francisco and the East Coast who were staying in Mendocino County to hunt for abalone .

"A 19-year-old model in California has taken to bathing in pig's blood in a desperate – and bizarre – attempt to maintain her youthful appearance – despite the fact that she is a vegetarian. In the latest episode of MTV's True Life, entitled 'I'm Obsessed With Staying Young', freelance model Chanel details her unique skincare method, which she tries to justify by claiming that 'thousands of years ago people did this and it worked'. 'My greatest fear is getting old and developing wrinkles and extra loose skin,' Chanel says. 'So to prevent that from happening I must do whatever it takes.' Scroll down for video . Model of insecurity: 19-year-old Chanel says she is terrified that the effects of aging will stop her modelling career in its tracks . 'I can't stop': Chanel (L) picks up the blood from a local butcher . Chanel insists that, despite her young age, she is already starting to show signs of aging, which she is convinced will soon put a stop to her modeling career altogether. Her desperation to remain looking as young as possible for as long as possible has driven Chanel to a number of extraordinary lengths, most notably covering her body in animal blood , a process she insists will 'keep the skin looking soft and tight'. Her family, skeptical of the benefits ask for proof, but Chanel is unable to offer anything which backs up her bizarre claims. The model also shows off a myriad of other 'beauty fixes' she uses, including a daily shot of garlic powder, balsamic vinaigrette, sage, and olive oil - which she claims helps to 'preserve your body' - as well as a skincare regimen that involves washing her face eight to ten times per day. She also claims to have eaten placenta, gone on fasts and put her body through many detoxes in her quest to stay young. In the thick of it: Chanel seems unperturbed by the process, dunking her hand into the container of blood and examining the contents before pouring it on to herself . Bloody bizarre: The teenager picked up the blood at a local butcher who asked her if she would prefer pork or beef, to which she replies, 'I don't eat meat' The teen's grandmother, Lois, tries her best to dissuade Chanel of her latest endeavor, saying she could be risking her well being. 'I'm sorry my grandmother is worried about my health,' says Chanel. 'But now that I'm this close to my blood bath, I can't stop.' After picking up the pig's blood from a butcher in a large bucket, Chanel climbs into the tub wearing only her underwear and begins pouring the thick, red liquid all over her body. The model, who claims to be a vegetarian, describes how 'even the roughest parts of the body like the elbows feel soft, and I think I owe that to the blood'. Later in the episode, Chanel claims that though she believes the blood bath helped her self-esteem, she 'has no desire to do it again'. Luckily for Chanel, the experience of filming with MTV seems to have had a positive outcome. As she reveals in a follow up Q&A with the channel, she was 'humbled' by the reactions she received. 'I never believed I was that off my rocker,' she adds. 'I think I owe that to the blood': The teenager describes feeling her skin become softer as she soaks in the blood . Other blood bathers: The infamous Countess Elisabeth Bathory was said to have bathed in the blood of virgins to stay young, and the benefits of its use are still championed today by the likes of Kim Kardashian . Although the benefits are not proven, the concept of using blood as a beauty product is far from new. The idea of bathing in blood for youth may have originated with the story of Elisabeth Bathory, a Hungarian Countess who was alleged to have murdered hundreds of young women around the turn of the 16th century. Folklore says that she bathed in the blood of virgins to maintain her youth. Fast-forward to more recent - and less murderous - applications, Kim Kardashian's 'vampire facial' went through a surge in popularity in 2013 after the reality star posted a photo of herself receiving the treatment, which involves drawing a person's own blood, separating the platelets and then injecting it back into the patient's face. A similar new beauty craze involved using a patient's own blood to create a beauty cream, which was recently offered to patrons at the Dorchester Hotel in London.","Chanel, from California, appeared on a recent episode of MTV’s True Life .

"Something odd is going on this year in Goa - and it has to do with the rows of empty sunbeds.

On the beach, Goans peddling pedicures and sarongs smile and tell us we are 'very pale', adding: 'You won't stay that way for long.' Even without the Russians, the beach is a hive of activity.

"Chamali Fernando, candidate for Cambridge, was speaking at a hustings event last night when she made the comment . A Tory parliamentary candidate has sparked outrage after claiming mental health patients should wear coloured wristbands to flag up their conditions. Chamali Fernando, candidate for Cambridge, was speaking at a hustings event last night when she made the startling suggestion. She said wearing wristbands indicating a person's condition would help doctors, lawyers and police officers – because people suffering mental illnesses often struggled to explain themselves. Ms Fernando, a barrister for 12 years, said: 'Police, social services or hospitals dealing with people with conditions that affect their ability to communicate can decide they are being obstructive or evasive. 'They do not realise the person may have a mental health or other condition. The way they behave often affects the way they are treated. 'Carrying some kind of identification shows they have a particular condition so allowances can be made. 'There are also different ways of doing this without stigmatising the person, such as carrying a card with details of the condition but in some cases by wearing a coloured wristband.' Ms Fernando's 'shocking' suggestion was slammed by the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today. Mr Clegg told MailOnline: 'The Liberal Democrats have spent many years campaigning for an end to the stigma around mental health. 'Silly ideas like making people suffering from mental health issues wear wristbands would only increase the discrimination and stigma around mental health, rather than end it.' Mr Clegg told MailOnline: 'The Liberal Democrats have spent many years campaigning for an end to the stigma around mental health' Miriam Gonzalez Durantez (right), the wife of Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg, joined the party's candidate for Hazel Grove, in Stockport, Lisa Smart (left) Julian Huppert, the Lib Dem candidate and Cambridge MP, said: 'I was really shocked at the suggestion that people with mental health problems should be expected to wear wristbands to identify themselves.' Mr Huppert said: 'I have fought hard for many years against the stigma people with mental health problems face. There is already far too much discrimination against mental health throughout our society, and a wristband saying 'I am depressed' is not going to help. 'We need to massively improve mental health support, which has been not good enough for many decades. I hope Chamali regrets her comments and will think carefully about her attitude to mental illness in the future.' Political blogger Richard Taylor reported Ms Fernando's comments at last night's hustings . The Conservative candidate insisted her remarks were 'distorted', adding: 'It was not that they should wear a wristband. That would be draconian' Ms Fernando has insisted that her comments were 'taken out of context'. She said: 'The question that was asked is how authorities, such as the police, could better deal with mental health issues. 'At Cambridge National Autistic Hustings the chairman of CNAS said he carries a green card in his wallet to identify his condition. 'There are people who have come into contact with the police and due to an underlying mental health condition are unable to communicate their condition. 'It was not that they should wear a wristband. That would be draconian.'","Chamali Fernando made comments at a hustings in Cambridge last night .

"Two 'unemployed rich kids' have caused outrage in China after causing a major traffic accident in central Beijing by racing and wrecking an underpass and two luxurious supercars. The spectacular crash on Saturday wrote a green Lamborghini off and wrecked a red Ferrari. Both drivers have now been charged by the local Public Security Bureau with dangerous driving and have been detained, according to the People's Daily Online. The green Lamborghini and red Ferrari - which are worth a combined total of £1.3million - are believed to have been racing through the underpass in Beijing when the drivers lost control and crashed . The green Lamborghini was completely wrecked during the crash and the front end was completely severed . Neither driver was hurt but a female passenger in the Lamborghini was taken to the local hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Although both of the drivers claimed the accident was caused by the slippery road conditions at the entrance of the tunnel, the state of the crash scene led Chinese internet users to speculate that the pair had been 'drag racing', which is illegal in China. The crash occurred two hours before 'Fast and Furious 7' broke the record for midnight screenings on its launch in China, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The 20-year-old driver of the Ferrari, Yu, from Changchun City in Jilin, and the 20-year-old driver of the green Lamborghini, Tang, a native of Beijing, are both reported to be unemployed - which fuelled more backlash from people online considering the two cars are worth in excess of 12 million yuan  - or £1.3 million. 'GuoPang' from Guangxi said 'Why didn't the drivers die? No Justice!' another 'Bluesky1963' from Hunan said simply 'The spoilt rich.' and 'dajianye' from Beijing said 'That part of the road has daily car races and the sound is deafening. This is definitely the result of car racing.' 'Socialism is so good that it allows unemployed people to drive supercars,' one posting said on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, mocking the country's authoritarian system of Communist rule. 'What are their names? Who are their fathers?' one netizen asked. 'Were they in a hurry to watch Fast and Furious 7?' said another. Both cars caused extensive damage to the guard rail and a 10 metre section of the tunnel wall (pictured) The maximum speed inside the tunnel is 60km an hour. Eyewitnesses said that halfway through the 1.2km tunnel the speeding Lamborghini swerved suddenly and lost control. The Ferrari also lost control not long after and both cars caused extensive damage to the guard rail and a 10 metre section of the tunnel wall. The cost of the damage is expected to be recouped from the drivers. The People's Daily reports that the wreckage of the Lamborghini was around 100 metres from the Ferrari and that there were no brake marks visible on the road. Debris from the cars and damaged wall were scattered across the area and closed off a section of the tunnel. The drivers were not hurt but a passenger in the Lamborghini was taken to hospital with non-serious injuries . The crash is believed to have cost thousands of pounds worth of damage to the underpass . Local residents told reporters that the tunnel is a frequent spot for car racing especially between 11pm to 12pm - creating incredibly high noise levels which disturb local residents. Residents in the nearby Fengling Lvzhou estate said they have been complaining about illegal racing in the area for years. Representatives of the residents told People's Daily Online they hear engines rumbling every week and most races take place after midnight. This has not only disturbed their sleep but also brought serious danger to the road. Residents have appealed for more speed bumps in the tunnel to prevent racing from happening. A high-speed Ferrari crash in the capital in March 2012 killed the son of Ling Jihua, a close ally of then-president Hu Jintao. Two women passengers, one of them naked, were both injured. The incident added to public perceptions in China of corrupt and high-living officials, and Ling has since been investigated for graft and dismissed from his post. A 21-year-old driver crashed his Ferrari at high speed in the Chinese capital in February last year, killing one passenger and injuring another .

"The hapless Seattle Airport baggage handler who woke up from a nap inside a plane's cargo hold, only to discover that the jet was in the air, made a frantic 911 call begging for help. Alaska Airlines Flight 448 bound for Los Angeles was forced to turn around and return to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Monday when passengers heard banging and pleas for help coming from the cargo section of the jet. It was later revealed that the unnamed employee of airline contractor Menzies Aviation had dozed off inside the plane at the end of his shift and only awakened when it was in the air, about 14 minutes into the flight. Scroll down for audio and video . Can you hear me now? This is the moment an Alaska Airlines baggage handler was pulled from the cargo hold after falling asleep. Earlier, the terrified man called 911 begging the dispatcher for help . Safe: This is the baggage handler who fell asleep aboard the Alaska Airlines flight from Seattle to Los Angeles on Monday . On Thursday, the trapped baggage handler's desperate 911 call was released, revealing the man's panic and terror. 'Hello, I'm trapped in this plane!' he tells he operator. The woman ostensibly struggles to grasp what's happening and asks for an explanation. 'You're where?' the dispatcher asks. 'I'm inside a plane and I feel like it's moving in the air,' he replies. The airport worker then rattles off the number of the flight and begs the dispatcher to call for help. 'Can you please, can somebody stop it?' he pleads. The man grows increasingly exasperated on the call, telling the woman on the other end of the line that he is not at the airport, but rather inside a flying plane. As he struggles to lay out his situation, the phone begins to cut out and eventually the call gets disconnected . The operator made an attempt to call the man back, but his phone was no longer in service. Luckily for the drowsy airport staffer, he had better luck with passengers aboard Flight 448 who heard his banging and screams and alerted the crew. 'Help! Help! Help!' the man screamed, according to one traveler. The airline said in a news release the captain immediately returned to Seattle-Tacoma International and declared an emergency for priority landing. The cargo hold where the handler was trapped is temperature controlled and pressurized, so he was not in danger of freezing or running out of oxygen. A passenger on board Flight 448 recorded video of the baggage handlder's knocking that passengers could hear inside the cabin . Emergency landing: The pilot turned back to Seattle 14 minutes into the flight when he heard screaming . 'At some point the marshal kind of made himself known and started banging back and he yelled really loud and said, ""We're getting ready to land, hold on to something,""' Troi Ge, a passenger on board the flight, told NBC News. Mr Ge, a sound designer from Burbank, recorded video aboard the plane in which passengers could hear the banging from the cargo hold. After the plane landed, a ramp agent was found inside the front cargo hold. Video taken by KIRO 7 showed the worker calmly walking out of the cargo hold and putting on a high visibility jacket. He stood talking to airport staff for a few seconds before walking off towards the terminal. 'Upon exiting, he told authorities he had fallen asleep,' the airline said. The worker, an employee of Menzies Aviation, walked off the plane and appeared well, but was taken to a hospital as a precaution. He was released home after passing a drug test. The worker, who was part of a four-person crew, started his shift at 5am Monday morning and was scheduled to finish work at 2.30pm, according to the airline. After the team was done loading all the luggage onto the plane, the leader of the crew noticed that one of his staffers was nowhere to be found. He tried calling and texting him but the man did not respond, leading his supervisor to believe that he had gone home at the end of the shift, reported KOMO News. The airline says it is investigating the situation. The pilot could hear banging and screaming from beneath the aircraft as they flew from Seattle to LA . The man appeared to be well as he walked around the runway talking to airport employees . Alaska Airlines is investigating how the man managed to fall asleep before the LA-bound flight took off . Passenger Marty Collins told KOMO-TV in Seattle the flight was surrounded by emergency vehicles when it returned to the airport. She said passengers did not hear the worker banging or making noise. 'Nobody on the plane heard anything like that, nobody knew why we were turning around,' she told the station. 'They just said we were fine and we weren't in any danger. Passenger Troi Ge told the station Q13Fox that at one point a federal air marshal revealed himself and started banging back. He then yelled to the man in the cargo hold that the plane was about to land and urged him to hold onto something to prevent injury. The flight departed again at 3.52pm and was expected to arrive in Los Angeles at 6.27pm, about 80 minutes late, according to the airline's website.","Flight 448 had just taken off Monday when the pilot heard banging from beneath .

"A retired Marine has pleaded not guilty to murdering his clothing-designer girlfriend, whose skeletal remains were discovered in a jungle in Panama two years after she disappeared. Brian Karl Brimager, 37, entered his plea on Friday after he was indicted by a federal grand jury in San Diego, in connection with the death of Yvonne Lee Baldelli. He has been in custody since June 2013 on charges including obstruction of justice and falsifying records related to the investigation.

The 42-year-old woman from Laguna Niguel, California, was last seen in September 2011 when she arrived in Panama with Brimager. Her family reported her missing the following January . The indictment alleges that Brimager murdered Baldelli, dismembered her body and disposed of her body parts in a remote jungle area. Brimager then engaged in an elaborate scheme to cover up the crime, including destroying evidence and sending a series of emails purportedly from Baldelli in order to make it appear to her friends and family that she was still alive, according to court papers. The indictment also alleges that Brimager attempted to conceal his crime by disposing of a bloody mattress involved in Badelli's murder in the ocean. Brimager conducted two Internet searches on Baldelli's computer, one for 'washing mattress' and a second for 'washing mattress blood stain,' according to documents. A man who was cutting bushes on the island province of Bocas del Toro found a bag containing Baldelli's remains in August 2013. Baldelli's family has the clothing designer was frequently out of touch so they did not immediately suspect anything was wrong. Panama police say Brimager left Panama for Costa Rica and the United States about 10 days after last being seen with Baldelli. In 2012 FBI agents and Panamanian forensic specialists found traces of blood on the walls and floor of the hostel El Sapo in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, which is the popular tourist spot where Baldelli was last seen.

"More than four million people will be stuck on hospital waiting lists – and a further 20 million unable to get a doctor's appointment within a week if the Tories are re-elected, Labour claimed today. Ed Balls and the shadow health secretary Andy Burnham made the stark warning this morning, warning that the NHS 'cannot survive' another five years of the Tories in government. The Labour frontbenchers, launching a week of Labour attacks on the NHS, said there had been a 'dramatic decline in standards' in the NHS over the past five years. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said if standards continued to decline at the current rate, then by 2020 millions more will face long waits in A&E and long waits to see GPs . He said if standards continued to decline at the current rate then by 2020 millions more will face long waits in A&E and long waits to see GPs. Ambulance response times for the most serious call-outs will rise to over nine minutes, 500,000 fewer older people will receive social care and 600,000 people will be forced to wait for more than four hours on trolleys on A&E, Mr Burnham warned. Labour said the figures were based on the latest official NHS data. In the latest GP-patient Survey, 10.9 per cent of people say they were unable to get an appointment with a GP the last time they tried. This is up from 9.6 per cent in 2012. On this trend, by 2020, 14.8 per cent of people, some 8.4 million people, will be unable to get a GP appointment. A further 14.4 per cent of people are now waiting more than a week for a GP appointment. This is up from 12.0 per cent in 2012. If this trend continues, some 21.7 per cent of people – more than 12.3 million people – will wait a week or more. A further two million a year will be forced to wait over four hours in A&E – up from 1.4million last year and just 350,000 in 2009/10. Shadow  health secretary Andy Burnham said four million people will be stuck on hospital waiting lists – and a further 20 million unable to get a doctor's appointment within a week if the Tories are re-elected . Hospital waiting lists are also set to spike, Labour said. In May 2010, there were 2.57 million people on the English waiting list – but by February this year, this had grown to 3.15million. On this trend, there will be 3.8 million people on the waiting list by May 2020. Labour said more than 100,000 operations will be cancelled in 2020 – up from . Over 27,000 operations will be cancelled every year in 2020 – up from 13,000 in 2010 – with 600,000 a year waiting longer than four hours on trolleys. Nicola Sturgeon today attempted to trump Labour on the NHS with a pledge to increase its budget by more than £8billion . Ambulance call out times are also under growing pressure, Labour said. In April 2011, the average ambulance response time for immediately life-threatening call-outs was 5.30 minutes. By February 2015 response times had risen by 1.6 minutes to 6.91 minutes. If this trend were to continue over the next five years, the average ambulance response time in May 2020 would be 9.12 minutes, an increase of over two thirds on 2010. The Tories said Labour were using the NHS as a political football. A Conservative spokesperson said: 'This marks a new low in Ed Miliband's desperate attempts to weaponise the NHS. His credibility on health is in tatters because he refuses to fund the £8 billion the NHS needs. 'By building a stronger economy, we have protected and improved the NHS with 9,500 more doctors, 6,900 more nurses, and 1.3 million more life-saving operations every year. 'There is only one threat to the future of our NHS and that is the economic chaos of an Ed Miliband-SNP government.' The future of the straining health service has become one of the key battlegrounds of the General Election, with Conservatives and Liberal Democrats pledging to find the £8 billion health chiefs say is needed by 2020 to prevent it buckling. Labour has refused to commit to providing the same amount but insists it will do 'what is necessary' and says its £2.5 billion spending plans are the only fully-funded proposals put forward so far. In an election dossier on the NHS, Labour accuse the Tories of having a secret plan for NHS charging. It claims public spending under the Conservatives would drop to levels similar to countries that have greater charging in healthcare, such as Switzerland, Mexico and Chile. At the launch of Labour's week of NHS campaigning, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 'This is the real face of the Tory Party. They have let the cat out of the bag - five more years of David Cameron means more NHS privatisation and charging. 'It is clear that, just like last time, Cameron's NHS promises have an expiry date of election day stamped on them. He promised no top-down reorganisation and brought forward the biggest-ever top-down reorganisation. If he gets back in, the NHS will be sunk by a toxic mix of cuts and privatisation.' David Cameron and George Osborne, at a campaign event in Crewe this morning, have accused the Labour Party of using the NHS as a political football . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls added: 'David Cameron is a serial offender when it comes to claims at election time. He broke his promises on the NHS, on VAT and on tax credits last time. And he'll break his promises again. 'Because on top of their extreme spending plans to double the cuts next year, the Tories have made billions of pounds of unfunded commitments in this election, including £10 billion of tax cuts and billions of pounds for rail fare freezes and paid time off for public servants to volunteer. 'And these unfunded promises will come before the NHS in the queue.' In a speech to the Scottish Trades Union Congress Mr Miliband will say: 'The Tory plans on the NHS are a double deceit. 'They are not being straight about their extreme plans to double the cuts to public services next year. 'And they are not being straight when they promise to protect the NHS, but cannot say where a penny of additional money will come from. 'This double deceit is a double danger to the NHS. They have extreme spending plans and they can't tell us where the money is coming from. 'David Cameron poses a risk to the very fabric and foundation of our NHS. 'That's why we will fight every day to May 7 to stop a Tory plan that threatens our NHS. 'And it's why we have a different approach. 'A fully funded plan, with a mansion tax on properties worth over £2 million to pay for more nurses and doctors in every part of the United Kingdom.'","Labour claims NHS 'cannot survive' another 5 years of Tory government .

"Britain's most famous pools winner who pledged to 'spend, spend, spend' after winning more than £150,000 has died. Viv Nicholson, 79, became rich overnight when she scooped £152,319 in 1961 with her husband Keith. The win, on a football betting pool, in which gamblers predict the results of football games across a season, would be worth up to £5million in today's money. The pair, from Castleford, West Yorkshire, splurged the cash on flash cars, designer clothes, holidays and partying - frittering away half of their wealth within four years of winning. Scroll down for video . Viv Nicholson, 79, from West Yorkshire, who became rich overnight when she scooped £152,319 in 1961 with her husband Keith (pictured with Bruce Forsyth) has passed away following a lengthy battle with dementia . Mrs Nicholson (above) and her husband splurged the cash - worth about £5million today - on expensive cars, designer clothes, holidays and partying - frittering away at least half of their wealth within four years of winning . However, tragedy struck when Mr Nicholson died at the wheel of his blue Jaguar in 1965, which led to Mrs Nicholson being declared bankrupt, as the tax authorities reclaimed most of her husband's wealth. She managed to reclaim some of the money after a lengthy legal battle, but lost it all again from poor investments on the stock market. She later suffered a stroke in 2011, which her son said led to the onset of dementia, and moved into a care home. Her family confirmed she passed away yesterday following a long battle with the brain disease and requested for donations to be made to Dementia UK in her memory. In a statement released today, her son Howard said: 'We are saddened to announce the death of our much loved mum, Viv Nicholson. 'After suffering with dementia for five years, she died on April 11 at Pinderfields Hospital with her sons at her side. 'Viv was a one-off in all ways - a loving and loved mother, a glamorous great grandmother and a friend to many. Mrs Nicholson lived a fascinating lifestyle, staying true to her word by spending all of the money which she famously won when she was just 25-years-old. In 2007, she recalled the evening she realised she had won the huge sum of money. She said: 'We found out on Saturday evening that we'd won the pools, but we couldn't find the coupon. We weren't sure if we'd sent it off or not, but then the winning ticket turned up in Keith's trousers. 'It's unbelievable that I remember the exact amount we won so clearly - it was £152,300, 18 shillings and eight pence. Back then, even the eight pence meant something. 'I walked half a mile to the Post Office to send the telegram to the pools company. Within a couple of days, we were in London and famous.' Mrs Nicholson, 79, lived a fascinating lifestyle, staying true to her word by spending all of the money which she famously won on the pools in 1961. Pictured: Actress and singer Barbara Dickson with Mrs Nicholson in 1999 . Mrs Nicholson (pictured above) previously condemned people who criticised her for spending all of the money she won, saying it was her life and she 'won't be told how to live it'. Right: Newspaper coverage of her win . The couple found themselves being mobbed by reporters at Kings Cross station. Then the cheque was presented to them by Bruce Forsyth. Asked what she planned to do with it, Viv gleefully replied: 'Spend, spend, spend!' Back then, there was no network to support or advise big winners - possibly because hardly anyone had ever won that much. Having promised to spend, not save, the naive young couple retreated to Yorkshire and recklessly proceeded to do just that. They bought a large bungalow in a smart suburb a few miles down the road from where they grew up and she ordered dresses from Harrods, bought a pink Chevrolet and then swapped it for a different luxury car every six months. Keith, a former miner, bought a racehorse and the children were sent to boarding school. She said: 'We travelled all over the States and Europe.' However, the money soon started to dwindle and Mr Nicholson died when his car skidded off the A1 just four years after the big win. Following his death, Mrs Nicholson married four more times, but was widowed again and went on to battle with alcohol and depression. A short-lived attempt to start a new life in Malta was soon curtailed after she was deported for fighting with a police officer. In desperation she took to performing 'Big Spender' in a Manchester strip club, but was fired when she refused to take off her underwear. In 1984, The Smiths asked her to pose for the cover of their hit single Heaven Knows I'm Miserable now. Her story was turned into a televised BBC play and later a musical - both called Spend, Spend, Spend in honour of her catchphrase. The production even appeared on the West End, netting Mrs Nicholson £100,000 royalties . Mrs Nicholson (pictured outside the home she lived in when she won the pools) married four more times following the death of husband Keith. Her family have asked for donations to Dementia UK in her memory . Her story was turned into a televised BBC play and later a musical - both called Spend, Spend, Spend in honour of her catchphrase. The production premiered at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds before a run at London's West End. Mrs Nicholson received royalties of around £100,000 from the musical, which were spent, and she revealed in an interview with the Mail in 2007 that she was living off of her state pension and seeking work. At the time, she said she couldn't help but spend her royalties or the money she received from her 1978 autobiography. 'I can't not do, I love to spend,' she said. She also criticised people who condemned her for splashing her cash and not investing it wisely. She said: 'People say I should be ashamed of what I spent my money on, and that I could have done so much more. 'But when I lost my last 20 grand on the stock market, I did not cry about it. I had a good whack and enjoyed what I did. 'It may have served me right - maybe I was wild and crazy.

"Ed Miliband’s son has inadvertently waded into the row about the Labour leader’s kitchen as he declared it ‘the best’ in his house. The unwitting admission from five-year-old Daniel, to be broadcast tonight, came as Mr Miliband yet again wheeled out his children for the cameras. It is the fourth time they have appeared on screen during the campaign – once for a BBC profile, again for an interview on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, a third time for a campaign visit in Blackpool over Easter, and again this evening on ITV. Scroll down for video . Kitchen sink dramas: Ed Miliband and his family in the kitchen that has caused so much controversy . Child's play: Mr Miliband's son Daniel (left) has inadvertently waded into the row about 'two kitchens' Ed. The comment was made during an ITV interview in which the Milibands, including wife Justine (right), cook eggs . But the move somewhat backfires as his eldest son tells the camera the spartan kitchen – that last month sparked such controversy for Mr Miliband – is the ‘best’ in the £2.7million home. And it led to accusations that Mr Miliband lives an ‘Upstairs, Downstairs’ lifestyle last night as he was forced to admit that he needs two kitchens because the family nanny lives in the basement of his London ‘mansion’. However, Mr Miliband, who is filmed attempting to make scrambled eggs, claims controversy about his kitchen ‘makes me laugh’. He tells ITV’s political editor Tom Bradby: ‘This is the kitchen we use, I mean there’s a kitchen downstairs. Our nanny lives downstairs and it’s sort of a basement area, a basement flat. She uses the kitchen downstairs and we use this kitchen.’ But the revelation that he keeps the help downstairs will do little to bolster Mr Miliband’s claim that he is in touch with struggling families. Tory MP Julian Smith: ‘This exposes Ed Miliband for the hypocrite and champagne socialist that he is. He claims he is on the side of working people but the reality is his home life is like a scene from Upstairs, Downstairs.’ Daniel, Miliband's eldest son, tells the camera the spartan kitchen – that last month sparked such controversy for Mr Miliband – is the ‘best’ in the £2.7million home . In a personal interview with ITV’s Tonight programme, Mr Miliband also brushes aside controversy about embarrassing pictures last year of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich. But Mr Bradby reveals he has been asked not to film Mrs Miliband eating the eggs her husband has cooked. The Labour leader indicates that spin chiefs have also told him not to be filmed eating, saying: ‘Apparently I’m not allowed to eat them.’ Mr Miliband’s kitchen hit the headlines last month when he was filmed in it by the BBC. In the personal interview, Mr Miliband also brushes aside controversy about embarrassing pictures last year of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich (pictured) Critics questioned whether the small, utilitarian room could really be the main kitchen in a large North London home that will qualify as a ‘mansion’ for the purposes of Labour’s proposed Mansion Tax. Times columnist and Miliband family friend Jenni Russell then intervened to say that the home’s real kitchen is ‘lovely’. She said the room in which Mr Miliband was filmed was a ‘functional kitchenette by the sitting room for tea and quick snacks’. Mr Miliband’s decision to again make prominent use of his sons Daniel and Samuel, four, to bolster his image is also likely to raise eyebrows. The boys are seen playing in a park and heard chatting with their parents. David and Samantha Cameron have allowed much more limited media access to their children. A Labour source said: ‘Justine and the children are the most important people in Ed’s life and it is right that the public see he is a father and a family man.’","Miliband came under fire last month for having two kitchens in £2.7m home .

Grim outcomes include being separated from your family by human traffickers, women being sold between militia groups, and refugees being beaten over the head and hurled into the Mediterranean from packed migrant ships. Middle East expert Chris Walker told The Sun: 'In the midst of probably the bloodiest Syrian crisis this century, the decision of the BBC to transform the human suffering of literally millions into a children's game beggars belief.' Twitter users reacted furiously to the game, which appeared on the BBC site last Wednesday.

Ripa's husband, actor Mark Consuelos, retweeted choreographer Isaac Calpito's post, which read: 'Devastated over the loss of our dear friend @drfredricbrandt. You are missed. You are loved. The world has lost one of its kindest souls.' Ms Abravanel, a Miami Herald columnist, posted a series of tweets on Sunday claiming that he had been 'devastated' by unflattering comparisons to Dr Franff on the  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, according to  sources close to the doctor. The doctor's longtime publicist Jacquie Tractenberg told The New York Post on Monday: 'The show definitely deeply hurt him, he was being made fun of because of the way he looks. 'It is mean, and it was bullying. But the show was not the reason for his depression, and it was not the reason he would take his own life.' The Tractenberg & Co PR agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online. Morning show host, Kelly Ripa, posted: 'My heart is breaking for the loss of Dr. Fredric Brandt. My friend. You will be missed forever and in my heart even longer' Behar tweeted on Monday: 'Dr Brandt was one of the sweetest, nicest, most generous people I have had the good fortune to meet & work with. He will be sorely missed' The doctor was found dead at his Coconut Grove mansion in Miami by his housekeeper where he lived alone. She called 911 at 9.17am, according to a police statement. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department confirmed that an autopsy will be conducted on Monday. The New York Post also wrote a column last month comparing the real-life doctor to the fictional doctor on Tina Fey's hit comedy. 'Sources: Dr Fredric Brandt was ""devastated"" over comparisons to the protagonist on Tina Fey’s new Netflix show, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"",' Abravanel tweeted. Dr Franff only appears in one episode, titled 'Kimmy Goes To The Doctor!', of the first season. The character shares Dr Brandt’s smooth skin, platinum blond hair and enthusiasm for plastic surgery, but his door sign claims he’s a ‘board certified D, DS, DDSOBGYN’, rather than a cosmetic dermatologist. Dr Brandt's colleague, Dr Robert Anolik (pictured right with Brandt in June 2014) posted a moving tribute on Monday saying that he had lost a 'close friend' The dermatologist posted a tribute to his colleague of five years after Dr Brandt's tragic suicide on Sunday .

The Dr Franff character is depicted on the Netflix show with a high-pitched laugh and unable to speak certain words due to his plastic surgery. He is also seen drinking  from a surgical bag and reinflates his own face after being punched. Netflix had no comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online. Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance, which displayed many of his dermatology techniques. In a 2014 profile in The New York Times, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony'. 'I approach each face with a visual perception, an artistic perception and a medical perception,' he said. The article, which described the doctor as an 'unnervingly ageless-looking personage', said that he was sought out by the rich and famous for his signature Y lifts, where fillers are injected below the cheekbones.

It was also widely known that Dr Brandt injected products including Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvéderm, Voluma, The Times reported, into his own face, erasing his wrinkles, leaving him with full lips and an ageless quality. The doctor told The Times that people often asked him if he was from Sweden. Representatives for Dr Brandt and Fey did not immediately return requests for comment from Daily Mail Online. Dr Brandt grew up in Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey where his parents ran a candy store. His father died when he was a teenager and he lost his mother before he graduated from Rutgers University in 1971. He went on to attend Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia. He completed residencies at NYU's Department of Internal Medicine and then in Dermatology at the University of Miami. He set up a practice in Coral Cables, Miami in 1982 and began part-time work in New York in 1998 but quickly expanded to become one of the most in-demand cosmetic appointments. He would sometimes see around 30 patients a day at his midtown Manhattan offices, which is filled with expensive art works, for appointments costing thousands of dollars. The 65-year-old was considered as the number one injector of Botox and Restylane filler in the world. Dr Fredric Brandt's practice was closed on Monday and Tuesday in Miami, Florida following his tragic death . Dr Brandt had famed practices (pictured) in Miami and Manhattan. In a 2014 profile, he said that his goal was to 'restore the face to harmony' Though Abravanel suggests that Dr Franff is a protagonist on the show, Martin Short's character only appeared in one episode of the first season . Security was tight in the gated entrance to Dr Brandt's  Miami home on Sunday. His publicist declined to comment on the circumstances or cause of death . The doctor was regarded by his peers as a pioneer in the field and often gave lectures on the use of products. Dr Brandt also has a range of high-end dermatological products. A 1.35 oz 'Do Not Age with Dr. Brandt' Transforming Pearl Serum costs $150. He wrote two books about his work, '10 Minutes/10 Years: Your Definitive Guide to a Beautiful and Youthful Appearance' and 'Age-less: The Definitive Guide to Botox, Collagen, Lasers, Peels, and Other Solutions for Flawless Skin'. Along with his Miami mansion, Dr Brandt had a luxury apartment on the West Side of Manhattan with sweeping views of the Hudson River and filled with the esteemed art collection. Tributes poured in for Dr Brandt following the news of shocking death. TV presenter and beauty editor Nadine Baggott wrote: 'RIP Frederic Brandt - I loved every fascinating minute spent interviewing him.' @idrisjoel postd on Twitter: #RIP to one of the kindest and most brilliant physician I've ever met, Dr Frederic Shelton Brandt.' TV Host Jeannette Kaplun ‏wrote: 'So sad that the world has lost a wonderful, kind and brilliant human being, Dr. Frederic Brandt' Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was 'devastated' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon, Dr Franff, in the Netflix comedy, is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt. In one scene, where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery, the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show's first season. When he is punched by the main character, Kimmy, as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon's chair, his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube . Dr Franff appears in episode four of the first and only season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He's a botox-loving plastic surgeon played by Martin Short. The show follows a Kimmy (Ellie Kemper), who was rescued from an underground bunker after years of being held hostage by a cult leader. She then is hired to be a nanny for the step-children of socialite Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski). In the fourth episode of the show, Jacqueline visits Dr Franff to discuss a 'foot lift' of sorts because she believes that 'feet are the new butts'. In the fourth episode of the Netflix show's first and only season, Dr Franff makes a short appearance as a cosmetic doctor who consults with Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) and Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski, pictured) Dr Franff's almost-overly smooth skin and platinum blond hair share a resemblance with that of Dr Fredric Brandt, who is known for being the cosmetic dermatologist of stars including Madonna and Stephanie Seymour. Franff is portrayed as a deranged doctor, whose face is so frozen from plastic surgery and other procedures that he even has trouble forming words at times. In the episode, he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline, as well as on Kimmy.","Cosmetic dermatologist to the stars Fredric Brandt was found dead at his Coconut Grove home in Miami on Sunday, aged 65 .

"Greece has demanded more than £200billion in compensation from Germany for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War. The government yesterday unveiled its final calculation for the war reparations stemming from occupation by the Third Reich. The radical left Syriza party says Germany owes Greece nearly 279billion euros, or £204billion to compensate it for looting and war crimes. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras raised the reparations issue when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month . The German government says the issue was resolved legally years ago. The demand comes just days before Greece is obliged to pay 450million euros of its debt to the International Monetary Fund. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, has said the country ‘intends to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum’. Greece suffered a brutal occupation at the hands Adolf Hitler’s forces in 1941. More than 40,000 people are believed to have starved to death in Athens alone. Yesterday a parliamentary committee established by Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras for the first time put an official number on the reparations claim. It includes the cost of a 10billion euro forced Nazi loan made by the Bank of Greece and the return of archaeological treasures. The revised figures amount to nearly 10 per cent of Germany's GDP. Mr Tsipras raised the reparations issue when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month. He has called the reparations question a ‘moral and ethical’ issue for his country. The new figure was revealed yesterday by Greek deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas. ‘According to our calculations, the debt linked to German reparations is 278.7bn euros,’ he told a parliamentary committee investigating responsibility for Greece's debt crisis. Mr Mardas said the reparations calculation had been made by Greece's state general accounting office. Berlin paid 115m deutschmarks to Athens in 1960 in compensation – a fraction of the Greek demand. Greece says this did not cover payments for damaged infrastructure, war crimes and the return of the forced loan. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, has said the country ‘intends to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum’ Yesterday a parliamentary committee established by Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras for the first time put an official number on the reparations claim . Germany insists the reparations issue was settled in 1990 legally and politically before Germany reunified. Syriza politicians have frequently blamed Germany for the hardship suffered by Greeks under the tough bailout conditions imposed by international lenders. Ministers have floated the idea of seizing German assets in the country to compensate the families of victims of Nazi war crimes. A poll carried for Greek radio found more than 80 per cent of Greeks agreed with the pusuit of Nazi war debt claims. Yesterday Greek MPs also voted to establish a committee examining the circumstances of its 2010 bail-out by eurozone creditors and the IMF to the tune of 240billion euros. ‘After five years of parliamentary silence on the major issues that caused the bailout catastrophe, today we commence a procedure that will give answers to the questions concerning the Greek people,’ Mr Tsipras said. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has claimed the economy was unfairly lumbered with the liabilities that it is now struggling to pay off as its coffers run empty. He has claimed Europe dealt with his country's bankruptcy by ‘loading the largest loan in human history on the weakest of shoulders - the Greek taxpayer’.","Greek government has unveiled its final calculation for the war reparations .

"The the first photos of Sarah Stage's healthy newborn baby boy have been released. The 30-year-old lingerie model and animal rights activist from Los Angeles had come under fire during her pregnancy for posting a string of sexy selfies showing off her seemingly rock-hard abs. But James Hunter was born at a healthy eight pounds and seven ounces earlier this week, putting paid to Sarah's critics. Scroll down for video . Underwear model and animal rights activist Sarah Stage shared this adorable picture of her newborn baby James Hunter on Instagram . Sarah Stage took her last pregnancy selfie (pictured) on Monday, writing: 'Still waiting'.  The 30-year-old gave birth James the next day . Sarah shared the adorable pictures to her Instagram page. One, which shows a close up of her son's face, said: 'Love at first sight #jameshunter.' While the first ever picture of James featured the newborn in an adorable fox outfit. Sarah commented on the photo: 'James Hunter (4/14/15) 8.7lbs/22 inches of HEALTHY baby! 'Thank you for the positive support throughout my journey... It's just beginning!!! #JamesHunter #Healthy' During her pregnancy many people commented that they felt Sarah's unusually trim figure could be damaging to her unborn child, but it seems their fears were unfounded. Sarah posted this adorable picture of James to her Instagram commenting that it was 'love at first sight' Sarah confirmed her happy news to E! revealing that her baby boy was  22 inches long at the time of his birth, adding: 'He's a big healthy boy and he got an APGAR score of eight to nine.' An APGAR score, which stands for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration, is a quick method for assessing the health of a newborn, with scores of seven or above being considered normal. Sarah famously documented her changing figure via her Instagram page throughout her pregnancy, earning herself a huge number of fans - as well as a fair share of critics - in the process. Although the now mother came under fire last month as more and more critics spoke out against toned figure their comments never stopped the model from sharing numerous photos of her tight abs with her 1.6 million Instagram followers. In this gorgeous snap James is seen sleeping in a giraffe costume . On Tuesday Sarah shared a photo of two In-N-Out burgers, writing, 'Cravings,' although its not clear as to whether or not she enjoyed the meal before or after she gave birth. The lingerie-clad model snapped her last pregnancy selfie on Monday, which she captioned: 'Still waiting #9months [sic].' The snapshot of her in a black bra and thong underwear has been liked over40,000 times since it was posted, and has earned nearly 4,000 comments. And Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent, took to Instagram last week to share a photo of growing belly during the last weeks of her of pregnancy, writing: '10 days until we meet #BabyJames.' But Sarah didn't just receive harsh comments. Many women noted that they found Sarah's pregnancy body to be motivation to work out and live a healthy lifestyle. Sarah struck various poses for these selfies of herself in her underwear which she posted throughout her pregnancy . Haters gonna hate: Sarah, who came under fire for her being tiny and toned throughout her pregnancy, told her critics to unfollow her if they have a problem with her pictures . Pregnant model Sarah Stage snapped this photo of herself flaunting her barely-there baby bump 10 days before she was supposed to give birth to her son . 'I'm completely inspired to go to the gym first thing in the morning. You look absolutely gorgeous @sarahstage #amazing [sic],' one fan wrote. 'You look absolutely lovely. Hats off to you for being fit and taking care of yourself!' another added. 'If I ever have children, I'm inspired by you to treat my pregnancy the very same way. I'm sure James will be amazing! Congratulations.' Others compared their figures to Sarah's pregnancy body, with one woman writing: '10 days before giving birth?! Lord Jesus help us all! I look like this after dinner [sic].' 'I look like that after a good meal or two,' someone else commented. Meanwhile, some people suggested that her son would be as tiny as she is - although it has since been proved that their fears about the young boy's size were unfounded. Sarah and her friend compared their growing bellies for this playful picture . Sarah shared this adorable photo of matching father and son Timberland boots . 'Baby James will come out the size of her phone case,' one person commented, referencing the model's bear-shaped cell phone cover. When she's not sharing lingerie selfies, the new mother regularly shared pictures of her son's nursery and his future wardrobe. Last week, Sarah shared an adorable photo of matching father and baby sized Timberland boots, writing: 'Daddy & baby shoe game [sic].' And despite her critics, Sarah refused to hide her then-eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes. Sarah refused to wear baggy clothes during her pregnancy and instead opts for figure-hugging dresses like the one she is wearing in this picture . Sarah wore this sexy black dress on a 'date night' when she was 37 weeks pregnant, two weeks before James was born . She shunned baggy dresses and instead dressed her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa,spinach and chicken. Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah continued to proudly model whilst carrying. Two weeks ago, she shared a sexy snapshot of herself in black underwear and responded to her haters. 'BTW If you don't like my pics then unfollow me,' she wrote. 'I'm excited, happy and enjoying every second of my pregnancy. Can't wait to meet James! #NFG #37weeks [sic].'","Sarah Stage, 30, welcomed James Hunter into the world on Tuesday .

"It's that time of year again - the in between seasons moment when you look in your wardrobe and genuinely believe there is nothing suitable for the weather outside. In the springtime, the shops are full of new season clothes that are just waiting for a sunny day but still unsuitable for the ever-changing British weather. Cotton dresses, cut-off mini skirts and denim hot pants all need to wait until at least June for an appearance. Scroll down for video . Lily Melrose is a fashion blogger who has 137,000 followers on Instagram . So what to do if you want to embrace summer style now, but keep away from the shops for another couple of months? Fortunately, there are still plenty of crafty ways to keep your wardrobe current - and all you need is a pair of pliers, a glue gun and some scissors. UK stylist and blogger Lily Melrose has come up with 15 style hacks to transform your 2014 wardrobe into 2015 style, without breaking the bank. Read on to find out the DIY tips for making your clothes up to date... Lily models her updated dress, complete with necklace collar . Evening glam . Perfect for a night out with the girls, give your trusty little black dress a gorgeous splash of glam that captures this season’s catwalk style by using an old necklace to create a stunning jewelled collar effect. Use pliers to separate the necklace into individual jewels, position the pieces around the collar and simply use a glue gun to attach, instantly adding ‘the glam factor’ as seen on Matthew Williamson and House of Holland collections this Spring. Off-duty pastels . Dip-dye is big news this season and a subtle dip-dye effect will add a burst of spring colour to any daytime look. Hand dye and a bowl is all that is needed to update last year’s festival staple, the white vest. Carefully dip the first few inches of the vest into your favourite pastel shade and leave to dry. Lily’s top pick is on-trend blush pink and styled with jeans and a leather jacket for a casual daytime look. Lily shows you how to update sunglasses . DIY designer shades . As the sun comes out, it’s time to dust off last year’s sunglasses. For an effortless, high-impact update, take some jewels or artificial flowers and carefully glue these to the brim or sides of the sunglasses in a symmetrical design. Already a  trend seen on the faces of Dolce & Gabbana and Prada catwalk models this season, this simple and cost-effective design will ensure you’re one step ahead of the fashion set . Dare to bare (your knees) You don’t need to buy a new pair of jeans to sport this season’s biggest denim trend – plus worn jeans are softer too so they’re much easier to customise. Cut a rip just above the knee cap and then pull out threads and distress the edges for the perfect laid-back cool look. Team with patterned tights underneath for a fresh take on this look. Hair jewelry . The Les Copains label was among those adorning catwalk hairstyles with statement jewellery, but you don’t need to buy them. Carefully attach old necklace jewels (broken down by pliers) onto hairgrips with glue and leave to dry, to turn a boring hair day into a cute one. Headphone sparkle . In fact, embellishment can be used to spruce up any accessory – take inspiration from Dolce & Gabbana’s bejewelled headphones and add some sparkle to your commute by adding old jewels and diamantes to the outside of your Beats headphones. Fringed boots is a key look for 2015 . Seventies chic . The Seventies look has exploded on to the high street from the catwalks, but instead of going all in with flared jeans and heavy prints, try wearing existing key items in a new way. Channel the vibe with a high waisted skirt (bonus points if it’s the classic Seventies shade of camel), teamed with a tucked in black polo neck. For extra fashion points, cut off the sleeves of the polo neck as seen in Topshop this season for an easy update for spring. Crystal slippers . Take last year’s slipper shoe and update for this season by attaching some studs to them for an edgy spring look. The soft fabric makes it easy to attach them; pierce the fabric with each stud and fold them flat on the inside using pliers to keep them secure and comfortable. Cropped logo T-shirts: Nineties style has been in for a while now, but this year expect to see classic logo T-shirts updated for spring with cut off sleeves and cropped to the waist a la Daisy Lowe. No sewing needed – just don’t be afraid to take your scissors to your favourite old T-shirt! Fringe feet: Fringing has been big for a few seasons now, but this season the must-have is going to be fringing on your feet; take a simple suede tassel in the same shade as your favourite boots and attach using a few stitches. Use thread in the same shade for a seamless look. Faux fur gilet . Spring is the hardest time to style as the weather is so changeable; dig out last year’s faux fur cropped jacket from your wardrobe and unpick the sleeves to create a gilet to throw on over T-shirts for warm, breezy days. Rita Ora was wearing a faux fur gilet in New York in February . Instagram . Pinterest and instagram are the perfect ‘virtual wardrobe’; when you get compliments on outfits or try something new, take a snap and post them to create your own style bible that you can refer to at any time. Just by looking through you’ll probably see something you haven’t worn in a while that’s worth digging out! Colour pop . The classic white shirt is a style staple, but you can add a bit of spring colour simply by swapping the buttons for bright alternatives. Just a few hand sewn stitches can change the entire look with subtle hints of colour. Personalised pumps . With even Prada getting in on the act, personalised footwear is everywhere right now. But you can create your own one-of-a kind look by using a paintbrush to paint fabric dye onto the panels of your favourite Converse or plimsolls. Celebrity dye job . One way to revive hair for the new season is with an ombre style. Rather than transforming your locks with an all-new shade, why not choose pink tips. The flash of colour will refresh locks for spring. Lily Melrose supplied her style hacks in association with Gallo Family Vineyards Moscato.

"A chef has created a 10in-tall, half-kilogram burger piled with six forms of three different meats and containing a whopping 2,000 calories. The Whole Damn Farm, which costs £13.50, is the creation of Sam Longhurst, head chef of Splendid Kitchen, Manchester. He devised the mega meal - which contains two beef patties and a whole fried chicken thigh - after he was challenged by diners to create a burger containing three kinds of meat. The Whole Damn Farm burger features two beef burgers, homemade bacon jam, ham chunks, a whole chicken thigh, barbequed pulled pork and bacon rashers . Ready, get set, go! Customer Angela Fox gets ready to take on the mighty meat challenge . The monstrous meat feast has two beef burgers weighing 220g, a layer of homemade bacon jam, 100g of ham chunks and a 150g whole battered and fried chicken thigh. Added to that is 80g of barbequed pulled pork and four rashers of bacon all sandwiched between two brioche buns. With a meat equivalent of six Big Macs the burger was created after a customer presented with the restaurant's 'Cow & Chicken' burger - a feast in its own right - remarked, 'It's almost the whole damn farm.' Mr Longhurst said: 'We are always up for a challenge and when a customer seemed disappointed by a burger that only contained beef and chicken, we knew we had to take it one step further. 'You could say we've taken it several steps further as there are six different forms of meat on there. I think it'll keep the punters satisfied.' The head chef joined forces with owner Mike Edge to set out to achieve what might constitute a whole farmyard of animals in one meal. Chef Sam Longhurst from the Splendid Kitchen restaurant in Manchester with his mega burger . Encased between a semi-brioche bun are: . Two beef burgers weighing 220g . Layer of homemade bacon jam . 100g of ham chunks . A whole chicken thigh weighing 150g . 80g of barbequed pulled pork . Four rashers of bacon . Mr Longhurst, who lives in Salford with his wife and eight-year-old son Matthew, said: 'It's amusing when people are cocky and decide to go for it, as it's a monster of a burger and they don't realise that. I have only just managed to eat it myself. 'It's loads of fun making stuff that's a little bit ridiculous. I experiment with cooking at home too. 'Matthew and I will make homemade burgers stuffed with cheese and cold meats, so I think of The Whole Damn Farm burger as a supersized version of that. 'I think Matthew would be scared of it, to be honest, a burger the same size as his head.' Mr Edge said: 'We wanted something show-stopping; we haven't gone down the road of using crisps and sweets as toppings, where it starts to get silly. 'All our dishes are quite fresh-tasting with just the odd strange ingredient.'","Chef Sam Longhurst of Splendid Kitchen Manchester created the burger .

"They live in one of the remotest places on earth which means visitors, let alone royal ones, don't come along very often. Yesterday, though, locals living in the tiny township of Wuggubun in Western Australia got the surprise of their lives when Prince Harry turned up unannounced. The prince, who begun a month-long secondment to the Australian Defence Force on Monday, took an hour-long break at the village during a training exercise with a Norforce unit. Scroll down for video . Striking a pose: Prince Harry poses with members of the local community, including Mr Trust . 'He just rocked up,' said delighted Barry Trust, a resident of the tiny township which sits 600 miles away from the nearest city - Darwin. Mr Trust, who was speaking to ABC News, described the royal visitor as 'a real delightful chap' and revealed that Harry is enjoying the Outback so much, he's contemplating a move there. 'We've invited him back again some time,' said Mr Trust. 'He'd love to - he said he'd love to live out this way, to get away from the media. 'It was pretty exciting - especially for the kids.' Warm welcome: Prince Harry arrived in Australia on Monday for his month-long secondment . Agreed! He struck a pose next to a Redheads Rule sign but refused to pose for a selfie . Prince Harry has been in Australia since Monday and spent his first day  paying his respects at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Canberra before reporting for duty. He also found time to meet some of the locals and hit the headlines when he revealed his true feelings about selfie photos. 'Selfies are bad,' he said, when asked to strike a pose by a teenage fan. He added: 'I know you're young but just take a normal photograph.' The prince is scheduled to spend the next month in Australia and, once he comes to the end of his time with Norforce, will spend the rest of the month stationed in Sydney and Perth. Captain Wales, as he is known in the Army, will take part in urban training exercises and joint fire exercises among other activities. Saying hello: Harry's winning ways have endeared him to Australian locals from the start . All smiles: His first act upon arriving in Australia was to visit the tomb of the Unknown Soldier . Clown Prince! He was happy to pull funny faces for the amusement of one little girl while meeting wellwishers . He will also briefly travel back to Europe for a visit to Turkey alongside the Prince of Wales later this month where he will take part in a memorial service for the men who fought and died at Gallipoli. The World War I battle, which pitted British forces against the Ottoman Empire, claimed the lives of 34,000 British soldiers, 8,700 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders. Harry has served with the Australian Armed Forces in the past, most notably during his two tours of Afghanistan. 'He met [Australian troops] during the Invictus Games and even trekked to the South Pole with a couple of Australian soldiers,' said an aide. 'Those experiences reinforced the huge admiration and respect he already had for Australian servicemen and women and has stoked his enthusiasm even more to build on those relationships in the next four weeks. 'He knows he will learn a huge amount from his Australian colleagues during this attachment and he is grateful to the ADF for producing such a varied and interesting programme for him. 'He is also looking forward to learning how wounded, injured and ill servicemen and women are supported here in Australia and hopes to pass on some of his experience from his current role in the UK. 'Prince Harry has been to Australia twice before, so he knows he is in for a great experience. He particularly appreciates the opportunity to pay his respects to the fallen  and fully appreciates the significance of commemoration in this centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign.'","Prince Harry made a surprise visit to a remote Aboriginal village .

"Don McLean is selling the original manuscript and lyrics  to pop anthem American Pie, including a 'lost verse', which included a line about the music being 'reborn'. The singer-songwriter's 16-page collection is expected to fetch up to $1.5million (£1,006,303) at auction today, which offers tantalising new details about the famous anthem, originally released in 1971. In an interview published by Christie's auction house New York, where the manuscript is up for grabs today, McLean says American Pie is about 'heading in the wrong direction'. Scroll down for video . Original song: Christie's curator Tom Lecky holds the 16-page notes and manuscript for singer Don McLean's American Pie at Christie's auction house in New York . “It is becoming less idyllic. I don't know whether you consider that wrong or right but it is a morality song in a sense.' It has long been known that the song about 'the day the music died' refers to February 3, 1959, when rock n' roll icon Buddy Holly and fellow singers Ritchie Valens and J.P. 'Big Bopper' Richardson died in a plane crash. The eight-minute-long song was released in 1971 and was a No. 1 U.S. hit for four weeks in 1972. McLean, 69, a longtime Maine resident, says writing the song was 'a mystical trip into his past.'

"A video has emerged that shows the horrifying moment two French backpackers attempted to torch a native Australian quokka. The disturbing footage sees Thibaud Jean Leon Vallet, 24, and his cousin Jean Mickael Batrikian, 18, use a deodorant can and a lighter to set the marsupial alight in Rottnest Island on April 3. The men told Fairfax Media outside court on Saturday, 'you think we're monsters? We didn't hurt the quokka. We have pets at home.' Scroll down for video . Video has emerged showing the horrific moment two French tourists set alight an Australian quokka . Using a deodorant can and lighter, the men torch the defenseless creature which quickly scampers away . Both men are heard laughing uncontrollably after igniting the quokka before one said 'Don't do that, why?' The creature survived the incident by scampering away, but was singed by the flame. Both of the tourists pleaded guilty to animal cruelty at Fremantle Magistrate's Court on Friday. They were each fined $4000 and will be held behind bars for seven days if they fail to pay the fines. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Magistrate Elizabeth Langdon commented on their cruelty, calling the offence 'abhorrent.' 'One can only imagine the impact caused to the quokka,' she said. 'Obviously it would have been fearful as a result of what occurred.' The men can be heard uncontrollably laughing after igniting the native Australian creature . The quokka is a small wallaby and resembles a diminutive version of the kangaroo with thick brown fur . Both men were on a working holiday and were spending three months in Rottnest Island working as cleaners. As a result of the incident, both men lost their job. They also had their passports confiscated and are expected to be leaving Australia soon. The quokka, classed by the government as 'vulnerable', is a small wallaby and resembles a diminutive version of the kangaroo with thick, rough, grey-brown fur. It is found only in the south-west of Western Australia state and on the offshore islands of Rottnest and Bald.

"Hooked to ventilators in hospital beds, they were on the brink of death. These shocking photos show brothers Jeff and Joey Stallings, who were placed in medically-induced comas after taking a 'bad batch' of synthetic marijuana in their hometown of McComb, Mississippi. The siblings, both in their twenties, fell seriously ill earlier this month after smoking the drug, which is a mix of herbs that has been sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to marijuana. They were hospitalized on April 6, within hours of each other, when they collapsed after suffering from hallucinations, vomiting, night sweats and violent shaking. They had to be put on life support. Critically ill: This photo shows Jeff Stallings, who was placed in medically-induced coma alongside his older brother, Joey, after taking a 'bad batch' of synthetic marijuana in his hometown of McComb, Mississippi .

Above, Joey . BrothersL They were hospitalized on April 6, within hours of each other, when they collapsed after suffering from hallucinations, vomiting, night sweats and violent shaking. Above, the pair before their hospital stays . Fortunately, the pair rallied against the terrifying effects of the drug, and were able to return to home on April 13. However, they are now facing serious - and in Jeff's case, permanent - medical issues. And these issues are only complicated by the fact that the brothers are both addicted to synthetic marijuana, which is also dubbed Spice, Mojo, K2 and Bliss, and is much more toxic than cannabis. Now, their mother, Karen Stallings, has appealed to others not to smoke the drug, which she says has wrecked her sons' bodies and has left her youngest, Jeff, with permanent kidney damage. Speaking to DailyMail.com, she said: 'Seeing my sons in hospital was 10 times worse than what those photos show. It was just chilling. They were put in induced comas and had to fight for their lives. 'Fortunately, they fought the battle and they're now home. But they're not well at all. They're very, very addicted to it and want to get off it. They suffer from shakes, tremors and say random stuff. 'My youngest has to sit down because he gets dizzy. And he has permanent kidney damage. I'm afraid I'm going to lose him, that my son will die.

They had to fight for their lives' Above, Jeff (right) and Joey (left) on Facebook . The distraught mother, who also has two young daughters, said her sons had purchased a bag of Spice in McComb - as they had done on a regular basis - without realizing it was a bad batch. 'The stuff is all over the town. People are selling it in bags, and Jeff and Joey got a bad batch,' she told DailyMail.com. She added matter-of-factly: 'It's going to kill my kids. This is a serious issue.' Synthetic marijuana a mix of herbs that has been sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to traditional marijuana. It is nicknamed Spice, Mojo, K2, Yucatan Fire, Solar Flare and Bliss, among other things. The drug is typically smoked by users. It does not give positive results in tests for cannabis. Because the herbs and chemicals in synthetic marijuana vary, it is impossible for users to know what they are smoking. They also cannot tell what concentrations they are taking - which can lead to fatal overdoses. Unlike pot, Spice can cause a huge range of symptoms, many of which can be severe. These include tremors, paranoia, seizures, vomiting, hallucinations, chest pain, cardiac problems, kidney damage and brain damage. Because the herbs and chemicals in Spice vary, it is impossible for users to know what they are smoking and in what concentrations - which can potentially lead to fatal overdoses. Experts say the mixture can be up to 1,000 times stronger binding to cannabis receptors compared to traditional marijuana. This means it can activate a receptor on a brain cell with maximum efficacy. In doing so, it can cause severe tremors, shakes, seizures, vomiting, hallucinations, and other frightening symptoms. Ms Stallings, who works at Santa Fe Cattle Co in McComb, said her sons were left 'flipping out'. 'They got scared,' she said. 'It was damaging their bodies. They just mentally shut down.' Family friend Jess Hurley posted the harrowing images of the brothers hooked to life support machines on her Facebook page earlier this month, asking people to pray for their family. She wrote: 'These are my friend's sons. I taught the man on the right [Jeff] how to walk and talk as a baby. 'The man on the left is his older brother. They are both on life support at this very moment because of synthetic marijuana. (Spice, mojo, whatever..) It's just not worth it.

Raising awareness: Family friend Jess Hurley posted the images of the brothers hooked to life support machines on her Facebook page earlier this month, asking people to pray for their family (pictured) 'People smoke it because it doesn't show up in drug tests.

Last year, California teenager Connor Eckhardt died after smoking one hit of synthetic marijuana. Connor, 19, fell asleep after taking the drug. His brain, deprived of oxygen, began to swell and he slipped into a coma. He was declared brain dead at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach hours later. A deadly case: Last year, California teen Connor Eckhardt died after smoking one hit of synthetic marijuana.

'He gave into (peer pressure) - thinking that it was okay, it was somehow safe - and one hit later, he goes to sleep and never wakes up,' Connor’s father, Devin Eckhardt told KTLA at the time. Doctors were unable to detect spice in Connor's system - there is no way to trace its everchanging components. However, they knew he had taken it after finding the package of the drug in his pocket. Connor's family donated his organs after his death, in accordance with the teenager's wishes. They later created a Facebook page to warn others about the perils of synthetic marijuana.

"The #grannyhair trend may still be going strong for women the world over, but it seems men will always hold the crown for rocking the grey  look - as David Beckham proved earlier this week. Victoria Beckham posted a pic of her husband on Instragram on Tuesday and, due to the wispy grey strands peppering his beard, captioned it 'silver fox'. With his 40th birthday just around the corner, it seems David is embracing his age with style, and he's not the only one. Victoria Beckham shared this picture of her husband David sporting some grey hairs in his beard . From old-school stars surfing the silver quiff to salt-and-peppered Hollywood hunks, men are getting more and more comfortable about embracing the distinguished look. Scott Ade, a stylist at Daniel Hersheson believes that celebrities are responsible for the change in attitude to going grey, he said: 'I feel like since the huge rise to fame of grey-haired sex symbols such as George Clooney, George Lamb and Jose Mourinho, there has been a shift in attitudes towards going grey. 'People are starting to embrace it now, seeing it as a sign of power, maturity and sexiness in the mould of the 'silver fox', as opposed to becoming a pensioner!' Here, FEMAIL takes a look at more male celebrities who win gold for their silver style, and asks top stylists for tips on how men can go grey gracefully. THE TREND SETTERS . George Lamb is a serious trendsetter, helping to make it cool for young men to embrace the grey . At the ripe-old age of 35, radio and TV presenter George Lamb rocks a full head of grey hair. It even has its own trendy mix of dark grey with light streaks around his forehead. George keeps his hair long and floppy, so he's clearly proud of his locks, and rightly so. Along with his smart fashion sense, Lamb is a serious trendsetter, helping to make it cool for young men to embrace the grey. Brad Pitt may be an oldie - well in Hollywood terms anyway, he's 51 - but this chiseled actor has been setting trends ever since he hit the spotlight in Thelma and Louise. Some of them caught on (hello blonde highlights), others, thankfully, didn't (we're thinking primarily of his long-haired hobo look here). This salt and pepper stubble will be a timeless addition to the Brad Pitt collection of hair styles . But we think we can safely say his salt-and-pepper stubble will be a timeless addition to the Brad Pitt collection of hair styles. If you're a football widow, you'll already be well aware of Jose Mourinho, 52. This grey-haired Portugese gentleman is arguably the best thing about watching a Chelsea match. The there's the lovable Gary Lineker, whose baby face keeps him looking eternally youthful at the age of 54 despite his quiff of silver. As well as making footie more bearable for us, these two show stressed-out footie fans that it's okay to go grey. If you're a football widow, you'll already be well aware of silver fox Jose Mourinho, 52 . The ladies love grey-haired Gary Linker. Pictured on the right with Catt Sadler and Danielle Bux . THE EMBRACERS . Growing old under the spotlight must give even the most cocky celebrity a crisis of confidence. As they get older, many have to dye their hair for roles, but these gents let it all grow out once the cameras stop rolling. Ben Affleck's grey-flecked quiff looks distinguished, while his silvery stubble adds an edge. No doubt the 42-year-old has been getting greying tips from his friend and fellow silver fox, George Clooney. No doubt Ben Affleck's been getting greying tips from his friend George Clooney . He may be greying, but we can't believe Liam Neeson is 62 years old. The Irish hunk dyed his hair dark for the first Taken, but can be seen greying around the temples. He's naturally a light brown with gingery tinge, and we think the grey sets this off perfectly. American actor Dermot Mulroney, 51, caught Jennifer Aniston's interest, well in Friends anyway, and Julia Roberts made a fool of herself over him in My Best Friend's Wedding. And with those looks and mop of dark grey hair, we can see why... Liam Neeson's grey sets off his coppery mop, while Dermot Mulroney oozes silvery sophistication . Everyone's favourite Scot, Gerard Butler has still got a good head of brown locks with copper highlights at the age of 45, but he's not afraid to let a few silver strands run wild on his chin and around his temples. Matt Leblanc had no trouble with the ladies when he played dark-haired Italian-American Joey Tribbiani in Friends. Now 47, he has traded in his floppy locks for a short shock of silver. But we reckon he could still work his famous 'how you doin'?' line and have ladies falling at his feet - although now they may have more trouble getting back up again. Gerard Butler's not afraid to let a few silver strands run wild on his chin and around his temples . We reckon Matt Leblanc could still work Joey's famous 'how you doin'?' line and have ladies falling at his feet . Colin Farrell is not yet in the forties club (he's 38), but Hollywood's Irish bad boy has the 'take me as I am' attitude, and his refusal to dye his grey streaks is testament to that. Eric Dana is 42 now, but he was working the grey look back in 2006 as Dr Mark Sloan in Grey's Anatomy. And this programme was well named indeed, as fellow Grey actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan, 48, also knows how to make silvery stubble look seriously dreamy. Colin Farrell shows off his rebellious grey streak, and Eric Dana subscribes to the all-over look . Grey's Anatomy actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan knows how to make silvery stubble look good . Tips supplied by Jordan Garrett and Scott Ade from Daniel Hersheson, and Laura Howlett, Managing Barber of L’Oréal Professionnel salon, Ruffians Edinburgh . THE OLDIES BUT GOODIES . As soon as the term 'silver fox' is mentioned, the first man who usually springs to mind is George Clooney. Checking out his big brown barnet back in 1985, we'd say it's a good thing Clooney has been embracing the silver look since he was 33. Now, the always-dapper 53-year-old is the epitome of the grey-haired gent. Kevin Costner is another classic, with his fair-haired mop ensuring the gradual fade to grey wasn't too big a jump, and the 60-year-old has maintained his Hollywood heartthrob status with ease. Checking out his big brown barnet back in 1985, we'd say it's a good thing Clooney has been embracing the silver look since he was 33. Despite going grey, 60-year-old Kevin Costner has maintained his Hollywood heartthrob status with ease . Arguably most of us had our first confusing crush on Richard Gere when he was in Pretty Woman - 'how can I fancy a grey-haired guy?' - but our crush continues as he's still looking good 25 years later. Age seems to have added character to lucky Pierce Brosnan, whose dark looks have been lightened by his mid-grey hair and silvery beard. It may have been 20 years since the 61-year-old played Bond, but he still leaves us shaken - and stirred.

"The NHS handed out 404,500 prescriptions for suncream at a cost of £13million in 2014 and 4.7million prescriptions for indigestion pills costing£29million, damning analysis has found (file image) The NHS is spending millions on prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste, a damning analysis has found. Some patients are even being given hangover tablets and Yakult yogurt drinks. Critics said it was ‘ludicrous’ that such items were being handed out when the NHS was rationing routine treatments. It has prompted concern that patients are abusing the system by demanding prescriptions for household essentials which are cheaply available at their local chemist. The figures came on the day that Britain was ranked only 27th in the world for health and wellness – below Slovenia, Spain and Portugal – and 111th out of 133 countries for obesity. In 2014, the NHS handed out 404,500 prescriptions for suncream at a cost of £13million. Another 4.7million prescriptions for indigestion pills cost £29million, while 1.4million were written out for multi-vitamins, at £4.2million. Other bathroom cabinet items routinely being prescribed by GPs include Calpol, Vaseline, Strepsils and toothpaste, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Roger Goss of Patient Concern said: ‘This is ludicrous. Every week we hear of patients being denied another cancer treatment or refused cataracts while others are being prescribed toothpaste. Whoever is prescribing this or authorising it must have completely lost their mind.’ Doctors admit that some patients abuse the system and arrive at surgeries with shopping lists of toiletries and remedies. But their contract states they must prescribe any medication they think is ‘necessary’, meaning patients can claim that most remedies are needed even if they are cheaply available from a chemist. The NHS is facing a huge black hole in its finances, with chief executive Simon Stevens predicting that by 2020/21, there will be a gap of at least £8billion in its annual budget. Only last month it stopped providing funding for 19 life-extending cancer treatments because there was not enough money to pay for all the patients who needed them. The NHS has also been forced to ration many routine treatments which are considered to be non-urgent, such as hip and knee replacements and cataract operations. Dr Anita Sharma, a senior GP in Oldham, Greater Manchester, said patients come into her surgery every week wanting prescriptions for head lice shampoo, which can be bought for £5 from the chemist. ‘We need to take a different approach to prescribing,’ she said. ‘Primary care must focus on ensuring the use of the right medicine, for the right patient and at the right dose. ‘This does not mean a script for every ill. We certainly cannot afford to waste NHS money [on what] can be bought over the counter.’ Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The vast majority of hard-pressed families have to pay for their own everyday essentials, and taxpayers will be furious if others are gaming the system. 'We must tighten up the rules on these giveaways and give GPs more flexibility, ensuring that only those who really need them receive them.’ Critics have branded the prescriptions for regular bathroom cabinet items such as Vaseline, Calpol, suncream, toothpaste and multi-vitamins as 'ludicrous' at time of financial crisis for the NHS (file picture) The Mail analysed figures from the HSCIC’s prescription cost analysis, an audit of all drugs handed out on the NHS by GPs, nurses and pharmacists. In England, most patients are charged a fee of £8.20 for each prescription. But certain groups can get them for free, including the under-16s, the over-60s, pregnant women or new mothers and adults on benefits. Some patients eligible for free prescriptions have been swapping tips on how to get them for Calpol and Gaviscon on the MoneySavingExpert and Mumsnet websites. And in 2012, a GP from Glasgow, Scotland, described how patients were coming into his surgery with ‘shopping lists’ of items including nappy rash cream and moisturisers. Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association’s GPs committee, said: ‘GPs have a duty to prescribe where there is clinical need. ‘What we don’t want to see is anyone abusing the system. The whole prescribing system needs to be looked at.’ The figures revealed that 1.1billion prescriptions were written in 2014 – more than 2,000 a minute and a rise of 3 per cent compared to the previous year. A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘GPs are responsible for only issuing appropriate prescriptions to their patients, and these figures underline the importance of ensuring that’s what happens everywhere.’","NHS gave out 404,500 prescriptions for suncream at a cost of £13m in 2014 .

"Disturbing images of a 15-year-old girl who is said to have undergone major cosmetic surgery are being circulated on Chinese social media. The teenager from the Henan province in central China has been labelled 'too beautiful too look at'. Going by the name Lee Hee Danae, she has a shocking 400,000 followers on her Weibo account - a Chinese social media platform - which states her birthday is May, 1999. Scroll down for video . The woman who claims to be just 15-years-old has drastically transformed her appearance . The teenager from the Henan province in central China appears to have had surgery on her jaw, chin and eyes . One of the comments about the underage girl has over 24,000 likes on Chinese internet portal Tencent, according to the Shangaiist. The girl reportedly underwent the procedures to win over an ex boyfriend, according to Chinese website cbg.cn. Others have hinted the photographs may not be real or are digitally enhanced. She is also referred to as 'snake spirit', relating to a Chinese folk tale, because of her pale skin. However, plastic surgery - particularly operations such as double eyelid surgery and rhinoplasty - are increasingly popular in China. Many women undergo surgery to give the jawline a more narrow heart-shape and make their faces look more like the shape of a V, seen as a sign of beauty in China. She has gained over 400,000 fans on her Chinese social media account Weibo - a hybrid of Twitter and Facebook . In some photos she has bluey green eyes and in other images her eyes are dark brown . The most popular procedures give women wide eyes and narrow faces with pointed chins. To achieve this many women undergo facial contouring - a highly invasive procedure that involves changing the shape of the face by shaving off bone from the cheeks, jaw and chin. Others adopt for double jaw realignment surgery. Plastic surgery has become increasingly popular in China in recent years, with many women seeing it as an opportunity to enhance their professional prospects. Last year Chinese women were reported to be entering South Korea in droves to seek plastic surgery because of the number of surgeons there and the popularity of South Korean celebrities. The practice was so widespread that some women were rendered almost unrecognisable and hospitals resorted to handing out plastic surgery certificates, which included their name and passport number, so they could re-enter China. Some people have hinted the photographs may not be digitally altered to enhance her surgery further . The girl apparently had the surgery in an attempt to win back an ex boyfriend . Plastic surgery is a huge business in South Korea and the popularity in China only helps to increase the profile of surgeons. However the amount of money that can be made by the industry has led to a number of illegal clinics springing up in South Korea. Earlier this year a 50-year-old Chinese woman was declared brain dead after she visited a small clinic in Seoul, which had previously been warned about carrying out activities against the country's health regulations. Operations to slim faces and increase the size of noses are common in China, while women also seek to have excess skin on their eyelids removed to make their eyes appear larger. China is renowned for its extreme cosmetic procedures. Last year a man reportedly had several procedures to look like Lei Feng, a Chinese soldier who became the face of communist party propaganda in the 1960s.","The 15-year-old girl is said to have undergone the operations in China .

"The former sister-in-law of a man who has been charged with the murder of his second wife and is being investigated over the mysterious death of his first wife has said that she feared she might have been next. Henthorn was charged with the murder of second wife, Toni Bertolet, 51, last November and police have reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife, Lynn Rishell, some 20 years earlier. In both cases Henthorn was named as the sole beneficiary in a string of lucrative life insurance policies totaling $500,000 on the death of his first wife and $4.5million on the death of his second. And Lynn Rishell's brother's wife, Grace Rishell, has opened up to say that the FBI told her about a secret $400,000 life insurance policy Henthorn had taken out on her, too. Scroll down for video . Grace Rishell was Herald Henthorn's first wife Lynn Rishell's sister-in-law. She said that the FBI told her about a secret $400,000 life insurance policy Henthorn had taken out on her . Henthorn (left), pictured with Grace (center) and Lynn (right) Rishell, was named as the sole beneficiary in a string of lucrative life insurance policies totaling $500,000 on the death of his first wife and $4.5million on the death of his second after they both died in what appeared to be freak accident . He had forged her signature and made himself the sole beneficiary on the policy, Rishell told CBS's 48 Hours. 'That was his doing. I did not authorize that policy,' she said. 'He profits, not my girls. I feel he came in and just preyed on my vulnerability.' Both of Henthron's wives died in 'freak' accidents to which Henthorn, 59, was the sole witness. Dr Toni Jill Bertolet plunged 140ft to her death shortly before her 12th wedding anniversary while hiking with Henthorn in a remote stretch of Rocky Mountain National Park. Lynn Rishell - his first wife - was crushed to death under the front of Henthorn's Jeep when, he told first responders, the jack gave way as she reached under the vehicle for a lug night while changing a flat tire in the dark. 'I think it's logical to conclude that he was planning on taking my life at some point,' Grace Rishell said. 'He's a dangerous man... He needs to be behind bars.' Grace Rishell was going through a divorce and ‘concerned for her financial stability,’ when she initially agreed to Henthorn taking out a policy that would pay $50,000 to Grace’s brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $250,000. Lynn Rishell - Henthorn's first wife - was crushed to death under the front of Henthorn's Jeep when, he told first responders, the jack gave way as she reached under the vehicle for a lug night while changing a flat tire in the dark . Henthorn's second wife, Toni Jill Bertolet, plunged 140ft to her death shortly before her 12th wedding anniversary while hiking with Henthorn in a remote stretch of Rocky Mountain National Park . According to prosecutors in Bertolet’s murder case, ‘the evidence will show that Henthorn had a romantic interest in Rishell’. But Rishell had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through. Instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer. Unbeknownst to her ‘her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well,’ with Henthorn making payments on the policy until December 2012 and listing himself as sole beneficiary. The policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that Henthorn had no insurable interest in Rishell. But the very fact of its existence raises the specter that Henthorn had Rishell in his sights as a third potential victim. Henthorn was arrested on November 6 when FBI apprehended him as he returned home after dropping his nine-year-old daughter, Hayley, at school. His indictment was the result of a prolonged investigation during which the FBI eavesdropped on his telephone conversations, combed through his finances, scrutinized his employment history and concluded that the ‘freak’ hiking accident that claimed the mother-of-one’s life was murder. Henthorn was charged with the murder of Bertolet, 51, last November and police have reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife, Lynn Rishell, some 20 years earlier . Henthorn and Lynn Rishell when he was a new geology graduate from Virginia. The couple moved to Colorado, where after 12 years of marriage, she died in a 'freak accident', now said to be murder . He was denied bail by US District Judge Kathleen Latoyfa who described him as a ‘danger’ and said, ‘there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second’ and pointed to large sums of money recently transferred by Henthorn to his brother as suggestive that he was ‘hiding funds.’ Though Henthorn claimed to work as a fundraiser for a charity the economic crime auditor for the US Attorney found no evidence that the geology graduate from Virginia had any earnings other than some in 1993, 1999 and 2000. The only job he appears to have had was one briefly held in the petroleum industry – the job that saw him and his then new bride, Lynn Rishell, move from their hometown of Harrington, Virginia, across the country to Colorado. The prosecution’s case against Henthorn highlights the similarities between both his wives’ passing – not least the substantial windfall both saw him set to receive. Both ‘freak accidents’ occurred at remote locations with Henthorn the lone witness. Both occurred after about 12 years of marriage and Henthorn told wildly varying stories about both deaths. Both ‘freak accidents’ occurred at remote locations with Henthorn the lone witness. Both occurred after about 12 years of marriage and Henthorn, pictured here with his first wife, Rishell, told wildly varying stories about both deaths. An autopsy carried out on Bertolet concluded that she ‘died as a result of multiple blunt force injuries when she fell or was pushed down a cliff’ According to prosecution documents Henthorn even told a Sunday school class that his first wife died of cancer and that she lost a baby she was carrying to chemotherapy. In the case of his second wife, two years before her death Bertolet almost died when she was struck by a wooden beam Henthorn had thrown off the deck of their cottage. After that incident Henthorn joked to friends, ‘I was trying to kill my wife.’ Investigators have also established that Henthorn ‘extensively scouted’ the fatal hike trail. Contrary to what he told law enforcement he made nine different trips to the area around Rocky Mountain Park that summer. The fortnight before their anniversary – the date of her death – Henthorn had hiked six trails to ‘find the perfect one for the trip.’ And damningly a map found in his car showed the spot where Bertolet fell to her death, marked with a pink X. In both  Rishell and Bertolet’s deaths Henthorn was eager to have his wives’ bodies cremated quickly despite family requests against it and, disturbingly, he spread both women’s ashes on the same mountain near Ouray, Colorado. A hearing for the civil case is scheduled for later this month while a trial date of May 4 -15 has been set for the murder case of Bertolet to which Henthorn has entered a not guilty plea.","In November Harold Henthorn was charged with murdering his second wife in criminal trial which will also hear that he killed his first wife .

"Mexican restaurant Chipotle has been leaving customers hungry for certain ingredients unsatisfied because not enough farms can meet its strict standards. The fast-casual chain, which plans on having 2,000 stores by the end of the year, removed carnitas pork burritos from roughly a third of its locations in January, but still doesn't have a stable supply of the meat. Chipotle, which dropped one of its pork vendors earlier this year, only uses humanely-raised pigs that have not received added hormones, though they have become harder to acquire after demand has risen. Fast-casual chain Chipotle says that it does not know when it will have enough pork to supply all of its stores with sustainably raised meat for its carnitas burritos (file photo) 'We don’t know for sure when we’ll be fully supplied again,' Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold told Bloomberg. The restaurant's pigs also need access to the outdoors and living spaces with large supplies of straw for their meat to make it into Chipotle burritos, tacos and bowls. Other retailers such as grocery store chain Kroger have begun taking up some of Chipotle's ethical standards. McDonald's pledged to stop using chickens treated with antibiotics at its stores in the next two years. The grocer and Dunkin Donuts have both said they will stop using pork from farms with gestation crates, where sows are kept in two-foot wide containers and are repeatedly impregnated without being able to move. The carnitas pork shoulder meat at Chipotle (pictured in burrito) comes from pigs that are raised outside or in living spaces with large supplies of straw (file photo) However, fewer than five per cent of pigs in the US are raised in a way that meets Chipotle's standards, according to CBS. It has been rotating its small supply of pork, of which it uses only pork shoulder, to different stores so that each location can have carnitas at least sometimes. Farmers are wary of the increased production cost for premium, antibiotic-free pork and worry about finding people to pay an appropriate price for the 'premium' meat after Denver-based Chipotle has the bits it wants. Chipotle said that supply constraints were behind 6.3 per cent price increases last year. As of Thursday morning, its stock price had fallen more than five points since news of the continued shortage was published Wednesday. Chipotle says that constraints on receiving supplies that met their standards led to 6.3 per cent price increases last year (file photo) When sustainably raised beef runs out, the store uses conventionally raised cows, but it views the conditions of factory farmed pigs by the world's biggest pork producers as particularly bad. Beyond the farming side, regular US pork production was also criticized earlier this year by meat inspectors after several of the nation's slaughterhouses transferred to a new system that increases the numbers of hogs killed per minute to 1,300. Whistleblowers from the United States Department of Agriculture said that toenails, hair and fecal matter may be creeping into Americans' pork under the new regulations. Chipotle's most popular protein is chicken, with only seven per cent of entree orders calling for carnitas. The restaurant has also warned of possible guacamole shortages.","Mexican restaurant chain cut carnitas pork from third of stores this year .

"Suddenly, in the middle of the New York night, Edward Snowden's familiar bespectacled face appeared - deep in a public park. A 4-foot-high, 100-pound sculpted bust of the infamous NSA whistle-blower now exiled in Russia was sneaked into Brooklyn's Fort Greene Park in the pre-dawn hours Monday. Animal New York, a city news website that first reported the incident, said the mysterious perpetrators were a trio of guerrilla artists — admirers of the former government contractor who had leaked thousands of pages of classified information from the National Security Agency detailing a massive domestic spying program to the media. Scroll down for video . Illicit tribute: A group of anonymous artists erected a 4-foot-tall plaster bust of Edward Snowden, the former US spy agency contractor famous for leaking classified information, in Brooklyn's Fort Greene Park early Monday morning . Looks familiar? The artists spent six months and $30,000 working on a life-like effigy of the 31-year-old whistle-blower (left) who has been living in exile in Moscow since 2013 . Perfect fit: The activists hoisted the bust to the top of a Revolutionary War memorial . The activists hoisted the unsanctioned bust to the top of a Revolutionary War memorial and secured it with an adhesive material, adding his name to a column, according to Animal New York. The website says the group allowed it to document installation of the statue on the condition that it not reveal the identities of the artists. Snowden's artistic appearance was short-lived. At daybreak, police said city parks officials ordered the sculpted Snowden removed from the top of Prison Ship Martyrs Monument, which honors the 11,500 patriots who died aboard British prison ships during the Revolutionary War. And by evening, his bust was being held at Brooklyn's 88th Precinct pending an investigation. The idea for the tribute was conceived by two New York City-based artists, joined by a West Coast sculptor, Animal New York said. In a statement to the online outlet, they said they had 'updated' the memorial to American POWs who died during the war for independence 'to highlight those who sacrifice their safety in the fight against modern-day tyrannies. 'It would be a dishonor to those memorialized here to not laud those who protect the ideals they fought for, as Edward Snowden has by bringing the NSA's 4th-Amendment-violating surveillance programs to light. From Russia with love: The statue appeared just hours after HBO aired comedian John Oliver's interview with Snowden on his weekly show Last Week Tonight (pictured) Cover-up: By noon, employees of the New York City Parks Department arrived on the scene and covered the unsanctioned artwork with a blue tarp . Rogue art: The parks department said the erection of any unapproved structure or artwork in a city park is illegal . Snowden selfie: Park-goers rushed to document the impromptu art installation before it was removed . Blended in: The color and style of the artwork matched the rest of the monument so well that many people walking their dogs in the park early Monday morning did not notice anything amiss . 'Our goal is to bring a renewed vitality to the space and prompt even more visitors to ponder the sacrifices made for their freedoms. We hope this inspires them to reflect upon the responsibility we all bear to ensure our liberties exist long into the future.' Following Edward Snowden's well-documented defection to Russia in 2013, the 31-year-old whistle-blower has emerged as a highly polarizing figure in the national debate, with the Obama administration and right-wing politicians labeling him a traitor, and those on the left praising him for exposing broad civil rights violations by the intelligence community. ‘If you look at history, the people we honor with statues now — certainly the people rebelling against the British rules — were criminals one day,’ the creators of the Snowden bust told Mashable. ‘Now they're heroes. We’re wondering if on the long arc of time Snowden will be considered a hero, too.’ It took the anonymous artists six months  to sculpt, mold and cast Snowden's likeness worth $30,000 out of a high-quality plaster-like material called hydrocal, and then have it shipped to New York. Towering figure: Snowden has emerged as a highly polarizing figure in the aftermath of his defection to Russia in 2013 . The artists said they chose the monument in the  park because it honors the 11,500 American patriots who died aboard British prison ships during the Revolutionary War . To be continued? The activists said they still have a mold of the statue and a 3D rendering of it, so they are capable of creating multiple copies in various sizes . The color and style of the artwork matched the rest of the monument so perfectly that many people walking their dogs in the park early Monday morning did not bat an eye at the sight of the notorious whistle-blower's face staring down at them from the top of a pillar. By noon, New York City parks officials wrapped the bronze-colored bust with a blue tarp and yanked it from the pedestal. The block letters spelling Snowdon’s name below a brass eagle were also removed. Workers had to use a pulley to lower the illicit artwork to the ground and load onto a truck to haul it away. ‘The erection of any unapproved structure or artwork in a city park is illegal,’ the parks department said in a statement. The guerrilla artists apparently knew going in that their bold tribute to Snowden was not long for this world. Down he goes: Workers had to use a pulley to lower the illicit artwork to the ground . Hauled away: The illicit bust was taken to a local police precinct pending an investigation . ‘We look at this as a gift to the city, but, you know, gifts are sometimes not accepted,’ one of the activist said in a video about the project titled Prison Ship Martyrs Monument 2.0. The installation of the sculpture came hours after HBO aired John Oliver's interview with Edward Snowden on the comedian’s show Last Week Tonight. ‘I do miss my country,’ he told Oliver. ‘I do miss my home. I do miss my family.’ As for Snowden's plaster likeness, it may not be the last time it pops up in a public space. The activists said they still have a mold of the statue and a 3D rendering of it, so they are capable of creating multiple copies in various sizes and spreading them around the country.","Activists installed Snowden's bust on top of century-old Prison Ship Martyrs Monument at Fort Greene Park before dawn Monday .

"A pregnant woman who went into a coma woke up to learn she gave birth to a baby boy. Sharista Giles of Sweetwater, Tennessee, was driving home from a concert in December with friends when a car accident sent her to the hospital with injuries so bad doctors believed she would never recover. The 20-year-old was five months pregnant at the time and in January doctors were forced to deliver the baby early, a little boy the family refers to as Baby L. And now, Giles has finally seen her newborn after waking up from her coma on Wednesday. Sharista Giles (above) of Sweetwater, Tennessee woke up on Wednesday after being in a coma for five months . Giles was five months pregnant (above) when she went into the coma, and a month later doctors were forced to deliver her son, who the family calls Baby L, who she saw for the first time Wednesday . Giles' family told ABC News that she opened her eyes, and soon began following her father's movements around the room. Then, her father showed her a photo of her son. 'He showed her a picture of her baby, and she followed the picture,' said her mother, Beverly. 'When he turned around to put it back on the bulletin board, she turned her neck, her whole head trying to follow and find the picture again.' Baby L (above in utero) weighed just two pounds when he was born and though he is still in the neonatal intensive care unit he now weighs over six pounds . Giles (above) prognosis is still not known, but she has shocked doctors who believed she would not make it out of her coma or even live this long . Baby L meanwhile is doing well, but still in the neonatal intensive care unit at the University of Tennessee Medical Center. He was less than two pounds when he was born, but since then has been greatly improving and now weighs 6 pounds and 4 ounces. As for Giles, doctors are still not certain of her prognosis, but she has done far better than they ever expected when she was admitted last December. This is no surprise however to her family. 'We never gave up,' said her mother. 'She's fought this hard.'","Sharista Giles of Sweetwater, Tennessee woke up on Wednesday after being in a coma for five months .

"The surrender of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee to Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant 150 years ago on Thursday was a milestone event in the end of the Civil War. Thursday's commemoration in Appomattox, Virginia, included a reenactment of Lee's last clash with Grant's troops and of the Confederate surrender in a Virginia farmhouse on April 9, 1865. Ahead of the battle reenactment, the boys of the Confederate 11th Virginia were a seemingly pretty cool bunch as those portraying Union troops gathered several fields away at Appomattox Court House amid the rolling farm country dotted by neat brick buildings and white picket fences. In April 1865, however, the troops weren't as calm. Lee's forces were in a state of growing disarray in the hours before Lee formally called it quits. Scroll down for video .

American Civil War re-enactors dressed as Union cavalry drill early in the morning at the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park . Ragged, hungry Southern soldiers, many straggling and on the run from federal forces, began giving up alone and in small bunches even before the official surrender. Days earlier that month, the Union Army had already smashed their way into the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. Lee's forces, seeking an escape route, had crossed the Appomattox River while burning bridges. Union forces 'attacked them vigorously' in the hours before the official surrender, convincing Lee the fight was over. The last days accounts were cited as saying 'the road for miles was strewn with broken down wagons, caissons, and baggage of all kinds, presenting a scene seldom witnessed on the part of Lee's army.' But in 2015, a stoic Chris Ferree couldn't contain his excitement when asked about his role in the 150th commemoration of Lee's surrender here, effectively ending the Civil War 150 years ago on Thursday. 'This is an awesome place to be,' said Ferree, a Roanoke resident. 'We're all excited to be here.' The Confederate re-enactors were a ragtag, mismatched group of heavy wool coats, ill-fitting trousers and more types of hats than a haberdashery. Dozens stood along a rough wooden fence, their muskets stacked at the ready. American Civil War re-enactors portraying Confederate artillery fire several of their cannons during the re-enactment .

The Union and Southern re-enactors spent the night encamped in tents at Appomattox Court House National Historical Park. The smell of wood smoke greeted the first of thousands of visitors expected to throng the park for several days of commemorative events. The outline of Union troops in formation could be seen in fields as visitors approached the park. Perry Miller of Salisbury, a re-enactor with the North Carolina 28th from Salisbury, explained the strategy succinctly: 'We're trying to break through the Union lines.' Thomas Holbrook, a park ranger on loan from Gettysburg to Appomattox, went down the line of re-enactors for a quick briefing before battle. 'This is part of what I like to call the armistice that was signed on April 9, when Gen. Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia,' he said. In a place where historically accurate fashions abound, the Rufeners of Ohio stood out. Cousins by marriage, Kim and Mary Rufener carefully stepped through soaked turf and muddy roads at Appomattox to keep their hoop skirts mud-free.

Amid the hundreds if not thousands lined along a fence watching a battle re-enactment, the two women drew attention as they posed for photographs. 'It just enhances the experience for us,' Kim Rufener said amid the startling booms of cannon fire and the crackle of muzzle fire. 'It makes it more alive. 'It's an important part of history that we need to remember.' 'We're just having fun,' Mary added. Asked if the reproduction outfit had hampered her travels, Mary said, 'Well, it is muddy.' She modestly lifted the hem of her hoop skirt, revealing laced black boots that were slightly muddied. Mary's husband Mark joined the two wearing a formal waist jacket and coachman's hat. He finished off the look with a cravat. The Rufeners have been to other Civil War commemorative events, but Appomattox was the first in period costumes.  'This is a big deal,' Mary Rufener said, adding 'We won't be around for the 200th.'

"Survivors of the Boston Marathon bombing returned to the site of the deadly blasts on Tuesday as they marked the second anniversary of the tragedy. Among them, the family of eight-year-old Martin Richard, the youngest victim to lose his life in the April 15, 2013 attack, headed to Boylston Street to help officials unveil commemorative banners. Four orange signs each bearing a white heart and the word 'Boston' were placed at the site. They were mounted on poles wrapped in blue and yellow flowers, the marathon's colors, to mark the tragedy that took three lives and left more than 260 others injured. Martin's older brother Henry and younger sister Jane, who lost a leg in the explosion, helped unwrap one of the flags on the street as bagpipes played during the low-key ceremony.

Memories: The family takes a moment to reflect at the scene as a ceremony to mark the anniversary begins . The family of Krystle Campbell, who also died in the attacks, helped unwrap another banner with the help of Governor Charlie Baker. Also at the ceremony was Jeff Bauman, who lost both legs in the bombings. His ashen face was captured in a now-iconic photograph as he was wheeled away by strangers. One of those strangers, Carlos Arredondo, is now a close friend. Arredondo, who became known as 'the man in the cowboy hat' was also at the site on Tuesday morning to greet Bauman as he walked on prosthetic limbs. 'We're here to pay tribute to the people who lost their lives,' Bauman told WFXT-TV. They were joined by city officials including Mayor Marty Walsh and Governor Charlie Baker. At 2.49pm, a moment of silence was held to mark the moment the first of two bombs exploded near the finish line two years ago, while church bells sounded throughout the city. Well-wishers visited the site of the explosions throughout Tuesday to pay tribute to the young people who had lost their lives, and stopped to pay their respects at a memorial bearing their names. Mayor Walsh has declared April 15 'One Boston Day,' on which Bostonians are encouraged to perform random acts of kindness and generosity.

'In many respects, those most affected by the events of two years ago have shown us all the way back - with their courage, grace and determination,' Governor Baker said in a statement released after the ceremony. 'They honor the past, remember and treasure loved ones lost and injured, and look forward to a better future. We should strive to do the same.'

"The British father of a 15-year-old who plunged 19 storeys to her death in an apparent suicide left court holding hands with his partner, after she was charged with 'wilful neglect'. Managing director Nick Cousins looked visibly upset and his Filipino wife Herminia Garcia was shaking when they emerged from the court in the Sai Wai Ho suburb of Hong Kong, after she was granted bail. The 53-year-old was arrested after her teenage daughter, Blanca Cousins, fell from the 19th floor of their luxury apartment in Hong Kong on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Nick Cousins left the Hong Kong court clutching the hand of his wife Herminia Garcia, who is charged with wilful neglect following the death of their 15-year-old daughter, Blanca Cousins, in an apparent suicide . The couple did not make a statement after they left court. Mr Cousins was also arrested on suspicion of 'ill treatment' after it emerged Blanca's birth had not been registered, but he has not been charged and is on bail . Blanca Cousins, 15, fell to her death from the luxury Hong Kong apartment block where she lived on Tuesday in an apparent suicide. It has emerged her birth, and that of her 14-year-old sister, was never registered . She was charged with wilful neglect and being in the country illegally for more than 20 years. Mr Cousins, 57, was also arrested on suspicion of ‘ill treatment’ after it emerged that Blanca’s birth, and that of her 14-year-old sister, had not registered. It is also alleged that they did not attend school. He has not been charged and is currently on bail. The couple refused to comment as they left Eastern Magistrates Court and were whisked away in a black Mercedes. A spokesman for the family said: 'The court has determined for the time being the family should stay together, we ask that you respect their privacy at this difficult time. We have nothing further to say at the moment.' Police have applied for a 'care and protection' order for the couple's other child, but she is back with them pending a court hearing. The luxury apartment block in Hong Kong where the Cousins lived, and 15-year-old Blanca fell to her death . Herminia Garcia moved to Hong Kong from the Philippines in the nineties to work as a domestic helper for Nick Cousins, before becoming his partner. It is not clear whether they married, although she uses his surname . Mr Cousins, originally from Thurrock, Essex, is managing director of the Hong Kong arm of international insurance broking firm Jardine Lloyd Thompson, and has worked for the firm in Asia for more than 20 years. It is understood that Ms Garcia - also known as Grace Cousins - moved to Hong Kong from the Philippines in the 1990s to work for Mr Cousins as a domestic helper before becoming his partner. It is unclear whether they had married, although she uses his surname. The couple were watching television in the family’s home, on the 19th floor of Hong Kong's most luxurious apartment buildings, when Blanca locked herself in a bathroom before failing to her death. Paramedics declared her dead at the foot of the building in Repulse Bay Road. A police source said they did not find a suicide note from Blanca, pictured, but said they were aware the girl was 'unhappy'. A horse lover, she was a member of the Hong Kong Pony Club and would have turned 16 in July . Police sources claimed while no suicide note had been found they were aware the girl had been 'unhappy' in recent weeks. Blanca – who was known as Blancs – was due to celebrate her 16th birthday in July. If their births were not registered, it means she would not have been able to attend school, travel abroad or receive medical treatment – unless paid for privately. However she appeared to have enjoyed a relatively normal life, and seemed to have a wide circle of friends among the city’s well to do expatriate community. A police spokeswoman said a security guard found Blanca lying on the ground at the foot of the apartment . She was a member of the Hong Kong Pony Club and had recently attended Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament, after her father secured a box there, and had invited friends to join her at the event. Ms Garcia’s charge sheet, seen by the Daily Mail, states that she is accused of overstaying in Hong Kong from 1994 until 2015, having initially entered as a visitor. She is also charged with ‘ill-treatment or neglect’ of a child between July 1, 2000 and April 7 this year ‘in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering’. It states her occupation as housewife. She was bailed until June.","Pair 'visibly upset and shaking' as they left the Hong Kong court together .

"A government inquiry is to be carried out into the impact of migrant children arriving in schools unable to speak English. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan revealed she has ordered officials to start 'mapping the pressures' on the state schools system. It comes less than six months after she told the head of Ofsted it was not 'helpful' to warn that schools are struggling to cope with an 'influx' of migrants. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan revealed she has ordered officials to start 'mapping the pressures' on the state schools system caused by immigration . Immigration has played a low-key role in the Tory election campaign to date, after David Cameron spectacularly to meet his pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands. The Tory leader vowed to cut the number below 100,000 'no ifs, no buts', but latest figures show the number hit 298,000 in the year to September. In an interview today Mrs Morgan admitted it is a 'big issue' for voters and revealed she has asked the Department for Education to examine the impact on schools. It is expected to look at how migrant children perform in exams and how schools with large immigrant populations cope. Mrs Morgan told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I think there is pressure in the classrooms in terms of teaching — how prepared [immigrant] children are when they start school. Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw last year warned schools had faced an 'influx' of immigrants . 'It would be wrong to say immigration holds results back or affects overall qualifications ultimately. But at the start of primary school, especially, it means that teachers have to tailor their lessons, to spend longer with pupils who have English as a second language. 'We are looking at that in the Department — exactly mapping the pressures, what teachers have to do, the resources that takes. I am very keen to know.' She added that she wanted to ensure that migrant children have caught up with other pupils before the end of the Year 1, aged six or seven. In October last year, Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw was challenged about the increased worked of teachers caused by a large number of children who could not speak English. Sir Michael said: 'Schools need the resources to deal with that. 'When they're faced with an influx of children from other countries, they need the resources and capacity to deal with it, and if those resources aren't there, that's a big issue for government. That's the first thing and we'll be producing reports on this fairly soon.' Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . But a week later Mrs Morgan questioned Sir Michael's language and played down the scale of the problem. 'Obviously Sir Michael Wilshaw has gone round to various schools but no, when I go round schools I see that they have adapted and are doing extremely well with students who do come from abroad. 'I am not sure that sort of language is always helpful but there are challenges and there are parts of the country where we know that there are higher numbers of students who don't speak English as a first language.' Asked whether Sir Michael should have chosen his words more carefully, Mrs Morgan added: 'This whole area of immigration is an area where we need to be very careful about the language that we use. 'It isn't that it isn't a concern to people because it absolutely is but we also need to think about the language and the tone of the debate that we use. 'We need to tackle the issue in a sensitive way without saying there isn't a problem because people are clearly concerned about it.' Everyone who comes to Britain should know how to speak English, Labour Ed Miliband has warned as he admitted Labour made mistakes on immigration. The Labour leader admitted that in the past his party had been 'too timid' about making clear that for communities to live together they must use a shared language. But the Tories said there was nothing in Mr Miliband's plans to act to reduce the number of people moving to Britain, after net migration hit 298,000 in a year. Ed Miliband admitted that in the past his party had been 'too timid' about making clear that for communities to live together they must use a shared language . Mr Miliband pledged a new crackdown on illegal exploitation of migrant workers, promising a Home Office task force to boost prosecutions and fines on bad employers. Speaking in Wirral West - a marginal seat held by the Tory Employment Minister Esther McVey - the Labour leader said exploitation drives low skilled migration and holds down wages for British workers. His new unit of 100 staff will bring together people from the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and specialist police units, together with additional Home Office enforcement staff. The unit will be empowered to investigate abuse and be challenged to increase prosecutions and fines levelled against employers who break the rules. But he also warned that migrants must learn to speak English, especially in key services like the NHS. Mr Miliband said: 'Our communities are changing fast but we don't cope with change by closing our doors to each other and living our lives in separate worlds. Instead we must find a way to live together across communities. 'A Britain where people of all backgrounds, all cultures, all religions, can practise their own faiths but also come together to forge a common identity. 'But we can only build this shared society if we speak the same language.' He said his own parents had learned to speak English after arriving from Belgium in 1940. 'It is why I believe in a simple principle: Everyone in Britain should know how to speak English. 'Sometimes, we've been too timid about this but it is something we should expect from everyone who comes here. 'And it is especially important that people who work in public services in public facing roles should be required to speak English.' He said that 'nowhere is that more true' than in the health service. 'We all know the crucial contribution that people from overseas play in our NHS. Doctors, paramedics, social workers, nurses. Bringing specialist skills that we need. 'I will never demean or devalue their contribution to our country. 'But it is vital that people who come to fulfil these roles don't just have the right medical skills, but can communicate with those for whom they care. 'So in the future all healthcare professionals will be required to speak English to a sufficient standard so they can care effectively for patients.'","Nicky Morgan asks officials to start 'mapping the pressures' on schools .

"A man took a friend's dog for a walk and hacked it to death with an axe because he was worried it might bite children. Kevin Dixon, 35, of Newsome in West Yorkshire, took his friend's Akita-type dog for a walk to help her out and then hit it seven times with an axe - killing the animal. He was convicted of causing the dog unnecessary suffering and was given a suspended prison sentence and banned from keeping animals for ten years. Kevin Dixon offered to take his fiend's Akita-type dog (pictured) out for a walk to help his friend and hacked the animal to death  because he was scared it might bite a child . Kirklees Magistrates' Court heard that Dixon had agreed to walk the dog, Tempa, for its owner Amanda Hamer who had been unable to do so after she suffered severe whiplash in early 2014. The dog had a history of biting people and Dixon had decided to kill the animal after it bit a woman, following a party at Ms Hamer's home. Dixon told the court he was worried it might bite one of the children sleeping at the house overnight. Dixon (left) was convicted after a trial of causing the dog, called Tempa (right), of unnecessary suffering . On the evening of May 16 he took the animal out for a walk and then hit it seven times in the pitch black. He had initially claimed the dog had not suffered when he attacked it and the assault had been all over and done with 'from first blow to last in 10 seconds.' Tempa was hit with the axe seven times . But he was convicted by magistrates after further evidence was presented in a case brought by the RSPCA at trial earlier in the year. Chairman of the Bench Sue Collins, told Dixon his actions were 'unacceptable' and he had caused 'suffering to the dog' but accepts 'he is remorseful and didn't want to cause harm'. Dixon was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended for two years. He was disqualified from keeping animals for 10 years. Catherin McCullagh, for Dixon, said: 'Clearly Mr Dixon's actions were undesirable if I can put it that way, as well as illegal.' Speaking after the sentence, Ms Hamer, 43, said: 'The sentence is too light for somebody who has taken a member of the family. 'Tempa was part of the family, my daughter's best friend. She absolutely loved him - she has had an awful time through this.'","Kevin Dixon took his friend's Akita dog for a walk when she was injured .

"Tragic: Joshua Vaughan, 17, died in January this year when he was struck by a train . A teenage boy who had been having relationship problems with his 'on-off' girlfriend, died when he was struck by a train just minutes after he spoke to his mother on the phone, an inquest heard. Joshua Vaughan, 17, was last seen standing on a platform at Chapeltown, Sheffield, on January 7, an inquest heard. Shortly before his death, his girlfriend had sent his mother a message on Facebook, saying the teen was on a platform and that 'he was going to end it'. His mother Stacey Vaughan told the inquest how she had immediately phoned Joshua, an apprentice at an insurance firm, and found that he was crying. Mrs Vaughan said she had told her son to come home, and that she would come and fetch him at the station. Mrs Vaughan called the police, but by the time she got to the station, Joshua's body had already been found on the line, the inquest heard. Before his death, Joshua had been suffering relationship problems with his girlfriend, who was a few years younger, and his family had expressed concerns about the relationship. 'I was quite worried about Josh having to deal with this as he was just starting off in his working life,' she said. Her son had recently sought medical treatment after he seemed 'unhappy and wasn't eating as normal.' He said he didn't know why he was unhappy but his GP said 'they were due to relationship problems.' Mrs Vaughan said: 'The doctor was under the impression he didn't want to be in a relationship any more. She thought he was too young to go on medication and his problems were relationship related.' She said the couple broke up 'now and again' and her son had told her he had finished with the girl and had not been in contact with her. Mrs Vaughan said she had received a phone call from Joshua's superior a week before Christmas, where he said he had found the 17-year-old crying with marks on his wrists, and that Joshua had told him he 'did it to himself'. The teenager's parents decided to seek professional help but Joshua said he was not keen on going to the doctor's and after a 'fantastic' family Christmas he said he was thinking about patching it up with the girl. On the evening of the tragedy he went out with a male friend and seemed in a good mood. When she got to the station she said: 'I was stopped by the police. I was in a right state, panicking about what was happening. A female officer came and said a train had struck him. I was shocked and devastated. Everything after that was a blur.' British Transport Police Det Con Ian Grice said the train drivers saw something on the tracks as he approached the station. Heartbreaking: Minutes before Joshua died, his 'on-off' girlfriend had sent his mother a message on Facebook, saying the teen was on a platform at Chapeltown station and that 'he was going to end it' 'The drivers thought it was something obstructing the line. As they got closer they saw it was a person. They applied the emergency brakes straight away.' Witnesses said the teenager had earlier been seen on the platform looking at oncoming trains and CCTV footage showed him pacing up and down the platform before disappearing off camera. 'All the witnesses said Joshua was a good lad, hard-working and friendly,' said DC Grice. 'There was nothing the train driver could have done.' Joshua, of Chapeltown, died from multiple injuries. Toxicology tests showed no evidence of drugs or drink in his system. Assistant Sheffield coroner Louise Slater said she was satisfied he had acted alone but was unsure about his intentions. 'There had been some difficulties and he was struggling with his mood,' she said. 'At the time he wasn't fully able to apprecaite what he was doing.' She recorded a narrative conclusion: 'Joshua died as a result of injuries he sustained while in collision with a train. At the time when the incident occurred it is unclear whether he fully understood the consequences of his actions.' She told his parents Stacey and Christopher: 'There is nothing more you could have done on that evening or in the weeks before to prevent that tragedy.' Joshua played for local football team Chapeltown Juniors and friends later played a match in his memory.","Joshua Vaughan 'stepped in front of a train' in Sheffield in January .

"The study's lead researcher said the results are a 'surprise', but  it's no excuse to pile on the pounds . For years we have been told that the first step to staying healthy is to keep to a healthy weight - that means making sure your Body Mass Index (BMI) is within the normal range of 18 to 24. Few people are advised to gain weight, unless their BMI is below 18, but could that change? A study published last week suggests that overweight people are less likely to develop dementia. The researchers, drawn mostly from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, analysed the medical records of nearly two million people for up to ten years and found that those who were overweight (with a BMI of 25 to 29) had an 18 per cent lower risk of dementia compared to those with a healthy BMI. Remarkably the obese (with a BMI of 30 plus) did even better; they were 24 per cent less likely to develop dementia. Being underweight increased the dementia risk by 39 per cent. Dr Nawab Qizilbash, a clinical epidemiologist and the lead researcher, called the results a 'surprise', but said it was no excuse to pile on the pounds: 'This is a robust and reliable study that opens up an avenue in the search for factors that protect against Alzheimer's.' But these results are not that extraordinary. Three years ago, an even larger study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reported that overweight people tended to live longer than those of normal weight. The study analysed 100 trials involving three million people. It found that being overweight (a BMI between 25 and 29) reduced the risk of premature death by six per cent compared with someone of a normal BMI. More surprising was that even if someone was at the lower end of obese (BMI of 30 to 34.5) their risk of premature death didn't go up. Being obese started to reduce lifespan only when your BMI went above 35 - here the risk of dying earlier climbed to 29 per cent greater than those with a normal BMI, according to the study, headed by Dr Katherine Flegal, of the U.S. government Centres for Disease Control. So could being cuddly fat, rather than hugely overweight, protect you against dying early? Being overweight (a BMI between 25 and 29) reduced the risk of premature death by six per cent . Professor David Haslam, a GP and chairman of the National Obesity Forum, says something called the obesity paradox is at work: 'Obesity increases your chances of developing disorders such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes but once you've fallen ill, being a bit overweight seems to have a protective effect. 'The obesity paradox had been called 'surreal and unsettling', but it does seem to be real. We need to understand it.' Malcolm Kendrick, a GP and author with an interest in obesity, claimed in his recent book Doctoring Data that being overweight was beneficial. He is suspicious of the word 'paradox' when used with a medical hypothesis: 'It is usually a way of describing something that contradicts your theory. For instance, people who believe high cholesterol causes heart disease use the phrase 'cholesterol paradox' to explain why countries with high levels of cholesterol have low levels of heart disease. They should admit their theory is wrong.' He says that what counts as a normal or 'healthy' BMI has been miscalculated: 'It would make sense if normal was what is now called overweight.' Millions would then not be pushed into losing weight when they did not need to or when it might be harmful. The number of Britons who go on a diet in any given year . These 'paradoxical' results suggest that BMI is too crude a tool on its own to make decisions about what a healthy weight is. It can misclassify athletes packed with muscle as overweight or even obese. Equally, current BMI categories give the wrong picture for what might be called the 'fit fat'; people who may have a lot of fat but also eat well and exercise regularly. Their BMI may classify them as obese, but other markers (blood sugar, fat levels in their blood and blood pressure) can all be in the super healthy range. Apparently healthy-weight people with little muscle mass because they rarely exercise also make BMI an unreliable indicator of health because rather than storing their fat under the skin, they may carry it in their abdomen, wrapped around their organs and pumping out chemical messengers and hormones linked to diabetes, heart disease and cancer. A tape measure is said to be one way to spot if you have this dangerous fat, but leading obesity expert Professor Arya Sharma, chair in obesity research and management at the University of Alberta, disagrees: 'A tape measure still won't tell you whether your stomach fat is unhealthy. Symptoms such as hypertension, diabetes or sleep apnoea are far more informative.' Current BMI categories give the wrong picture for what might be called the 'fit fat' All this suggests it is not a good idea to advise someone to lose weight just on their BMI. Professor Haslam says: 'I'd never do that; I'd need to know about their diet, how much they exercise, what their blood pressure and blood glucose levels were.' He welcomes the latest Alzheimer's and obesity research because it should make people more aware of the complexities of the fat debate: 'We've got too stuck in the idea that when it comes to weight, one size fits all.' Why fatter people should be better protected from Alzheimer's is guesswork, but evidence suggests having more fat reserves when you fall ill is associated with better recovery. 'Heavier people have better survival rates,' says Dr Flegal. 'If you get pneumonia and lose 15 lb, it helps to have 15 lb spare'. Fat is a vital source of the energy needed for recovery and also helps the immune system. Professor Haslam says: 'Those who are elderly or suffering from long-term conditions should be advised to become fitter, but not to lose weight.' One of Dr Flegal's fiercest critics is Professor Walter Willett, chair of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health. He, too, is concerned that BMI does not provide the whole picture of someone's health but has described Dr Flegal's research as 'rubbish'. He is particularly worried her claims could 'undermine public policies to curb rising obesity rates'. He says they could be 'hijacked by special interest groups such as soft drink manufacturers and food lobbies'. There is no doubt that being obese, and to a lesser extent overweight, is linked to a raised risk of cancers, diabetes, and other chronic disorders. While you might not die prematurely, at the very least you are likely to have a poor quality of life; diabetes complications can include blindness, ulcers and amputations. Nonetheless Professor Haslam believes the new findings cannot be ignored: 'We need to use them to improve the advice and support we give to patients. It's not right to try to discredit them for political reasons.'","A study suggests overweight people are less likely to develop dementia .

"A transgender woman has launched a campaign on social media to protest bathroom bans. Brae Carnes of Victoria, British Columbia, has photographed herself over the past few months as she applies makeup and even changes in men's public restrooms, sometimes when men are even going to the bathroom right behind her. This to protest a proposed amendment to a Canadian transgender rights bill that would allow owners to make their own decisions as to whether or not to allow transgender individuals to use facilities corresponding to their gender. Scroll down for video . Brae Carnes (above) of Victoria, British Columbia is protesting an amendment to a Canadian transgender rights bill . Carnes has begun posting photos of herself applying makeup and even changing in men's public bathrooms (above) 'I’m giving them what they want,' Carnes said of the photos in an interview with the Times Colonist. 'I’m actively showing them what it would look like if that became law and how completely ridiculous it is. It’s just not right.' On top of that, Carnes revealed that it is scary to go into a men's public bathroom as a woman. A bill to grant equal rights and protections to transgender individuals and protect them from discrimination has been stuck in the Canadian senate for almost two years now. Recently, Senator Don Plett introduced this new amendment to the bill. He argues it is more a protection for women who may be afraid to share a space with anyone who is 'biologically male.' The new amendment would allow business owners to determine if they want to allow transgender individuals to use facilities corresponding with their gender . 'I’m actively showing them what it would look like if that became law and how completely ridiculous it is,' says Carnes . The transgender community meanwhile has pointed out the issue of their own protection should they be forced to use a bathroom that does not correspond with their gender identity. 'I think [the amendment] is actually giving predators a chance and an opportunity. People think, ""Why’s this girl in the washroom? She must be looking for a guy,""' said Carnes.","Brae Carnes of Victoria, British Columbia is protesting an amendment to a Canadian transgender rights bill .

"Why do people kill? A Manhattan real estate publicist and freelance writer has been penning letters to murderers behind bars to find out exactly what makes them tick. Kelly Kreth, 44, told Dailymail.com that after having a traumatic encounter with a sociopath in her own life she became inspired to learn about the inner workings of a criminal mind. Six years and 600 prison letters later, Kreth says she's learned that a sociopath is a person 'who wants to feel like the smartest person in the room.' Her own trauma: Kelly Kreth told Dailymail.com that after having a traumatic encounter with a sociopath in her own life she became inspired to learn about the inner workings of a criminal mind . Conceptual prison: In order to make initial contact with the prisoners, Kreth sent a postcard that had an image of her in a striped dress along with a note saying she thinks everyone lives in a type of prison . 'They do it for the thrill,' she said, adding that she does not condone any of the perpetrators crimes. Kreth has written to men and women behind bars who she believes fit the bill of a sociopath and who have a certain level of intelligence so that they are able to discuss their crimes in a conceptual manner. The New York Post reports that the list of the killers Kreth interacted with include Michael Swango, a doctor who poisoned as many as 60 patients in a variety of different hospitals for over two decades. 'I love it: the sweet, close, husky smell of indoor homicide,' Swango wrote in a notebook presented by prosecutors in 2000. Another killer she dared to write  was Sarah Joe Pender who was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a couple that she and her boyfriend shared a house with in 2000. Hundreds of letters: Six years and 600 prison letters later, Kreth says she's learned that a sociopath is a person 'who wants to feel like the smartest person in the room' Kreth also wrote to Ira Einhorn, a hippie who helped to found Earth Day. In 1979 police found his ex-girlfriends body beaten and mummified in his closet in 1979. She even reached out to prisoner Thomas 'Bart' Whitaker, a man on death row for the murder of his devout Christian family in 2003. In order to make initial contact with the prisoners, Kreth sent a postcard that had an image of her in a striped dress. She planned to open conversation by saying that prison goes beyond padlocked walls. 'I wanted to discuss how conceptually everyone lives in their own type of prison.' Kreth says she shared personal information about her own life so that the prisoners saw her as someone they would feel comfortable sharing their secrets with. 'Sociopaths spend their whole life acting,' Kreth told Dailymail.com . 'They can tell when people are being fake or genuine. I waited two years before asking them the questions about what makes them a true sociopath.' Hippy killer: Fugitive Ira Einhorn who killed his ex-girlfriend  told Kreth that he is not a sociopath but found manipulating people easy . Kreth said one of her most interesting interactions was with the hospital killer Michael Swango. ‘Love your look; love your age, Kelly,' Swango wrote Kreth in a  2009 letter, adding, 'Would love to get to know you much better. EXPLORE ALL THINGS INSIDE and OUTSIDE . . . I hope you’re not shy.' Kreth said she made it clear to prisoners that her interactions to them were not romantic, though it was her picture that got their attention. She says she would send Swango articles in publications in the New Yorker about sociopaths and that he would then circle parts of the story he felt were true characteristics of a killer. ‘A sociopath wants to feel like he is the smartest person in the world,’ Swango told her. When asked if he had guilt or remorse, Swango wrote, ‘The short answer to your question is, ‘nothing at all That’s why it went on for so long. No deep thoughts, or confusion, or remorse or anything else.’ Lady killer: Another killer she dared to write was Sarah Joe Pender who was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a couple that she and her boyfriend shared a house with in 2000 . When asked if sociopath’s feel he wrote, ‘I would disagree that a sociopath can “neither feel empathy or true love.” One can be “empathetic” to some people or things and not to others. Where is the line between love, obsessive love, or something that looks like any of the above, but is not…? You & I could have a long discussion on the exact meaning of this phrase! Many gradations, many shades of gray between pure while & pure darkness/evil!’ Swango, Kreth told the Post, would sign his letters very bizarrely. ‘Sometimes he would sign his notes ""You know you love me, XOXO, Gossip Girl,""” Kreth said. ‘He’s a 60 year old guy, who has maybe murdered 60 people, who’s into poison, and writing, ‘hey girl’ . . . and ‘OMG we must talk about ebola.’ ‘It’s darkly funny,’ she said. When speaking to Ira Einhorn who killed his girlfriend, Einhorn said that he doesn't see himself as a sociopath but told her that 'manipulation is the easiest thing in the world.' 'I’m an empath, so calling me, labeling me as a sociopath is silly.When you’re intelligent & have some ability to introspect, you early on or eventually realize that it is easy to manipulate almost everyone you meet. You or I made a choice: No manipulation which people often take as the ultimate manipulation. Too easy! Not interesting — what is of great interest is direct open communication which is what I did for years in the 70s,' he wrote. Murdered his parents: Thomas Bart Whitaker told Kreth he admits to being a sociopath and says he murdered his parents because they 'didn't love him' Thomas Bart Whitaker never admitted to being a sociopath but said he always felt different form other people. 'You are correct about being born with the wrong wiring. Some of us just don’t have things set up upstairs like everyone else,' he wrote her in a letter. An alleged killer Kreth has been dying to interview is millionaire Robert Durst who has been linked to three murders but never convicted. Durst, who was heir to a vast real estate empire before becoming estranged from his family, was arrested last month for the suspected 2000 murder of his friend, writer Susan Berman, in Los Angeles. ‘Durst once stole a sandwich for $6 but had $37,000 with him in his car. It’s because he wanted to feel the thrill. He seems like the true definition of a sociopath.’ Writing to killers has helped Kreth to heal and has also provided fascinating insight into a criminal's mind. She told Dailymail.com she hopes to write a book.","Kelly Kreth had a traumatic encounter with a sociopath in her own life and became inspired to learn about the inner workings of a criminal mind .

"This is the moment a thief casually strolls up to a Range Rover and takes less than 30 seconds to break into the vehicle and drive it away in a car hacking theft. It shows how easy it is for the so-called hackers to bypass security systems using hand-held devices to steal cars without even using the owner's keys. The latest footage was captured by a CCTV camera outside a home in Woodford Green, north London at 3.20 on Sunday morning. The CCTV footage shows a man casually approach a white Range Rover parked outside a house in Woodford Green, north London . Just seconds later using car hacking technology, he opens the door without even using a key or smashing a window . It shows the man approach the white 4x4 and within two seconds opening the door and getting into the driver's seat. Just seconds later, he then manages to start up the engine and reverse the car away from the front of the house and drive it down the road. The Metropolitan Police are now appealing for information in a bid to try and track down the thief. Keyless car thefts are on the rise in London with 6,000 of them in the capital last year, and Range Rovers and BMWs thought to be particularly vulnerable. Last year figures revealed by the Home Secretary showed that one in three car thefts in London are now carried out by high-tech hackers who do not even need the owner's keys. The thief then climbs into the drivers seat during the theft, which took place in the early hours of Sunday morning . The man then sits in the car for another 30 seconds before managing to start the engine without a key . Theresa May highlighted how gangs can break into a car and programme a new electronic key or use devices to ‘grab’ security coding when the owner uses their fob. Experts are concerned that thieves may even be using computer malware to take over vehicle systems via satellite, issuing remote commands for them to unlock and start up. The latest figures from the Met, Britain’s largest police force, indicate that more than a third of vehicles stolen in the capital are not driven away using a key.. After turning on the ignition, the turns on the headlights and begins to reverse the car off the driveway . Once off the drive, he then drivers the car away down the road. Metropolitan Police are now appealing for information to trace the thief . Many devices can be bought cheaply online, often from websites based in Bulgaria. They are accompanied by video tutorials posted online. Meanwhile police in Kensington and Chelsea were told earlier this year to stop all prestige cars which are being driven after midnight after a spate of thefts using 'keyless' entry methods. It came as officers warned as many as ten vehicles per night were being stolen with the method in some London boroughs. The Met advises car owners to leave their cars in well-lit areas, to consider using steering, gear shift and pedal locks, as well as tracking devices.","Footage shows a thief casually stroll up to a Range Rover in north London .

Macemore had a casual sexual relationship with one of the young men, but had enjoyed a longer and more involved relationship with the other, said prosecutors. On Thuesday she pleaded guilty to two counts of taking indecent liberties with a minor. She had also pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors: assisting a student in obtaining a grade by fraudulent means and giving alcohol to someone under age 21. As part of a plea agreement, six counts of committing a sexual offense with a student at the same school were reduced to taking indecent liberties. The offenses occurred between October, 2013, and January, 2014, but not on school property. The incidents only come to light after Macemore told another student.

Authorities said they spotted her 'sweating profusely' and 'avoiding eye contact with officers' so they decided to pull her aside to conduct a search. After patting her down in a private room, investigators reportedly felt a 'dense hard material' under her clothes. Hidden packages: A 70-year-old woman faces jail time for allegedly smuggling four pounds of cocaine in her girdle and underwear (seen above) Fowler was found to be wearing one pair of black underwear and one white girdle with white powder packed into the garments. The packages tested positive for cocaine. It's estimated the drugs found in her panties have a street value of more than $73,000. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers placed Fowler under arrest and turned her over to Homeland Security Investigations.

A Labour councillor refused to deal with a local resident because they supported Ukip, it has been claimed. Pensioner Alan Roberts wrote to Bournemouth Borough Council complaining about a lack of action over fly-tipping. He signed off his email with: 'That's why I'll be voting Ukip'. Ben Grower, leader of the authority's Labour group, responded: 'As you now appear to be a supporter of a racist party please do not send me any further emails as they will be put in my junk mail folder and automatically deleted.' Mr Roberts said he was shocked by the 'petty' reply. The 65-year-old said: 'I am certainly not a racist and I do not think Ukip is racist.

"An adaptor that allows colour blind people to enjoy TV without a loss of detail is seeking funding on Kickstarter. Called Eye2TV, it adjusts colours in the image so that shows look 'normal', even if features colours such as red and green that would otherwise not be visible. And the subtle effect is such that someone with normal vision will barely notice any change in the picture, so people can easily watch TV together. Scroll down for video . Norwich scientists have developed an adaptor for colour blindness. Eye2TV can be plugged into any HDMI port on a TV or a computer monitor (shown in illustration). A remote control or app then adjusts the colour adjustment. It allows colour blind people to watch shows they otherwise couldn't . The team from the University of East Anglia in Norwich is seeking £100,000 ($150,000) of funding to get their project of the ground. At the moment you can buy a single adaptor with a Bluetooth remote control for £50 ($75), with shipping expected in May 2016. The device uses a patented Eyeteq algorithm to automatically adjust the picture, with a variety of settings available until optimal picture quality is found. The video is enhanced on a frame-by-frame basis through Spectral Edge's patented Eyeteq image enhancement technology, offering a dramatically improved viewing experience. The picture quality can be adjusted via remote control to suit the unique colour-vision of the individual viewer. To make the effect work, they created a small gadget that plugs into the HDMI port of a TV or monitor. You then plug another device into the adaptor and, using an app or remote, adjust the colour settings on whatever you are watching. It works with any HD-ready screen, such as a TV or a computer monitor. It charges using a USB cable, which can be plugged into a spare USB port or into a plug. And the goal is to enable people of all sight levels to enjoy shows. At the moment, more than 90 per cent of forms of colour blindness are supported. Around four per cent of the world's population suffers from colour blindness. Their viewing experience is particularly affected when watching particular content types. For example, it can be difficult to tell sports teams apart, particularly if one is playing in red and the other in green, while programmes about wildlife, cookery and art are severely impacted. 'A 2014 Champions League football match between an all red and an all green football team [Liverpool and Ludogrets] was unwatchable for colour blind fans,' explained Christopher Cytera, Managing Director of Spectral Edge, the spin-off company of the university developing the product. But with Eye2TV, the same match could have been watched by people who were colour blind and not alike. The team also says nature shows are difficult to watch, as they often mix colours that are indistinguishable to people who are colour blind. A Champions League football match between Liverpool and Ludogrets on 16 September 2014 (pictured) was criticised because the teams played in red and green, making it difficult from people who suffered from colour blindness to watch the match . With Eye2TV, the same match could have been watched by people who were colour blind and not alike. On the left is the regular version, while on the right is the subtle changes made by the Eyeteq algorithm . Another example is shown here, with the regular spider on the left and an enhanced version right . Playing video games which feature predominantly red or green characters and those with subtle colour differences between good guys and monsters is also difficult. 'The inability to enjoy watching TV or to play video games alongside friends and family is a major frustration to those suffering from colour blindness, significantly impacting their quality of life,' added Mr Cytera. 'Our image enhancement technology is proven to solve this major accessibility issue, and the Eye2TV adapter is poised to transform how colour blind people, and their families, watch TV and video content. 'By launching the project on Kickstarter we can accelerate bringing our technology to the consumer electronics market, giving those with colour blindness the chance to become early adopters and improve their viewing experience.' The company also has an app that is available, enabling people to view content on their smartphone or tablet that they would otherwise not be able to see.","Norwich scientists have developed a £50 adaptor for colour blindness .

"A Connecticut boy who was thrust into the national spotlight before he turned ten because of the way he could throw a baseball will not see his 17th birthday thanks to a drive-by shooting. Jericho Scott, 16, who became an internet star after being told he couldn't pitch for his Little League team because he had a 40mph fastball at age nine, was shot dead in New Haven early on Sunday. Scott was killed while he sat in a white Volkswagen with a 20-year-old friend, Justin Compress, who was shot in the shoulder, hand and wrist but is now in stable condition. Scroll down for video . Jericho Scott (seen at age nine) was killed early on Sunday while he sat in a car in New Haven, Connecticut . Scott became a star when he was told he couldn't pitch for his Little League team because of his fastball . He was banned from the Youth Baseball League of New Haven in 2009 at age nine because he threw 40mph . Scott was the star pitcher for Will Power Fitness team in the Youth Baseball League of New Haven in 2009 when league officials informed him he could no longer pitch for his team. The budding star had five no-hitters in the team's first eight games of the season before he was told he had to sit or switch positions, the Hartford Courant reported. When his manager sent him out to the mound anyway after the ban, the other team refused to play and said its players were afraid of being injured. The story made headlines when lawyers were hired and Scott's team eventually disbanded. The budding star had five no-hitters in the team's first eight games of the season before being told to sit out . When Scott's manager sent him out to pitch after the ban was issued, the other team refused to play the game . His mother, Nicole Scott, said at the time: 'I think it's discouraging when you're telling a nine-year-old you're too good at something. 'The whole objective in life is to find something you're good at and stick with it. 'I'd rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner.' During a 2011 follow-up piece about Scott in the New Journal, his father Leroy also referenced the streets of New Haven and how some of them have 'fourteen-year-olds holding pistols'. That was four years ago, but his sentiment still rings true. A shrine  at the scene. The murder was the city's fourth homicide of 2015 and its first youth killing of the year . Scott's parents wrote: 'Jericho, at only 16, has given so much to his family, friends and the community' Sunday's murder was the city's fourth homicide of 2015 and its first youth killing of the year, the Yale News reported. The Scotts have set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for their son's memorial service and tribute. They wrote: 'Jericho, at only 16, has given so much to his family, friends and the community.

"Whether it's a chocolate bar that no longer satisfies your appetite or washing powder which now runs out before your next shop, many of our big brands are shrinking their products. The latest casualty are boxes of Cadbury's Fingers which, it was announced yesterday, will contain two fewer chocolate fingers from now on. They join Creme Eggs, PG Tips teabags and even John West tuna in the ever-increasing list of goods getting smaller. Scroll down for video . Shape changer: The rounded chunks look nice - but they give you 14 per cent less Dairy Milk chocolate . Even if maths isn't your cup of tea, it's easy to see you're now getting fewer tea bags per pack of Blend of Both . Good old Bessie? Not so - she's nicked 50g of your homestyle chips that are cooked in a 'crispy batter' But while it may be better for your waistline, it's not better for your pocket if manufacturers and supermarkets don't pass on the cost saving to consumers. When John West shrunk its No Drain Tuna Steak In Brine from 130g to 120g, the price stayed at £1 in Morrisons. And there was no change in the £5 cost of Surf with Essential Oils Washing Powder when it dropped from 2kg to 1.61kg. It's seemingly part of a strategy across the retail industry that enables manufacturers to increase profits without putting up prices (and thus risk losing customers). It's now so common, it's even got a name: 'shrinkflation'. In its latest issue, consumer watchdog Which? reveals a host of products that have been shrunk, from Surf washing powder and Cif spray to Hovis Best Of Both bread, while the price remains the same. 'Shrinking products can be an underhand way of raising prices because pack sizes shrink but the prices don't. Consumers will feel angry that they are being short-changed by some of their favourite brands,' says Which? executive director Richard Lloyd. 'It's time for action on dodgy pricing practices that stop people from comparing products to find the cheapest.' It's fiendishly difficult to compare prices properly nowadays because special offers mean they change frequently. Indeed, very often a negative story about a product shrinking in the media will lead to its price magically shrinking. For example, after being featured in Which? this month because it had dropped from 750ml to 700ml but stayed at the same £2 price in Asda, the supermarket giant discounted Cif Actifizz Lemon Multi Purpose Spray to £1.75. F ood industry commentator Martin Isark believes the shrinking ploy is becoming more widespread. 'It's now common practice among the big confectioners and their argument is that they reduce the size so they don't have to put the prices up,' he says. 'Ping-pong prices going up and down almost daily confuse the shopper so the brands can reduce the size without the customer ever realising. 'Most of us buy on price, which is why they get away with this.' Other confectionery goods that have gone the same way as Cadbury's Fingers include Mars Bars (down from an original bumper 58g to 48g since 2013), Kit Kat Chunky (down from 48g to 40g earlier this year) and in 2011, the tins of Cadbury's Roses chocolates shrank from 975g to 850g, the equivalent loss of 11 chocolates. Sometimes, changes are obvious, such as Cadbury altering the shape of its chocolate. On other occasions, the clues are more subtle — a pasta sauce taking less time to warm suggests you are getting less of it. The new version of Tesco's Tomato and Mascarpone sauce is a minute quicker to cook - as you get 25g less . Whoever heard of a pack of FIVE eggs? It seems Cadbury has when it controversially took an egg out the box . Angus Kennedy, editor of trade magazine Kennedy's Confection, says one of the worst examples of shrinkflation was Cadbury's reducing the number of Creme Eggs in a box from half-a-dozen to five in the run-up to Easter (both sizes cost £1 at Iceland). 'If these companies said: 'We're sorry but we have no choice but to do this because cocoa is now in short supply,' then I think the British public would be much more understanding,' he says. 'What we don't like is feeling duped when we realise what the companies are up to.' Especially when they're still paying £1 for a sharing bag of Maltesers that's down from 140g to 120g (in fact, Cadbury's fingers have gone up from £1 to £1.50 in Sainsbury's this year despite the shrinkage). Confectionery companies have argued that a reduction in the size of their bars is not all about rising production costs but is also an attempt to support the Government's drive to help people lose weight in the face of an obesity epidemic. Mr Kennedy disputes this, saying that as the bars get smaller, people are likely to just buy and eat more. Manufacturers often claim that, when they reduce the size of a product, they pass on savings to shops but cannot guarantee that they will, in turn, bring down retail prices. Firms that were approached by Which? were unwilling to go into specifics, saying the information was 'confidential'. Spreading it thinly: Philly is down 10 per cent. But at least it's healthier with less fat and salt... Going down: Cadbury has snatched two chocolate Fingers from its famous packs – reducing the number to 22 . Now 114 grams: Cadbury chocolate Fingers have come down by 11g - the equivalent of two chocolate Fingers . Vince Bamford, buying and supply editor of The Grocer, says shrinkflation has taken off because suppliers are under pressure to maintain profit margins to keep shareholders happy and believe consumers prefer smaller products to price increases. 'When we were in recession, suppliers and retailers were very wary of raising prices,' he says. 'But I don't think it would do them any harm to be more honest with consumers. To say: 'We're having to pay 10 per cent more for our products and we're having to pass some of that cost on to you.' ' Instead, customers are left feeling short-changed. 'Food and drink pricing always reflects the economic climate of the day, whether that's the impact of changing utility prices or ingredient costs, which can be volatile,' says a Food And Drink Federation spokesperson. 'Businesses seek to offset these costs wherever possible through improvements in efficiency and productivity, but these actions can only go so far, and in some cases companies will reduce the pack size rather than increasing the price for consumers.' However, it's the underhand way in which these product changes appear to be introduced that leaves a bad taste in the mouths of so many.","Boxes of Cadbury's Fingers will contain two fewer chocolate fingers .

"Britain's youngest sex swap patient has resorted to working as an escort - to pay for her treatment. Rihanna Cooper, 21, from Hull, hit the headlines when, at 16, she became the youngest person in Britain to be accepted for gender reassignment. But part way through her treatment, the stress of her transition from male to female became too much and she  called a halt to it. Scroll down for video . Transgender woman Rihanna Cooper, 21, is paying for her gender reassignment herself . Now, having realised she can't go on as a man again and having to  pay for her treatment privately, Rihanna is working as an escort to fund her dreams. She said: 'Working as an escort can be dangerous and frightening. It's exhausting sometimes too. 'But it's the only way I have of earning enough money to become a woman.' Her initial treatment, and her subsequent decision to abandon the reassignment programme, sparked huge debate over whether she was too young to be allowed to swap sexes in the first place. But Rihanna insists that her decision was the right one - and blames NHS psychiatrists and doctors for clouding her focus. Rihanna was born Bradley Cooper in January 1994, and grew up with her mum, Elaine, 46, and three sisters, Claire, now 29, Katy, 26, and Sophie, 23. Born Bradley Cooper, Rihanna realised she was born in the wrong body and at 16 was accepted for treatment . Rihanna says: 'From an early age, I wanted to play with my sisters' Barbie dolls. My mum bought me Action men but I wasn't interested. 'I used to love watching her put make-up on. I was always stealing her lipstick. 'At school, my friends were all girls and I loved playing netball. 'I knew I had been born in the wrong body and I wanted so desperately to be a girl. 'I was an angry kid, because I was so confused, and though I was never bullied, I got into trouble, and I ended up expelled from school.' At 15, she announced that she wanted to become a girl. She says: 'It was hardly a shock. My family had always known. My mum and sisters were very supportive.' At 16, Rihanna was referred for specialist psychiatric assessments and she began dressing and living as a girl, painting her nails and growing her hair. However Rihanna, pictured centre with her mother and sister, said she actually wanted to be a boy part way through her NHS treatment - sparked huge debate over whether she was too young to be allowed . But Rihanna blames NHS medics for clouding her focus - and says she does want to be a woman . Her story hit the press as she became Britain's youngest sex-swap patient. But she rebelled against the treatment programme. She says: 'I hated the psychiatric treatment. I felt as though I was being made to justify why I wanted to be a girl, like they wanted to catch me out almost. 'I knew I was a girl inside, and to me, it was that simple.' At 17, she began a course of hormone injections but stopped the treatment after two suicide attempts. She says: 'The whole thing just got on top of me. I was sick of travelling to my appointments where I felt everyone was trying to catch me out and trip me up. 'I felt so alone, so isolated. I just wanted to be happy. My treatment caused a lot of stress in my family and I just wanted everything to go back to how it was.' Her full transgender op, scheduled for January 2013, was called off and she returned to living as a young man - but says she soon realised she could not live a lie. She is now saving to pay for gender reassignment privately, using her work as an escort to fund her surgery. She is now saving to pay for gender reassignment privately, using her work as an escort to fund her surgery . Rihanna hasn't asked the NHS to fund this reassignment, and doubts they would, because she pulled out last time. She also feels the psychiatric assessments were too invasive and the NHS programme was too invasive, so she wants to fund it herself. First on her list is a £4,500 breast enlargement, followed by surgery to remove her male genitalia. Rihanna says: 'I've always wanted to be a girl and that has never changed. I was born in the wrong body. 'My work as an escort is not ideal, but it is virtually impossible for me to get any kind of work, because of the stigma which surrounds transgender people. I see this as my only chance to fulfil my dreams.' The following is part on an NHS guide . If your child is under 18 and thought to have gender dysphoria, they will usually be referred to a specialist child and adolescent Gender Identity Clinic (GIC). Currently, the only specialist clinic for young people with gender identity issues is run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust in London, although they occasionally provide satellite clinics in other parts of the country. Staff at these clinics can carry out a detailed assessment of your child, to help them determine what support they need.

"A University of South Carolina ex-sorority girl has been suspended after she was pictured writing that 'n*****s' were to blame for the campus's poor Internet connection on a whiteboard in a study room. The white female student, who has not been identified, was captured in a Snapchat photo detailing several 'reasons why USC WiFi blows' on the board at the university in Columbia, South Carolina. Her reasons included 'incompetent' professors, 'ratchets', an 'overpopulated campus' and parking. But at the top of the list was the word 'n*****s'. Her actions were captured by a fellow student. Scroll down for video . Suspended: This University of South Carolina student has been suspended after she was pictured writing that 'n*****s' were to blame for the campus's poor Internet connection on a whiteboard in a study room . After the shocking image was posted online, the girl, who was a member of the campus's Kappa Delta Chapter sorority until last year, was identified by other students and condemned for the slur. However, she is yet to be named by school officials. Now, university president Harris Pastides has announced that the student has been suspended  - and is also facing a USC code of conduct inquiry. In a statement, Mr Pastides said: 'The unfortunate and disappointing act of a student in a study room has challenged the Carolina community to reflect on our values and tell the world what we believe. 'Respect for all is at the heart of the Carolinian Creed, the code by which we agree to abide. Racist and uncivil rhetoric have no place at the University of South Carolina.' Campus: After the picture was posted online, the girl, who was a member of the university's (pictured) Kappa Delta Chapter sorority until last year, was identified by other students and condemned for the slur . Shocking: The image marks the third racially-charged incident on a college campus in the past week. At Duke University, a noose was found hanging from a tree. The student responsible is no longer on campus . He added that the school's Board of Trustees has endorsed the suspension, according to multiple media outlets. A school spokesman would not comment on whether the girl faces expulsion. The picture marks the third racially-charged incident on a college campus in the past week. Three students at Bucknell University were expelled  for making racist comments during a March 20 campus radio broadcast. Meanwhile, at Duke University, a noose was found hanging from a tree. A student has admitted to placing the noose on the tree, and is no longer on campus, officials said, although disciplinary actions are pending and criminal charges are under consideration.

"It will be remembered as one of the Premier League's greatest ever goals. Stoke's Charlie Adam stunned the Chelsea home crowd today with a breathtaking 66-yard strike that will go down in history.

Stunning strike: The Scottish midfielder picked up the ball up deep into his own half and belted it with his reliable left foot after noticing Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois well off his line . The shot, travelling at 45.1mph, was hit such power that the back-pedaling Courtois was unable to deflect the ball away despite getting his fingers to it. As it sailed into the net the goalkeeper came tumbling in after in an embarrassing moment he will want to forget. Which do you think is the best long-range goal in Premier League history? Which do you think is the best long-range goal in Premier League history? Now share your opinion . Chelsea had been leading thanks to a penalty from Eden Hazard before Adam produced his moment of genius. The blues went on to win the match - but few will be talking about the result after witnessing a contender for best Premiership goal ever. Speaking after the game, Adam said: 'On a personal note it is a great goal to score. I saw the keeper off his line, had an effort and it has gone in. 'I always have a look at the goalkeeper because these balls move so much. When you have got that much space and time it is good to do something like that. 'It was great to get back into the game, but we lost it and that is three on the bounce and we need to come back against West Ham next week.' Adam later told the BBC: 'I never knew I had that much power, to beat a quality goalkeeper like that is something special. Once in a lifetime this can happen to you.' The strike is already being hailed as one of the greatest in the Premier League's history on social media and has been compared to other legendary long-range strikes from David Beckham and Xabi Alonso. Beckham famously scored from his own half against Wimbledon in 1996 -  a goal that catapulted him into the limelight. Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso, renowned for his long-range efforts, scored from 70 yards in 2006 while playing for Liverpool against Newcastle. Another of the Premier League's great long-range efforts came from a Stoke player when goalkeeper Asmir Begovic score from 91 yards in 2013. The strike has now been registered as the 'longest goal scored in football' in the latest edition of the famous book of records. It came just 12 seconds after kick-off - catching the wind and bouncing over opposite number Artur Boruc into the net.

"Kicked out: Elizabeth Sedway, 51, says Alaska Airlines had her ejected from a flight because she has cancer and lacked a doctor's note clearing her to fly . A married mother of two battling cancer  whose removal from an Alaska Airlines flight caused outrage online said on Wednesday that the carrier refunded her family's airfare, which will be donated to research. Elizabeth Sedway, 51, from Granite Hill, California, posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane. Mrs Sedway, who suffers from multiple myeloma - a rare form of plasma cancer - detailed her ordeal in a status update accompanying the short video, which has been viewed thousands of times. In the message, the mother of two explained that she was sitting in the handicapped section of a boarding area at Lihue Airport on Kauai when an Alaska Airlines representative noticed she had put on a surgical mask to shield herself from germs and came up to her asking if she needed anything. Mrs Sedway initially said she was fine, but when the airline employee approached her a second time, she indicated that she might require a little extra time to board the plane because she sometimes felt 'weak.' Homeward bound: The married mother of three, her husband (right) and their two sons were returning home to California Monday after vacationing in Hawaii when they were kicked off the flight . Caught on camera: Sedway posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane . In Sedway's video, her husband is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats . Brought to tears: As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up . The Sedway family eventually boarded the plane and were awaiting takeoff in their seats when an airline representative came on board and announced that the cancer-stricken passenger could not fly without a note from her doctor. In Sedway's video, her husband dressed in a brightly colored Hawaiian shirt is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats while his wife narrates their removal from the flight. 'All these people are waiting, and I am being removed as if I'm a criminal or contagious because I have cancer,' she says. 'My family is being forcibly removed from an airplane because I have cancer and no note to fly.' As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up. One of the passengers tells the woman, 'God bless you.' In an interview with NBC Bay Area, Elizabeth Sedway said the airline was concerned she might collapse during the eight-hour flight to San Jose, California. After being asked to leave the plane, Mrs Sedway emailed her oncologist in California and he gave her the green light to fly, but she told the local NBC affiliate in a phone interview that the airline was not satisfied and refused to let her re-board. The Sedways spent Monday night in a hotel in Maui, for which they were forced to pay out of pocket, and they were scheduled to return home on a Hawaiian Airlines flight Tuesday evening. Elizabeth Sedway lamented on her Facebook page that because of the delay caused by Alaska Airlines, she will miss two chemotherapy sessions, her husband will miss important meetings and her sons will miss school. Named and shamed: Sedway shared this photo of Alaska Airline staff at Lihue Airport on her Facebook page, identifying them as the employees whom she had to deal with during the incident . Damage control: Alaska Airlines later apologized to the family for mishandling the situation . Earlier Tuesday, a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines told CBS San Francisco that the company apologized to Elizabeth Sedway for the inconvenience and for the way its employees handled the situation. ‘Her family's tickets have been refunded and we will cover the cost of her family's overnight accommodations in Lihue,' Alaska spokeswoman Halley Knigge stated. 'While our employee had the customer’s well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.' Alaska Airlines apologized for the incident but said the employee had Sedway's health in mind. 'We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced Monday,' Knigge said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. Sedway posted on her Facebook page on Wednesday that the 'silver lining' of her family's experience would be that the value of their airline tickets would go to study the blood cancer multiple myeloma, for which she is being treated. She wrote 'Our family talked during the flight home from Hawaii, and decided how we wanted this situation to conclude. As with most unpleasant times, there are silver linings, if we're determined to find them. Here, we plan to donate the airfare, to be refunded by Alaska Airlines, to the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation – MMRF. In the future, we hope this airline will look at events of this kind with increased wisdom and sensitivity.'","Elizabeth Sedway, 51, has rare plasma cancer and was returning to California with her husband and two children from Hawaii vacation .

"The former BBC economics editor made headlines last week after it emerged she had been ‘secretly’ dating Ed Miliband . Former BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders yesterday broke her silence over her fling with Ed Miliband, describing it as 'fleeting and very costly'. She made headlines last week after it emerged she had been ‘secretly’ dating the Labour leader when he first met his wife Justine in 2004. In a brief message on Twitter yesterday she said: ‘We “dated” fleetingly in 2004. Very costly few weeks it turns out’. It was unclear whether Miss Flanders was voicing regret over her relationship with Mr Miliband, or was embarrassed by the media coverage – or both. Miss Flanders, 46, accused the media of ‘raking over’ Mr Miliband’s past in the run-up to the election. But in fact the revelation about the timing of her relationship with the future Labour leader was revealed by Mrs Miliband during a soft-focus interview with the Labour-supporting Mirror newspaper, which was headlined ‘How I fell in love with Ed’. Mrs Miliband revealed the couple had first met at a London dinner party hosted by Miss Flanders in 2004. She recalled: ‘I thought he was good-looking and clever and seemed to be unattached. But we just went down a conversation cul-de-sac. Apparently we had nothing in common. ‘He just wanted to talk about economics – one of my least favourite subjects. None of our conversations went anywhere.’ Mrs Miliband said she had been ‘furious’ when she later found out that her future husband was not ‘unattached’ at all and was ‘secretly going out with’ the woman who had invited her to dinner. She did not name Miss Flanders. But Tony Blair’s biographer John Rentoul later revealed it was common knowledge in Labour circles that the BBC woman had hosted the dinner party. Mr Rentoul said: ‘Could the secrecy have been because he was a Treasury special adviser and Stephanie Flanders was a BBC economics journalist?’ The revelations also revived stories about Miss Flanders’s former relationship with Labour’s shadow chancellor Ed Balls, which is said to have been more serious than her fling with Mr Miliband. Miss Flanders, daughter of Michael Flanders of the musical comedy duo Flanders and Swann, met Mr Balls in 1989 at Harvard University where they were both Kennedy scholars. They later worked together as leader writers at the Financial Times. Miss Flanders, 46, accused the media of ‘raking over’ Mr Miliband’s past in the run-up to the election. Miss Flanders, now a mother of two, went on to spend years reporting on economics for the BBC, firstly on Newsnight and then as the corporation’s economics editor. In 2013 she quit the corporation to take a lucrative job as chief European market strategist for the fabulously wealthy US investment bank JP Morgan, where Tony Blair is a senior adviser. Last week’s revelations led to a series of stories about Mr Miliband’s tangled love life before he met his wife. In an interview yesterday, the Labour leader played down the controversy, saying: ‘I’m not at all bothered about attacks on me, but I don’t think it’s very nice for the other people who are not in the public eye.’ Labour sources also dismissed the row, saying it would help dispel characterisations of him as a geek. But one poll yesterday showed a sharp deterioration in Mr Miliband’s approval ratings among women. The Opinium survey showed that the Labour leader’s approval rating among women fell by nine points in a week. Just 24 per cent of women think Mr Miliband is doing a good job, compared to 45 per cent who do not, giving him a net approval rating of minus 21, compared to minus 12 the previous week. His approval rating among men is minus 15.","Ms Flanders was ‘secretly’ dating Labour leader when he first met Justine .

"When the Queen, then aged 86, was filmed 'jumping out of a plane' during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, no one was more surprised than her grandson, Prince William. Describing her as an 'unbelievably good sport', he added:  'Harry got a sniff of a rumour on the night and the rumour mill was going into overdrive. 'But, in fact, she did such a good performance that she's been asked to star in the next Bond film. I'm thrilled for her.' Scroll down for video . Birthday: The Queen, pictured at Newbury Racecourse on Saturday, is celebrating her 89th birthday today . While the Queen's cameo role as a Bond girl came as a surprise to her grandsons, her still-sharp sense of fun did not and, as she turns 89, it's one that shows no sign of diminishing. Just last week, she was spotted looking animated and crossing her fingers at the Newbury Races while cheering on her filly, Ring of Truth. Although the two-year-old bay only managed second place, the Queen, who still goes to the races whenever she can, clearly enjoyed herself. Her Majesty is also a regular rider and is frequently spotted riding out in Windsor Great Park on her black Fell pony Carltonlima Emma - despite, as she turns 89, reaching an age where most other riders have hung up their hats for good. Sense of humour: The Queen proved her sense of humour remains undiminished with her James Bond spoof . Active: The Queen still rides regularly and is pictured out in Windsor Great Park last week . Long-standing love: The Queen, pictured in 1968 and 1972, has long adored all things equestrian . But the Queen is an expert when it comes to defying her advancing years and, along with maintaining a schedule that would leave people a third of her age exhausted, continues to enjoy herself much as she always has. Although recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over Trooping the Colour on horseback - the Queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and, according to sources, is a familiar sight at her Windsor stables. She is said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. Her Majesty also puts in regular appearances at the Windsor Horse Show and is frequently seen watching the action during the Cartier Polo Cup - a tournament that takes place at the Guards' Polo Club in Windsor. Although, unlike her grandsons William and Harry, the Queen has never played polo herself, she has long been a fan of the sport. Showing her nerves: The Queen grimaces while watching her filly Ring of Truth last week . Shared love: The Duke of Edinburgh also shares her love of racing and polo . Popular: While the Queen cannot ride as much as she'd like, she still has a heavy work schedule . But while her advancing age has curtailed the Queen's ability to ride, she still partakes in many of the habits picked up as a young woman, among them a penchant for a pre-lunch gin and Dubonnet. Like her mother, who lived to be 102, Her Majesty is also said to be fond of a pre-dinner gin and tonic but turns down fancy fare in favour of plainer dishes. According to former royal chef Darren Brady, a typical lunch for Her Majesty is grilled Dover Sole served with wilted greens - that followed by an afternoon tea with 'at least two kinds of sandwiches' at four. For supper, the Queen has more fish or game such as pheasant sent to Windsor from her estate at Sandringham or Balmoral. Perhaps this hearty but plain fare explains her continuing good health and her ability to manage what remains a heavy workload . Meetings: She meets the British PM once a week and 'regularly speaks' to those elsewhere . Role: The Queen performing her role as Queen of Australia with a visit to an Aboriginal culture show in 2002 . State opening: The Queen, here as Queen of New Zealand, opening Parliament in Wellington in 1977 . Patriotic: The Queen, here of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, meeting children in Hampshire . Her Majesty  spends most afternoons welcoming incoming ambassadors to Buckingham Palace, presiding over investitures or, as she did last week, taking part in visits on behalf of one of the 16 countries of which she is head of state. She also has a weekly audience with the UK prime minister, currently David Cameron, and 'speaks regularly' to the prime ministers of the 15 other countries where she is head of state, among them Australia's Tony Abbott and Canada's Stephen Harper. Under the Queen, the monarchy has also modernised and embraces the latest technology, including social media. The Queen is currently the world's most followed royal, with her account, @BritishMonarchy, followed by 970,000 people. Her first post, an anodyne comment about the opening of an exhibition at the Science Museum, went viral - as did her first photo-bomb. The moment, which came during last summer's Commonwealth Games, saw Her Majesty appear in the background of a selfie being taken by Hockeyroos player, Jayde Taylor, 30. Her Majesty also made her first, if unscheduled, appearance in a selfie in June when 14-year-old Jack Surgenor darted in for a cheeky snap during a walkabout in Belfast's St. George's Market. Photo-bomb! This snap of the Queen by Australian hockey player Jayde Taylor rapidly went viral . First selfie: 14-year-old Jack Surgenor snaps a cheeky selfie with the Queen during a visit in Belfast . First Tweet: The Queen sends her first official Twitter message during a visit to the Science Museum . Beyond selfies and social media, the Queen continues to make waves in the sartorial world with her trademark shift dresses and colourful coats, all of which are regularly referenced by the world's top designers. Even her Launer London handbags are enjoying renewed popularity, with the brand regularly selling out colourful special edition versions of her favourite £1,075 Traviata style. At home, her family are enjoying a period of relative peace and, as she celebrates her 89th birthday, the Queen is about to become a great-grandmother for the fifth time. But for Her Majesty, who is spending today privately with her family at Windsor Castle, the imminent arrival is just one of a number of reasons to be pleased. Still riding, still enjoying the races and still unafraid to surprise family and the public alike, the Queen, nearly ninety, surely is the world's coolest great-grandmother.

"Kenyatta Leal has something millions of people would give anything for: the ability to bring the cream of Silicon Valley’s executives to their feet. However, unlike most app developers, he learnt about technology not at MIT or at Stanford, but at San Quentin Correctional Facility. He is the first graduate of The Last Mile, the world’s only prison-based tech incubator. Unprecedented: This is Kenyatta Leal, the first graduate of San Quentin's tech program that teaches prisoners who have never experienced the internet how to code and build a business for when they are paroled . Leal was one of 15 prisoners who was selected from about 200 to undergo six months of intensive business training with Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to develop their own business plan - while inside San Quentin. MC Hammer acted as one of his numerous mentors. Each prisoner that applies to the scheme must complete an application process, as they would for a job, explaining their history and their ambitions, plus one 'essay question' about their life. Leal was handed a life sentence in 1994 for his third strike, unlawfully possessing a firearm after committing a felony. He was locked up in the country’s oldest men’s prison, which has housed Charles Manson and Bobby Kennedy killer Sirhan Sirhan. But in 2011 he was handed a lifeline: programming. The business program teaches inmates about the internet, a phenomenon invented in the mid-90s after most of them were incarcerated. The aim is for each to develop a business idea to embark on after their release as most struggle to find work 'on the outside’. Now, after being paroled in 2013, Leal is lobbying investors to back the unprecedented method of criminal rehabilitation: teaching cons about technology. 'I’ve been very lucky,' he told DailyMail.com. 'I was completely lost when I was incarcerated. I didn’t know what I was doing. 'Then I started hearing about this thing called the internet. My family started visiting me with these things called smart phones, we would talk about 'the internet' inside. 'I was asking, ""What is 'tweeting'? What is a 'blog'? What is 'Google'?"" I wanted to know more.' The program was started in 2011 by venture capitalists Chris Redlitz and his wife Beverly Parenti, who were asked to perform a half-hour guest speech to prisoners. But, intrigued by the questions they were asked, they stayed for hours and as they left, vowed to come back. California has a 61 per cent rate of re-offending within the first years - the highest of any state. And criminals cost $47,000 a year. Kenyatta Leal became a star of his class by developing a live version of Fantasy Football called Coach Potato - which will launch after he completes his second degree in business management. Chris Schuhmacher, who is serving a life sentence for stabbing to death a friend that stole a suitcase of marijuana from his apartment 12 years ago, is another star student, now developing a fitness app. Horatio Herts, is currently in Pittsburgh advising state legislators on how to tackle obesity. His business plan was called The Healthy Hearts Foundation. It focuses on ways to help overweight Americans get back in shape. James Houston has built a curriculum to teach under-privileged, inner-city children about technology. As Americans struggle to land jobs, and employers place an increased emphasis on computer literacy, prisoners who have never even seen a computer are sidelined from any tech-related occupations.

'We need to do something. And imagine the untapped potential in prisons. Criminal behavior and entrepreneurial behavior have a lot of things in common. Entrepreneurs are looking to get things done and quickly and get to the bottom line. Criminals do as well.

"Two TSA employees have been fired after they used the airport body scanner inappropriately to allow the male worker to fondle male passengers' genitals. The pair allegedly worked as a team to manipulate the results of a full body scanner at a security check-point in Denver International Airport last year, CBS4 reported. According to a Denver Police Department report seen by Daily Mail Online, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) received an anonymous tip in November last year that an employee had admitted to 'groping' men who came through security. Scroll down for video . The male employee and a female accomplice allegedly worked as a team to manipulate the TSA screening system at Denver International airport in 2014 . According to the report: 'When a male he finds attractive comes to be screened by the scanning machine, he will alert another TSA screener to indicate to the scanning computer that the party being screened is female. 'When the screener does this, the scanning machine will indicate an anomaly in the genital area.' The male TSA employee would then perform pat downs of the male passenger's genitals at the Colorado airport. Despite receiving an employee tip-off to the alleged sexual assaults in November, the TSA only investigated in February. A TSA supervisor told police that he saw the male employee 'give a signal' then after the screening device showed the anomaly 'conduct a pat down of the passenger's front groin and buttocks area with the palms of his hands... contradictory to TSA searching policy'. The female employee was questioned and admitted she had taken part in the assaults on unsuspecting passengers a total of 11 times. Both employees were fired following the incident. The TSA said that efforts to find the male Southwest Airlines passenger who was targeted had been unsuccessful. No other complaints have been made. Denver Police Department were unable to file criminal charges because no victims had been identified. The TSA refused to provide the names of the employees involved. The agency told Daily Mail Online on Tuesday: 'These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable. TSA has removed the two officers from the agency. 'All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.'

"Doctors have been accused of letting a woman die after wrongly concluding she had terminal cancer. Medics told the family of Margaret Hesketh that there was little they could do for the 70-year-old because she was riddled with tumours, her children will claim at an inquest this week. The family claim she was then put on a discredited Liverpool Care Pathway-style treatment for the dying – having fluid and nutrition drips removed six days before she passed away. Medics told the family of Margaret Hesketh there was little they could do for the 70-year-old because she was riddled with tumours . But they claim a post-mortem found no sign of cancer in the grandmother-of-six, and that she died of pneumonia while malnourished. Daughter Karen Masters, 45, said: ‘I want a criminal investigation. I want somebody to tell me why a 70-year-old died in this way.’ Mrs Hesketh went in to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan on October 28 last year with an infected bed sore and suspected pneumonia. Her medical notes reported that the former factory worker was in ‘poor general health’: she was a smoker who suffered from lung disease and had a heart attack 12 years ago. Doctors ruled out surgery to remove pressure sores because they feared she would not survive the operation. About ten days after she was admitted a consultant summoned the family to tell them a scan had revealed cancer. A Macmillan nurse allegedly told the family Mrs Hesketh probably had less than three months to live. Mrs Hesketh went in to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan, above, on October 28 last year with an infected bed sore and suspected pneumonia . On November 19, the family say they noticed that Mrs Hesketh’s feeding tubes had been removed and asked for them to be put back. But, they claim, they were told it would cause unnecessary distress. She died six days later. Mrs Masters said: ‘The doctors have destroyed us. We have had to sit there and watch her die, not knowing that she didn’t actually have terminal cancer.’ Hospitals were instructed to phase out the Liverpool Care Pathway in 2013 after a review uncovered ‘heartbreaking’ cases in which patients suffered days of dehydration before their deaths. The hospital said: ‘Due to patient confidentiality, we are unable to give any more details but more information will emerge at the public inquest where a more balanced view of events will emerge. ‘We can confirm that since July 2014, Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust decided to disregard the Liverpool Care Pathway with regard to patients.’","Medics told the family of Margaret Hesketh she was riddled with tumours .

"When Jade and Ross Morley were told that their first baby, Floyd-Henry, had a rare form of dwarfism called Achondroplasia, they made the decision that their son would be celebrated instead of pitied. The Morleys, from Casuarina on the north coast of NSW, released a video to explain Floyd's condition to their friends and family, in a bid to make their community a kinder place for their 'little legend'. Less than two years later, Floyd is now a big brother to three-week-old twins, and his mum Jade said that she knows the two newest additions to their family will be his biggest supporters. Scroll down for video . Jade and Ross Morley have welcomed twins into their family, making their son Floyd-Henry, who has Achondroplasia dwarfism, a big brother . Harrison Stone Morley and Cleo Téa Morley were born at 37 weeks on March 20, meaning the Morley household now has three children under 20 months- a fact which Jade said is 'crazy'. 'It was pretty unexpected. We were utterly shocked when we found out we were having twins,' Jade told Daily Mail Australia. The twins were born on March 20 this year . The Morley's aren't strangers to unexpected news, finding out when Floyd was only five months old that he had a rare genetic condition which meant he didn't grow as quickly as other kids. 'When we had Floyd we thought he was just a normal, happy baby. At about four months we noticed that he had really chubby arms and legs and knew something wasn't right,' Jade said. 'Even when our pediatrician ordered x-rays, we still didn't think anything was wrong. But when they came back with his notes on them, mentioning characteristics like short legs and low muscle tone, I Googled them and dwarfism just jumped out at me from every page,' she said. 'The day the pediatrician called to tell us Floyd had Achondroplasia was the day that changed it all.' Jade said that she and her husband Ross were 'utterly devastated' by the diagnosis, especially because the only information she could find about Achondroplasia was quite negative. 'We couldn't find anything that told us that we would be fine, that this wasn't a death sentence and that we wouldn't be going through big surgeries,' she said. While the couple were still grappling with the news, they decided to tell a few of their close friends about Floyd's Achondroplasia. The Morley household now has three children under 20 months- a fact which Jade said is 'crazy' 'It was pretty unexpected. We were utterly shocked when we found out we were having twins,' Jade said . Harrison Stone Morley and Cleo Téa Morley were born at 37 weeks . The twins are healthy and feeding well and are much loved by their big brother Floyd . 'When we told one of our friends, she gasped, she couldn't believe it.  I decided from that day I was going to educate my friends and family because I didn’t want them to be sorry for Floyd, we wanted to celebrate him and have them be happy for us,' Jade said. 'I said to my husband that it would be a nice idea do a celebratory video about Floyd and his diagnosis. I wanted to show that even though he would be a bit different that was it, I wanted to stop stares of the community because everyone would know him,' she said. The video was posted to Facebook and which explained how Jade and Ross met, fell in love, married, and had a 'beautiful baby boy'. The clip explains that Floyd-Henry was diagnosed with Achondroplasia, which means he will be 'a shorty- a little man, a little legend'. 'We were just going to send it out in an email to our friends and family, so it was pretty nervewracking just putting it out there. Some of our best friends didn't even know about Floyd and we just threw it up on the internet,' Jade said. The video quickly went viral, and was shared and liked around the world, as well as used by dwarfism awareness websites as inspirational. 'The response was beautiful, no one said they were sorry, everyone said 'how wonderful', which is exactly what he is,' Jade said. 'What's beautiful is that it's really doing it's job and educating our local community, which was the most important thing for me,' she said. Jade and Ross posted a video to Facebook to explain Floyd's Achondroplasia .

Every day in the street someone will come up to me and say 'This is Floyd', and they know who he is and we don’t have to explain that he is different.' Floyd is now a happy, healthy 20-month-old, who is very excited about having two new playmates around. 'He loves the twins, he's fascinated with them. Every morning when he wakes up he says 'mumma' and then points to the cot where the twins are sleeping,' Jade said. 'Floyd tries to talk to the 'bubbas' and pats them on the head. He's such a kind little boy which is all I care about,' she said. The twins don't carry the gene mutation that caused Floyd's mutation, and weren't genetically disposed as Floyd's condition was caused by a random rather than inherited syndrome. 'It happens in one in 40,000 babies, so they had just as much chance as getting it as anyone. We never even thought about it with them, and though we had scans right up until the birth because they were twins, we never even thought about testing them,' Jade said. Jade said that she and Ross are looking forward to their three kids being best friends, and to them loving each other well. 'I just hope they love each other and support each other. It's how I grew up, my brother and sisters are everything to me and I want that for my children,' she said. Floyd is now a happy, healthy 20-month-old, who is very excited about having two new playmates around . Achondroplasia affects one in every 40,000 babies and is nomally a random genetic mutation . 'Cleo and Harry will be Floyd's biggest supporters, beside me and Ross.' 'Floyd is such a little dude, he is so cheeky and has the most beautiful soul. He is so funny and loves a bit of attention. We just can't get over his cuteness, he just stomps all over the house.' Jade said that Floyd is an intelligent little boy who has a big future ahead of him. 'Most of his demands come from his complications. He has low muscle tone which means he doesn't have as much ability as other kids,' she said. 'In two weeks he's having an operation to put in his gromits [hearing aids] which we're looking forward to because at the moment it would just sound to him like he's underwater.' The Morley's, who said they aren't very different from many other parents, are passionate about raising the profile of Achondroplasia in Australia. They use their tag line 'he's small, that's all' in their approach to life with Floyd, and are active in connecting with other parents with children who have differences. 'There are so many parents out there that are going through a similar experience, and I think that's why people relate to us,' Jade said. 'When you have a child that's a little different, you enter a world of really accepting and understanding parents,' she said. Jade said that she and Ross are looking forward to their three kids being best friends . Jade said that she knows the two newest additions to their family will be his biggest supporters . We were utterly shocked when we found out we were having twins,' Jade said . Jade said that she feels that both she and Ross are better people because of their experience, and that they both 'just want to meet people who are different' all the more. 'We didn't know anything about Floyd's condition when he was diagnosed and I remember thinking that people aren't treating those with it very well,' she said. 'I remember very clearly one night deciding that if this is what he has, I was going to educate the entire world. His world is going to be a kind world and the only way that is going to happen is if we get something out there.' Jade said that what she is most passionate about is encouraging children who are curious about Floyd to come over and ask about his Achondroplasia. 'I would prefer a kid who is staring to be encouraged by their parents to come over and ask 'how come he is littler?' than just stare and have their parent tell them to stop looking, or shush them,' she said. 'I want to spark conversations and have kids talk about it. Then I can tell them that Floyd is just like you or me but small.'","Jade and Ross Morley released a video to explain to their friends and family that their first child Floyd-Henry had Achondroplasia dwarfism .

The study found that the three names most likely to vote Tory were Charlotte, Fiona and Pauline whereas those least likely to were Sharon, Samantha – unfortunately for the PM – and Clare without an i. The three most likely to vote Labour were Michelle, June and Andy and the least likely were Nigel, Nick and Jonathan. The most likely LibDem names were Tim, Kathryn and Samantha. The study comes just a day after it was revealed a Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'.","Those named Nigel are twice as likely to vote Ukip, according to research .

"Victims at an Australian orphanage have told of the horrific abuse they suffered at the hands of the priests and nuns who ran the institution from claims of being raped by a broom handle to being forced to drink their own urine. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse in Rockhampton has also heard a woman was gang raped by employees and then had a child at 14 years of age. While a retired nurse, who was sent to Neerkol orphanage near Rockhampton, said she was punched and slapped repeatedly, and a third victim claimed she was raped more than 100 times by parish priest Reginald Durham, who is now dead, from when she was 11. Scroll down for video . The royal commission in Queensland heard from alleged victims who suffered at the hands of nuns and priests who ran the Neerkol orphanage near Rockhampton . The Rockhampton hearing in Queensland, which started on Tuesday, is expected to go until April 24. A victim identified as AYL told the inquiry she had allegedly been routinely raped by a male employee from 1963, and in claims aired publicly for the first time said on one occasion the man and two other employees bound, gagged and raped her at the orphanage. AYL also recalled an incident where she was allegedly raped with a broom handle by employee Kevin Baker, The Courier Mail reported. The day before her own assault was carried out she claimed she had witnessed Baker sexually abusing a boy until he bled. When she informed a nun at the institution, the boy was allegedly slapped in the face. The next day AYL claims Baker raped her and threatened if she levelled another accusation at him again 'it won’t be a few inches, but a few feet'. AYL, who was sent to the orphanage in 1961 at the age of 10, assumed he meant this as a reference to the broom. She also claimed at age 14 she gave birth at a girls' home in Mitchelton, in Brisbane's north, and the child was taken away by a nun who was present at the delivery. About 4000 children passed through what was known as St Joseph's Orphanage between 1885 and 1978 . 'I do not know what happened to the baby,' AYL told the commission. 'At the time, I was told that I was having the devil taken out of me.' The woman said she had previously asked for the claims she gave birth to be included in her March statement to the commission but they were not. She told the inquiry she was made to scrub the floor with a toothbrush when she told a priest about the sexual abuse she suffered at Neerkol. The commission has heard the nuns who ran the orphanage meted out savage and arbitrary punishments to children, and some residents were molested by priests who are now deceased. Former residents told of being locked in rooms and cupboards, starved of food and water, being forced to drink their own urine for hydration and to lick their own vomit. Claims ranged from being raped by a broom handle to being gang raped to being forced to drink their own urine . On the first day of hearing, a 67-year-old woman who worked at Neerkol said former Catholic bishop of the Rockhampton Diocese Brian Heenan had been originally dismissive of her claims she was raped more than 100 times by Durham. 'After each time I was sexually abused, I had to go to confession to him and confess my sin of impurity,' the woman, identified as AYB said. Durham was in 1999 sentenced to 18 months prison for indecently dealing with the woman but many more serious charges involving her and other complainants were discontinued. The commission also heard from retired nurse Mary Adams, 64, who was at the orphanage between the 1950s and 1960s. She claimed she suffered repeated emotional, physical and sexual mistreatment at the hands of nuns and priests at Neerkol. Sobbing uncontrollably at times, Ms Adams told the hearing in Rockhampton she was punched, slapped, pulled by her hair and on one occasion flogged with a skipping rope so forcefully she struggled to walk for days. The commission will be hearing from 13  former residents of the orphanage located in south-east Queensland . Boys who tried to run away from Neerkol were publicly flogged with horse whips and those who wet the bed were forced to stand with the soiled sheets draped over their heads. Ms Adams recounted how when aged 12 she confided in a visiting priest, and he tried to rape her. Another priest repeatedly molested her while she was billeted to a foster carer in Mackay, the commission heard. The royal commission hearing is expected to run until April 24. Pictured is Justice Jennifer Coate . She later received $20,000 compensation from the Catholic Diocese of Rockhampton and the Sisters of Mercy, who ran the orphanage. But she said nothing could ever heal the pain she had suffered because of the alleged abuse. 'No amount of money can ever give back my childhood, my loss of confidence, my lack of formal education, my dignity, my self-esteem and self-worth,' Ms Adams said. She also claimed Bishop Heenan made no real attempt to identify the priest who sexually assaulted her. A fourth victim, Diane Carpenter, said she was led to believe all five of her siblings, including herself, were abused. She lived at Neerkol until she was 17 years old on a number of occasions and claimed she was physically abused by the Sister of Mercy nuns, the ABC reported. On one occasion Ms Carpenter said she was forced to drink her own urine to keep hydrated while she was locked in an 'extremely hot room'. Many former residents of Neerkol who received payouts and formal apologies from the church said they could not erase the horrible memories. 'I can never be compensated for the abuse I suffered at Neerkol,' AYL said. 'I just wish that I could wind back the clock and be a child.' The commission is investigating historical allegations of child abuse at the Neerkol St Joseph's Orphanage near Rockhampton, which was operated by the Sisters of Mercy until 1978. About 4000 children passed through what was known as St Joseph's Orphanage between 1885 and 1978.

"Officer Michael Slager is being kept in isolation and can not walk down a hall without the entire cell block being cleared first, according to his lawyer. Slager, 33, is charged with murder after opening fire on Walter Scott, 50, after reportedly stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Saturday. His attorney Andy Savage told CBS that Slager is housed in a room with one small window and does not have any interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail. Scroll down for video . Patrolman Michael Slager, 33, is charged with murder after opening fire on Walter Scott, 50, after reportedly stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Saturday. Pictured: Slager and an unknown woman . Slager pictured with two women who have not been identified. His attorney Andy Savage told CBS that Slager is housed in a room with one small window and does not have any interaction with any other detainees at Charleston County jail . He said that when he met Slager on Wednesday for 60 minutes, that it took an hour and 45 minutes to move the North Charleston police officer to the meeting place because they had to clear all of the cell blocks. A jail staff member told the New York Daily News: 'He wouldn’t last one week in the general population. Everyone inside is talking about it. Of course people want to get at him.' CBS reports Slager's mother is expected to visit her son Friday for the first time since the shooting. She has defended her son in an interview, saying she cannot believe that he would do anything like what he's accused of. Karen Sharpe (above) the mother of North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager, defended her son in an interview . Killing: Walter Scott, left, was killed by Michael Slager, right. Scott was in the Coast Guard for two years, and is pictured left in uniform. Slager is being held in jail on murder charges, and is pictured right in his prison mugshot . She also revealed that his wife, who is eight months pregnant, is devastated. Ms Sharpe said that she will never watch the video footage of the fatal shooting. She also expressed her sympathy for Walter Scott's family, the man her son shot dead. I just can't,' Sharpe told ABC News. 'Maybe to some people, 'Well, you're being in denial,' but I'm sorry I just can't. I just - I know how Michael is.' She went on to say her son loved being an officer. 'I can't imagine him doing something, it's just not like him,' she said of the shooting. 'That's just not his character. It's not.' On Friday it was revealed that no warrant had been issued for Walter Scott's arrest when he ran from Officer Michael Slager moments before he was shot dead, it has been revealed. Court records show he was $7,500 behind on child support when he was pulled over on Saturday and had already been jailed three times for missing payments. His family believe the fear of being thrown back in prison was the reason he tried to flee during the deadly traffic stop. But there was nothing directing officers to bring him in to face a family court judge, despite the fact his last payment was only in 2012. Escape: Dashcam footage released on Thursday shows Walter Scott running away from his car minutes before he is shot dead by Officer Michael Sager. His family believed he fled over fears he would be arrested for being behind on child support payments . History: Scott had already been jailed three times over missed payments, but court records have revealed there was no warrant out for his arrest when he was pulled over. Minutes later he was shot dead . In 2008, after a traffic stop in which he was charged with an open-container violation and driving under suspension, he was sent to jail in Charleston for six months for failing to pay about $6,800. In 2011, bench warrants ordered deputies to bring him in, and Scott spent a night in jail when he was $7,500 behind. In 2012, he spent another night in jail when he owed $3,500. On Thursday a police dashboard camera video released Thursday shows Scott bolting from his Mercedes after he pulled over. The camera on Slager's patrol car captures him telling Scott his third brake light is broken, before asking him to produce insurance papers. Scott, who appears to be accompanied by a person in the passenger seat, explains he does not have any documents as he has yet to officially buy the car. 'I haven't bought it yet, I'm about to do that Monday.... My car is down,' he says. Horrifying: Scott was gunned down as he ran away from Sager, who has since been charged with his murder . The officer appears calm, checks his licence, then tells him: 'I'll be right back with you.' When Slager returns to his vehicle, Scott flees, running towards the park where he would die moments later. Off camera, a scuffle can be heard, with shouts of 'Taser, Taser, Taser!' and 'Get on the ground!' Slager's account has been called into question after a shocking video taken by a witness shows the officer shooting Scott in the back. In the dash cam footage, captured from Slager's patrol car, the officer explains, 'The reason I've pulled you over is because your third brakelight is out.' The conversation is muffled, with music playing in Slager's car obscuring the sound. He can be heard asking Scott for his licence, registration and insurance card. Scott responds that he doesn't have papers as he has not yet to bought the car. 'Alright let me see your licence,' Slager replies. 'So you don't have any papers in the glove pocket?' Scott repeats that he does not and he is paying for the car on Monday. Slager returns to his car. A minute later, Scott opens the door, and gestures to Slager, who shouts, 'you've got to stay in the car!' Scott then sits back inside the car - and moments later flees. The only other footage of the incident shows the moment Scott was shot. Released earlier this week, it begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.","Officer Michael Slager is being held at Charleston County jail .

"A sure sign of middle age is when you start to get nostalgic about the mobile phones of your youth. OK, those early models couldn’t do much compared with today’s smartphones. They couldn’t surf the internet, take pictures, play music or make you a cup of tea. But what they did have was a battery that lasted more than a few hours before the phone went dead. Scroll down for video . Modern life: According to a recent poll, nine out of ten people feel stressed if their phone battery run out. There’s even a word for it — ‘nomophobia’, the fear of being without a working mobile . My favourite phone of all time was a sleek silver Nokia 6310i from the early 2000s, which is still sitting in a drawer at home. It may be primitive by today’s standards, but it could run for 17 days on a single charge. Compare that with the battery life of a modern iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. Make a few calls, send a few emails, listen to some music and you’ll be out of juice by teatime. This week it was revealed that Sir James Dyson, inventor of Dyson hoovers, is attempting to solve the problem by investing £10 million in U.S.-based battery experts Sakti3. The 67-year-old entrepreneur is supporting the company as it attempts to double the battery life of our phones, electric cars and vacuums. Separately, scientists at Stanford University are hoping that their newly invented aluminium battery will revolutionise the industry with its ability to fully charge in under a minute. The battery will keep going for seven times as long as its lithium-ion relative, and can apparently withstand 7,500 recharges, whereas a conventional battery can take only 1,000. In the tech world, the battle for better battery life is never-ending. Earlier this month, Apple was left red-faced when it was revealed how quickly its new iWatch — which costs up to £12,000 — ran out of power. Sir James Dyson, pictured, inventor of Dyson hoovers, is attempting to solve the problem by investing £10 million in  battery experts Sakti3 . At the launch, Apple chief executive Tim Cook boasted that the device had a battery life of 18 hours. But it later emerged that using the smartwatch for phone calls or apps means it will die after three hours. According to a recent poll, nine out of ten people feel stressed if their phone battery run out. There’s even a word for it — ‘nomophobia’, the fear of being without a working mobile. And increasingly, phones come with built-in batteries that are almost impossible to remove without a degree in electronics. Apple started the ball rolling with the iPhone, and this month Samsung announced its latest model — the S6 — would have built-in batteries. So is there anything we can do to get more juice out of our phones? Nigel Linge, professor of telecommunications at Salford University, says the problem isn’t the batteries, which have improved immeasurably over the past couple of decades. ‘The reason why batteries lasted seven days in the 1990s is that a phone back then didn’t do a great deal,’ says Professor Linge. ‘It had a monochrome screen, made phone calls and sent the occasional text. It didn’t have apps, GPS, Bluetooth or wi-fi and it wasn’t used for Facebook. ‘If you take a modern phone and turn off all those things and just use it for phone calls and text messages, it will last a lot longer.’ The first mobile phone batteries were bulky, heavy and made with nickel cadium. They also lost battery life over time if they were not run down fully between charges, known as the ‘memory effect’. In the 1990s those early batteries were replaced by a superior version — nickel metal hydride. These didn’t suffer as badly from the memory effect, were thinner and quicker to charge. Today’s phones use lithium-ion batteries, an even thinner, lighter and even longer-lasting variety. How long they last depends what you do with them. Caught out: Early mobile models couldn't surf the internet, take pictures, play music or make you a cup of tea. But what they did have was a battery that lasted more than a few hours before the phone went dead . ‘One of the big drains is the screen — if people have the brightness turned up, it will run down the battery,’ says Professor Linge. ‘The other drain is the phone signal.’ If you are in a low signal area, your battery will drain more quickly because the phone has to work harder to stay in contact with the nearest phone mast. Phones also use up more of the battery if they are indoors, where signals are weaker. But Sunetra Chakravarti, from Mobile Choice Magazine, says there are simple things everyone can do to extend their phone’s life between charges. Turning off Bluetooth — the wireless system used by phones to connect to printers, laptops and other computers — will save your battery from running down. Switching off location services which use the phone’s built-in GPS tracker can also save power, as can turning down the volume of the ring tone and silencing any bleeps and clicks when you press buttons on the phone. ‘And make sure you have turned off any apps that are running in the background,’ she says. Keeping phones cool is also crucial: they work best below 30c (86f). So leaving them in the sun, or sleeping with the phone so it gets warm, will run it down faster. However, unlike the older style batteries, you don’t need to discharge modern ones fully before you top them up. Charging overnight shouldn’t cause problems, as modern phones and batteries have switches that stop the charging when they are full. Another way to get more out of a battery is to download the latest version of the phone’s operating system. Newer versions of the software used for Apple iPhones, for instance, let owners stop apps from constantly updating themselves with new information when they are not being used. Even then, you’ll still find major variations between different phones. That’s because some models are more efficient at making calls, surfing the internet or playing videos than others. When technology consumer website Expert Reviews tested the battery life of different smartphones, it found that the best lasted an amazing 14 hours longer than the worst. The Sony Xperia Z3 Compact kept playing a movie on a loop for more than 20 hours on one charge before it went dead — while the Nokia Lumia 620 managed just six hours and the iPhone 6 lasted just under 13 hours. Apple was left red-faced when it was revealed how quickly its new iWatch (pictured) ran out of power. It emerged that using the smartwatch for phone calls or apps means it will die after three hours . Other tests have found that the Xperia Z3 lasts on average 48 hours when used for five hours a day to stream music, make calls and watch videos. You may still need to replace a battery; a typical one will start to lose its ability to recharge after three or four years. But replacing batteries is becoming more and more difficult. Manufacturers are increasingly building batteries into phones so that owners can’t remove them. You can send your iPhone off to Apple to get the battery replaced, though it will take a week and cost £59 plus postage. And it is possible to do it yourself with a screwdriver and a replacement iPhone battery — available for around £15 on eBay. But it’s fairly tricky to pull off and easy to damage the phone. Some mobile repair shops will also replace batteries — and charge a lot less than Apple. The bright spot on the horizon is that it will soon take less time to charge up a phone. ‘Almost every manufacturer is bringing in faster charging, so with 15 minutes of charging you get four hours of talk time,’ says Sunetra Chakravarti. Sales of portable chargers are also booming. These slim boxes have to be charged in advance but are small enough to fit in a pocket. If your phone is running low, the charger tops up the battery. But until battery life catches up with the demands of modern phones, millions of mobile users will spend their life plugging in their phone to charge.","Most modern phone models have batteries that only last a couple of hours .

"This is the man who was caught on  surveillance cameras appeared to punch a three-year-old boy in the face at a supermarket. Justin Whittington, 23, was arrested on Friday in Bakersfield, California, and charged with child cruelty after the video of the alleged abuse surfaced online. But following interviews, his charge was changed from 'cruelty' to 'endangerment', and his bail dropped from $1 million to $20,000. On Saturday, Whittington posted bail. He will be released by Sunday morning, with a court date set for April 24. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Pictured: This is Justin Whittington, the man charged with punching a three-year-old boy in the face . The punch: Surveillance video shows a man chasing a toddler then hitting him in the face . The relationship between the toddler and Whittington has not yet been revealed by police but the owner of Vest Market Harry Dindral said the man was the boy's father and said that he's seen them in the store together before. The video posted to social media and shared thousands of times shows a boy running through Vest Market. The toddler is approached by a man believed to be his father who hits him in the face. The man then is then shown aggressively yanking up the toddler by his shirt. A pregnant woman, can be seen coming and taking the distraught boy away. The child appears to leave the store crying and covering his face. The police were notified of the video after it was leaked online. They asked the public for help identifying the man in the video who ruthlessly punched the small child. By midnight, the man who was caught on video punching the toddler, 23-year-old Justin Whittington, was in police custody. The Kern County Jail website showed Whittington remained behind bars on Friday with bail set at $1 million. 'That was horrible, man,' owner of Vest Market Harry Dindral told the Daily News. Horrifying: Video shows the injured boy crying on the floor, then the man who may his father, yanking him up off the ground by his shirt . 'The worst thing I've ever seen,' he said of the incident at his establishment. Dindral says he was in the back of the store when his employee ran to him and told him to watch the surveillance video to see if there was any proof of the violent assault. Dindral later gave the footage to cops who were able to track down the suspect. 'It was the right thing to do,' Dindral told the Daily News. 'You don’t hit a child like that.' Local Tattoo artist Chris Danaher who works near the market said he could never fathom acting violently towards a child. 'I would never imagine treating a child like that,' Danaher told ABC. 'His wife or girlfriend or whatever was clearly pregnant. She had no regard to it. She picked up her son and left the store,' he added. Danher said sadly the child is too young to truly understand what is going on. 'It's terrible. That kid is obviously too young to know what was going on. Honestly, couldn't be more than 3 years old, and I just couldn't imagine anyone doing that to me or me doing that to a child whatsoever,' said Danaher. The boy was later examined by medical personnel at his home and he did not require hospitalization. It is unknown whether or not he will be placed in new custody. A second video released on Friday shows Whittington allegedly picking up his son like a rag doll. The potential child abuse case is currently under investigation.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"After languishing at the bottom of the Pacific for a staggering 64 years, an aircraft carrier from the Second World War has been discovered 'amazingly intact'. Experts found the giant U.S. ship - which could incredibly still have a plane inside it - standing upright and listing only slightly. The USS Independence is resting 800m underwater off California's Farallon Islands with its hull and deck very well preserved and clearly visible. There also appears to be a plane in the hangar bay of the vessel, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said on Thursday. Scroll down for video .

Historic: Experts found the giant U.S. ship (pictured in 1943) - which could incredibly still have a plane inside it - standing upright and listing only slightly . High tech: Experts last month used an autonomous underwater vehicle called the Echo Ranger (pictured) made by Boeing to survey the Independence . Ambitious: The ranger was deployed as part of a two-year mission by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to find historic shipwrecks . Found: The USS Independence was found off California's Farallon Islands (pictured) with its hull and deck very well preserved and clearly visible . The veteran ship even survived an atomic bomb test after being chosen as a 'target vessel' for Operation Crossroads on July 1, 1946. After taking part in yet another explosion, it was eventually decommissioned in August 1946 before its highly radioactive hull was taken to San Francisco five years later. Controversy surrounds its sinking as some believe the ship was loaded with barrels of radioactive waste that subsequently contaminated the wildlife in the Farallon Islands. 'After 64 years on the seafloor, Independence sits on the bottom as if ready to launch its planes,' said James Delgado chief scientist on the NOAA mission. He added: 'This ship fought a long, hard war in the Pacific and after the war was subjected to two atomic blasts that ripped through the ship. 'It is a reminder of the industrial might and skill of the ""greatest generation"" that sent not only this ship but their loved ones to war.' The carrier is one of an estimated 300 wrecks in the waters off San Francisco - and the deepest known shipwreck in the sanctuary, according to NOAA. Independence operated in the central and western Pacific from November 1943 to August 1945 and later was one of more than 90 vessels assembled as a target fleet for atomic bomb tests in 1946 in the Marshall Islands.

"At Tokyo's Narita Airport, the newly-opened Terminal 3 sure has some quirky features. Among them, strips of brightly-coloured running track, which have been installed in the airport's hallways. While of course passengers are entertained by the latest buzzworthy stunt, we have to wonder: were they really intended to encourage travellers to dash to their boarding gate? Tokyo's Narita Airport has installed running tracks in its new Terminal 3 in honour of the 2020 Olympics . Turns out that the cushioned tracks were actually designed to celebrate the 2020 Olympics, which will be held in Tokyo. But there's no denying that the footpaths are extremely useful regardless. The blue path leads passengers toward departures, while arrivals can be reached by following the red pathway. Further, in each lane there are a series of icons, which include information such as the distance to other terminals, directions to nearby restaurants and shops and where to find outside transport options. The recently-opened terminal will be primarily used for departures and arrivals of low-cost carriers . To save money, the airport installed these cushioned running tracks, which also include directional information . All of the blue lanes lead towards the departure area, while the red track leads travellers to arrivals . The new terminal, which will be used for many of the city's low-cost carrier departures, first opened on April 8 and according to the website, the aim of the innovative tracks was, in part, to save money. 'To cut costs, we opted not to install the typical moving walkways or illuminated signs,' the terminal's website reads. 'Instead, to offer an exciting walking experience that is easy on the feet, we implemented running tracks used for track and field, and added signage for user-friendly guidance.'","In Terminal 3, cushioned running paths direct passengers to their gates .

Its CEO and president said in a statement: 'A criminal charge involving someone at our hospital is... highly distressing' The name of the patient has not been formally released, but the husband of Deanna Leblanc, 39 from Midland, told The Toronto Star she was the alleged victim. The mother of two died at the hospital on March 2, 2014, leaving the couple's two young sons aged 15 and 18. Her husband Michael Leblanc said Deanna had undergone a minor knee operation when she suddenly woke up in at 3am in the morning, feeling ‘like she was dying’. She was taken to Georgian Bay and as her condition rapidly deteriorated, she was put on life support. The furniture saleswoman died at around 8.30pm that evening. Mr Leblanc said he is still coming to terms with her death a year on. ‘It just wasn’t right’, he told The Star. ‘Thirty-nine years old and nothing wrong with her but a bum knee’. ‘This should never have happened’, he added. The police in Midland launched an investigation on March 6, and on Thursday announced they had arrested Flynn.

"A New York college has provoked anger after postponing its screening of movie American Sniper in response to complaints from Muslim students. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday. It said it will still show the Oscar-nominated movie but with an educational forum follow-up to allow students to discuss the film. Bradley Cooper in his Oscar Nominated role as Chris Kyle, the most deadly sniper in US military history . The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (pictured) in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday . The film was postponed because senior management at the college did not want to create animosity or tension among its students. However they appear to have done just the opposite. Following complaints from the RPI’s Muslim Students’ Association a number of students have said the postponement was an act of censorship and an attack on free speech, Fox News reported. While the film grossed a total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis . A statement from the university explained the aim of the screening, coupled with the now scheduled educational forum, was to allow students in the campus community to ‘participate in an intellectual discourse about the film and current world events’. American Sniper, a film by Clint Eastwood about US Navy Seal sharp-shooter Chris Kyle the most deadly sniper in US history, has courted controversy since it was first shown in the US in November. While the film grossed an international total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis. It was also accused of stoking racial hatred after screenings of the film led to a rise in threats against Americans of Middle Eastern origin and even some attacks on Muslims outside movie theaters. Earlier this month the University of Michigan flip-flopped over whether or not it would show the film on its campus. The college pulled a screening over student complaints but quickly did an about-face after news of the cancellation sparked a firestorm on campus. The school released statement saying the decision to cancel had not been consistent with the high value it placed on freedom of expression. Navy Seal and Iraq war veteran Chris Kyle, depicted in the film, was killed at a shooting range in Texas . The school's vice president for student life, E. Royster Harper, acknowledged that it was ‘a mistake’ to call off the screening. ‘The movie will be shown at the originally scheduled time and location,’ Harper’s statement read. ‘We recognize, however, that some students are uncomfortable with the content of the movie, and appreciate that concern.’ An Alternative screening of the Paddington Bear movie was offered to those students who did not want to watch the American Sniper.

"With 17 feature films, two fashion campaigns and a role as a UN Ambassador under her belt, it's hard to believe that Emma Watson is just 25. The Harry Potter star reached a quarter of a century yesterday, celebrating what must arguably be one of the recognisable A-lister names on the planet. Now renowned for her effortless style and influential role in women's right movements, Emma has come a long way from her frizzy-haired days as Harry Potter's loyal companion. Scroll down for video . Emma Watson turns 25 and has already carved a career that many of us can only dream of . But how has the actress made the transition from Hermione Granger to a feminist heroine? Here, FEMAIL charts her 14 years in the spotlight that have made her a global icon. 2001 . Emma was placed firmly in the global spotlight after taking on one of the world's most famous roles. Aged just 11, she joined the cast of Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone as the geeky but loyal Hermione Granger. Alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, she was catapulted to fame after the adaption of the JK Rowling book grossed at $317m (£214m) worldwide. Emma's career began when she landed the roll of Hermione Granger alongside Daniel Radcliffe (centre) and Rupert Grint (right) who play Daniel Radcliffe and Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter saga . Emma was just 11 when she filmed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. She is pictured here bright-eyed at her first ever premier for the first film . 2002 . A year later saw the release of the second film in the series - Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets which saw Harry Potter and Ron Weasley go it alone after Emma's character Hermione is petrified by a giant snake known as the Basilisk. Critics criticised the director Chris Columbus for under-employing Emma's talents in the film. After her appearance in the second Harry Potter flick critics criticised the director for underplaying Emma . 2004 . In the third installment of the Harry Potter series, Hermione took a more prominent role, aiding Harry in restoring peace in Hogwarts, travelling back in time. The actress earned kudos for her powerful female role after she famously punched the gang's arch Nemesis Draco Malfoy, which the actor Tom Felton described as 'hardcore'. The film also sees her famous frizz take some taming, as her hair appears softer and more tamed. 2005 . As Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire was released, Emma was recognised as an individual. She received a Bronze Otto Award for her performance and, after her Yule Ball costume sent many teenage boys' hearts a flutter, she landed a cover on Teen Vogue magazine. Hermione takes a much bigger role in Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban . Emma won over the hearts of many teenage boys when she was transformed from a girl to a woman at the Yule Ball in Harry Potter And Yhe Goblet Of Fire . Emma may be an on-screen siren however she was still finding her fashion feet in 2005 . 2007 . In the fifth film - Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix - we also begin to get a sense of her worth, with her earnings so far estimated to be £10m. This year also sees Emma branch out from her role as Hermione, taking the lead in the BBC production of Ballet Shoes based on the novel by Noel Streatfeild, which was aired over Christmas. It was also this year Emma considered leaving the Harry Potter franchise. When she was asked to renew her contract that she had been presented with at the tender age of nine, she wanted to give it serious thought after she said her life had become out of her control. 'I get told what time I can eat, when I have time to go to the bathroom. Every single second of my day is not in my power,' she said at the time. Eventually at the age of 16, she signed up for another five years with Warner Brothers. Emma's hair took a bleach blonde tone in 2007 following her appearance in the fifth Potter film . The BBC adaptation of Ballet Shoes was the first non-Potter role for Emma Watson aged 16 . 2008 . It was a role in which we heard Emma, but didn't see her as the actress voiced the role of Princess Pea in the animated film The Tale Of Desperaux. It was her first - and only - animated film to date. 2009 . In March 2009, Emma was named in sixth place on the Forbes list of the Most Valuable Young Stars. She was also named Hollywood's highest paid female star having earned an estimated £19m aged just 19. In 2009 both Emma and her brother Alex (left) took centre stage in the Burberry campaign . It was to be the first of several modelling jobs for the actress . Emma took on her first modelling job in 2009, appearing in the AW09 campaign images for Burberry alongside her brother Alex. She also appeared in the brand imagery a year later for the AW10 campaign. As if she didn't have enough on her plate, Emma also embarked on her degree at Brown's University in USA, but shortly after dropped out in order to continue filming Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince which was released that year. 2010 . In the penultimate Potter flick, Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1, we see the trio step away from Hogwarts for the first time. The film was split into two parts for financial reasons. Emma became a regular at fashion week taking to the front row and brushing shoulders with stars. Pictured: Emma at the Burberry SS10 show with Gwyneth Paltrow and Mario Testino . Emma made headlines when she debuted a cropped haircut at the premier of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, a far cry from Hermione's bushy waves . After getting a taste for fashion as a Burberry model, Emma was seen on the catwalks of several Fashion Week shows. She took front row at the Burberry catwalk in London where she was sat with Gwyneth Platrow and Vogue photographer Mario Testino. At the World Premier of Harry Potter, the actress showcased her desire to disassociate herself with Hermione when she debuted her cropped haircut. 2011 . This year saw the end of Hermione Granger for Emma after the release of the final film Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2. Despite her previous gripes with the movies, Emma was moved to tears at the world premiere of the last instalment, which marked the end of 10 years of filming. 2011 saw the final instalment of Harry Potter and Emma was moved to tears at the world premiere . Emma grew as one to watch in the fashion industry when she was awarded Style Icon at the Elle Style Awards . After having waved goodbye to the Potter franchise, Emma picked up a new role as Lucy, a wardrobe assistant in My Week With Marilyn. Emma's style efforts were further acknowledged when the actress took home the Style Icon award at the ELLE Style Awards. Emma also returned to her studies at Oxford University before having to put her studies on hold in order to film. Her first post Potter role came when she acted alongside Eddie Redmayne in My Week With Marilyn . In 2012 Emma abandoned her English Rose status as she adopted an American accent to play Sam, a glamorous high school student in The Perks Of Being AWallflower . 2012 . Emma took a complete turnaround from her famous English schoolgirl role as she adopted an American accent in The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, in which she played Sam in the adaption of Stephen Chbosky's novel. 2013 . Emma took on her most unrecognisable role yet, playing the pot-smoking underage drinking Nikki in The Bling Ring, based on the true events of teenagers in LA who burgled from the homes of Hollywood A-listers. In a bizarre turn of events, Emma appeared in a cameo role as a more exaggerated version of herself along side Seth Rogan and James Franco, in the post apocalyptic film where she famously used a four letter swearword. Emma's role in The Bling Ring saw her go from British school girl to LA socialite in 2013 . 2014 . Emma proved she had brains as well as beauty when she graduated from Brown University with a degree in English Literature, after commencing her degree five years earlier. Additionally, Emma took on the role of Ila in Noah where she played the girlfriend of Noah's son, starring alongside Russell Crowe and Douglas Booth. But by far the most applauded achievement that Emma gained in 2014 was for her role as a UN Goodwill Ambassador for Women. In early 2014 Emma graduated from Brown's University with a degree in English Literature . The speech that she gave in New York made waves around the world and paved the way for her to continue her work as ambassador. The Paris-born actress launched her HeForShe follows feminism's principles of striving for equal rights and opportunities for men and women, including the political, economic and social equality of the sexes. But it aims to repackage the concept without emphasis on oppression by the male sex. In fact Emma formally invited men - who may have previously felt alienated from the movement - to play a greater role in ending gender inequality. Emma was applauded by feminists as she launched the HeForShe campaign as part of her work as the UN Goodwill Ambassador for women . She addressed the United Nations in New York and called for the support of men in women's rights rather than the oppression of the male sex . The campaign attracted a celebrity following with Simon Pegg and Joseph Gordon Levitt and seeing the star recognised for something other than her role as the bushy haired Hermione. 2015 . Emma has a busy year ahead. September will see the release of her latest flick Colonia in which she plays a woman in search of her boyfriend who was abducted in Seventies Chile. She will also begin filming perhaps her most magical role yet as Belle in the live-action remake of Disney's Beauty And The Beast.","Emma Watson celebrated her 25th birthday on 15 April .

"A Massachusetts police department was forced to pay a $500 Bitcoin ransom to hackers who encrypted vital records on their computer network. Tewksbury Police Department came under  attack by criminals who infected their network with a form of Internet malware in December before demanding money to decrypt the files. The program called CryptoLocker infects  through an e-mail and then scrambles the data on the computer. It caused police systems to be down between four and five days, according to Tewksbury Town Crier. Tewksbury Police Department (above) came under attack by hackers which encrypted their computers' files using a malware program called CryptoLocker. They were forced to pay a $500 in Bitcoinransom . The only files that were not corrupted were 18 months old, so cops were left paying the ransom in the untraceable digital currency or they risked losing the data forever, according to the Boston Globe. 'Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan told the Town Crier. 'We did everything we possibly could. 'It was an eye opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort.' Police Chief Timothy Sheehan said: 'It made you feel that you lost control of everything. Paying the Bitcoin ransom was the last resort' The department was hit with the ransomware on December 7 when access to the infected computers became restricted and a payment was required to recover the files. Police became aware of the malware infection the following day. Computers were hit with a more recent form of CryptoLocker that authorities did not have the key to, said Sheehan. It is believed that the Officer In Charge's computer  became infected and the virus traveled to the largest store of data on the network which held files including arrest logs, motor vehicle records, calls for service and records management, according to the Town Crier. CryptoLocker is malware that is often installed on computers at the same time. CryptoLocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked. Computers can become corrupted through phishing emails that include malicious attachments and pop-up ads. According to reports from last year, the U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay a $750 ransom to release sensitive files. When a Tewksbury officer tried to access the data, a demand for $500 was sent from a web address and account that is untraceable by authorities including the FBI and National Security Agency. After this sort of infection occurs there are only two options which include accessing the most recent back-up or paying the ransom. As Tewksbury's back-up was corrupted they were forced to pay the ransom, but Sheehan also noted that the malware infection was not a data breach. 'This isn't a breach. [The data] stays interior, but this virus encrypts it and prevents it from being readable,' Sheehan told the Town Crier. Tewksbury is not the first police department to be a victim of ransomware in the U.S. Similar incidents have occurred involving Swansea Police Department which paid a $750 ransom in November 2013, according to Town Crier. Police in Midlothian, Illinois most recently paid a $500 ransom in January.","Tewksbury Police Department was attacked by criminals who infected their network with  malware program called CryptoLocker .

"You would think it would be a little intimidating. But for this tiny chihuahua, having a best friend 120 times his size is proving a great source of comfort. The diminutive Digby was abandoned on the street next to a set of bins. At just over a month old and weighing less than 1lb, he was freezing cold and perilously close to death. Fortunately, he was rescued by the RSPCA and taken to their Southridge centre in Hertfordshire - where he quickly became inseparable from 9st mastiff Nero. Scroll down for video . New pals: Tiny chihuahua Digby with best friend Nero, a 9st mastiff who is 120 times the size. Digby was rescued by the RSPCA and taken to a centre in Hertfordshire where the two have quickly become inseparable . 'It was as if the little fellow took on Nero as his personal minder,' said centre manager Anna White. 'Poor Digby had to be rescued once by the RSPCA and it seems like he is taking precautions to make sure nothing can happen to him again.' Digby was found severely dehydrated and cowering between two bins at a block of flats in North London last week. But he was revived by the reassuring presence of the mastiff, who eats more than Digby's weight in pet food each day. Natalie Ditchfield, RSPCA animal collection officer, said: 'It is so lovely to see he is safe and happy. 'Love story': Digby was found severely dehydrated and cowering between two bins at a block of flats in North London. But staff at the RSPCA say he has been revived and come out of his shell after finding Nero . 'When I first came across Digby he was frozen and shaking and had just been left to die. He's really tiny - small enough to fit in the palm of my hand. 'He seemed to come out of his shell as soon as we arrived at Southridge and spotted Nero. It really is a love story.' The RSPCA is appealing for information in a bid to trace Digby's owner. Unless one comes forward, he will be available for rehoming in the coming days.","Tiny chihuahua Digby was abandoned on the street next to a set of bins .

"A woman's noisy neighbour has issued a withering reply to her hand-written letter complaining about his hard-partying ways, claiming only the deaf and 'those buried in the cemetery' would have any concerns with the noise coming for his home. The man's sarcastic response comes after Melbourne-based actor, Lucy Gransbury, wrote a two-page rant claiming her neighbours were keeping her awake at night. Gransbury thought the good-humoured note worked wonders after an entire week of uninterrupted sleep until she was woken again just before dawn the following Sunday. So she followed up by dropping a thank-you card and some gifts over the fence to the seven or eight men who lived there because she was 'too scared' to knock on their door. But after a month of not hearing back from any of her boisterous neighbours, Jershon Witehira posted an equally cheeky reply on his Facebook page opening with ' My dearest Lucy'. Scroll down for video . After weeks of not hearing back from any of the boisterous lads, Jershon Witehira posted an equally cheeky reply on his Facebook page opening with this photo holding her two handwritten notes . Witehira said although others may find her crazy he thinks Gransbury is brave and creative . 'I'm impressed by the lengths you went to creatively to get your point across and even more by the audience it reached,' he said. He went onto apologise for the the' music festivals and comedy galas' and added that the deaf man and those buried in the cemetery 4kms away, that Gransbury had referred to, awake occasionally. 'There's probably people out there that think your crazy for what you done but not me I thought you were brave and I respect you for it,' he went on to say. He then took up Gransbury's offer of getting to know each other over a few drinks. 'We look forward to getting to know you also and about that G&T you mentioned let's do it.' But he saved the most hilarious comment for the end. ‪'P.S We have a room for rent if you know anyone interested. P.P.S I'm deadly serious.' Lucy Gransbury dropped a thank you letter and gifts over the fence to her neighbours because she was too scared to knock on their door after they had been quiet for an entire week . The good-humoured letter asks the seven or eight burly blokes not to throw a hand grenade over her fence . Although a week after her first letter the neighbours woke her at 4.30am when they arrived home, and again at 6.45am when their mates left, Gransbury decided after writing a list of pros and cons that the mostly-reformed dudes, who she fears could crush her 'between their shoulder blades' as 'they seem to be a gang', deserved to be rewarded. The note, which was posted on her blog and on the Mamamia site, began with thanking the less-noisy neighbours for a quieter week and although their voices woke her on Sunday she was grateful there wasn't the 'bass guitar song' interrupting her dreams about Prince Harry. 'You probably think I'm a bit weird and have too much spare time, and you are entirely correct.' The gifts included: . A burnt DVD of the pilot episode of Neighbours where Max Ramsay breaks up a party on his namesake street by 'yelling at the flamin' lot of them'. She then later reveals that the DVD is in fact blank and suggests they watch the scene on YouTube. Two chickpea cans with a piece of string so she can create her 'own old-school walkie-talkie' with them while adding that they must detach the string if they are having a party - not to mention remove the chickpeas for a more effective communciation device. And in good neighbourly fashion - specifically chose chickpeas in case the burly blokes wanted to whip up some hummus for their next party. Last but certainly not least - Gransbury threw in some salt and vinegar chips because she wanted to share her favourite things with her dear neighbours. She signed off by saying she hoped they got a giggle out of her note instead of being insulted and throwing a hand grenade over her fence. One of the gifts was two cans and string so they could she can create her 'own old-school walkie-talkie' with her neighbours - and she chose chickpeas so they could also whip up some hummus for their next party . After she was woken by their voices on Sunday morning, she wrote pros and cons about the incident - Derpa is in reference to the man she used to regularly hear who sounded like he was constantly yelling 'derpa"" Gransbury took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the first lengthy and hilarious handwritten letter over their adjoining back fence before running off in hysterics. She posted the letter on her blog with the precursor: 'So if you never hear from me again, I've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours' sound system.' Gransbury chose to replace the expletives she had the strong urge to use with the more polite neighbourly word of 'funk' in her letter that was also published on Mamamia website. 'Dear Noisy Neighbours, . 'There are some choice swear words I would like to throw at you, but in the interest of being neighbourly, I'm going to replace them all with the word 'funk'. 'Please turn your funking music down so I can get some funking sleep,' the letter opened with. Lucy Gransbury wrote a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways . The actor/comedian used her humour in the two-page rant to get her rage across to the party-hard residents who live next door and cause her never-ending grief . Gransbury even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics . She then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them 'all the funking time'. Adding that the night before she wrote the letter when was woken at 4.30am was an uncivilised time that should only be reserved for 'breakfast radio hosts, international flight passengers, and parents of infants.' Gransbury said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but wouldn't have been heard over the revving of their friend's engine of their 'sh*thouse fancy ute.' 'They were then reversing down your driveway for so long and with such difficulty, that I am worried that the man behind the wheel was: A) drink driving B) not sure how to drive C) brain damaged D) actually a potato.' She signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left' Her hopes of the music stopping were quickly dashed as she continued to hear one note on the bass guitar 'over and funking over.' 'I'm not sure if it's you, or perhaps a friend, but one man seemed to contribute to the party by yelling 'derpa, derpa, derpa, derpa' at the top of his lungs. Is he okay?' she asked sarcastically. She expressed concern that this man is either not sure how to be human, brain damaged or simply a moron. The music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before Gransbury had to go out and begin her day. 'Everyone in my street probably feels the same. And the street behind us. And the deaf man in the next suburb. And anyone buried in the cemetery four kilometres away.' She also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs . Gransbury said she bought this card because 'Shut The F**k Up' was not available in a large size . As the considerate neighbour, Gransbury gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with the apt songs: Respect by Aretha Franklin, 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii, 'All About The Bass' by Meghan Trainor, 'Stop Right Now' by The Spice Girls and Uptown Funk' by Bruno Mars 'because it's just a funkin' good song, really'. But she later revealed in the note that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs. After suggesting to catch up over a G&T sometime, she asked them to 'Grow up. Get some funking manners. And Go. The Funk. To Sleep.' Gransbury also warned them that she would call the police if there was a next time. The exhausted performer signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left'.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has been convicted of leaving a property to rot after he was fined for the condition of a house he rented out which was left in a state of disrepair for  three years. The Anfield boss was ordered to pay £400 and £375 costs, with a £40 surcharge at Blackburn magistrates' court for leaving a £69,950 terrace house in Accrington with broken windows and doors and rubbish strewn across the garden. Rodgers - whose Liverpool side crashed out of the FA Cup on Sunday in a 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa - and his business partner Judith O'Hagan were found guilty of ignoring an improvement notice issued by Hyndburn Council. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has been convicted of leaving a property in Accrington to rot . Rodgers had been told to fix the windows, doors and roof, and to remove the rubbish from the house's garden . The pair had been ordered to fix the windows, doors and roof, and to remove the rubbish, but the house was left to rot. Both Rodgers and O'Hagan, who bought the property in August 2007, were absent when found guilty at Blackburn magistrates' court. Local neighbours and former tenants of the property have criticised the failure to maintain the property. The house is located in an area of Accrington which is undergoing a £13million regeneration project to sort out over 200 derelict empty properties. Former Deputy leader of Hyndburn Council, Clare Pritchard, said at an earlier stage of the project: 'We are working with PlaceFirst on a major regeneration project to bring over 200 derelict empty properties back in to use in Woodnook within the next three years. 'As an authority we take a tough line on people who fail to bring their properties into repair and this strong enforcement policy will play a part of the regeneration of the area.' The house (outlined) is in an area which is undergoing a £13million regeneration project, this image was taken in March 2009, seemingly before the issues which brought on the magistrates court case . The Liverpool boss issues instructions to Emre Can  during Sunday's FA Cup defeat by Aston Villa at Wembley . An improvement notice, as served to Rodgers and O'Hagan, requires a landlord to carry out work to deal with a hazard associated with a property. If the landlord does not do the work, or 'reasonable progress' is not made, the local authority can carry out work itself and claim the costs back from the landlord. They were convicted in December 2013 of failing to comply with an enforcement notice under Section 79 of the Building Act 1984.

"A four-year-old boy got trapped in an arcade game after climbing in to the 'claw' machine when he failed to win a teddy. Henry Howes narrowly failed to pick up a Despicable Me toy as he played the notoriously difficult claw game at his local swimming pool in Tamworth, Staffordshire. Desperate to get to his hands on the teddy, he put his hand inside the machine's hatch - but when he reached too far, he slipped under the trap door and was stuck inside. Scroll down for video . Trapped: Henry Howes got stuck inside an arcade game at the Snowdome in Tamworth, Staffordshire . Grumpy: But the four-year-old was unhurt after spending half an hour trapped in the machine . Luckily, his nine-year-old brother Harvey witnessed the accident, so was able to run and call their mother Emma. She alerted staff at the Snowdome leisure centre, but Henry was trapped for half an hour as workers looked for the key to the machine. Mrs Howes, 33, said: 'He asked if he could have a go on the teddy machine so I gave him £1 and told him to go with his big brother. 'Off they went round the corner and then his brother came back and said, ""Henry is stuck in the machine."" I assumed he meant his hand - I didn't think he'd be inside the machine. He was completely inside it! 'He had picked the teddy up with the claw and it had dropped with the teddy's leg hanging over the edge. Struggle: It took workers half an hour to free Henry as they searched for the keys to the machine . Free at last: Henry eventually made his way out of the machine - and got to keep the cuddly toy . 'He opened up the hatch and reached up to get it and when his bottom got under the hatch door it just flipped down. It came down on him.' She added: 'I don't know how he managed to get in there. He's only four but he's a tall lad. 'I was laughing my head off. I could see that he was fine and he wasn't upset. 'I had to go to the reception and tell them my son was stuck in the machine. They couldn't believe it either. He was in there for a good half an hour.' Henry had previously gone for a swimming lesson with Harvey, and was waiting for his sister Scarlett, seven, to finish her class when he got stuck in the machine. Relief: Henry's mother Emma said she could tell that the young boy was unhurt while in the machine . Venue: Henry had just finished a swimming lesson at the Snowdome in Tamworth, pictured . As staff hunted for the keys, Mrs Howes tried to encourage Henry to open the machine from the inside, but he refused because he didn't want to release the teddy from his grasp. 'They tried to take one side off but they couldn't find the keys,' she said. 'We were asking him to reach up and get at the screws but he wouldn't let go of the teddy. Eventually they managed to get the other side open. 'I said to the lady, ""I hope you'll let him have it,"" and they did. He hasn't let go of it since. He went to bed with it that night.' Mrs Howes, who lives in Tamworth with husband Don, added: 'When I showed his dad he laughed too. He said it was the kind of thing he would have done when he was young. 'Henry is very adventurous. I'm worried he's going to do it again to get another toy because it really didn't bother him.

Great Manchester Police Chadderton division revealed a man lodged a complaint that the weather on his holiday was 'too hot' The incident was shared by the police press office on its Facebook page, along with a warning that members of the public should not waste police time. There was a warning that such an offence can carry a maximum punishment of six months' imprisonment and/or a fine. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police told MailOnline Travel: 'The male was advised that this was not a police problem.' Following the post being shared on Facebook, there were mixed reactions to the man's actions. Janine Gamblen wrote: 'Some people really are just stupid,' while Sarah Edwards added: 'Only in Oldham.'

"Ukip candidate Kim Rose (pictured handing out sausage rolls today) is being investigated by police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls . A Ukip election candidate will be grilled by the police over claims he tried to 'corruptly influence' voters by giving them sausage rolls. Kim Rose, who is running for Nigel Farage's party in Southampton Itchen, is being investigated by officers after laying out the snacks at an event, which also featured snooker star Jimmy White. Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. The Ukip candidate put on a spread of sandwiches, sausage rolls and teas and coffees for the event, which also saw veteran snooker player White play pool with local youngsters. Mr Rose, a jeweller, said he was oblivious until he was contacted by Hampshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit. Laughing off the allegations, he said: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes. 'The sausage rolls were for the kids but now I have been reported to police who I believe have received a complaint from one of the main parties. 'Under parliamentary rules allegations of treating is bribing people with food and drink. I thought it was a joke at first and I said to the police officer it was a bit daft. 'He said, ""it isn't daft it could be a very serious offence"". Fortunately I have eaten all the evidence.' Mr Rose, who will now have to report to a police station on Monday, added: 'It was a fantastic day. We laid on teas, coffees, sandwiches and some sausage rolls. 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind over voting for a sausage roll.' Mr Rose (pictured with Jimmy White, left, and Nigel Farage, right) branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll' Today Mr Rose was seen out in Southampton handing out sausage rolls to members of the public . He said: 'The Ukip support is very strong here and I feel the main political parties will do anything they can to scrutinise everything about us.' Mr Rose added that if other politicians fear voters could be 'bribed with sausage rolls', perhaps it is not surprising they will not trust the country with a referendum on EU membership. Today the parliamentary candidate was out campaigning on the streets of Southampton, handing out sausage rolls to members of the public. Ukip leader Nigel Farage weighed into the dispute, backing Mr Rose. He said: 'I think it’s utter nonsense. There seems all sorts of cases in politics of people behaving badly and doing things wrong, abusing their positions. 'Having a few sausage rolls I don’t really think counts as one of those.' Mr Rose said the event, which was attended by 250 people, took place at a community centre in Southampton on February 21 - more than a month before Parliament was officially dissolved. He invited veteran snooker star Jimmy White, 52, who he described as a long-time friend. The former world number two and six-time World Champion, nicknamed 'The Whirlwind', played pool with residents, who were charged £2 to attend the event. 'I've known Jimmy as a friend for a number of years and so I asked him to come down and play pool with the kids,' Mr Rose said. Mr Rose, 57, branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'. 'I didn't want to make the event very Ukip so we put all the party banners away and everybody had a game of pool with Jimmy.' The Electoral Commission said the pastry provision was a police matter. A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'We have a received an allegation of ""treating"" by a prospective parliamentary candidate, contrary to the Representation of the People Act 1983. We are looking into the complaint. No arrests have been made.' Electoral Commission rules on treating state: 'A person is guilty of treating if either before, during or after an election they directly or indirectly give or provide any food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting. 'Treating requires a corrupt intent - it does not apply to ordinary hospitality.' Anyone found guilty of treating can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. Mr Rose has been a member of Ukip since 1999. He briefly stood as an independent in the key marginal Southampton Itchen seat in 2010 before pulling out. He is campaigning on tackling deprivation in Southampton, as well as wanting to pull the UK out of the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron came under criticism in the constituency earlier this week after sending a letter to residents spelling the constituency's name wrong three times. His letter, which has his letterhead and signature, had 'Itchen' spelled as 'Itchin', prompting the Conservatives to apologise for the embarrassing mistake. The constituency's MP has been Labour's John Denham since 1992. He held the seat in 2010 by just 192 votes and is standing down after May 7.","Ukip's Kim Rose laid out spread of sausage rolls and sandwiches at event .

The implication is that the potential for committing a sex offence may be written in our genes - but while this is an interesting finding, it is unlikely to help prevent sex crimes or catch offenders. This is because the genes that make up the people who we are, and the environments in which we are raised cannot be considered independently of each other. The brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes, a study found. Johnny Savile (left) is accused of abusing seven women, while Jimmy Savile (right) raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse . The research analysed DNA from 21,566 men convicted of sex offences in Sweden between 1973 and 2009. It found that sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders were four to five times more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than men in the general population. In seeking to explain this connection, the researchers found that in only 2 per cent of cases could this familial connection be explained by shared environmental factors. This can include social or environmental aspects of their upbringing that siblings would have experienced together. On the other hand, their shared genetics were a factor in 40 per cent of cases, with the remaining 58 per cent of cases stemming from environmental factors not shared between family members. Genetic factors were also found to be stronger for child molestation (46 per cent) than for adult rape (19 per cent). While the study makes an estimate of the heritability of sexual offending, it cannot of course pinpoint the genes that might be involved. Dr Mairi Levitt says that genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment . Putting a figure on the genetic basis for behaviour seems to suggest that these factors are inherited directly by the children from their parents. Of course genetic material from both parents is passed on, but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment. As can be seen from the percentages above, the largest proportion of cases involved a large, rag bag of environmental factors that are by far the greatest influence on behaviour. You may not have been born a criminal, but a combination of genes and environment could control your fate when it comes to anti-social behaviour. This is according to a recent study which found that experiences, such as divorce and sexual abuse, could affect gene expressions that control a person's predisposition to delinquency. The study used a survey of 1,337 students aged 17 or 18 in Västmanland, Sweden, who anonymously completed questionnaires reporting on their behaviour. As well as their behaviour, they spoke about past family conflict, experiences of sexual abuse, and the quality of their relationship with their parents. They also provided a sample of saliva from which the researchers extracted DNA. One of the genes examined was Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). This gene is a key enzyme which breaks down and releases energy in brain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin. The transmitter be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness . 'About 25 per cent of Caucasian men carry the less active variant of MAOA,' explained Professor Sheilagh Hodgins, a researcher at the University of Montreal. 'Among them, those who experience physical abuse in childhood are more likely than those who are not abused to display serious anti-social behaviour from childhood through adulthood.' Separating  nature and nurture may be useful as a model but does not really make sense because research has demonstrated that gene development is affected by the environment. Any report of genes influencing behaviour tends to polarise opinion. Some may welcome the science and see this as confirmation that sex offenders are biologically different from other people and could perhaps be prevented from offending. Others will be concerned about the stigmatisation of family members defined as 'at risk', but still unlikely to offend themselves. Only about 2.5 per cent of brothers or sons of convicted sex offenders were also convicted so the preventative programmes aimed at at-risk families would mainly target the innocent. So what then might this mean in practical terms? The discovery could perhaps one day lead to the identification of specific genotypes but could or should this affect the way we deal with sex offenders? A genotype has already been identified that increases the risk of violent behaviour in specific environments. Dubbed the 'criminal' or 'warrior' gene, it has in some cases even been used successfully by defence teams in mitigation pleas to avoid the death penalty in the US, or reduce the length of sentences in the US and Italy. It might be thought odd that a convicted murderer, who is at increased risk of offending and therefore presumably more dangerous to the public in the future, would be treated more leniently. Sex offenders, particularly where children are involved, are probably even more stigmatised than other violent criminals so perhaps a genetic defence would not work in their favour. What is clear is that finding genetic influences on behaviour does not affect legal responsibility. It is recognised that there are many genetic, biological and environmental factors that influence behaviour, and it may be harder for all sorts of reasons for some people to refrain from criminal acts than others. Any research that helps us to understand problem behaviours is to be welcomed, but the headline figure – a genetic link in 40 per cent of cases – does not tell us that sex offenders 'can't help it' or are different from 'normal' people.

This article originally appeared in The Conversation .","Recent study found sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders were four to five times more likely to be convicted of sex crimes .

"Dr Unt Tun Maung, 43, asked the vulnerable teen to remove her bra before cupping and squeezing each of her breasts, Durham Crown Court heard . A married GP who fondled a vulnerable teenager's breasts when she came to him complaining of chest pains has been jailed for 18 months. Dr Unt Tun Maung, 43, was working as a locum GP when he assaulted the patient during a routine examination at a Teesside medical centre in 2012, Durham Crown Court was previously told. The father-of-one, of Chester-le-Street, County Durham, had spent 12 years working in the NHS, but has now lost everything because of a 'moment of madness', his lawyer told the court. The attack took place during a routine appointment in July 2012 when the girl went to Maung complaining of chest pains. Maung then asked the teenager to remove her bra, before cupping and squeezing her breasts before telling her to put her clothes back on. After the incident, the woman texted a friend to say she felt she had been sexually abused. In a statement read to the court, she said had not wanted to believe she had been taken advantage of, but she could not rid it from her mind. Then, when she visited another doctor a few months later with another chest infection, she panicked while being examined, the court heard. A complaint was made to the NHS, although the police were not alerted for 'several months', prosecutor Peter Makepeace said. Dr Maung came from a medical family and had worked in the NHS since moving to the UK in 2000, Mr Hurst said, and was held in high regard both professionally and personally. He had devoted 12 years of his life to working in the NHS and had also helped contribute to his Buddhist community, defence barrister Andrew Hurst said. Mr Hurst asked the judge to suspend the sentence, saying Maung's earning potential had been decimated and he had lost the respect of the community, to the point that his conviction 'effectively amounts to a life sentence'. Maung was jailed for 18 months for the attack, which took place in 2012, is currently suspended from practicing and is facing a General Medical Council investigation . Judge Prince told Maung he had previously been of 'exemplary' character, had made a significant contribution to society, both as a 'diligent and dedicated doctor' and in the wider community. He added that Maung was clearly held in high regard by numerous people of high standing. However, the judge concluded that only an immediate prison sentence would be appropriate for the crime and deter others from behaving in such a way in future. Dr Maung has been suspended from general practice since October 2013 and now faces a General Medical Council investigation. Judge Prince added that his NHS career was 'unquestionably over'. Maung will also be placed on the sex offenders' register for ten years, but was not told to pay the victim any compensation, though she can pursue him through the civil courts.","Dr Unt Tun Maung, 43, working as a locum GP on Teesside at time of attack .

"Spring is the ideal time to fill your home with gorgeous flowers. However, your beautiful bouquet might look stunning to begin with, but it will soon fade in just a few days, a week at the most. But that doesn't have to be the case, as there are simple tricks you can use to prolong the life of your blooms. Scroll down for video . With simple and sensible tricks recommended by a professional florist, you can make your flowers last . While there are plenty of DIY 'solutions' - vodka, aspirin and pennies - to keep a bouquet fresh, most of these things can actually damage the delicate flowers. Using some simple and sensible tricks recommended by a professional florist, you can make your blooms last a lot longer. You don't need to be a professional florist to pull these off, just read our guide and try it out. From spraying them in hairspray to keeping them far away from fruit and electricals, we've gathered a handy list of seven unlikely tips from Serenata Flowers. Tip number 1: Keep your flowers well-groomed. Trim a half-inch of the lower stem so that water can be absorbed freely. Use a sharp, unserrated knife and cut on a slant - exposing more surface area. Trim just half an inch off the stems of your flowers with a sharp knife . Warming then cooling the flowers 'hardens' them for longer-lasting freshness . 2. Harden the flowers, which speeds up the water update through the stems. After cutting the stems, place the flowers in 43.5C water. Leave to sit in a cool location for up to two hours. 3. Preserve your flowers with hairspray. Remove them from the vase and lightly spray the petal undersides while holding the can several inches away. Hang the flowers upside down to dry before returning to the vase. 4. Don't mix fruit and flowers as some fruits - particularly kiwis, apples and bananas - produce ethylene, which rots nearby plants and fruits. Delicate petals can be kept in place with a light spritz of hairspray . 5. Keep your flowers well-fed - and 7Up or Sprite could do the job. Mix together one cup of water, one cup of 7Up and half a teaspoon of household bleach. If more liquid is required, increase the amounts proportionally. 6. Clean your vases. Vases in regular use often contain microorganisms that will kill of your flowers. First, fill the vase with hot water and mix in a tablespoon of baking soda and white vinegar. Scrub the insides with a cloth, empty the mixture and dry before housing new flowers. 7. Keep flowers away from appliances. TV and computers give off heat, which can lead to flowers becoming dehydrated. Place flowers in a cool spot where they'll receive plenty of light. Make sure they have plenty of water and mist the petals daily. If you want to ripen an avocado, put it next to your bananas, they say. Do the opposite for fresh flowers . The most popular spring flowers are daffodils - the messengers of spring - and tulips. Tulips are very affordable but they normally don't last very long if kept in a vase. Other popular spring flowers include sweet peas and peonies. Peonies are very popular wedding flowers as they symbolise good fortune and happy marriage. Anemones are also in season in spring, another popular flower in wedding bouquets. Hyacinths are beautiful flowers that add a hint of colour and wonderful smell to any room. Other flowers perfect for a spring arrangement are narcissus, hyacinths, ranunculus, lilacs, delphiniums and boronia. Daffodils, tulips, sweet peas and peonies are all in season for spring . Feeling ripped off by flower feed? Make your own with 7 Up and bleach . A used vase can contain organisms that will kiss your flowers faster - so give it a good scrub first . Once you've picked your favourite blooms, it's all about composition: . 'First, start with the correct vase for your flowers. 'For stiff-stemmed flowers like roses, cube shaped or round vase will make them look great and enable easy arranging. For soft stemmed flowers like tulips, use a tall vase that will support them properly and their natural arch will help with arranging. If you have mixed flowers, you can use different vases, depending on the size of the flowers, their quantity and style of flower arrangement you want. 'Pay attention to the colour of your flowers. Shades of the same colour (for example shades of pink) or contrasting colours, like red and white, will look great. 'Remove the leaves from the stems and leave only few on the top, especially for roses. This will add additional support, help to fill in the arrangement and adds a bit of colour too. 'Start by arranging the flowers in hand. Place the larger flowers near the base of the arrangement. Start adding your flowers around the base, then tie them together. Place them in a vase and add some small flowers around the edges, to fill the gaps if needed.' Who knew you had to keep flowers away from the TV? The heat is dehydrating! So keep them misted .","Spring is the perfect time to fill your home with seasonal flowers .

"Kim Kardashian continued her tour of the tour of the Holy Land with husband Kanye West and their daughter North, as she visited the site of Jesus Christ's crucifixion. On Monday, she took her family to Jerusalem's Old City - the reputed location of the historical religious event - to visit Armenian church St James Cathedral in order to baptise their little girl. And, clearly overwhelmed and honoured by the pilgrimage, Kim took to Instagram to share a couple of pictures from inside the holy building. Scroll down for video . Humbled: Kim Kardashian seemed amazed to be inside Saint James Cathedral in Jerusalem's Old City on Monday, the location for her daughter North's baptism . Along with her artful first post from inside the St James Cathedral in Jerusalem's Old City, Kim revealed it had been an early start for the family. 'Good morning Jerusalem! We woke up really early to see the site where the crucifixion of Jesus Christ took place,' she wrote. The image showed the ornate interior of the 12th century church, which sits in the Armenian quarter of the city, the capital of Israel. Family time: Another picture posted on Kim's Instagram showed her and husband Kanye West crouching under the statue of Jesus Christ . A second shot posted on the reality TV star's Instagram page showed herself and Kanye crouching under the statue of Jesus Christ on the crucifix, although as it was heavily filtered, the showbiz couple were hard to see. The centuries-old church in the Holy Land was the location of choice for the Kardashian-Wests for the baptism of their nearly two-year-old daughter. And as they approached the iconic building, they fended off swooning fans as they entered it. Archbishop Aris Shirvanian, an Armenian church official, revealed the family had arrived for a baptism ceremony. Surprise stop: Kim, Kanye and North arrived early on Monday in Jerusalem for North's baptism . Special visit: Kanye and North at the Armenian St. James Cathedral in Jerusalem's Old City . Sacrament: Archbishop Aris Shirvanian, an Armenian church official, confirmed North's baptism . 'Kim Kardashian's daughter will be baptized and become a Christian officially and a member of the Armenian church,' Shirvanian said, slightly perplexed by all the commotion. 'All I know is that she's a famous personality. I don't know her in person. In any case she is welcome with her family.' A source tells E! that Khloe, who attended the ceremony wearing sneakers and ripped jeans, is North's godmother while the priest acted as her godfather (while uncommon, it is an option where there isn't one). VIP treatment: The family were escorted out of the church by a priest . Tight security: The group were surrounded by guards . No heels today: Kim wore sensible flat sandals for the ceremony . The insider described the ceremony as 'so special'. The 22-month-old was dressed in a white gown and her father was wearing the same colour. Kim opted for a striped wrap-around dress and flat sandals. Afterwards, the family dined with Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat at Mona Restaurant. Members of reality TV's first family touched down Monday in the Holy Land for what was described as a private two-day visit. They family had earlier arrived in a private jet at Israel's international airport before being whisked away in a dark black SUV to a hotel in Jerusalem. Protective dad: The rapper left the church after the ceremony with his daughter in tow . Taking in the sights: The group explored the historic church . Holy Land visit: The family are in Jerusalem for what was described as a private two-day visit . Family affair: Khloe Kardashian was also on the trip, and acted as North's godmother . Cuddles with mom: The reality star carried her daughter into the church . All were captured on camera disembarking their plane and the images featured prominently on Israeli websites. The Kardashian entourage arrived from a high-profile visit to Armenia, where the Kardashian family traces its roots. They are expected to shoot some footage for their reality show in Jerusalem before moving on to Jordan. Reality TV royalty: The star gave fans a regal wave . The family's Armenian tour certainly ended in spectacular fashion after Kanye gave a surprise free performance in the capital city, Yerevan, on Sunday night. He had to be rescued by security after being mobbed by fans in Swan Lake. Things got hectic when 'thousands' of fans followed his lead and waded into the water. Before striding into the shallow lake, he told the assembled crowd: 'Over there, can y'all see me over there? We're going to do something different right now, like, like, like we always do it this time!' Not too close! Kanye tried to keep the crowd at bay . As paparazzi scrambled to get a picture, security guards pulled Kanye out from the group of fans and police stopped the gig - which was being live streamed - from continuing. However, despite the abrupt ending to the set, which lasted just six songs, he and Kim appeared to have enjoyed the mayhem. His wife tweeted afterwards: 'Crazy night! Kanye wakes me up & says he's doing a free concert in Yerevan, Armenia! I throw on sweats & we go! Thousands of people were there! Kanye jumped in swan lake to be closer to the crowd on the other side & so many people jumped in too! Such an exciting crazy night! So happy I got to rock out with everyone in Armenia on our last night here!!!! #EpicNight #ArmenianPride (sic)' Baby and Yeezus: Kanye doted over his only child . Back on daddy duty: The rapper performed a surprise concert in Armenia on Sunday to mark the end of their trip . Quick visit: The family are expected to leave Israel on Tuesday . The 34-year-old - whose late father Robert Kardashian was of Armenian-American descent - later took to Twitter again to thank everyone who came out to see her husband perform, and said she was going to miss the country. Kim tweeted: 'I've learned on this trip how many talented Armenian musicians we have! What an incredible night!!!! Going to miss it here!!! Thank you to everyone who came out last night to see Kanye perform!' The reality TV star's Armenia trip had been very well-documented on the social media website, as she posted pictures of her, her sister Khloe, and cousins Kourtni and Kara, meeting the Armenian Prime Minister, as well as the two sisters having an 'emotional day' at the Genocide Museum - which they were visiting for a documentary they're filming about the Armenian Genocide. Kim tweeted: 'It was an honour to meet the Prime Minister of Armenia, Hovik Abrahamyan. He expressed how proud they are that we are proud Armenians and we have not forgotten our roots. #NeverForget'. Power couple: The pair met with Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat and his wife Beverly after the baptism .

"'Cool' credentials: This week Samantha Cameron revealed her love of alternative group Poliça . She rarely misses a chance to demonstrate her ‘cool’ credentials. And this week Samantha Cameron was at it again, revealing her love of alternative group Poliça. But their brand of psychedelic rock conjures up a world a far cry from her life in Downing Street and the Cotswolds. The American band – whose name roughly translates as ‘policy’ in Polish – are inspired by a radical feminist who described pregnancy as ‘barbaric’, and their songs feature violent imagery. The video for the first single on the group’s most recent album depicts androgynous-looking singer Channy Leaneagh subjecting her trussed-up alter ego to a violent assault. Blood spurts in all directions as she smashes her hands with a hammer, punches her in the face and finally waterboards her. Another unsettling song by the four-piece band from Minnesota, entitled Leading To Death, includes the lyric ‘I dream of you, oh my strangler’. Miss Leaneagh, 33, has described her music as ‘rhythm-driven sex noise’ and says the digital effects she uses to modify her broken-hearted vocals are ‘like taking drugs for your voice’. Her marriage broke up several years ago after she had a child, and her lyrics have a tendency towards violent, sexual imagery that bemoans ‘boys’ and ‘all the work they require’. Mrs Cameron, 43, pictured, comes from an aristocratic background and was educated at Marlborough College, whose other alumni include the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Eugenie. But she has a distinctly bohemian streak and was friends with Bristol trip-hop artist Tricky during her time at university. She recently name-checked US indie group The War On Drugs, and claims to be a big fan of Radio 6 Music, the BBC’s ‘cutting edge and ground-breaking’ station. ‘I listen to Radio 4 in the morning and the rest of the day I have 6 Music on,’ she said in a rare interview last weekend. Inspiration: Channy Leaneagh of Polica, a band which specialises in psychedelic rock . Displaying her love of Poliça, Mrs Cameron even joined the crowd at a recent gig in Shoreditch, East London, at which the group played songs from their latest album, Shulamith. The record’s cover is illustrated with a photograph of a naked young woman, her hair and neck caked in blood. The title is a tribute to Canadian-born feminist Shulamith Firestone, whom Miss Leaneagh has described as a ‘mentor and muse from the grave’. Miss Firestone, who died in 2012 aged 67, painted a radical vision of a ‘liberated’ world without families, childbirth or any real distinctions between men and women. She is best known for her 1970 manifesto The Dialectic Of Sex: The Case For Feminist Revolution, which drew inspiration from Karl Marx’s Communist Manifesto. Miss Firestone argued that pregnancy was ‘barbaric’ and childhood was a ‘supervised nightmare’. Poliça's record cover is illustrated with a photograph of a naked young woman, her hair and neck caked in blood. The title is a tribute to Canadian-born feminist Shulamith Firestone (above) She looked forward to a new world in which women were to be liberated from men thanks to the scientific breakthroughs which meant that sexual reproduction could happen outside the womb. The radical feminist was also responsible for stunts including unfurling a ‘Women’s Liberation’ banner at a beauty pageant. Later in life she became a recluse and spent time in a mental health hospital. She was found dead in her studio flat, apparently after starving herself to death.","Samantha Cameron recently spoke of her love of alternative group Poliça .

"A couple who were told their severely disabled baby may die within hours of being born are celebrating her first birthday. When Sonia Morales was pregnant, her daughter Angela was diagnosed with anencephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born without parts of their brain and skull. But Sonia and her husband Rony, who live in Providence, Rhode Island, decided to 'keep her no matter what.' A couple who were told their severely disabled baby may die within hours of being born are celebrating her first birthday. Pictured: Sonia and her husband Rony, with Elizabeth, four, and Angela, now one . Elizabeth with her little sister. Angela has anencephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born without parts of their brain and skull - many newborns with the condition die soon after birth . Angela, who weighs only 16 lbs., celebrated her first birthday on March 23 alongside their four-year-old daughter Elizabeth. They were prepared that they may lose Angela from the moment she was born. 'When we went to the hospital, I thought I was going to be saying hello and goodbye on the same day,' says Sonia to People. 'We sang her a song that we made for her. It was during an ultrasound that Sonia Morales was told her daughter was not developing properly . Sonia says her daughter is aware that her little sister is sick, but just wants to spend as much time with her as she can . Everyday the family sing a birthday song, along with a birthday cake and a prayer as they celebrate Angela's life . After her birth, doctors told the family it was a critical period, but a week later they were thrilled to bring her home. The family have been celebrating every day with Angela since as they know life could be short for their sick daughter - they have a birthday cake and sing every day. 'Every day is truly a gift. She knows how much she is loved,' Sonia says. Anencephaly occurs between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy. During that time, the neural tube is supposed to close and fold over to form the brain and spinal cord of the fetus. This process fails to occur in anencephalic pregnancies, resulting in the absence of a large portion of the brain, skull and scalp. Babies born with anencephaly are usually blind, deaf, unconcious and unable to feel pain. They are usually stillborn but in rare cases they may survive longer. The rate of anencephaly is one or two per 10,000 births. Sonia says her other daughter is aware that her little sister is sick. She wrote on a Facebook post: 'From the beginning we tried to explain that her baby sister would have to go to Heaven with Jesus because her head was not fully formed. She took it in a very natural way. 'Eli was always there close to help me with her sister. Rony and I, did not want her to see Angela's head without the hat that covered the hole in her head. 'But one day I did not locked the door when I was doing Angelas's dressings and I was washing her wound. Elizabeth's first reaction is priceless, ""Mami she has hair, she is beautiful!"" 'Elizabeth didn't see Angela's deformity she saw her sister, she saw her beauty. 'And from that day she was the one who helped me clean the opening. 'Passing me the gloves, tape and bandages. She told me, Angela is different from other children but who cares mommy she is beautiful God made her like this.' Angela has part of her brain missing and one of her eyes is shut, but she has made progress in the past year. Sonia posted a video online which shows her moving her head as she calls her voice and she recognizes those familiar to her. Although her future is still uncertain the family are making the most of their time with her and take her on family outings. The Morales have created a GoFundMe page to help with medical expenses. They have also made a Facebook page which offers updates on Angela's health as well as offering support to other families whose children have anencephaly. Sonia wrote on the Facebook page: 'I am a happy mom. She gives us so much joy to our family.' Although her future is still uncertain the family are making the most of their time with her and take her on family outings .","When Sonia Morales was pregnant, her daughter Angela was diagnosed with anencephaly .

"German police are investigating whether a woman sickeningly claimed to be related to a victim of last month's Germanwings air disaster - so she could get free flights to southern France. The airline's parent company Lufthansa organised special flights for victims' families after the March 24 crash in the French Alps which killed all 150 people on board. The Halterner Zeitung newspaper - based in the town that lost 16 students and two teachers - said she flew to the region twice after falsely claiming to be one of the deceased teacher's cousins. Police are investigating the possible fraud and the alleged culprit will be questioned, a police spokesman in Hoexter has said. Scroll down for video . Fraud: Police in Germany are investigating whether a woman lied about being related to a victim of the doomed Germanwings flight (pictured) to get free flights to southern France . Cruel: As Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr (left) and Germanwings Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann (right) mourn, a German woman has been accused of using the disaster for her own gain . Liar: The woman allegedly tried to pass herself of as a deceased teacher on the flight, meanwhile passengers have laid flowers for the victims of the plane crash at the airport in Dusseldorf (pictured) Killer? Andreas Lubitz may have spiked his Captain's coffee so he would be left alone on the aircraft's flight deck, investigators have now said . Memorial: The first picture of the doomed crew of the Germanwings plane at Germanwings HQ in Cologne has been revealed . And Lufthansa says it is looking into what appears to be a 'regrettable isolated case' but did not give further details. The Airbus A320 went down in a remote region of the French Alps en route to Dusseldorf from Barcelona. Recordings from the flight data recorder suggest co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit before 'deliberately' crashing the jet. Crash investigators are now examining a computer belonging to Lubitz to determine whether he 'spiked' his captain's drink to force him into the toilet. The 27-year-old changed the aircraft's altitude to just 100 feet using the autopilot - sending it on collision course with the Alps. German prosecutors believe that Lubitz may have added a chemical to Captain Patrick Sodenheimer's coffee to remove him from the flight deck. Once Captain Sodenheimer closed the cockpit door, Lubitz enabled special security features preventing the reinforced door from reopening. The safety systems were introduced following the 9/11 attacks although the designers did not consider a rogue pilot seeking to kill himself while taking his passengers and fellow crew with him. Destruction: Lubitz remained silent during the final eight minutes of the flight as it crashed into the Alps . Probe: Investigators have been scouring Lubitz's computers to determine his state of mind before the tragedy . Already it has emerged that Lubitz used his computer to research methods of killing himself as well as information concerning the cockpit door locking mechanism. It is understood that European safety chiefs had concerns about Germanwings' safety procedures in the weeks before the crash. In November 2014, the European Commission contacted several airlines and 'had asked for clarification to make sure all airlines actively observe rules'. Following the crash, it emerged that Lubtiz suffered from crippling depression although Lufthansa, who own Germanwings, did not pass on this information to aviation regulators. Doomed: The Germanwings Airbus A320 crashed into a remote region of the French Alps en route to Dusseldorf from Barcelona . Investigators believe that Lubitz, 27, informed its flight school when he returned from a several-month break in pilot training in 2009 that he had experienced an episode of 'severe depression'. Lufthansa has said he subsequently passed all medical tests. The EU has detailed air safety regulations, which included rules on a pilot's mental health, that member states need to take into account. EASA regularly tests whether the 28 EU nations adhere to those standards. 'This is a normal and regular occurrence,' said the official.","The woman allegedly boarded special flights organised for victims' families .

"The Tories could cut child benefit or stop millions of families receiving it, Government chief whip Michael Gove admitted last night. Mr Gove, the former education secretary, said he could not rule out further cuts to child benefit to reduce the deficit. Asked on the BBC's Newsnight if he could confirm that there would be 'no more changes to child benefit', Mr Gove said: 'No I can't say that.' Conservative chief whip Michael Gove admitted the Tories could cut child benefit or stop millions of families receiving it . Mr Gove said the Tories would not cut benefits for the disabled or pensioners – but refused to rule out cuts to child benefit. He said: 'There is a huge amount of welfare spending that can be reduced without having any impact on people who have disabilities. 'We're not going to hit, or take money away from, the disabled. We're going to protect people who are pensioners. What we are going to do.' Mr Gove was asked specifically: 'There will be no more changes to child benefit. Can you say that to us?' He said: 'It's not our policy at the moment. But the thing I would say is that we've succeeded over the course of the last five years, not just in making departmental cuts which I've alluded to, but in making £21billion worth of welfare cuts. All we're asking to do is to do half of that again.' Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'Michael Gove's repeated refusal to rule out child benefit cuts will only add to fears that the Tories have a secret plan to cut support to children. 'The Tories have a £12 billion black hole in their welfare plans it's clear they can't fill without hitting families with children. It's time for the Tories to come clean with the public about their plans to cut child benefit.' The revelation comes after George Osborne last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term. Asked on the BBC's Newsnight if he could confirm there will be 'no more changes to child benefit', Mr Gove said: 'No I can't say that' Mr Gove's remarks came after  George Osborne last month refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term . More than a million households lost out when the Coalition announced that families with one parent earning £50,000 would pay tax on child benefit. Earners over £60,000 lost out altogether. The controversial measure, brought in two and a half years ago as part of the Government's austerity programme, was criticised for penalising single-earner families and stay-at-home mothers. It meant anyone earning less than £50,000 – even a couple on £49,000 each - still received the full entitlement of £20.70 a week for the first child, and £13.70 for every subsequent child. Mr Osborne was asked at a briefing in central London on the economy this morning whether he could 'rule out depriving more people of child benefit, like you've already done in this Parliament?' But the Chancellor appeared to leave the door open to further cuts when asked if he would be 'depriving more families' of the payments which are worth more than £1,000 per year. Mr Osborne did not directly answer about reducing the threshold, only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system Universal Credit, which is being rolled out nationally. The respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies have suggested that increasing Universal Credit for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save £4.8billion a year. The Chancellor said: 'You can judge us on our record in this Parliament. If we wanted to put child benefit into Universal Credit we would have done it when we set up Universal Credit. 'We've got a track record, we've got a plan based on clear principles of making work pay, sharpening work incentives.' Asked again why he did not rule out any type of child benefit cuts, he said: 'I've given you a very clear answer. We've created a welfare system where child poverty is down, inequality is down, we have a record low number of workless households and what we are doing is creating welfare system where it pays to work and we protect the most vulnerable. 'We are going to carry on doing that in the next Parliament. But we can't do any of these things without economic security and a growing economy.' The Conservatives say they would cut £30billion of spending if they win a second term. Of this £12billion would be slashed from the welfare bill, with the rest from government departments and further cracking down on tax avoidance. While the Prime Minister has given a commitment to protect the state pension, few other savings have been set out apart from reducing the cap on a family's annual benefits from £26,000 to £23,000. It is widely speculated that the Conservatives could restrict child benefit to just two children, to save around £2billion a year.","Asked if he could rule out child benefit cuts Mr Gove said: 'I can't say that'

"An athletic Boston-area high school senior collapsed and died in Greece this week, becoming the third student in his school year to die within six months. Jared Quirk, 18, was in Athens with classmates from Rockland, Massachusetts, to see the ancient world - but fell to the ground while walking through the city with friends, for reasons which are not yet clear. Quirk, who played basketball, baseball, and football at Rockland High School, died a hospital in the Greek capital after being taken there by ambulance, the Boston Globe reported. Sudden death: Jared Quirk, right with his mother and brother, died on Friday in Athens, Greece, while walking with friends. Two others boys who attended Rockland High School with him in Rockland, Massachusetts, also died in the past six months . It was the third day of the trip. Authorities have yet to announce a cause of death for Quirk, whose unexpected passing has plunged Rockland High into mourning for a third time since October. Quirk's death follows that of Joshua Rose, a 17-year-old student at the school, who died suddenly on October 1 for reasons which were not explained in depth. A third contemporary, Patrick Sullivan, 17, was killed in a three-car pileup on New Year's Eve. Other students on the European trip, which was also supposed to take in Italy and last until April 24th, will come home early to grieve. Others: Joshua Rose, left, died on October 1 from an unknown cause, while Patrick Sullivan, right, was killed in a New Year's Eve car crash. Both were 17 and attended Rockland with Quirk . School: Pictured is Rockland High School in Rockland, Massachusetts, where all three were students . According to the Enterprise local newspaper, funeral workers and the State Department are working with Greek counterparts to transport Quirk's body back from Athens. An uncle, who asked not to be named, described Quirk as a 'good, sweet kid' to the Globe. According to a neighbor who spoke to the paper, Quirk was considering going to Boston College, where one of his brothers now studies. Marina McCauley, seemingly a classmate, posted a tribute via Twitter. She said: 'Jared Quirk was probably one of the funniest people in our school. I can't believe this.' An online tribute page dedicated to Quirk had amassed 20 entries by Sunday night, mainly from family friends. One, signed Linda Ricciarelli, read: 'My heart is broken for you. My son Ronnie adored Jared. In time I hope your memories will make your heart smile for this wonderful young man that was taken too soon! Thoughts and prayers are with you.'","Jared Quirk, 18, collapsed while walking through Athens with classmates .

"An estimated 957,000 shoppers in the US alone ordered Apple Watches on Friday and this popularity surpassed expectations - even Apple's. In a leaked memo from the firm's Angela Ahrendts, the retail chief said that customers won't be able to buy an Apple Watch in store 'through the month of May' due to 'high global interest combined with our initial supply.' It was expected to launch on 24 April. Ms Ahrendts added it had not been an easy decision and would provide more updates as the firm gets 'closer to in-store availability.' Scroll down for video . In a leaked memo from Apple's Angela Ahrendts the retail chief wrote: 'Due to high global interest combined with our initial supply, we are only taking orders online right now [and] we expect this to continue through the month of May.' It was expected to launch on 24 April . The memo was seen by Rhiannon Williams at The Telegraph. Pre-orders of the watch began on Friday at 12.01am PDT (8.01am BST) and within an hour many models in various regions had sold out including the most expensive 38mm gold Edition version in the US and Canada. Models were showing a shipping time of four to six weeks or, in some cases, June despite the watch going on general sale on 24 April. An estimated 957,000 American shoppers ordered Apple Watches on Friday. That estimate comes from Slice Intelligence, which measures digital commerce by tracking consumer e-receipts. Its data from online shoppers showed an average of 1.3 watches bought per customer, with $503.83 (£337) spent per item - although Apple has not officially confirmed any sales figures. In a recent Goldman Sachs survey, more than 10 per cent of iPhone owners say they will buy an Apple Watch, a new survey has found. Goldmach Sachs surveyed 1,000 people, and found 11% of people who own an iPhone are 'very likely' to buy the $349 smart timepiece this year. It said the demand for the Watch was 'encouraging', and says sales are likely to hit hit traditional watch firms. It was initially believed that those who were willing to queue on 24 April would be able to buy the Watch before people who had pre-ordered. But Ms Ahrendts memo has confirmed otherwise. 'It's important to remember that Apple Watch is not just a new product but an entirely new category for us,' the memo continued. 'There's never been anything quite like it.  That's why, for the first time, we are previewing a new product in our stores before it has started shipping. 'Given the high interest and initial supply at launch, we will be able to get customers the model they want earlier and faster by taking orders online.' She added that this isn't the way Apple intends to launch all new products form now on and it loves 'those blockbuster Apple product launch days', but told store employees to be prepared for the changes. On Friday many buyers reported Apple's site was still down after the launch time, forcing them to order the device through the Apple App Store on their phones or tablets. As part of the first wave of pre-orders, the Watch can be bought online by people in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Australia, Hong Kong, China and Japan. The Watch also went on display in Apple stores across these regions, as well as in Galeries Lafayette in Paris, Isetan in Tokyo, Selfridges in London, and select Apple resellers in Japan and China. Online pre-orders began on Friday at 12.01am PDT (8am BST) and although Apple said the devices will ship on 24 April within just an hour this had been pushed back to June. Buyers also reported the site was still down after the launch time, forcing them to order the device through the Apple App Store app . Ms Ahrendts added it had not been an easy decision and would provide more updates as the firm gets 'closer to in-store availability.' It was initially thought those who were willing to queue on 24 April would get the Watch in stores before people who had pre-ordered. But Ms Ahrendts' memo has confirmed otherwise . 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone. 'While Apple may be the firm that really creates phone addiction, meaning we are constantly checking our handsets, with the Apple Watch it may have cured it. 'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can't even imagine now. 'Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.' Mark Prigg in New York . As with all Apple launches, the Californian tech giant took its store offline hours before the pre-order time to update its product pages. However, shortly after the pre-orders opened customers took to Twitter to complain the site was still down and they couldn't access the checkout. One said: 'Irritated that I stayed up until 3AM to pre-order an #AppleWatch and the site was down until after the May inventory already sold out.' And even after orders had been placed, some customers had trouble receiving confirmation details and delivery dates. One Twitter user wrote: '#AppleWatch ordered but no email confirmation and the 'orders' section on their site and app is down so I can't confirm it went through.' Another wrote: 'No way in hell am I preordering an #AppleWatch today when it won't ship until June.' and another added: 'There's an #AppleWatch for everyone.' Unless you want it before June.' But for people who want to try on the Watch they can book an appointment online. A MailOnline investigation earlier this week revealed that the UK is the most expensive place in the world to buy the majority of Apple Watch models. Apple's site and app still say the Watch is available from 24 April, but when a model is selected and added to the customer's online basket (pictured), this changes. A Sport model currently has a dispatch time of four to six weeks, while the Edition model has a June delivery date . And for people who want to try on the Watch  they can book an appointment online (pictured). The memo added this isn't the way Apple intends to launch all new products form now on and it loves 'those blockbuster Apple product launch days' but told store employees to prepare for the change . The most expensive Edition model costs up to £2,500 more in the UK compared to elsewhere in the world, while at the lower end of the scale British buyers pay up to £63 more for the Sport model. The cheapest model is the 38mm Sport version and costs £299 in the UK. In the US, the same model costs $349, but this doesn't include sales tax. Sales tax in the US depends on the region where the product is sold, but as an example California has one of the highest rates - at 9% - while Montana has zero. All prices shown in the table above are for the most expensive option in each model and region. Prices also include all relevant sales taxes. Beneath each foreign price is the conversion rate in GBP. In the US, California was chosen because it has one of the highest sales taxes at 9%, while Montana was chosen for the opposite end of the scale because it doesn't have a sales tax. Quebec in Canada has one of the highest sales taxes at 15%, while Alberta has one of the lowest at 5%. Prices and conversions were correct at the time of writing. With both of these sales taxes added to the price of the Sports model in the US, the total cost works out at $380.41 (£257) and $349 (£236) in the respective states. This is a difference of £42 when bought in California, compared to the UK, and £63 when compared to Montana. The effect is magnified for the top-of-the-range Edition version, which costs from £8,000 for the 38mm model in Britain, compared to a starting price of $10,000 in the US. At the time of writing, $10,000 converts to £6,769 - which equates to a difference of £1,231 before charges are taken into account. The most expensive version of the 38mm edition in the UK is £13,500 in the UK, and $17,000 in the US. When sales taxes are added to the US model, the price rises to $18,530 in California, which converts to £12,543 - a difference of £957.","The leaked memo was written by Apple's retail chief Angela Ahrendts .

"Elephants are often seeing travelling single file, using their trunk to hold onto another mammal’s tail in front of them. But one young elephant decided to go it alone, when it walked alongside its herd and even broke their chain. Captured at Whipsnade Zoo, the video shows keepers assisting six elephants along a path – five of which walk in single file. The baby elephant can be seen walking alongside its herd, which travel in a single file line . As the first three elephants move from the shot, the fourth – a smaller elephant – is flanked by a baby. It stops to dawdle as it reaches the grass and uses its trunk to pick something up off the floor before setting off again. Finding itself in between the last two elephants as it begins walking, the young mammal’s  back gets in the way and causes the link to break. The baby elephant stops to dawdle and picks something up from the floor with its trunk . It then rather cheekily forces its way into the line at the expense of the huge – and rather understanding – elephant behind it. Uploading the video to Newsflare, the filmmaker wrote: ‘We had just come out of the bear’s exhibit at Whipsnade Zoo when we saw elephants being led by zookeepers along the road, it was so amazing and unexpected. ‘I quickly grabbed my camera to take photos and managed to get a video of them holding each other’s tails, I had never seen elephants hold their tails in a line before, it was quite remarkable. The baby elephant goes to start walking once more and manages to break the elephant chain with its back . ‘The little baby elephant was constantly stopping or running off to the frustration of the other elephants, it was hilarious to watch him being put in his place.’ Whipsnade Zoo opened in 1931 and was originally known as Whipsnade Wild Animal Park. Located at Whipsnade, near Dunstable in Bedfordshire, the zoo has a land area of 600 acres and, as of 2012, was home to 2,741.

The video depicts the 918 Spyder clocking 350km/h as it rockets down a dead-straight stretch of road on the on the Stuart Highway, north of Alice Springs, on a stretch of road with  no speed limit. The car was driven by New Zealand professional race car driver Craig Baird, who switches the vehicle into ‘Race Hybrid’ and slams his foot on the throttle when they reach the unrestricted zone. Scroll down for video . The video is part of a promotional tour from Porsche to promote their 918 Spyder, a limited edition $900,000 supercar . The $900,000 vehicle is driven by a petrol-electric hybrid system which can accelerate from 60km/h to its 350km/h top speed in a mere 40 seconds. In ‘Race Hybrid‘ mode the motors work in unison with the 4.6-litre V8 petrol to deliver  a staggering  8,500 rpm of power. Obviously, this stunt is not to be tried by the amateur driver: Porsche used radios and spotters to ensure that the road was completely empty at the time, and Baird is a highly-experienced racer with multiple V8 Supercars and Porsche Carrera Cup race wins to his name.

"A 16-year-old filmed throwing a kitten against a door and flushing it in the toilet has been banned from keeping animals for ten years after it had to be put down because of the abuse it suffered. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had to look away as disturbing footage of Tilly meowing in distress as he threw her against the door was played in Swindon Magistrates Court. He claimed he was 'accidentally' high on 'white rhino' - super-strength cannabis - and was being egged on by friends when the abuse occurred. Scroll down for video . Disturbing scenes: Defendant flushes Tilly's head in the toilet while high on super-strength cannabis . Tilly was held by her tail and dangled in bathwater. She was in such a sorry state when RSPCA inspectors found her that she had to be put to sleep. Inspectors said she suffered a lot in her short life . Owner Sarah Reeves was filmed throwing her cat against the walls, alerting the RSPCA to the abuse . The defendant admitted to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering and was given a nine-month referral order and banned for keeping animals for ten years. At an earlier hearing, Tilly's owner, Sarah Reeves, 19, was also given a ten-year ban from keeping animals. The RSPCA became aware of Tilly's condition when friends filmed Reeves throwing the young cat against the walls of her home, where the male had been living for a month, the court heard. RSPCA Inspector Miranda Albinson said when she arrived, the cat was cowering under a blanket, weighing just a third of what she should weigh, cold to the touch and 'clearly dying'. She said: 'This cat suffered a great deal in its very short life.' Tanya James, prosecuting the 16-year-old, told the court: 'The vet was asked to consider all the evidence in relation to this defendant, and in his opinion, it shows him subjecting the cat concerned to mental and physical suffering when he flushed her in the toilet. 'The cat was further distressed when it was forced to cling on to him (the defendant), and being dropped in the bath was a further traumatic experience. 'The cat would have been suffering considerable stress and anxiety throughout the incident. 'He states the cat was locked in the bathroom 24/7 and rarely got fed. 'He had been living at the address for a month, and said he had kicked the cat in the stomach in a play fight. 'He agreed he had been cruel to Tilly. 'On the day in question he had come back to the house and there was a group of males smoking weed and Sarah asked him to put Tilly in the bathroom.' Mark Glendenning, defending the youth, said: 'The cat suffered at the hands of the co-defendant which is why it had to be euthanised. 'He can give no credible explanation as to why this happened, other than he did not give it any thought, which is worrying in itself. 'There is some talk he will have to rely on food banks, and he was effectively sofa-surfing.' Linda Raine, Chair of the Bench, told the youth: 'This was a horrible incident. I notice you couldn't bring yourself to even look at the video. 'Unfortunately we had to.'","Kitten Tilly had to be put down after inspectors found her 'clearly dying'

"A Bosnian town, home to more than 200 sets of twins in a population of 20,000 has claimed that it is the world's multiple birth capital and wants to use that fact to turn it into a tourist attraction. Officials in Buzim, north west Bosnia said their home should be known as the 'Town of Twins', due to the unusually high number of multiple births. Local journalist Nedzib Vucelj noticed the phenomena when his wife Emira gave birth to twins during the 1992-95 civil war. Edita and Elma Pajalic are among the 200 sets of twins in the Bosnian town of Buzim . Samed and Sara Dizdarevic live in the town which has a far higher than normal rate of multiple births . Local journalist Nedzip Bucelj noticed the number of twins such as Adisa, left  and Adis Muratovic, right . He said he went to his neigbours seeking to borrow a buggy to carry the babies, only to discover they had given it to a third family who also had multiple babies. He said: 'That's when I realised just how many twins were here.' Mr Vucelj found that during the war, there were at least 21 sets of twins born, however he believes the figure is far higher as many residents left to escape the fighting and to escape poverty. Using his Facebook page 'Buzim - The Town of Twins', Mr Vucelj has identified at least 200 sets of twins. Now the town's mayor Agan Bunic has backed the initiative believing it could help drive tourism in the area which relies on harvesting raspberries and chestnuts. He said: '[There could be] annual meetings of twins from Busim and across the country, the first gathering of its kind in Bosnia.' Local politicians want an annual twin festival for people such as Dzenisa, left, and Merisa Kaukovic, right . At least 21 sets of twins were born during the civil war, pictured Almin, left, and Almina Duranovic right . Some experts believe the high number of twins could be genetic, pictured, Admir and Sadmir Bajric . According to doctors at the local hospital, a set of twins can be expected once in every 88 births. However, medical records proving the total number of multiple births is incomplete due to the conflict. However, there are suggestions that inbreeding could increase the number of tiwns. Mayor Bunic added: 'The local people mostly marry among themselves, this is a pretty much traditional and patriarchal community.' Zumreta Hodzic, municipal birth registrar said there is some truth behind Mr Vucej's theory: 'I remember the years when nearly each class in the school had twins; there were also triplets.' Kemal Dizdarevic, an unemployed father of 17-month-old twin boys, said there was a history of twins in his family and his wife's. 'Maybe they will be sportsmen. They can become anything, just not politicians.' Some of Buzim's twins may not have been registered due to the war. Pictured Merjema and Merisa Baltic .

"Surgeons are calling for the rules on laser eye surgery to be strengthened after an apparent rise in patients receiving substandard care. A private hospital in Harley Street says that increasing numbers of people are seeking its help after being given bad advice or poor treatment elsewhere. And it says it is now time for the industry to be ‘taken to task’. A leading private eye hospital is calling for tighter regulations on laser eye surgery after noting a rise in the number of people who have been given inaccurate information or poor care. Up to 120,000 Britons have laser eye surgery each year to correct long and short-sightedness, and almost one in 20 of them suffer some sort of complication.Most operations are done privately, with patients paying up to £5,000 to have both eyes corrected. Last year, the consumer group Which? warned that not all clinics are properly explaining the risks involved. Regret: Law graduate Lois Roberts . Law graduate Lois Roberts said that surgery to correct her short-sightedness left her in agony. She suffered from painfully dry eyes after she had the laser treatment, which was caused by damage to the nerves that stimulate tears. And in the years after the procedure, Miss Roberts said she had to apply eye drops every day to alleviate the pain, which in itself can bring on chronic eye inflammation. Miss Roberts had used contact lenses and glasses since she was at primary school but found they were a nuisance when playing sport. She had the £1,500 treatment as part of her 21st birthday present in 2010. But it wasn’t the pain-free experience she was promised. She said: ‘I’m upset I wasn’t warned enough at my initial consultation that anything like this could happen. I would have thought much harder about it had I known the risks.’ Miss Roberts, from Gwynedd in North Wales, suffered from poor night vision and ‘floaters’ in the years after she had the surgery. ‘The floaters are like clumps of black lines and dots,’ she said. ‘I’ve been reassured they’re harmless, but they are incredibly annoying.’ Floaters can occur as a result of a popular form of laser surgery in which a flap is cut into the surface of the cornea — the clear, domed part of the eyeball. Poor night-time vision can occur if part of the cornea has been lasered incorrectly. Despite the side effects, the procedure did correct Miss Roberts’ vision. Its investigation found that one in three consultations by clinics offering the treatment was of poor quality. Now, surgeons are speaking out. They say that despite the term ‘laser eye surgery’, the procedure doesn’t have to be done by a surgeon or even someone with specialist eye knowledge. Instead, all that is required is that the person doing the operation is qualified as a doctor of some sort. Dr Saj Khan, an eye surgeon at the London Eye Hospital, said the unit is treating more patients who have received unsatisfactory treatment elsewhere than five years ago. And other specialist clinics are seeing a similar rise. Dr Khan added: ‘At the moment, anybody who has a basic doctor’s qualification could in theory go off and spend a few hours or a couple of days learning how to use the kit and set off giving treatment.’ Bobby Qureshi, the hospital’s medical director, called for a compulsory register of practitioners that patients could use to find a suitably qualified surgeon. He said: ‘Laser eye surgeons are, at present, only required to be registered as doctors; no specialist qualifications are legally required to carry out a laser eye procedure. The London Eye Hospital in Harley Street said laser eye surgeons are presently only required to be registered as doctors - and no specialist qualifications are legally required . ‘And with those who trained abroad, it’s even more difficult to establish levels of expertise in specific treatments. This makes a central register all the more important, as it gives patients the tools to check exactly in whose hands they are putting their vision. ‘We have seen a rising number of people arriving at the London Eye Hospital who have previously been given inaccurate information or poor care and we strongly believe that it is time for this industry to be taken to task.’ The Royal College of Ophthalmologists says complications occur in almost one in 20 cases. These include dry eyes and problems with night vision. It says that severe visual problems are ‘very unusual’, but some patients require corneal surgery or hard contact lenses to restore satisfactory vision. It advises patients to quiz clinics about how often they perform the treatment and what their success rates are. A spokesman said that while in theory the operation could be done by someone who is registered as a doctor but does not have further qualifications, the likelihood of this happening is ‘very, very negligible’.

"A restaurant boss is facing a lengthy jail sentence after he became the last of a string of men to be convicted of child sex offences against girls in Peterborough. Mohammed Khubaib, originally from Pakistan, befriended girls  and then ‘hooked’ them with alcohol - normally vodka - in an attempt to make them ‘compliant’ to sexual advances. The 43-year-old married businessman, who lived in the city with his wife and children, would pursue his interest ‘away from his home and family’, using his restaurant as a ‘focal point’. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Married businessman Mohammed Khubaib, originally from Pakistan, had a ‘persistent and almost predatory interest’ in teenage girls . Khubaib - who was convicted of the charges against him by a jury at the Old Bailey in five hours - had a ‘persistent and almost predatory interest’ in teenage girls, the trial heard. The father of five groomed vulnerable under-age girls by giving them money, gifts or cigarettes before plying them with alcohol. Following a trial he was found guilty of forcing a 14-year-old girl to perform a sex act on him and nine counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation involving girls aged from 12 to 15 between November 2010 and January 2013. His South African friend Manase Motaung, 32, was cleared of raping a 16-year-old and seven trafficking charges, involving six girls. Khubaib's conviction brings the total number of people to be convicted under Operation Erle to ten, of which five are of Pakistani origin. Khubaib was remanded in custody and warned he faces a long spell behind bars when he is sentenced on May 15. Eatery: Khubaib, who lived in Peterborough with his wife and children, would pursue his interest 'away from his home and family', using his restaurant (above) as a 'focal point' Judge Peter Rook QC told him he had been convicted 'of a very serious offence of a rape on a young girl... having plied her with vodka'. He added: ‘You have also been convicted of no less than nine trafficking offences in relation to under-age girls who you were deliberately plying with vodka so that you could take advantage of them, knowing they craved vodka so you could exploit them sexually. The Cambridgeshire Police investigation codenamed Operation Erle has led to a string of convictions for sex offences against girls in the Peterborough area. ‘You must know the only sentence is a custodial sentence - and a long sentence.’ The jury was deliberating for less than a day before it reached its verdicts. Four previous cases led to nine male defendants being jailed for 59 offences against 15 girls, from Peterborough, with a couple from Lincolnshire and Rutland. Mark Dennis QC, prosecuting, said the girls were vulnerable because of their age, background, circumstances or unsettled schooling and Khubaib pretended to be their ‘friend and helper’. Khubaib, who also ran a lettings agency, would drive girls to flats in his 4x4 and, once there, they would be groomed for sex by being ‘plied with alcohol and entertained by himself and his friends’. Khubaib raped a 14-year-old girl in August 2007 by forcing her to perform oral sex on him after she was given alcohol and then ‘rewarded’ with £5, the court heard. The jury heard details of the trafficking allegations. Khubaib would buy one girl and her friends McDonald's meals and tobacco, as well as giving her small sums of money and a £40 bunch of flowers for her 15th birthday, the court heard. He told the girl he wanted her to be his wife, saying that he would ‘choose her over everyone else’, while he told another 15-year-old she had beautiful eyes, the jury was told. When she rebuffed him, saying he was too old for her, he was said to have replied: ‘Age doesn't matter.’ Khubaib allegedly offered another girl £60, telling her: ‘You make me happy, I'll give you money.’ Two weeks later he allegedly increased the offer to £90. The girl refused. In January 2013, Khubaib picked up two friends - one aged 12 and the other aged 14 - in his seven-seater car and took them to a McDonald's, Mr Dennis said. The girls became uncomfortable when Khubaib got into a row on his phone and slipped away. Later that month, the defendants were arrested at a terrace house in Peterborough, where police found two girls aged 14. Khubaib said in police interviews that his association with all of the girls was innocent and he had not acted in any improper way, denying any sexual contact with the girl he is said to have raped. Motaung also denied wrongdoing by saying he had consensual sex with the rape complainant. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a ‘victim-led’ inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. Nine Asian men from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, were jailed for a total of 77 years in May 2012 for raping and abusing up to 47 girls - some as young as 13 - after plying them with alcohol and luring them to takeaways. Two years earlier, in November 2010, five men from Rotherham in South Yorkshire were jailed after being found guilty of grooming girls as young as 12. Separately, a serious case review found last month that up to 373 children may have been targeted for sex by gangs of men in Oxfordshire in the last 16 years. Wendi Ogle-Welbourn from the council said: ‘What was different in Peterborough is that having followed other places like Rotherham and Oxford we knew we must have child sexual exploitation in our city.’ The two defendants, both from Peterborough, denied the charges. Following the verdict, Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: ‘I'm pleased with the verdicts today because not only does it acknowledge the seriousness of this behaviour but also the courage of the young people who were able to face their abuser in court.’ He added that the investigation was more than two years old, and ‘I do not underestimate the impact on some of the young people involved’. Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council launched a ‘victim-led’ inquiry after identifying a number of young people who might have been at risk of sexual exploitation towards the end of 2012. The joint investigation was proactively initiated in response to the Rotherham and Rochdale child abuse cases. A police spokesman said: ‘We have made great efforts to safeguard these young people, win their confidence and explore what they told us. 'As a result of the information given to us, we launched a number of investigations. A police investigation formally began in early January 2013.’ A number of the victims were in care at the time and had problems at home and school while the abusers' ethnicity reflected the local demographic - Portuguese and eastern European, as well as Asian/Pakistani men. Khubaib's activities involved girls being befriended and then ‘hooked’ with alcohol in an attempt to make them ‘compliant’ to sexual advances . A mother has spoken of her pride after her teenage daughter ‘kick-started’ the police investigation into Khubaib. The teenager was targeted by him when she was just 14 in Peterborough. She saw him three times, but grew scared when he had an argument over the phone after taking her to McDonald's and decided to tell her parents, who took her to the police. Khubaib, 43, did not touch her - but had a ‘persistent and almost predatory interest’ in teenage girls, the Old Bailey heard. The girl's mother said the youngster found giving evidence at his trial ‘worse than she expected’ after her father broke down in tears when she went into the courtroom. She said: ‘We keep telling her how proud we are. At one point she got very depressed and kept saying ""I'm stupid, I'm silly"". But we told her that, at the end of the day, she has helped so many girls. ‘Luckily, nothing happened to her and she saw sense before it got any further - but she has helped so many girls and she should feel proud of that. ‘There are many girls out there, even though they don't know her, they are going to be thanking her.’ The woman said that the pressure of taking the matter to police had had a ‘big impact’ on her daughter. She explained that before meeting Khubaib, the girl was an outgoing tomboy who enjoyed being out with her friends and going to school. She said: ‘After she told me and her father what had happened and we had gone to the police, she became a hermit.'","Married businessman Mohammed Khubaib convicted of raping girl, 14 .

"Veteran CBS News 'Face the Nation' moderator Bob Schieffer announced Tuesday at the Texas journalism school named for him that he'll be retiring this summer. It's not his first retirement announcement but, at age 78, looks like it has a good chance of sticking. Schieffer was speaking to students at an annual symposium that bears his name at Texas Christian University's Schieffer School of Journalism in Fort Worth, his alma mater. 'It's been a great adventure,' Schieffer said at the college. 'You know, I'm one of the luckiest people in the world because as a little boy, as a young reporter, I always wanted to be a journalist, and I got to do that. 'And not many people get to do that, and I couldn't have asked for a better life or something that was more fun and more fulfilling.' Bob Schieffer opens the Schieffer Symposium on the News at TCU on Wednesday, April 8, 2015, in Fort Worth, Texas. CBS says veteran newsman Schieffer is retiring this year . Career: Schieffer began at the political affairs show 'Face the Nation' in 1991, asking direct questions to politicians in a Texas twang . Announcement: Schieffer also posted the news of his retirement to his Twitter account Wednesday night . New career option: Country singer Brad Paisley joked about what Schieffer might do after stepping down from his job with CBS News . On Wednesday night, Schieffer tweeted 'Great talking journalism at @TCU tonight. Also really happy to be in my hometown, where it all started, to announce my retirement.' Journalists and media personalities have been discussing Stelter's announcement on social media. CBS This Morning Anchor Gayle King, who was present when the news broke, uploaded a photograph of Schieffer to Instagram, along with the caption 'Oh what a nite ! @bob schieffer announces he is RETIRInG . . A class act and his announcement stunned the audience at the schieffer symposium.' CNN's Brian Stelter wrote Twitter 'Sandy Livingston, who was at Schieffer announcement in TX: ""It was a stunner to the audience. There were some gasps; I heard some 'Oh nos'""' 'Bob Schieffer announces retirement from an amazing career: at CBS since '69, hosting Face the Nation since '91. Trusted by both sides,' Fox News' Howard Kurtz tweeted. CNN's Jake Tapper and The Drudge Report's Matt Drudge were also among those who paid tribute to Schieffer on Twitter. Big reveal: CBS This Morning Anchor Gayle King said Schieffer's announcement 'stunned' Stay tuned: King also uploaded this shot of Schieffer to Instagram after the news broke . Tribute: CNN news anchor Jake Tapper called Schieffer a 'legend' Wednesday night . He will be missed: Matt Drudge also said he was 'sad to see' Schieffer retire . A former newspaper reporter at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Schieffer joined CBS News in 1969 and has been the network's chief Washington correspondent since 1992. He began at the political affairs show 'Face the Nation' in 1991, asking direct questions to politicians in a Texas twang. He had an unexpected career highlight starting in 2005, filling in as anchor of the 'CBS Evening News' following Dan Rather's exit for a year and a half until Katie Couric took over the role. His folksy style got good reviews, boosted ratings and healed morale at the news division following the network's discredited report on President George W. Bush's military service. Schieffer survived bladder cancer about a decade ago, a brush with mortality that was one factor in his 2008 announcement that he would retire with the inauguration of a new president in January 2009. That inauguration came and went and Schieffer stayed. He was enjoying the job too much. The death of NBC's Tim Russert, whose 'Meet the Press' led in the ratings for many years, opened Sunday morning to a tighter competition. 'Face the Nation' often led, and CBS responded by expanding the show to an hour. 'I know what you're thinking,' CBS News President David Rhodes said in a memo to his staff Tuesday. 'Bob's thought about retiring before, is he really retiring now? And of course with his long connection to CBS News we'd be happy to learn that he's not leaving now, or that he can be seen by our viewers in the future.' But Rhodes said Schieffer wanted to announce the end of his career where it all began. Rhodes called him 'an inspiration and a mentor to so many colleagues - and, frankly, to me.' CBS would not talk Tuesday about potential successors at 'Face the Nation.' Schieffer hasn't had a single substitute when he took time off; Charlie Rose, Norah O'Donnell, Major Garrett, John Dickerson and Nancy Cordes have all filled in at different times. His chief competitors are Chuck Todd at 'Meet the Press' and George Stephanopoulos at ABC's 'This Week.' Rhodes told Politico '[Schieffer] felt very strongly about doing this at TCU. He's been really deveoted to us, he's had such a long career here - but he's also made a huge investment in TCU. 'His wife is still on the board, his name is on both the journalism and the communications school. He and I have been talking about this for a long time.' CBS News quoted Schieffer as saying Wednesday 'We like any large organization we have had our ups and downs; we're on a high right now. ""Face the Nation,"" I think, is better than it has ever been.'

"A science lecturer determined to teach people about different brain regions has shaved her head during an educational video. The clip shows Nancy Kanwisher, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, chopping at her shoulder-length bob with scissors just a few seconds into a lecture. A graduate student then uses an electronic razor to shave the rest off, with piles of hair left on a bench in front of a projector. The short video was posted on the scientist's Brain Talks website, which is designed to teach people about the different methods of studying the brain. Ms Kanwisher, 56, said: 'I thought it would be a fun way to draw attention to my site where I have posted lots of short videos talking about the cool things we have learned about the human mind and brain. 'There is a lot of silly stuff about the human mind on the web that misses out on the real science - and that is a shame because the real science is just as exciting. 'In just the last couple of decades we have discovered some truly fundamental and exciting things about the human mind and brain.' During the footage Ms Kanwisher is heard explaining: 'It is hard to tell [what the different regions are] with all this hair in the way so let's take care of that.' After the haircut the student used permanent markers to draw the different brain regions on Ms Kanwisher's bare scalp.

"A chilling new jihadi video has emerged on social media, showing a new militia of female jihadis firing machine guns and practising drills in Syria. All of the women are fully veiled, making it hard to identify individuals but it is possible the group may be linked to Islamic State. Standing on their parade ground, the radical women are shown shouting jihad slogans and attempting to use their AK 47 rifles. Scroll down for video: . The female jihadis are shown practising with their machine guns and learning how to march as a unit. Some of the women appear to struggle with the the cumbersome weapons. The radical group of women boisterously shout religious slogans, praising Islam and re-iterating their devotion to jihad . The women appear to struggle with the weight of their machine guns and make a number of basic rifle mistakes. One of the women is filmed hurriedly running up to a mound of sandbags, her burqa blowing heavily in the strong breeze. With the magazine of the machine gun incorrectly resting unevenly on a pile of old sandbags, the female jihadi fires off five rounds before being ushered away to allow another woman to practice. Many of the women also seem surprised by the powerful recoil of the rifle, taking just a couple of shots before returning to the group. Standing awkwardly in a group, many of the women appear to carelessly place the rifle butt on the ground whilst others appear to be leaning on their weapons. All of the women are fully veiled, making it hard to identify individuals but it is believed several of the women could be British nationals. Many of the women can be seen menacingly waving their machine guns in the air whilst they walk slowly to their parade ground. The  video opens with the band of female jihadi marching along a sloped road in the Syrian countryside. Charlie Winter, a researcher at counter-terrorism think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, identified the location of the video, believed to have been filmed at the St Simeon's Church, around 60 km from the Syrian city of Aleppo. Many of the women can be seen menacingly waving their machine guns in the air whilst a few of the women simply point their fingers towards the sky. A couple of the women can be seen carrying their hand bags on their shoulder as they carefully navigate the uneven road. Most of the women appear to be wearing white sports shoes or unflattering sandals and shoes. Standing to attention, the unit of female jihadis sloppily hold their rifles by their sides, awaiting the commands of their self-appointed officer. Many of the women seem surprised by the powerful recoil of the rifle, taking just a couple of shots before returning to the group. The training group are filmed from different angles, including close up shots of the female fighters. Formed up in an informal parade square, the group stand to attention, lazily holding their guns down by their side. One of the women, who seems to be the enthusiastic leader of the group stands at the front, leading the loud call and response chants in Arabic. They boisterously shot religious slogans, praising the  Islamic State and re-iterating their devotion to jihad. According to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King’s College London,  a group of at least 30 female British female nationals have been identified as being based in northern Syria.

"A sign written in ancient Greek and Latin warning cyclists not to chain their bikes to railings in Cambridge has been branded 'elitist'. The notice has been fixed outside a university building in Portugal Place - but the message contains grammatical errors, according to one expert. It warns that bikes will be 'removed or destroyed' if they are left  behind a building previously used by the Greek Orthodox Church. Warning: A sign written in ancient Greek and Latin telling cyclists not to leave their bikes chained to railings has been erected outside a university building in Cambridge . The sign, put up behind a building previously used by the Greek Orthodox Church, has been branded 'elitist' Selwyn College classics lecturer Dr Rupert Thompson said there were inaccuracies in the Greek warning with one word having the opposite meaning to that intended. He said: 'It's definitely trying to be ancient Greek but it's not quite. The second word, ""ΛΗΦΘΕΝΤΕΣ"", actually means ""taken"" not ""left"".' He added: 'I don't know what to make of it really, but it's very amusing and it's absolutely great to see this in the city.' Classicist Professor Mary Beard, from Newnham College, translated the Latin part of the sign as meaning 'two wheels [cycles] left/abandoned here will be removed'. Classicist Professor Mary Beard (pictured), from Newnham College, translated the Latin part of the sign as meaning 'two wheels [cycles] left/abandoned here will be removed' But both lecturers agreed it was the correct way to describe bicycles as the noun was not invented until the early 19th century. One Twitter user called the sign 'elitist' and another wrote: 'I feel tempted to add some Anglo-Saxon graffiti.' Others suggested the sign had not done much good - because a picture on social media showed a bike chained to the rails in defiance of the notice. According to the Daily Telegraph, nobody from Cambridge University knew when the sign had been erected or who had put it there.","Sign was erected outside university building in Portugal Place, Cambridge .

"Mohammed Emwazi, the British jihadi now known as Jihadi John, planned to join a different terror group in Somalia years before becoming a member of ISIS, it has been reported. Emwazi, who is originally from London, was planning on joining al-Shabaab in Africa but changed his mind after his friends were killed amid accusations they were set up by rival group members. Instead he travelled to Syria where he joined Islamic State and became synonymous with their gruesome beheading videos posted online. Scroll for video . Mohammed Emwazi (left), now known as masked killer Jihadi John (right), planned to join al-Shabaab in Somalia before going to Syria because two of his friends were killed, a source has said . According to a 29-year-old Syrian, named only as Ayman, Emwazi was obsessed with al-Shabaab and constantly spoke about the fighting in Somalia. In an interview with The Independent, Ayman says Emwazi once confided in him that he planned to join al-Shabaab before coming to Syria because Somalia was too dangerous. Ayman, who said he met Emwazi in Syria after ISIS captured his hometown, added: 'Mohammed was obsessed with al-Shabaab, he was angry about what happened in Africa. 'Some of his friends had been killed, some sent to prison and he thought they had been betrayed.' Emwazi became convinced al-Shabaab had been infiltrated by Western spies after friends Bilal al-Berjawi (pictured) and Mohammed Sakr were killed . The friends referred to are likely to be Bilal al-Berjawi and Mohammed Sakr, two members of the 'London Boys' gang of extremists that grew up with Emwazi in Maida Vale, north west London. Al-Berjawi passed through UK Border Control at least five times between 2006 and 2009 as he travelled between London and African terror cells, and helped to radicalise Emwazi while in the UK. Three years ago he was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Somalia, and according to Ayman, Emwazi was convinced that his location had been given to the Americans by fellow members of al-Shabaab during an internal power struggle. Emwazi also believed that another friend, Mohammed Sakr, who at one time had lived next door to al-Berjawi, was also betrayed to his death after he was killed in February 2012, also in Somalia. Emwazi has previously been accused of trying to join al-Shabaab, and was detained in August 2009 after flying to Tanzania in east Africa with a group of friends. They had claimed to be going on a wildlife safari, but were sent back to the Netherlands by security forced, where Emwazi later claimed he was questioned by an MI5 agent who tried to recruit him. Al-Berjawi and Sakr were also detained in Kenya around the same time, but later returned to Africa and were able to make it to Somalia, where they joined the fighting. Ayman claims that Emwazi also intended to return, but after his friends were killed he decided against it, believing al-Shabaab had been infiltrated by Western spies and was too dangerous. He added: 'Perhaps the British should be sorry they did not let him go to Somalia, he would probably be dead now like his friends.' In 2012, Emwazi fled Britain for Syria, despite being on terror watchlists, where he eventually joined the ranks of ISIS. Emwazi was accused of trying to join al-Shabaab in 2009 when he flew to Tanzania before being sent back home by security force. He joined ISIS in Syria in 2012 (pictured, al-Shabaab militants in Somalia) It is thought that during the early stages of the conflict Emwazi was a prison guard, along with three other Britons, leading to them being nicknamed The Beatles. Escaped captives had given him the name John, after Beatles lyricist John Lennon, which eventually became Jihadi John. In previous interviews, French hostages have described how Emwazi talked to them about al-Shabaab and the war in Somalia, making them watch videos of the fighting there. Emwazi first rose to international attention in August 2014 when he appeared in a video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley. Since then he has been seen in videos showing the beheading of Steven Sotloff, another American journalist, Peter Kassig, a former U.S. solider. Also murdered at the hands of Emwazi were David Haines and Alan Henning, two British aid workers, and Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yakuwa.","Mohammed Emwazi wanted to join al-Shabaab in Somalia, source claims .

"Perched on the rooftops of tall buildings in cities across the world, a French photographer has captured the essence of what people do when they're alone, in places where they're surrounded by millions of other people. In her photography project, Inside Views, Floriane de Lassee spots movement in the standstill of the night - she finds lone beating hearts who still have the light on when everyone else is sleeping. 'No matter whether it’s Paris or Istanbul. I do not photograph cities, but an imaginary City that inhabits each megalopolis. It is the product of the Man’s excesses, his genius, his madness. The City exceeds the overflow. She is about to devour us,' de Lassee says about her project. Scroll down for video . From one window into another, French photographer Floriane de Lassee captures a photograph of a man practicing his piano in his London flat . A woman looks on at the vast skyline ahead of her as she stands on a balcony. With a light illuminating her from the front, she appears to radiate in the darkness of the run-down building beside her . In some of her photos, including this one, de Lassee gets close enough to her subjects that she can capture their facial expressions as well as the vast metropolises behind them . In was appears to be an empty building in Tokyo, a person gazes out the window into the night. There isn't a person or car in sight in the illuminated city . In this photo, taken in an unknown city, de Lassee snaps a photo of a person looking to the skyline as she appears to be on the same roof . De Lassee has been photographing the cities of insomnia for at least ten years, and she had a book published filled with pictures of the cities that never sleep in 2008. The French photographer found her inspiration when she studied at the International Center of Photography in New York, according to Les Photographes. Her East Village apartment faced a police station's 'recreation room', where officers, still in uniform, would play table tennis. She found the angle at which she could watch them to be one that should be photographed. 'I'm just trying to move me, to move others, to bring them further in their dreams or in the perception of the world around them. The city that I show is both terrifying and touching. It is this balance that interests me,' she told Les Photographes. A woman in Shanghai stands on her lighted balcony and stares at the massive buildings across the water.

Her images show the moment vast cityscapes collide with sole protagonists, resting on balconies, doing work in offices and gazing out windows into the distance.

She instead tries to find the common traits and emotions that the cities' inhabitants share, according to Vanilla Magazine.

"Beer is booming at discount supermarket chain Aldi which increased its share of the premium ale market by a third stealing customers away from troubled giant Tesco. Tesco does still have the biggest share of the lucrative market, which research by Kantar shows has grown by more than 10 per cent over the last year and is now worth £490million. The leader has improved its market share in the increasingly fashionable premium ale market, but it's believed Aldi is luring customers away from Tesco, offering a smaller range but cheaper prices. Another chapter: Fluctuations in the premium ale market are just a small part of the shopping revolution which has seen shoppers flock away from giants like Tesco and towards the growing discounters . To use an example of the difference in price, Aldi sells bottles of Newcastle brown ale for £1.24. They costs £1.64 at Tesco and Waitrose and £1.65 at Morrisons. The discounter has also increased wine sales by 24 per cent over the last years which shows drinkers with all tastes are now flocking to Aldi to buy their booze. It's another chapter in the rise of discounters who are slowly stealing market share from the big three, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda. Other research, also by Kantar, showed that Aldi overtook Waitrose as Britain's sixth biggest supermarket with its performance in the first three months of 2015, increasing share of the whole supermarket industry from 4.6 top 5.3 per cent in a year. The top four supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have all lost market share in the first three months of 2015. Aldi, Waitrose and Lidl managed to increase thiers, with Aldi showing the biggest rise . Tesco has had a troublesome year, with its year-on-year share price down 18 per cent. Last year, they discovered a £263million gap in their accounts which involved rebates to suppliers and is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. Shortly afterwards they sacked boss Phil Clarke who was replaced by Unilever executive Dave Lewis, who announced a series of money-saving measures to try and turn the tide.. The research into the premium ale market doesn't tell a very consistent story, with all but two of the big supermarkets managing to increase their market share. Sainsbury's currently has the second largest share in the beer market which it has improved by 7 per cent while Asda, third, increased by 1.5 per cent. Upmarket Waitrose, which also saw a double-digit increase in the premium ale market, now has a 5.1 per cent share of the entire supermaket industry. But while Aldi made great gains, Lidl, the other rising discounter to have improved its share in the supermarket industry, saw a 7.9 per cent fall in its proportion of the premium beer market. Morrisons’ share dipped 1.4 per cent . In January Tesco published the location of 43 loss-making stores that will close, and shelved plans to open a further 49 stores. City bosses expect them to announce huge losses in profit next week. It's been a totally different story for Aldi, which offers cheap prices and a smaller range that have helped them compete with the big boys. Aldi – motto Spend a little. Live a lot – stocks virtually all own-branded goods and and they're market share has grown by 0.7 per cent this year. It plans to open 60 new stores in 2015, more than than Sainsbury’s and Tesco put together. Between January and the end of March, Aldi sales grew by 17 per cent from the same time a year earlier. The total market share of the ‘big four’ fell below 73 per cent, the lowest for a decade. Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi had recorded double-digit growth for the past four years. More than half a million new shoppers visited the store in the three months to March 29, compared to a year before. Lidl also saw sales jump by almost 12 per cent over the period to secure a 3.7 per cent market share. This is some way off Tesco’s dominant 28.4 per cent share, followed by Asda at 17.1 per cent.","Fashionable premium ale market grew more than 10 per cent to £490million .

"Stephanie Scott was due to get married to her partner of five years Aaron Leeson-Woolley . Police will begin an autopsy on Stephanie Scott's body to determine how she was killed. Ms Scott's remains have been transported to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, and a NSW Department of Justice spokeswoman confirmed State Coroner Michael Barnes has ordered that an autopsy be carried out this week. This comes after it has emerged detectives who are leading the investigation into the death of Stephanie Scott will reportedly make inquiries with authorities in the Netherlands in an attempt to run a background check on the accused killer. School cleaner Vincent Stanford, who moved to Leeton  from Holland over a year ago with his mother and brother, was charged with Ms Scott's murder on Thursday. The 26-year-old Leeton High School teacher was allegedly murdered and dumped in bushland six days before she was due to walk down the aisle to marry her partner of five years. NSW Police will get in contact with their counterparts in the Netherlands to determine if the accused 24-year-old murderer had any relevant history there, AAP reports. Stanford has reportedly been uncooperative with investigators. Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW police for comment. It has also emerged that one of the last actions of Ms Scott was to send an email to the bus company hired for her wedding, confirming transportation for guests. The revelation follows after police discovered the charred remains of a woman's body around 5pm on Friday after they were directed to Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW by  Stanford's family. It's further alleged a gasoline can had been found nearby. Police were lead to the place where Stephanie Scott's remains were found, by the family of her accused killer . Her body was discovered on Friday evening around 5pm in Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW . Stephanie Scott (right), pictured with her fiancé Aaron Leeson-Woolley, was last seen on Easter Sunday . It is understood Stanford was familiar to the area and went on regular camping trips to the national park  on many occasions with his family. On Saturday - the day which English and drama teacher Ms Scott was set to marry her fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley - a memorial was held to honour the late bride-to-be. In a poignant move, the memorial service took place at the same time as when her wedding ceremony was due to take place. Her father Robert Scott spoke to the gathered mourners on behalf of his family and friends who were united in their grief on Saturday at Mountford Park in Leeton. The 26-year-old was last seen on Easter Sunday, when her disappearance sparked a widespread search for the much-loved teacher.

On Saturday, the day Ms Scott was due to marry fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley, a memorial was held . Aaron Leeson-Woolley was comforted by friends and family at the heartbreaking service at the weekend . 'Stephanie was a bright, intelligent and fun-loving woman who has impacted on many people here today,' Mr Scott said at his daughter's memorial on Saturday. 'Our wishes for the future are that this stays in your minds and you remember her. 'I'm sure she'd wish for that to be the case and you could remember her for the great little girl she was.' Ms Scott's grief-stricken fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley was too upset to take the stage, but was supported by loved ones to release yellow balloons into the air to commemorate her life.

Among them were conductor Inma Shara and doctor Maria Neira, while watching from the audience was communication company Grupo Zeta's president Antonio Mosbah. For all the star power on show though, all eyes were on Letizia who looked relaxed and happy as she chatted to Ms Hayek. The 48-year-old star, who brought her seven-year-old daughter Valentina to the ceremony, was taking a break from her preparations for next month's Cannes Film Festival. Ms Hayek stars in Tale of Tales, a dark Matteo Garrone fantasy based on a collection of 17th century Italian folk stories, which is set to make its début at the event on 14th May.

"Poisoned by Botox? Mike and Susan Fortuna, of Shelburne are accusing Allergan of failing to warn of dangers, negligence and breach of the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act in treating their daughter, Mandy . The parents of a Vermont woman who died last year have sued Botox maker Allergan, saying off-label treatment of her spams caused by cerebral palsy with Botox contributed to her death. Mike and Susan Fortuna, of Shelburne, sued last week, accusing Allergan of failing to warn of dangers, negligence and breach of the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act in treating their 21-year-old daughter, Mandy Fortuna. In November, a Vermont jury awarded a New York family $6.75 million in their lawsuit against Allergan. Their lawyer said 7-year-old Joshua Drake developed epilepsy after getting Botox injections for his leg spasms caused by cerebral palsy. Joshua and Fortuna were treated by the same doctor, Dr. Scott Benjamin of Burlington, Vermont. The last set of injections occurred on September 5, 2014, approximately three weeks prior to her death, according to a press release put out last week by the Fortunas' attorneys. The Fortunas claim their daughter suffered an unexplained deterioration in her health after from Dr. Benjamin. 'She was continually gagging and choking, unable to clear her secretions,' reads the complaint. 'Her breathing was shallow and Mandy had trouble holding her head up. She began to experience seizures or seizure-like spells.' The cause of death was not entirely conclusive and was ruled as atypical pneumonia, a common complication associated with Botox overdoses, according to their suit . The family obtained records from the Burlington physician, which their attorney Ray Chester says they used to determine that Mandy had received an overdose of Botox just like Joshua Drake. 'It came about seven or eight weeks too late,' Mike Fortuna told the Burlington Free Press. 'Nonetheless, we were perplexed by the whole thing. We didn't understand what had happened to her, and now we know.' Off-label: Mandy Fortuna suffered from cerebral palsy and was treated for spasms using Botox off-label . Their suit claims Botox contacted Dr. Benjamin multiple times in the 2000s and urged him to use unsafe doses of Botox for pediatric uses. In 2011, Chester and his team received what was reported to be the largest single plaintiff personal injury verdict ever awarded in the State of Virginia. That verdict was $212 million and included a $200 million punitive damages award. The case later settled for a confidential amount. According to the release, Chester's other clients range from adults who wanted to remove a few wrinkles to young children with cerebral palsy who received high dose, off-label Botox to treat spasticity. The one common thread among almost all cases is that the treatments were off-label, meaning not approved by the FDA. Allergan plead guilty to criminal off-label promotion in 2010 and paid $600 million in fines. Allergan hasn't commented on the lawsuit. Dr. Bejamin has declined to comment on the pending litigation . Allergan hasn't commented on the lawsuit. Dr. Bejamin has declined to comment on the pending litigation, which claims he was often urged in the 2000s to administer what are now known to be unsafe doses of Botox to children .","Susan and Mike Fortuna of Shelburne, Vermont say their daughter Mandy suffered an unexplained health deterioration soon after treatment .

"Protests by Japanese-American groups and Star Trek's George Takei have led an East Coast auction house to cancel a sale of 450 photos and artifacts from World War II internment camps. Thousands of Japanese-Americans, groups and sympathizers posted their opposition to the sale on social media and the auction house's Facebook page, the San Jose Mercury News reported Thursday. The items from the collection of 'dean of American crafts' Allen Eaton were slated for public auction on Friday at the Rago Auction House in Lambertville, New Jersey. Stopped the sale: Star Trek actor George Takei helped halt the action of 450 photos and artifacts from World War II Japanese-American internment camps . The collection includes 63 photos of people of Japanese descent who were imprisoned over fears they were spies and dozens of arts and crafts they made. The auction was halted thanks, in part, to the efforts of Takei, who lived in an internment camps in Arkansas as a child. 'Greetings from Australia,' Takei wrote to followers on the Japanese American History NOT for Sale Facebook. 'Thank you all for mobilizing on this important issue. It took a few calls today here in the wee hours, and I'll be issuing a formal statement later, but we can all celebrate a bit today at this news.' Also leading the charge against the auction was the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation (HMWF), which threatened to sue the Rago Arts and Auction Center over the sale. Outcry: Takei and a group called the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation helped stop the sale of items like these panels carved in the internment camps . Not just art for sale: Families forced into the internment camps during WWII were not allowed to take photos and the officials photographers were barred from snapping the barbed wire and guard towers that became a part of these families' lives . Critics of the auction say these works aren't just art but expression of the sorry the disenfranchised families felt . 'I am heartened by the solidarity shown among the Japanese American community to bring this issue to light,' Executive Director Brian Liesinger said in a release. 'It spurred us on in our effort to do right by the collection and the incarcerees who created the artworks.' Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation runs a museum dedicated to educating the public about the wartime relocation of Japanese Americans, including the background history of anti-Asian prejudice in America. According to a Change.org petition that aimed to stop the auction, Allen Eaton would himself have been opposed to the sale. 'These items were given -- not sold -- to the original collector, Allen Eaton, because he wanted to display them in an exhibition that would help tell the story of the incarceration of 120,000 innocent people,' reads the petition.

'Eaton opposed the incarceration and this sale goes against his intent for a public exhibition that received official support.' According to NBC News, Rago Arts and Auction Center acknowledged the 'uncertain ethical landscape' of the sale. Their statement said, in part: . 'There is an essential discussion to be had about the sale of historical items that are a legacy of man's inhumanity to man. 'It extends beyond what is legal. It is something auction houses, galleries and dealers are faced with regularly. We hope this controversy will be the beginning of a discourse on this issue.' George Takei (pictured) was taken with his family to a Japanese internment camp in Arkansas for he duration of WWII starting at the age of 5 . Roughly 120,000 Japanese Americans were incarcerated at 10 relocation camps after the December 7, 1941, Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. The ten camps were located in: . Amache, Colorado; Gila River, Arizona; Heart Mountain, Wyoming; Jerome, Arkansas; Manzanar, California; Minidoka, Idaho; Poston, Arizona; Rohwer, Arkansas; Topaz, Utah; and Tule Lake, California. A third of those in the camps had been born in Japan and were not allowed to own land in some states or become naturalized U.S. citizens, writes History.com. Rumors fueled by racial prejudice spread following the Pearl Harbor and suggestive a sabotage plot among Japanese-Americans. President Roosevelt signed, Executive Order 9066, which forced families and Japanese-Americans young and old out of their homes and into the cramped camps. Among them was 5-year-old George Takei, who was kicked out of his Los Angeles home along with his family in . 'We were in the living room - my brother and I - looking out the window and we saw two American soldiers marching up the driveway,' Takei recalled on The Daily Show. 'We were literally ordered out of our home at gunpoint.' The family was taken to the Rohwer, Arkansas camp. They were forced to live there for the duration of the war, according to NBC News. Years later, Takei would still remember something his father said after the harrowing experience. 'Our democracy is a people's democracy,' he said. 'And it can be as great as people can be, but it is also as fallible as people are.'

"Menacing: An immigrant holds his machete to his face as gangs clashed with police following the outbreak of violence in South Africa . Police battled to contain a wave of violence in South Africa last night as gangs of migrants armed themselves with machetes to fight off anti-foreigner attacks by locals. Five people have died since vigilantes started looting and attacking shops owned by immigrants, mainly from other parts of Africa. Police fired stun grenades and rubber bullets as immigrant gangs confronted the vigilantes, and last night in parts of Johannesburg officers formed a human barrier to keep the two sides apart. More than 200 immigrants had to take refuge in a police station and dozens of businesses were closed when trouble spread just a day after a rally against xenophobia in Durban. Immigrants have complained about a lack of protection from the authorities and some have started arming themselves to fight back. Eyewitnesses have claimed that the vigilante violence is carefully orchestrated and that minibuses have been ferrying men armed with knives and machetes around suburbs. In the past two weeks, shops and homes owned by Somalis, Ethiopians, Malawians and other migrants have been targeted, forcing more than 2,000 to flee to camps protected by armed guards. In Johannesburg, Malawian immigrant Samuel Idrssa described how his friend was stabbed and set on fire by a mob. ‘We wanted to rescue him but there were too many of them,’ he said. ‘It was shocking.’ He added: ‘We have all left our homes. Those affected are those of us who live in poor townships because we live with poor South Africans who do not have jobs.’ So far, five people are believed to have been killed in the violent protests which started two weeks ago in Durban, a key port on South Africa's Indian Ocean coast, spreading to Johannesburg. Violence flared days after Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini said in remarks reported by local media that foreigners should 'take their bags and go'. In a recorded speech sent to a local broadcaster, he said: 'We must deal with our own lice' and complained about foreign-owned shops. He has since said his comments were misinterpreted. Addressing parliament in Cape Town on Thursday, President Zuma reiterated his condemnation of the violence, calling it a 'violation' of South Africa's values. 'No amount of frustration or anger can ever justify the attacks on foreign nationals and the looting of their shops,' he said. 'We condemn the violence in the strongest possible terms. The attacks violate all the values that South Africa embodies.' Scroll down for video .

He also said the government was taking steps to secure its porous borders and making progress in setting up a Border Management Agency, announced last year and scheduled to be up and running in 2016. The ruling African National Congress party has condemned the attacks as 'shameful' and branded them 'criminal acts against vulnerable people'. The US ambassador to South Africa, born in Zaire - now the Democratic Republic of the Congo - to Haitian parents, spoke in defence of the immigrants. 'As an immigrant to my own country, my heart goes out to those who have been attacked for being different,' Patrick H. Gaspard said. The Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation, which campaigns for peace, warned: ‘The fabric of the nation is splitting at the seams; its precious nucleus – our moral core – is being ruptured.’ Gang: A group of immigrants brandishing machetes in a run-down area of Johannesburg prepare to defend themselves against the police .

In the past two weeks, foreign nationals living near Johannesburg had to remove items from their shops and shut up their stores because of fears they could be targeted by protesters. They fled after a mobile phone text message was apparently sent to shop owners, warning them to shut their premises, claiming that 'Zulu people are coming to town... to kill every foreigner on the road'. Angry South Africans accuse immigrants of taking jobs in a country where unemployment and poverty levels are high - the official figure is 25 per cent but economists say, in reality, it is much higher.

"Strangers from around Minnesota flocked to a ten-year-old girl's birthday party, after several of her classmates didn't respond to their invitations, in hopes of giving her a celebration she'll never forget. Mackenzie Moretter, who has a rare genetic disorder called Sotos Syndrome that has delayed her development, which makes it hard for her to socialize, told her parents she wanted a 'big-girl party' for her tenth birthday. This meant inviting friends, but after her parents sent invitations to Mackenzie's classmates and heard no response, her mother Jenny Moretter took a different approach. Jenny Moretter went on Facebook and posted in a few local groups asking families with girls around Mackenzie's age to stop by their Shakopee home on Saturday - and the response was overwhelming. Scroll down for video . Mackenzie Moretter, of Shakopee, Minnesota, had a tenth birthday party on Saturday that she'll never forget after hundreds of strangers showed up to celebrate with her . Mackenzie's parents had sent out invitations to several of her fourth grade classmates, but all but a neighbor and a cousin had canceled or did not RSVP . So Mackenzie's mother went on Facebook and posted in several groups asking families with girls Mackenzie's age to stop by their family home to celebrate . 'I want so much for much for Mackenzie to belong and for her to have friends and people to accept her for who she is,' Jenny Moretter told CBS Minnesota. Mackenzie told KSMP that she is often by herself on the playground, saying that 'kids don't want to play me'. Her mother said that kids seem to like Mackenzie, but they don't seem to socialize with her. But after not getting RSVPs and having families of Mackenzie's fourth-grade classmates cancel, she wanted to do something about it. 'I thought to myself, it is not going to happen again this year,' Jenny Moretter said about her daughter who was diagnosed with Sotos Syndrome when she was one year old, and her skull didn't form completely, causing brain damage. She received an overwhelming large positive response and more than 700 people joined an event titled, 'Mackenzie's Birthday Party' Strangers of all ages showed up at a Shakopee park on Saturday to celebrate Mackenzie's tenth birthday . People came with gifts, food, chairs and even a banner that read, 'Happy Birthday Mackenzie' to be hung from the sheltered area in the park . She hoped that with her Facebook posts that she would get comments from people wishing her daughter a happy birthday and a few families would show up to her family's house. 'I honestly thought it would be a matter of a few other moms out there who I touched their heartstrings,' she told CBS. But to her surprise, more than 700 people joined a Facebook event she titled 'Mackenzie's Birthday Party'. Mackenzie's dad, Matt Moretter, was just as surprised as his wife. 'Jenny was hoping to get ten girls to show up and all of a sudden this happened,' Matt Moretter told Buzzfeed. 'We had hundreds of people arrive on Saturday.' Mackenzie blew out the candles and helped her mom cut her Frozen-themed birthday cake. Cupcakes and other goodies were also supplied at the party . Shakopee Mayor issued a proclamation announcing that Saturday would be Mackenzie Moretter Day in the city, giving the girl a signed certificate of the declaration . Mackenzie made new friends of all ages throughout the day. She said before the party that kids at her school don't want to play with her so she's often by herself on the playground . The party was moved to a local park, where city officials offered to host the family. People of all ages came with gifts, food, party favors and even a banner that read, 'Happy Birthday Mackenzie'. Local companies donated food and people brought chairs to the area, and even a woman dressed as Elsa from Frozen showed up to celebrate. And Shakopee Mayor issued a proclamation announcing that Saturday would be Mackenzie Moretter Day, giving the girl a signed certificate of the declaration. Matt Moretter said the day was 'amazing', and he learned that his family was not alone in the birthday scenario they experienced. One family (left) stopped by to give Mackenzie flowers, while a woman dressed as Elsa from Frozen (right) also made an appearance . Mackenzie appeared to be all smiles throughout the day on Saturday. Hundreds of people came out to celebrate with her . 'There were so many people who had similar stories to ours that we got to meet,' Matt Moretter told Buzzfeed. And Jenny Moretter again went to Facebook to thank all of the people who touched her family and made Mackenzie's birthday a day she wouldn't forget. 'I'm overwhelmed with emotions, my heart has been touched by so many stories similar to mine or just people wishing her a Happy Birthday,' she said. She added: 'I will never be able to thank you all enough for your kindness. 'I will not remember all your names or I may forget what was said or done but just know I am so incredibly grateful and blessed that you cared about my daughter. Love to all.' Families played games and socialized at the Shakopee Memorial Park. Mackenzie had the chance to make friends from all over during the party . A camera crew showed up at one point during the day to interview young Mackenzie and see how she was enjoying her big day . FOX9 News took a group photo in front of a sign wishing Mackenzie a happy birthday and posted it to Twitter in celebration of the day's events .","Mackenzie Moretter, of Shakopee, Minnesota, celebrated her tenth birthday on Saturday .

"The principal of a private boys school in Sydney has sent an email to parents and former students to inform them of child sex abuse allegations dating back 35 years. Newington College in Stanmore in Sydney's inner west is the latest prestigious private school to be hit by historic child sex abuse allegations. Headmaster David Mulford notified parents and students of the allegations in an email sent out on Monday ahead of a pending court case, Fairfax Media reports. Newington College in Sydney's inner west notified parents and students of child sex abuse allegations dating back 35 years in an email sent out on Monday ahead of a pending court case . He said the case referred to alleged incidents from more than 35 years ago and asked anyone with grievances to come forward. Headmaster David Mulford notified parents and students of the allegations in an email sent out on Monday ahead of a pending court case . 'I regret to inform you that a matter is to come before the courts involving alleged offences at Newington from more than 35 years ago,' Dr Mulford wrote. 'The sad cases about child sexual abuse and the poor institutional responses at the time have received considerable press coverage,"" the headmaster added. Dr Mulford, who has been been headmaster since 2009, spoke of the royal commission set up to look at institutional failures and child sex abuse but made it clear the school had not been called to give evidence. 'Sadly, many institutions with a long history, including Newington, have past incidents that require investigation and effective follow up,' he wrote. 'The commission's activities will no doubt, and justifiably, encourage those abused to come forward if they haven't already done so.' 'All of us have been appalled at the revelations coming from the Royal Commission sessions across the country. We feel deeply for the victims of such abuse.' He said Newington College would fully co-operate with police over the allegations. St Ignatius' College Riverview, located on Sydney’s north shore, has been responsible for the education of several high profile Australians including Prime Minister Tony Abbott . The principal of St Ignatius' College Riverview, Paul Hine, sent a letter to its old boys last month informing them that a former student had made allegations of 'child sexual abuse over 30 years ago'. It comes after the principal of St Ignatius' College Riverview, Paul Hine, sent a letter to its old boys last month informing them a former student had made allegations of 'child sexual abuse over 30 years ago' The prestigious school, located on Sydney’s North Shore, has been responsible for the education of several high profile Australians including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Minister for Agriculture Barnaby Joyce and the Archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher. The letter, penned by Principal Paul Hine, gave no details of the allegations except that it concerned child sexual abuse and that it happened more than 30 years ago. It's not the first time abuse allegations have surfaced at St Ignatius' College Riverview. Previously, it was alleged that former teacher and pupil Peter Bohrsmann had sexually abused a student during his time at Riverview. The 57-year-old categorically denied the allegations, which were made to police anonymously, before taking his own life two days later on school grounds. Police have made no links between the current allegations and any past complaints. Meanwhile, Knox Grammar was recently in the spotlight at the child abuse royal commission, which heard evidence about sexual abuse at the school during in the 1970s and '80s. Hearings will resume on Tuesday.

"Ever since the iPhone 3GS launched in 2009, Apple has followed a new handset one year with a marginally-different 'S' version the year after. But rumours suggest it is about to abandon these plans by skipping the launch of a 6S this autumn in favour of going straight for the iPhone 7. This difference may seem slight, but it suggests the next model of iPhone could be substantial improvement on iPhone 6 range, and rumours have hinted towards new features such as Force Touch. Rumours suggest Apple is about to abandon the 6S later this year in favour of going straight for the iPhone 7. This difference may seem slight but it suggests the next model of iPhone could be substantial improvement on iPhone 6 range (pictured), and rumours have hinted towards new features . The claims were made by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo during a note to investors on Tuesday, reports MacRumors. He said the next-generation iPhone will feature Force Touch, recently added to the Apple Watch and new MacBook. Apple describes Force Touch as the 'most significant new sensing capability' since Multi‑Touch. It recognises typical scrolling and pinching gestures, but it additionally tracks the pressure of a person's click and responds accordingly. The claims were made by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who said the next-generation iPhone will feature Force Touch, recently added to the Apple Watch and new MacBook (pictured). It recognises typical scrolling and pinching gestures, but additionally tracks the pressure of a click and responds accordingly . Apple released its iOS 8.3 update yesterday. And in addition to 300 new emojis, including the much-anticipated 'racially diverse' people icons, Apple also rolled out Wi-Fi Calling on more networks. People on Sprint in the US and EE in the UK can now use their iPhones to make calls using the web. Wi-Fi Calling routes calls through a Wi-Fi network instead of using mobile signal, which can be notoriously temperamental. Calls made over Wi-Fi don't use minutes or data and can be used to make free calls when roaming. Apple added the option in iOS 8 in September, although it was only used by T-Mobile at that time. EE launched the UK's first Wi-Fi Calling service earlier this week on the Lumia 640 and Samsung's Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Although services such as Skype and Viber offer calls over Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Calling doesn't require an app and uses the handset's built-in dialler and contact list. This means gestures and tracking feel more intuitive and are more responsive. And on the Watch this feature is used to access more options in menus, for example. If Force Touch is added to the next iPhone, Mr Kuo said the change will be significant enough to warrant Apple adding the 7 moniker to any new handsets. This follows recent rumours which suggested a 4-inch version of the iPhone 6 is in development to replace the iPhone 5C with a lower cost and 'female friendly' design. The handset will be launched during 2015, according to Chinese rumour site Feng.com, and it would complement the current range of larger 4.7 and 5.5-inch screen sizes. In particular, The Feng.com report called the new design  'female friendly', alluding to the fact women typically have smaller hands than men. This could be known as the iPhone 6C, or based on Mr Kuo's predictions, the iPhone 7C. The larger handsets were extremely well received and became Apple's fastest-selling product to date, selling more than 10 million units within the first three days. Many doubted how successful a large screen iPhone would be, claiming it was too big but the recent sales figures show the 6 Plus is outselling every other 'phablet' in the US. Despite being on the market for just a single month of the three months ending October 2014, the iPhone 6 Plus captured 41 per cent of 'phablet' sales.

"Dogs can sniff out prostate cancer with 98 per cent reliability, a new study has shown. The research, carried out in Milan, backs up tests carried out by the charity Medical Detection Dogs. Its co-founder Dr Claire Guest said the charity's research found a 93 per cent reliability rate when detecting both prostate and bladder cancer. She hailed the new study, describing the findings as 'spectacular'. Dogs have been found to detect prostate cancer with 98 per cent accuracy when sniffing men's urine samples . The latest research, by the Department of Urology at the Humanitas Clinical and Research Centre in Milan, involved two dogs sniffing the urine of 900 men - 360 with prostate cancer and 540 without. Scientists found that dog one got it right in 98.7 per cent of cases, while for dog two this was 97.6 per cent . They said the dogs are able to detect prostate cancer specific volatile organic compounds in the urine but said an important question remains of how a dog would find it in daily practice. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Dr Guest said: 'These results are spectacular. They offer us further proof that dogs have the ability to detect human cancer. 'It is particularly exciting that we have such a high success rate in the detection of prostate cancer, for which the existing tests are woefully inadequate.' She said there is currently a 'reluctance to embrace this tested, time-old technology' but dogs can pick up a scent in a dilution of one to a thousand parts. There is no single test for prostate cancer, but the most commonly used are blood tests, a physical examination or a biopsy.

'Over the years, millions of pounds of NHS funding has been poured into the traditional test methods, and yet there has been little improvement in their reliability,' Dr Guest added. 'This has caused a huge waste of resources, not to mention the distress to the impacted individuals. 'Moreover, the detection dogs provide alternative solution that yields consistently accurate results. If our detection dogs were a machine, there would be huge demand for them.'

"A high-flying Tory MP has been ordered to remove ‘interfering’ tweets that risk derailing a murder trial amid claims he was exploiting the case to ‘win votes’. Richard Graham, who is fighting to retain the marginal seat of Gloucester, faces contempt of court proceedings if he fails to obey an order by the High Court to take down the Twitter posts. At an extraordinary pre-trial hearing, the Old Etonian former diplomat was accused of posting the tweets to ‘ingratiate himself’ with voters by ‘whipping up local feeling’ about the forthcoming case concerning the killing of a teenager. Richard Graham, who is fighting to retain the marginal seat of Gloucester, faces contempt of court proceedings if he fails to obey an order by the High Court to take down Twitter posts a court case . Zac Evans, 19, was killed in a machete attack outside a pub in Gloucester in January while apparently trying to protect a group of girls. The trial, due to take place in June, was originally set for Bristol Crown Court, 30 miles from Gloucester. But after Mr Graham called for it to be moved during an exchange in the House of Commons and wrote to the Lord Chief Justice, it was transferred to Gloucester Crown Court. It was later switched back to in Bristol following objections that Gloucester would struggle to stage such an emotive case. Zac’s family said they preferred the case to be heard in Bristol. The High Court heard concerns by defence lawyers that Mr Graham may have used his political influence to try to get the trial switched from Bristol. They also argued that a number of his Twitter posts could prejudice the trial if not removed from his Twitter account. Zac Evans, 19, was killed in a machete attack outside a pub in Gloucester in January while apparently trying to protect a group of girls . Barrister Stephen Kamlish QC, acting for the defendant in the murder trial, said in court that Mr Graham’s tweets were a ‘clear attempt to win votes by ingratiating himself with his electors’, the MP was ‘potentially out of control on the issue’ and if he refused to remove his tweets or added to them, the defendant may not get a fair trial. Mr Justice Hamblen ordered Mr Graham to remove the tweets ‘as soon as reasonably practicable’, and to say nothing more that could prejudice the trial. Mr Graham insisted he was right to speak out about the trial arrangements, but refused to discuss his tweets, which he said had been removed. On the suggestion that he had used the trial for electioneering, he said: ‘That’s rubbish. 'For an MP not to say anything about an event which filled the cathedral [for Zac’s funeral]... no MP is going to sit there and say nothing.’ A spokesman for the judiciary said: ‘The presiding judge for the area, in consultation with the resident judge, felt it was appropriate to try this case in Gloucester. 'Both have made it clear the letter from Mr Graham did not influence their decision.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Case about Zac Evans, killed in machete attack outside pub in Gloucester .

"A pair of turkey-sized ‘egg thief lizards’ dubbed Romeo and Juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75-million-year-old rock in the mid-90s, but it has taken until now for experts to determine the sex of the 'lovers'. Now, researchers believe they have come up with a way to tell fossils of small feathered male dinosaurs from those of females. They say that the key differences between the sexes lie in bones near the base of the tail. A pair of turkey-sized ‘egg thief lizards’ dubbed Romeo and Juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75-million-year-old rock (pictured) in the mid-90s. Palaeontologists led by Scott Persons (pictured) believe they can tell males and females apart from certain tail bones . Paleontologistsat the University of Alberta examined a pair of fossils found in Mongolia, which were first described in 2001. One is a complete skeleton, while the other is missing the middle and end of its tail. ‘Determining a dinosaur’s gender is really hard,’ said graduate student Scott Persons, who is lead author of the study, published in Scientific Reports. ‘Because soft anatomy seldom fossilises, a dinosaur fossil usually provides no direct evidence of whether it was a male or a female.’ So instead, the researchers looked at indirect evidence of sexually dimorphic display structures, which are evident today in birds. Examples include the fans of peacocks, the tall crests of roosters or the long tail feathers of some birds of paradise, which are used to attract and court mates. They are almost always much larger in males who do the courting, than in females, who do the choosing. They suggest that male oviraptors had broader and longer chevron bones in their tails so they could shake their feather-tipped tail to woo potential mates (illustrated), much like modern peacocks . The team theorised that like birds, small feathered dinosaurs such as oviraptors used long feathers on their tails to attract mates, rather than for flying. ‘My analysis of the tail skeletons supported this theory, because the skeletons showed adaptations for both high tail flexibility and enlarged tail musculature - both traits that would have helped an oviraptor to flaunt its tail fan in a mating dance,’ Mr Persons said. After studying the fossils carefully, his team found signs of sexual dimorphism in the length and shape of blade-like bones called chevrons, which point downwards from the vertebrae near the base of the tail. A number of chevrons in one of the fossils were longer and had broader tips than those in the other specimen, indicating the creature is male, the experts said. They suggested that males had larger chevrons to anchor the muscles that controlled their flexible, feather-tipped tails. The researchers suspect that male oviraptorosaurs shook their tail feathers in intricate displays to woo potential mates, akin the behaviour of modern-day peacocks. They suspect females had shorter chevrons to make laying eggs easier. Scientists have recently shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Their mating ritual may bear some resemblance to that of small feathered dinosaurs . Scientists have shown that peacocks (stock image) shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear . Scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate. Researchers at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them. Humans hear a rustling sound when this happens, but the experts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels, according to the study published in the journal Animal Behaviour. Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers, with males shrieking out in response. Experts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound, but know that some can feel vibration through their legs. Graduate student Angela Freeman observed that male peacocks were most likely to make the low sounds when they showed off their train feathers, producing two displays which she called the ‘shiver train’ and the ‘pulse train’. The shiver train is produced by vibration of the train feathers from the centre feathers to the outside of the array and is used by males when females are far away. The pulse train is produced by a vibration emanating from the base of all the train feathers and it is used when the female is nearby. Peacocks’ tails are a sign of strength and good genes, so a strong noise may reinforce a message of virility, Ms Freeman said. This could be especially useful as the birds live in scrubby woodland, where high noises can only travel over short distances and birds sometimes can’t see each other. ‘We think that possibly these signals could signal to females and males who are out of sight behind a bush or over the hill,’ she added. The two raptors were discovered in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Both died and were buried next to each other when a large sand dune collapsed on top of them, creating the interesting fossil. When they were first unearthed, the two oviraptors were given the nicknames Romeo and Juliet because they seemed reminiscent of Shakespeare's famously doomed lovers. ‘We discovered that, although both oviraptors were roughly the same size, the same age and otherwise identical in all anatomical regards, “Romeo” had larger and specially shaped tail bones,’ Mr Persons said. ‘This indicates that it had a greater capacity for courtship displays and was likely a male.’ By comparison, the second specimen, Juliet, had shorter and simpler tail bones, suggesting a lesser capacity for peacocking, and has been interpreted as a female. According to Persons, the two may very well have been a mated pair, making for a romantic story, as the dinosaur couple was preserved side by side for more than 75 million years. While the theory is compelling, Thomas Holtz, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park told Nature that it’s not yet completely convincing, because only one pair of oviraptor specimens have been studied. Therefore, there is a possibility that the difference in Chevron shape was a variation, rather than a sign of sexual dismorphism.","'Egg thief lizards' preserved in rock for 75 million years were studied .

"The probe into the suicide of a 12-year-old girl was more of a 'publicity stunt' than an investigation, according to a new lawsuit. Rebecca Sedwick leaped to her death from the roof of an abandoned concrete plant in Lakeland, Florida in September 2013. The following month, the Polk County Sheriff's Office said she likely killed herself following 'malicious harassment' from two schoolmates, Katelyn Roman, then 12, and Guadalupe Shaw, 13. Both girls, who were students at Crystal Lake Middle School, were arrested on charges of aggravated stalking and the sheriff's office distributed their names and mug shots. Suicide: Rebecca Sedwick, pictured with her mother, took her life in 2013 and two girls were arrested for bullying her but later released. One of the girls has now filed a lawsuit against the sheriff's department . Authorities claimed they bullied Rebecca online and sent her messages such as 'go kill yourself'. But the charges were dropped when police were unable to find any evidence of the messages. On Wednesday, lawyers representing the family of the youngest girl filed a lawsuit naming Sheriff Grady Judd and Deputy Jonathan McKinney, the Orlando Sentinel reported. It accuses them of using Rebecca's death as an 'opportunity for media attention' and says that they maliciously deemed the girl 'the poster child example of a cyber-bully'. She was arrested without any factual basis, according to the lawsuit. It also accuses the sheriff's office of falsely telling the media that the girl had admitted to bullying Rebecca, even though this was false. Arrested: Katelyn Roman, 12, and Guadalupe Shaw, 13, were arrested a month after the suicide for allegedly bullying the girl - but the charges were dropped when police filed to find evidence of harassment . Defiant: After the charges was dropped, Katelyn went on the Today show with her parents and attorney and denied she had ever bullied the 12-year-old girl. Her family has now filed a lawsuit in Polk County . 'Although the charges were unsubstantiated and ultimately dropped, the incident left [jer] devastated and irreparably damaged,' the lawsuit says. Named: Sheriff Grady Judd, pictured, is accused of using Rebecca's death for 'media attention' Last year, it was reported that Katelyn had the third highest state testing score in Polk County but feared that she would no longer be able to continue her education after being suspended. The family is seeking at least $15,000 in damages. A representative for the sheriff's office said the claims 'have no merit'. Following Rebecca's death, Judd claimed  that Guadalupe had posted online: 'Yes [I know] I bullied REBECCA and she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***].' Judd said the message led to her arrest, explaining: 'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' But Guadalupe claimed her account had been hacked and the charges were ultimately dropped. The rift between the girls allegedly came after Guadalupe started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend. At the time, the teen boy told DailyMail.com that the girls fell out because he still liked Rebecca. Rebecca's computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like: 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl?' Last summer, Rebecca's mother, Tricia Norman, filed a lawsuit in Polk County, seeking more than $15,000 from each of the defendants over the death of her daughter. Heartbroken: Rebecca's mother, pictured, filed her own lawsuits against the accused bullies last year . Norman, who said her 'happiness no longer exists', said the school failed to properly supervise the girl accused of stalking her daughter, even though they were allegedly aware of the situation.

"As Britain’s Got Talent acts go, she was certainly a conversation starter – a ‘talking’ dog with singing skills and a sense of humour. But some viewers at home were less dazzled by Miss Wendy's false mouth trick - and questioned the effect of the 'cruel' stunt on the dog. After Saturday's episode of the show, broadcasting regulator Ofcom received 21 complaints over the talking dog, while ITV received a further 35. The RSPCA yesterday said it would be contacting Britain’s Got Talent ‘to ascertain what methods were used’ in the performance. Scroll down for video . Was it a trick? Britain's Got Talent singing dog Miss Wendy with owner Marc Métral stunned the judges - but it may not have been all it seemed . Convincing: Miss Wendy's mouth moved perfectly in time with the music but it is believed the dog had a fake jaw . Astonished: Simon Cowell thought the act was incredible and even called his girlfriend Lauren to tell her about it . Theory: It is believed that a false mouth was placed on Miss Wendy's face, which is triggered by a remote control . ‘We would be very concerned if it became clear that [the dog] was caused distress,’ a spokesman said. ‘Distress could result from her being unable to breathe or pant properly whilst wearing a mask on stage – in an environment which can get very warm, it is essential that panting is not restricted.’ One viewer wrote on on Twitter: ‘That’s not talent [and it] should be looked into for animal abuse.’ Others said the act was cruel. But French ventriloquist Marc Metral insisted that Miss Wendy ‘loves performing’. ‘I’ve been working with Wendy since she was a puppy,’ he said. ‘I would never put her in a situation that would cause her distress. She gets excited when we go to work and is always comfortable on stage.’ Britain’s Got Talent also defended the act, with a spokesman saying RSPCA guidelines were consulted during the audition process. ‘We are comfortable that Mr Metral’s act complies with the guidelines and we look forward to hearing from the RSPCA to talk through the methods used,’ he added. Cowell has always dismissed claims that having animals on the show is cruel. He has previously said: ‘God no, I think the opposite! We show animals’ personalities. Agreement: Marc and Wendy received a standing ovation on Saturday and progressed to the semi-finals - with Amanda Holden telling him he had made TV history . ‘I think they all have a great time on our show, you can see the dogs are wagging their tails.’ Perched high on a silver plinth, Miss Wendy shared a joke with her owner and serenaded the judges with a rendition of 1970s classic Feelings during Saturday's episode, which was watched by 11m viewers. The audience roared with laughter as she argued with French ventriloquist Marc Metral – and all four judges were so impressed they sent the pair straight through to the next round. Old dog old trick? In 2012, a contestant on America's Got Talent, Todd Oliver astounded judges with his talking French bulldog, Irving (pictured) But in case you were wondering just how easy it is to teach a dog to talk, the trick behind the act can be revealed with a quick look at the ITV show’s archives. A similar illusion was used on America’s Got Talent in 2012, when contestant Todd Oliver appeared to make his French bulldog speak. It involves fitting a fake snout over the nose of the animal, which is then controlled remotely to make the artificial mouth open in time with the routine. To make it seem more realistic, the breathable snout is covered in fur exactly the same colour as that of the dog. And the novelty clearly hadn’t worn off by Saturday night, as Simon Cowell seemed particularly astounded by the performance of 61-year-old Mr Metral and his pet. Amanda Holden told her French owner that he had 'made television history' and Cowell phoned his girlfriend Lauren Silverman to tell her about it. Holden said to Mr Métral: 'Congratulations, in the nine years of doing this show, Simon has said he wanted a dog that could meow or sing, and you did both, incredible.' Simon Cowell commented: 'Wow, I don't know how she does that. How does she know the words? Unbelievable.' Marc and Wendy received a standing ovation on Saturday and progressed to the semi-finals. On Saturday another act shocked Simon Cowell when a fearless free-runner pretended to be injured after plunging from a balcony during a terrifying routine. Look out below: Matt McCreary's jaw-dropping audition saw him pretend to fall over as he jumped from the balcony . Ouch: He went to put on a dazzling display on the stage as he ended his audience with an impressive jump over Ant and Dec . Cowell, who earlier in the week conned Amanda Holden into thinking she was being dumped from the show for Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, was left open-mouthed when 20-year-old Matt McCreary, from Belfast, leapt around the stage. Cowell asked McCreary: 'Oh my God, Matt are you really OK?' as he lay on the theatre floor after diving from a balcony. The 20-year-old,  also leapt over show hosts Ant and Dec on stage, also impressed Amanda Holden, who told him: 'We have never seen anything as brave and dangerous before'. But not everyone on the panel was won over, with David Walliams joking: 'Jumping over two people who are that short isn't really such a big deal.' Amazing: Britain's Got Talent started with a bang on Saturday when Simon Cowell pressed his Golden Buzzer in the first round of auditions as he put singing through singer Calum Scott . You're in: Receiving not only a standing ovation, he also got a golden buzzer from Simon as his sister was able to move past her exit and give her brother a hug . Later Simon Cowell pressed his Golden Buzzer in the first round of auditions as he put singing through singer Calum Scott. Scott, 26, had come along to audition for the ITV talent competition with his sister who failed to impress the judges while her brother went on to wow Simon. The recruitment officer from Hull, had to go on stage after watching his sister's audition go wrong, and he performed Dancing On My Own by Robyn. Receiving not only a standing ovation, he also got a Golden Buzzer from Simon, causing his sister to run on stage and give her brother a proud hug. Simon revealed why he pressed the buzzer saying: 'I've never ever in all the years I've done this show heard a guy with the talent you've got'. At the start of the show, Simon was seen driving his fellow judges to the auditions. Well, that's different: The show kicked off with 42-year-old Narinder Dhanni. The IT consultant certainly started things off in a unique style as he played his instrument – which turned out to be a comb . Helping out: He immediately received a buzz from Simon Cowell before he was joined on stage by hosts Ant and Dec as they played I Just Called To Say I Love You by Stevie Wonder .

"Three men accused of being agents of the Syrian government have been executed in a shocking new video, Islamic State has claimed. The barbaric footage, released earlier today, shows the men kneeling in the middle of a dusty road in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, as a militant brandishing a sharpened sword stands behind them. It comes just one day after the extremist group claim to have shot and beheaded more than 30 Ethiopian Christians in Libya. Each of the men are forced on to their hands and knees in the war-torn street before they are beheaded . The harrowing video shows the sword used to kill the men being forged and sharpened for the executions . The three men were accused of being Assad agents, working for the Syrian governmment, say ISIS . The new eight-minute video shows the men - wearing orange Guantanamo-style jumpsuits with their hands and feet in chains - sitting in a dirty, underground room. After giving information about each of the prisoners in Arabic, the men are blindfolded and filmed in the back of a moving van while an ISIS militant decked in black guards over them. When the van stops, the barefoot captives are escorted out and begin to march slowly down an abandoned street, surrounded by fighters holding guns. The professionally-shot film pans the scene - showing buildings irreparably damaged by bombing - before phasing into a picture of the executioner's sword being sharpened before the brutal executions. One by one the prisoners are beheaded by a fighter, who is dressed completely in black and unidentifiable. Their bodies are left on the road. Initial reports suggested the extremist group targeted the men because they worked for the Syrian regime. But they did not confirm who the men - thought to be aged between 35 and 45 - were or when the execution took place. The prisoners were filmed barefoot and in shackles in an unknown prison at the start of the sick video . They were then blindfolded and transported in a van to the execution point - thought to be Deir ez-Zo in Syria . Sparks fly from the sword as it is sharpened, before being used to behead the men in a brutal execution . One by one the men are murdered. The body of one of the men can been seen after he was beheaded . It is the latest footage released by the militant group, which is increasingly using propaganda to encourage would-be jihadi fighters. Yesterday a 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive in Libya. It showed at least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', being shot in a desert area while 12 others were beheaded on a beach. In February a similar video was released showing the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya. The helpless men were kept under a close watch by their ISIS captives. Videos of this nature - often professionally shot - are used by the militant group as propaganda to attract other would-be jihadi fighters . The bodies of each of the helpless men, thought to be aged between 35 and 45, were then left on the road . One of the victims, flanked by two fighters in black, can be seen being led down the abandoned Syrian road . ISIS has taken over large sections of iraq and ISIS and carried out multiple public executions similar to this . The battle against Islamic State amid a protracted civil war in Syria is thought to have already claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people. ISIS has destroyed churches and Christian shrines in the country. They also demanded that Christians living under its rule pay a 'special tax' known as jizya. Fighters from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) have been on the offensive and a large area is now divided between Kurdish and IS control. The extremist group has been able to gain a foothold amid chaos in Libya and is also advancing in Iraq.","Men were executed on a dusty road in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, ISIS claimed .

"Sidonie, a well known band from Catalonia, created a rather tongue-in-cheek song during a recent Ryanair flight to Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain. The group, who posted the performance video to Facebook and Youtube, explained that they composed the tune after experiencing a 'lack of respect shown by Ryanair flight attendants.' In the video, the band's lead singer strums a ukulele as the group serenades passengers on board - despite Ryanair's scathing review of the sarcastic ditty. A well-known Spanish band from Catalonia, called Sidonie, sang an impromptu song aboard a Ryanair flight . While en route to Santiago, the band grew impatient with the alleged 'lack of respect' from flight attendants . Although sung in their native tongue, the lyrics read: 'Ryanair, how we like Ryanair, and its flight attendants, they could not be nicer'. Clearly meant to be ironic, some passengers even join in and sing or clap along as the band repeats the chorus during their impromptu performance. Explaining the motivation behind their hilarious video, the band wrote online: 'After receiving, repeatedly, the habitual lack of respect shown by flight attendants on the Ryanair route to Santiago, we were moved to compose and perform a song dedicated to them and their irritable airline.' Ryanair, however, wasn't as impressed with the band's performance. Robin Kiely, a spokesperson for the airline told MailOnline Travel: 'Sidonie? More like sit down mate. 'The lyrics are average, the vocals out of tune, the ukulele playing leaves a lot to be desired and there isn't one trumpet.' Taking matters into their own hands, the group composed and performed a tongue-in-cheek tune . As they paraded up and down the aisle of the plane, some passengers even began to sing along with the lyrics . The band also posted the video to Facebook, adding that the song was dedicated to the 'irritable airline' 'We much prefer our new on-time landing music, which will be heard on over 90 per cent of our flights this year, as we carry 100 million customers,' Kiely added. Ryanair is famous for complaints about its customer service and surcharges, and it has recently launched a marketing campaign and measures such as allocated seating to win over passengers. Since being posted on March 27, the video has been viewed over 24,000 times on YouTube and has been liked over 12,000 times on Facebook. MailOnline Travel has contacted Sidonie  for comment about the video.","Sidonie, a well-known group from Catalonia, created and sang mid-flight .

"A gay student in Louisiana says she is going to skip her senior prom because the school principal won't let her wear a tuxedo. Claudetteia Love, a senior and one of the top students at Carroll High in Monroe, said she was planning on going to the prom without a date and with a group of friends, but now she and her friends are staying away. Though a petition was started and signed by members of the senior class to allow Love to wear a tuxedo, it was not acted on by school faculty. Carroll High School senior Claudetteia Love will skip her senior prom after her Monroe, Louisiana, school's principal told her that she would not be allowed to wear a tuxedo . Principal Patrick Taylor told Love that the decision was dress-code related and that she shouldn't take it personally . 'I told my mom, ""They're using me"". They put me in all these honors and advanced placement classes so I can take all of these tests and get good grades and better the school, but when it's time for me to celebrate the fact that I've accomplished what I need to accomplish and I'm about to graduate, they don't want to let me do it the way I want to,'' she told The News-Star. The decision is part of the school's dress code and not anything personal, principal Patrick Taylor told The News-Star. Love's mother, Geraldine Jackson, said Taylor told her faculty members said they wouldn't supervise the April 24 prom if girls wore tuxes. 'That's his exact words. ""Girls wear dresses and boys wear tuxes, and that's the way it is,""' she said. Love was going to go to the prom with a group of friends and no date, but all of them have decided not to go after Taylor made his rule. Love's mother said that she believes Taylor is 'taking his values and throwing them' on her daughter because she's a lesbian . 'I feel like he's taking his values and throwing them on my daughter because of what her preference is and what she represents,' Jackson added. Monroe City School Board President Rodney McFarland said Taylor's decision was discriminatory and he disagreed with it. 'Banning her from her prom just because of what she wants to wear - that's discrimination,' he said. 'As far as I know there is no Monroe City School Board policy saying what someone has to wear to attend the prom. You can't just go making up policies.' He said he planned to ask Superintendent Brent Vidrine to talk to Taylor. Love said that though she will skip her own prom, she hopes that she can make a difference for younger students. Love is a top-performing student at Carroll High School. She will represent the school at an annual scholars' banquet and has a full scholarship to Jackson State University once she graduates . 'There are other girls in lower grades than me, and I want for them when they come up to not to have to feel like they aren't accepted,' Love said. She added: 'I don't want them to feel like they are less of a person because people don't accept them. 'There are people in the world that won't accept you but they don't have to be so judgmental and make you feel like you're less of a person and that you shouldn't express yourself.' Last year, Love was one of a group of students presented in a Monroe City School Board meeting as part of the school's high achieving medical magnet program. She will represent the school at the annual Scholars' Banquet, an event for the top students in Ouachita Parish, and has a full scholarship to Jackson State University.","Claudetteia Love was planned to go to prom dateless with a group of friends .

"The city of Naypyidaw is shrouded in secrecy. It first became the capital of Myanmar a decade ago, after the government decided to move the capital from Yangon (also known as Rangoon) with minimal explanation. Since then, although developed to be the size of 120 Manhattans and to have space for up to one million residents, it remains a relative ghost town. Scroll down for video . Myanmar's newly-built capital city, Naypyidaw, is shrouded in secrecy, after the government decided to move the capital from Yangon . Built mainly for government staff, locals only come to live in the city, which looks more like no man's land than a booming metropolis, if they need to for work. The super-sized highways have up to 20 lanes and are built to be big enough for government SUVs, though some report that the massive roads were also constructed as runways to accommodate the landings of military. Official records state the population is just over 924,000, though any photographs taken would beg to differ. The streets are barren, with just a handful of individuals spotted walking or cycling through the secluded capital at any given point during the day. The city was developed mostly for government staff, including residential zones to house employees in four-storey apartment blocks . Despite a reported population of 924,000, the city's streets are barren and it's rare to see more than a couple of people at any given time . The building of Naypyidaw began in 2002, with it location chosen in the middle of a jungle that hadn't been lived in for more than 2,000 years. Although some government workers moved to the new capital at the beginning of 2005, many employees were separated from their families due to a lack of schools and other amenities. Split into various zones, the city keeps the government ministries far from the military area and there is also a designated commercial zone and hotel zone, despite a lack of tourism in the region. Burmese workers walk past the massive Parliament building surrounded by high gates and empty 10 lane roads . A street sweeper cleans this empty super-sized highway in the seemingly secluded capital city by hand with a broom . The residential areas are carefully organised into 1,200 four-storey apartment blocks. The roofs of the buildings are colour-coded by the jobs of their inhabitants. Despite the government-issued housing, many of the residents still live in slums. When it comes to recreational activities, there's the beautiful Uppatansanti Pagoda, which is similar in size and shape to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, as well as several parks and gardens, including a water fountain complex that hosts a musical light show each night. Foreigners and investors aren't keen to visit the secluded city and foreign aid workers prefer to commute daily from Yangon . But there are not many people around to enjoy the sights. Reportedly, foreigners and investors aren't keen to visit, especially amid travel agent reports that the area may be 'dangerous,' and foreign aid workers who have visited the city in an official capacity are apparently so spooked by the eerie emptiness that they prefer to commute in daily from Yangon. Despite the fact that the government set aside almost 5 acres of land each for foreign embassies and headquarters of UN missions, only the Bangladeshi embassy has moved to Naypyidaw so far.","The Burmese capital was moved from Yangon (Rangoon) to Naypyidaw, inexplicably, about a decade ago .

"Noelle Reno, socialite, reality TV star and former fiancee of businessman Scot Young, has broken her silence almost four months to the day since his death. She confirms she had split up with her partner of five years before he fell out of her fourth-floor flat window in London’s Marylebone on to the railings below. In a move bound to spark further controversy she also labels his death a ‘suicide’, pre-empting any coroner’s verdict. Socialite Noelle Reno, who is the former fiancee of businessman Scot Young who fell 60ft from his West London home last year, has broken her silence almost four months to the day since his horrific death . The tycoon was killed after falling 60ft from his multi-million pound apartment onto metal railings (pictured) The inquest was adjourned in December and no date has yet been set to re-open it. ‘Four days before we were to depart from Waterloo to Brussels somebody very close to me, named Scot Young, unexpectedly committed suicide,’ Reno writes in a blog post entitled ‘Coping with grief’, explaining she had been due to travel to Belgium with girlfriends. ‘Scot and I had recently broken up after five and a half years of being together, for most of which we were engaged.’ Reno, who was a regular on reality TV show Ladies Of London, was spotted out in metallic shorts at a Knightsbridge soiree last month, her first public outing since the tragedy. Reno, 31, called the police after she and Young had a blazing row and he later fell from the window. He had been involved in one of the UK’s most acrimonious divorce cases with his ex-wife Michelle after claiming to have lost all of his money in a mysterious Russian property deal, and there was speculation he might have been murdered. His was the latest in a series of ‘apparent’ suicides of a group of businessmen that some believe are linked to the Russian mafia. Ms Reno said in a blog post that her former partner 'unexpectedly committed suicide', despite an inquest into the cause of his death not yet being concluded. Pictured: The property from which he fell last year . Mr Young (left) had been involved in one of the UK’s most acrimonious divorce cases with his ex-wife Michelle (right), after claiming to have lost all of his money in a mysterious Russian property deal . Just one month before Young died, his friend Johnny Elichaoff, the ex-husband of TV presenter Trinny Woodall, fell to his death from a roof in West London. Reno, who had embarked on a project of visiting 12 countries in 12 months at the beginning of last year, inspired by the Julia Roberts film Eat Pray Love, says that travelling helped her come to terms with her ex-fiance’s death. ‘I look forward to exploring this new journey in more depth as I come in to a new stage in my life,’ she says.","Noelle Reno believes former fiancee intended to jump from London home .

"Just as we humans flock to the UK's coastline when the days get longer and warmer, jellyfish arrive in their droves to seemingly ruin it for us. A recent surge in jellyfish numbers has moved tourism group Stay In Cornwall to reassure swimmers that the water is fine and we need not be discouraged by the sight of these brainless, boneless creatures that have been around for 500 million years. 'We want to put the minds of holidaymakers at ease by showing that jellyfish are not as harmful as they may appear,' says Stay In Cornwall's Matt Fletcher. 'Swimming in the sea is one of the most enjoyable parts of a coastal holiday and one that should not be avoided simply because of jellyfish in the water.' With the warmer months comes a surge in the number of jellyfish, such as this barrel variety at Kynance Cove, off the UK's coastline . The water is fine: Stay In Cornwall has reassured swimmers to not be discouraged by the increased sight of the unusual sea creatures . Not all jellyfish found off UK beaches can sting humans, and for the majority of cases, stings are mild or are easily treated. How to deal with a sting as changed in recent years, with the long-adopted method of pouring vinegar over stings now considered a big no-no. The theory that covering the affected area with urine has also been debunked, with NHS now recommending the best product to use now is  shaving cream. Stay in Cornwall's put together a simple guide to dealing with UK jellyfish with help from University of Exeter natural environment lecturer Dr Matthew Witt, a jellyfish fan who urges beachgoers to look but don't touch. The stunning sight of a compass jellyfish (Chrysaora hysoscella), which has a painful sting, captured underwater in Cornwall . Thousands of visitors who will soon flock to the UK's beaches have been told to look but not touch jellyfish they will inevitably see . 'Jellyfish are an important part of our British wildlife and lead amazing lives - we see them year round, but mostly in summer months and lots around the South West, this is a great place to see marine wildlife,' Dr Witt says. 'But remember look and don't touch. If you do happen to come into contact with a jellyfish then follow these simple instructions. Also, please take time to inform the Marine Conservation Society of your sighting as this information will help us to understand the health of our coastal seas.' If the person stung doesn't have serious symptoms such as breathing difficulties or chest pain and hasn't been caught in a sensitive area, such as the face or genitals you can deal with a sting yourself, says the NHS. After leaving the water immediately the stung person should stay as still as possible to not to increase the spread of toxins through the body. The stingers should then be removed (tweezers are best) and then apply the shaving cream. An ice pack will also reduce pain and inflammation if one is available. Vinegar and other alcohol-based substances are now discouraged as they activate unfired stinging cells, while urine also makes things worse. After the shaving cream is applied, we're advised to use a 'razor blade, credit card or shell to remove any nematocysts (small poisonous sacs) that are stuck to the skin.' Paracetamol and ibuprofen can also be taken to help relieve pain and inflammation.","A recent surge in jellyfish numbers has been recorded off the coast of the UK as the weather has warmed up .

"Julie Walter, 49, who has been jailed for two and a half years after posing as trusted officials to dupe elderly residents in sheltered housing out of money . A woman has been branded a 'menace to the community' after she posed as both a council warden and a church official to bluff her way into sheltered housing complexes to steal from vulnerable residents. Julie Walters, 49, has been jailed for two and a half years after she pretended to be a trusted official to dupe elderly victims out of cash. She was caught by police after she was spotted on CCTV loitering in the communal hall of a retirement property near to the Old Trafford football ground in Manchester before an 80-year-old man and an 81-year-old woman were fleeced in two separate attacks. Today, police issued CCTV images of Walters of Withington, Manchester, hanging around outside the complex after she admitted three counts of burglary at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court. The court heard how the first victim, a man aged 81, was targeted at about midday on February 25 this year when he was walking back to his sheltered accommodation. He saw Walters get out of a taxi and she asked him for money, claiming she needed to pay the taxi and then go into town. Mistakenly thinking she was one of the wardens, he gave her about £30 in cash. The next day she returned to the man’s address, claiming she worked there, and needed to check his bathroom. After tricking her way inside, she stole his wallet and £100 in cash. Walters struck again on March 2 at the home of an 80-year-old man who lives at another retirement home. She falsely claimed she was from the church which convinced the man to let her inside. Walters then rifled through the kitchen, stealing his wallet containing between £50 to £60 in cash. Later that day and at the same retirement home, Walters targeted the home of an 81-year-old woman, claiming she was from 'the council' and needed to use the toilet. Once inside, she stole a £5 note from the woman’s handbag but was caught red-handed. When confronted she simply put the note on the coffee table and left. Walters was identified on the CCTV footage by a beat police officer and she was arrested on March 4. Investigations showed she had booked taxis to drop her off and then pick her up at times and locations matching those of the three burglaries. Today, police issued CCTV images of Walters hanging around outside a complex, where she targeted two residents, after she admitted three counts of burglary at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court . After the case Detective Sergeant Rachel Smith of Greater Manchester Police said: “Walters is devoid of conscience and scruples. “She is also extremely manipulative, not only in terms of tricking her way into the homes of vulnerable people but also targeting those she thinks are too frail or elderly to recognise her or give evidence in court. “In fact, in this case, one of the victims did feel he was too old to go to court but thankfully the woman who caught her red-handed positively picked her out of an identity parade and that, combined with the CCTV and mobile phone evidence we found, created an overwhelming case against Walters. “I cannot overstate what a menace to the community Walters is but thanks to this excellent investigation, she is now starting a lengthy jail sentence and the streets are much safer with her behind bars. “I would also like to commend the victims for giving their statements despite some reservations about their age. 'By doing so, they have not only helped effect justice for themselves but also saved other potential victims a great deal of heartache.”","Julie Walters pretended to be trusted official to gain access to care homes .

"Two armed robbers have been caught on camera using a sledgehammer and an axe to try and smash their way into a jewellery shop. The raiders were foiled by a brave employee who barricaded the door to the premises, and they proceeded to flee on a motorbike. A passer-by captured photographs of the two criminals, and police have now appealed for the public to help them identify the offenders. Raid: One of two robbers who used a sledgehammer and an axe to try and break in to a jewellery shop . The attempted break-in took place in Pemberton, a suburb of Wigan in Greater Manchester, on Saturday afternoon. One of the raiders used a sledgehammer to smash through an internal wooden door and the other used a axe to smash security glass at Uncle Jewellers and Pawn Brokers. When a worker barricaded the door and pushed one of them back through the broken window they fled the scene, threatening a member of the public with the axe as they did so. Greater Manchester Police are now investigating whether the incident is linked to a similar break-in at another Wigan jeweller last week, which also involved a motorbike and a sledgehammer. Getaway: The two criminals used motorbikes to escape from the scene in Wigan, Greater Manchester . Detective Sergeant Pete Carletti said: 'This attempted robbery happened in broad daylight on a busy Saturday afternoon in Pemberton town centre. 'It caused a lot of commotion and I have no doubt there are lots of potential witnesses who saw what happened and could have vital information for us. 'We have obtained a large number of names of members of the public present in the area at the relevant time but I would ask for those people who have not yet spoken to police to contact us. 'The shop worker showed incredible bravery in the face of adversity to hold these two thieves back and I would like to commend them for their actions. Vehicle: One of the motorcycles used by the raiders, who were caught on camera by a bystander . 'I would also like to thank the member of the public who was brave enough to take photos of the offenders, although we would obviously never advise people to put themselves in danger to do so in any similar situation. 'We now need to find those responsible so I would again urge anyone who witnessed this appalling attempted robbery to come forward.' Anyone with information about the raid should call police on 101 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Two raiders tried to attack a jewellery shop in Wigan, Greater Manchester .

"Kicking, punching and moving around during sleep might be an early sign of Parkinson's disease, a new review suggests. Moving around in sleep, and seeming to 'act out' dreams is a characteristic of a condition called rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). Researchers have discovered about half of people with RBD will develop Parkinson's disease or another neurological disorder within a decade of being diagnosed, LiveScience reports. People with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) move around in their sleep and 'act out' their dreams. Up to 90 per cent of people with the condition will develop a neurological condition, a study found . Ultimately, 81 to 90 per cent of patients with RBG with develop a neurodegenerative disorder, they found. 'If you get this disorder and live long enough, you will almost certainly get Parkinson's disease or a condition similar to it — it's an early warning sign,' said Professor Michael Howell, of the University of Minnesota, and co-author of the study. People with RBD describe having vivid dreams, and they act them out theatrically while asleep. They can be fighting enemies, or fleeing danger, and actually act out these dreams in their beds. This can range from making small hand movements to thrashing around, punching, kicking and jumping out of bed. Sometimes, people with the condition can injure themselves or anyone sharing a bed with them. 'It's very important to make the bedroom environment [as] safe as possible' by removing objects that can be picked up or used as a weapon, such as guns, Professor Howell said. People with RBD move around during the rapid eye movement period of sleep, when most dreaming occurs but the body's muscles are usually paralysed by the brain stem. Those with the condition are believed to have a malfunction in their brain-stem which allows them to move around during REM sleep, and therefore act out their dreams. For most people, dreaming is purely a 'mental' activity: dreams occur in the mind while the body is at rest. But people who suffer from REM behavior disorder (RBD) act out their dreams. They physically move limbs or even get up and engage in activities associated with waking. Some engage in sleep talking, shouting, screaming, hittting or punching. Some even jump out of bed while sleeping. RBD is usually noticed when it causes danger to the sleeping person, their bed partner, or others they encounter. People with RBD move around during the rapid eye movement period of sleep, when most dreaming occurs but the body's muscles are usually paralysed by the brain stem. Those with the condition are believed to have a malfunction in their brain-stem which allows them to move around during REM sleep, and therefore act out their dreams. RBD is not curable, but it can be treated with high doses of the sleep aid or low doses of the anti-anxiety drug clonazepam. Source: National Sleep Foundation . It is a different condition from sleepwalking, Professor Howell explained, as sleepwalkers are confused when they wake up. It is normally easy to awaken someone with RBD, and they will recall clear details of the vivid dream. RBD affects 0.5 per cent of the population or 35 million people worldwide. While it is incurable, it can be managed with high doses of the sleep hormone melatonin or low doses of the anti-anxiety drug clonazepam. As part of the study, Professor Howell and his colleagues reviewed 500 studies published between 1986 and 2014 that explored the link between RBD and Parkinson's. They found between 81 and 91 per cent of patients with RBD developed a degenerative brain disorder during their lifetimes. Parkinson's disease, a condition in which part of the brain becomes progressively damaged, is characterised by a tremor, slow movement and stiff and inflexible muscles. It is caused by the breakdown of certain proteins in the brain cells that produce dopamine, a chemical that produces pleasurable feelings in response to rewarding activities. It could be that RBD results from the early stages of the breakdown of the proteins in the brain cells, meaning it could be a useful warning sign of Parkinson's disease, Professor Howell said. However, not everyone who develops Parkinson's will have RBD first. Nevertheless, the findings could help doctors find a way to catch Parkinson's early and treat Parkinson's disease while it is in its early stages, Professor Howell added. The condition is not curable, but it can be managed with drugs. An experimental therapy called deep brain simulation has shown promise in some patients. The study was published  in the journal JAMA Neurology. Parkinson's disease is caused by the breakdown of proteins in brain cells, meaning that part of the brain cannot work (pictured in red). RBD could be an early warning sign of Parkinson's disease, researchers said .","Lashing out in sleep is a sign of 'rapid eye movement behaviour disorder'
Half of people with this condition will go on to develop Parkinson's disease .
Up to 90% of people will develop another neurological disorder within 10 years .

"From Victoria Beckham to the Duchess of Cambridge, our favourite celebrities always dress to impress. But if you thought they rolled out of bed and picked up the first thing in their wardrobe, you're mistaken. The A-listers have tried-and-tested techniques when it comes to getting dressed and they all follow simple styling hacks to flatter their figure. FEMAIL has pulled together the simple but effective celebrity-favoured styling tips you can employ to make the most of your figure. Scroll down for video . The A-listers have tried-and-tested techniques when it comes to getting dressed and they all follow simple styling hacks to flatter their figure . COMBINE NAVY AND BLACK . The fash-pack have long championed head-to-toe black, but they're shaking it up for spring by injecting another colour into their wardrobes. Navy rocked the runways, from Calvin Klein to The Row, and the likes of Victoria Beckham and Rita Ora can't get enough of it. As our favourite stars prove, combining trusty black with elegant navy is both chic and flattering. Victoria Beckham, left, out and about in New York and, right, at a news conference at the U.N. headquarters, proves that navy and black is not only the season's hottest colour combination but also super flattering . Plus, everyone looks good in navy because it suits every type of skin tone. Because it's slightly less severe than black - yet  equally sophisticated - it puts an updated spin on a classic. Global style icon, the Duchess of Cambridge, is rarely spotted in dresses that don't come in her favourite dark navy and black - both of which she has worn almost without exception for evening appearances since announcing her pregnancy in September. Already a fan of inky day wear, since giving birth to Prince George in July 2013, black and navy have become an increasingly important part of her evening wardrobe. Over the past year, Kate opted for a £2,145 bespoke Jenny Packham dress - complete with a glittering crystal fern - for a reception on her final night in New Zealand. She also won style plaudits when she teamed a black Hobbs top with a blue Jenny Packham skirt. Alicia Kite and business partner and stylist Kay Davidson mused: 'A darker colour will always make you look slimmer and the combination of navy and black together is a great way of camouflaging a few pounds without dressing head to toe in black.' The Duchess of Cambridge is rarely spotted in dresses that don't come in her favourite dark navy and black these days and she proves the power of the colour combination, left, in a navy Jenny Packham gown for St Andrew's 600th Anniversary Ball in New York and, right, Hobbs and Jenny Packham for a reception earlier this year . CONTRAST PANELLING . Make like Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne and opt for dresses with cut-out designs in sheer fabrics. The use of side panel creates an hourglass shape and gives the illusion of a thinner waist, more shapely figure, as well as hiding imperfections. 'There are plenty of dresses on the market that use the illusion of contrasting panelling down the sides of your hips and thighs,' says Lydia Jones, founder of wantherwardrobe.com. 'This creates a thinner illusion and can also be used around the waist to cinch you in and give the illusion of an hourglass figure, which waif-like Kate Moss showcases to perfection.' The use of side panels, as seen on (L-R) Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne and Yasmin Le Bon, creates an hourglass shape and gives the illusion of a thinner waist, more shapely figure and hides imperfections . As well as using sheer panels to accentuate your waist, you can also make like Kate Moss and use them to elongate your legs . GO HIGH-WAISTED . They're the hottest shape of the summer and trendsetters Amal Clooney and Chrissy Teigen are already trialling the look - and you should be rocking high-waisted trousers, too. Contrary to popular belief, high-waisted trousers can flatter every figure. Whether you're looking to jump on the season's trends with high-waisted jeans or you're a mature woman looking to hide your tummy, the style can work wonders for you. If you're plus-size, opt for flared versions to flatter, if you're petite, team the style with sky-scraper heels to elongate your legs. The one universal golden rule for pulling off the look is sticking to a simple top - avoid jumpers and bulky styles, which will draw attention to your waist for the wrong reasons. Contrary to popular belief, high-waisted trousers can flatter every figure. Whether you're pear-shaped like Kim Kardashian, left, or have a more boyish shape like Pixie Lott, right,  the style can work for you . GO CHROMATIC . One of the most simple ways to look chic is by sticking to one colour palette - and the more neutral, the better, notes ELLE magazine. Kim Kardashian is a star who adheres to this - and pulls it off with aplomb. The A-lister loves neutral tones - such as peach and cream - which flatter her Armenian skintone. Other hues to look for when constructing an outfit include nude, grey, navy and black, which are understated yet chic. One of the most simple ways to look chic is by sticking to one colour palette, such as a peach hue like Kim Kardashian, left, and the Duchess of Cambridge, right . BELT IT UP . Accessoring with a belt is both practical and stylish and a simple belt can totally modify your outfit. Wearing your belt around your waist (just below your bust) will create a feminine hourglass silhouette. Use a belt to cinch a chunky knit, a slouchy T-shirt, a billowing blouse, a sundress (a la Gigi Hadid) or even over your coat or blazer for a more tailored look. Another simple and flattering ways to accessorise your outfit is via a nude heel. The miracle worker instantly creates longer, more toned legs and - as the Duchess of Cambridge proves - can pull together any outfit. Kite and Davidson concur. 'Ladies, if you don’t own a pair, this has to be your purchase this season. 'They will make your legs look longer and slimmer, however it's not enough to only think about the shade because you also need to consider the style. The chunkier the shoe, the more likely it is that it will add weight to your leg so we recommend investing in a nude shoe that has enough attitude to reflect your personality but is also elegant enough to be a classic.' Accessoring with a belt is both a practical and stylish way to flatter your figure - just ask Gigi Hadid, left, and style icon Olivia Palermo, right . Another simple and flattering ways to accessorise your outfit is via a nude heel, which, as the Duchess of Cambridge proves, can pull together any outfit . GO LONG . Duster coats and lightweight styles that just graze the floor are perfect for spring dressing. Rihanna, Victoria Beckham, Miranda Kerr and Kim Kardashian are all huge fans of floor-sweeping coats, which help elongate the figure by tricking the eye into seeing a longer, leaner silhouette. Team the garment with  jeans (skinny or boyfriend styles work well) and vertiginous heels. Rihanna is a huge fan of floor-sweeping coats, which help elongate the figure by tricking the eye into seeing a longer, leaner silhouette . DRESS FOR YOUR SHAPE . Whilst all of these styling hacks can work wonders, it's always important to dress for your shape, advises Lydia Jones. 'Everyone has different body shapes, whether it's hourglass or pear-shaped, and it's always important to know what suits your body shape and how to dress yourself to accentuate your best assets. 'For an hourglass figure, accentuating the waistline is great for creating the illusion of a bigger bust and smaller waist. Using a waist belt with a dress is an easy option for this, whilst high-waisted trousers and skirts are also great for highlighting the waist. 'If you're slightly pear shaped, an A-line midi skirt or floaty long length maxi skirt is great for creating a more balanced illusion and also drawing more attention to your top area.' Alicia Kite and business partner and stylist Kay Davidson share their fail safe tips... • Never underestimate what a well-fitting bra can do for your shape. It will lengthen your torso making you appear taller and definitely make you look slimmer too. • The fit of your clothing is crucial to flattering your body shape and enhancing your style. Your clothes should follow your curves to show you are a woman but not be so tight that it leaves nothing to the imagination! • If you wear a looser top, pair with a narrower bottom as this will always make you look slimmer. • Wear a bracelet or a cuff to help elongate and flatter your arms. This will draw the eye away from the top of your arms - an area that most of us girls hate. • Wear a long scarf simply draped and worn loose to disguise any muffins. This tip is especially useful when you sit down.","Victoria Beckham has updated her black wardrobe with a hint of navy .

"Tens of millions of people in China marked the annual 'Tomb Sweeping Festival' this weekend by travelling home to their ancestral villages. Families across the country descended on graveyards to clean their tombs of the deceased and honour their loved ones, burning fake paper money and leaving their favourite food and drink to ensure they are not poor or hungry in the afterlife. As part of the Qingming Festival – which means 'pure brightness' – China celebrates the coming spring and the beauty of nature, says People’s Daily Online. A grand and colourful ceremony was held in honour of the 'Yellow Emperor' Huangdi in Huangling County, Shaanxi Province . Huangdi is considered the ancestor of the Qingming Festival which sees the Chinese mark the start of spring with outdoor celebrations . Lines of dancers take to the stage as part of the celebration, which was watched by thousands of people during the public holiday . Around 1.3 billion Chinese people marked the Qingming Festival, a three-day holiday in China, by watching parades and travelling home . Traditional Chinese dancers wear intricate gowns as they swirl and dance in the sunshine during the celebrations in the city of Huangi . An actor dressed as a soldier takes a break from the celebration to check his phone . In Shaanxi Province, a huge outdoor celebration was held as part of the Qingming Festival and in honour of the 'Yellow Emperor' Huang Di, considered the founding father of the Chinese nation. A bell was rung from the top of the city's temple, while the drums were struck 34 times, one for each of China's provinces including Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The festival falls in the first week of April every year, and is one of the 24 Chinese solar terms - the date from which temperatures rise, rainfall increases and marks an important time for the land to be prepared for the sowing of seeds. Hundreds of visitors filmed the celebrations on their smart phones, as a colourful inflatable dragon dances in the sky. It is said that the Yellow Emperor Huang Di did not die, but instead ascended into heaven on the back of a dragon - making the creature a Chinese symbol . Participants carry platters of fruit as part of the ceremony in the central China, which had hundreds of dancers and performers .

A young performer casts a smile on a guard, as she fixed her hair during the Qingming festival celebrations . Dancers make offerings to the water in a service at the Duijang Dam for Qingming - praying for favourable weather for their crops . Opinion on the origins of the festival differ, but it can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty which ruled China between 618 and 907. While millions of Chinese people made the trip to their ancestral villages, opportunistic traders took advantage of some people's inability to make the visit - advertising 'tomb sweeping packages' which include weeping, praying and cleaning. Depending on the package, costing between 100 yuan and 1,300 yuan, the buyer receives a commemorative photo of the occasion. A record-breaking 36.5 million passenger trips were made over the weekend and public holiday - up 5.8 per cent on last year and an all-time high. The rise is partially due to the construction of new railways in recent years, particularly high-speed railway, say commentators. A couple pray as they burn paper money during Qingming.

"A newly-wed couple were taken on a romantic flight over the Mediterranean which left airline enthusiasts baffled after the passenger jet flew in the shape of two giant hearts shortly after takeoff. The Air Malta jet was tracked by flightradar24.com as it took off the island's international airport as it embarked on the unusual flight. The Airbus A319 flew two circuits around Malta, with final section skirting the Italian coast. The Air Malta passenger jet took the unusual flight path, pictured, to celebrate the wedding of two of its crew . The special flight was to celebrate the marriage one of the airline's pilot to a member of cabin crew. The jet took the happy couple's family and friends on a short sight-seeing tour over the Mediterranean. The arrivals' board at Malta International Airport provided some clues as to the reason behind the unusual flight path with the status 'Just Married' placed beside flight KM 14JC. A spokeswoman for Air Malta told Sky News that the couple were married at the airport earlier that day. She revealed: 'They are both members of staff at Air Malta. 'He is a pilot and she is a member of cabin crew. They were joined on the flight by family, friends and colleagues who had been at the wedding. 'I think it was a very romantic flight. They flew close to Sicily, so they could see Mount Etna through the window.' On social media, some aircraft enthusiasts described the exercise as a 'creative training flight' while Aoife Sherwin tweeted 'Love in the air over Malta!

"Hundreds of tourists had to be evacuated from Warwick Castle after a flaming cannonball set alight to a medieval thatched building during a display. Holidaymakers, many with young children enjoying the last day of the Easter break, had gathered to watch the cannonball be fired from the wooden trebuchet – the largest working siege machine in the world. However, the big display ended in catastrophe when sparks from the fireball ignited the roof of a nearby ancient boathouse, causing it to erupt into flames. The thatched building, which overlooks the River Avon within the castle grounds in Warwickshire, was unoccupied when it became engulfed in fire at about 5.45pm yesterday. Scroll down for video . Holidaymakers watched in horror as  a cannonball fired from a wooden trebuchet – the largest working siege machine in the world - struck a medieval thatched boathouse overlooking the River Avon at Warwick Castle . Witness Heather Taylor, 42, who had travelled from Birmingham with her six-year-old son Ethan to watch the cannonball launch, described the panic as the incident unfolded. She said: 'The trebuchet launched the flaming cannonball but as it flew almost over the boathouse sparks could clearly be seen coming off it and the high winds must have sent them onto the roof of the boathouse. 'There was a lot of panic and people were scrambling up the bank because they had no idea if the fire would spread. 'The place was packed with lots of young children and families. We were all evacuated and it was quite scary. 'It was shocking how fast the fire took hold. 'The cannonball actually appeared to land behind the boat house but it was obviously too close. 'It's such a shame because the boathouse has only just been re-thatched and we watched a chap thatching it before the big show. It's a medieval building so it's a big loss.' The catapult display ended in catastrophe when sparks from the cannonball ignited the roof of the ancient boathouse, causing it to erupt into flames at about 5.45pm. It forced an evacuated at the Warwick attraction . Video footage shows the medieval boathouse engulfed in flames after the flaming cannonball apparently set it alight yesterday afternoon. Warwick Castle said the attraction remains open today despite the incident . The thatched boathouse, which overlooks the River Avon within the castle grounds in Warwickshire (pictured above before the blaze), was unoccupied at the time and has now been completely destroyed by the flames . Up to 30 firefighters attended the incident and fire chiefs confirmed no one was injured by the blaze. The main castle was also unaffected by the fire. A Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'We received a call at 5.47pm to a fire at the boathouse in the grounds of Warwick Castle. 'Three appliances were sent to the fire.' The historic boathouse, which was completely destroyed as a result of the fire, dates back to 1896. The 5th Earl, Frances Greville, had it built to house an electric boat which he powered by batteries charged from the electricity generated by the castle's mill. The trebuchet which fired the flaming cannonball stands 60ft high and weighs 22 tonnes. A flaming cannonball was launched from this wooden trebuchet, which stands 60ft high and weighs 22 tonnes, during a demonstration to show how the machine was used to hurl huge projectiles to breach the castle walls . The fire forced hundreds of tourists to be evacuated from Warwick Castle (above) at about 5.45pm yesterday . Warwick Castle confirmed the incident and said the attraction remains open and unaffected. A spokesman said: 'We did experience a fire in our boathouse yesterday which was safely extinguished within a short time. 'The island where the boathouse is located was not open to the public at the time and no-one was ever at any risk; nor did it affect any other part of the castle. 'We'd like to take this opportunity to thank Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service for their prompt assistance. 'Despite speculation we have not yet ascertained the cause of the fire. A full investigation is underway. 'The castle will be fully open today featuring our spectacular Easter events programme.' The trebuchet, which is 60ft tall and weighs 22 tonnes, was used to hurl projectiles at the castle . The wooden trebuchet is the largest working siege machine in the world and is effectively a colossal catapult. It is a recreation of one of the biggest and most deadly military machines of all times, which was used as a weapon for protection. The trebuchet, which stands 60ft high and weighs 22 tonnes, was used to hurl huge projectiles to breach the castle walls. Large rocks and stones were the main ammunition but there is evidence of more unusual material used such as large flaming cannonballs. Manure and dead animals were also hurled by the machine into the besieged castle to spread disease, with pigs among the top choice of animals to be fired. The trebuchet at Warwick Castle is an authentic recreation by Dr Peter Vemming, from The Mediaeval Centre in Nykobing, Denmark. Notes and drawings from the 13th century were used as the starting point for the reconstruction and were often referred to during the process of developing the working replica of the powerful machine. The trebuchet, which was built at a workshop in Wiltshire, is made primarily of oak with the long throwing arm made of ash and metal fixings holding it together. - Warwick Castle .","Holidaymakers watched in horror as ancient boathouse erupted into flames .

"Puren - who has died aged 96 - was the youngest brother of the final Qing monarch Puyi (above), who ruled for four years until 1912 . The brother of China's last emperor who was pushed off the throne more than 100 years ago has died. Puren was the youngest brother of the final Qing monarch Puyi, who ruled for four years until 1912. The 96-year-old died on Friday after being taken to hospital with pneumonia in February, his family said. He had been suffering from poor health and memory loss in recent years. One of his sons told The Legal Evening News that Puren - who took the Chinese name Jin Youzhi - was 'almost deaf'. 'He even couldn't hold a pen... he couldn't recognise people,' the son added. Puyi became emperor in 1908 when he was two years and ten months old. His abdication ended the rule of the Qing dynasty, which began in 1644. After the government took power in 1912 Puyi and his close family were forced to live within the walls of the Forbidden City, where they retained imperial traditions and were tended to by eunuchs. They were expelled from the palace complex in 1917. Puren established a primary school with the help of his father in the 1940s and continued to teach until he retired in the late 1960s. He reportedly had three sons and two daughters. The Communist party which took power in 1949 also reportedly gave him a place on the local Beijing branch of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a mostly symbolic body. A memorial for Puren will be held at the Babaoshan Cemetery in Beijing. The former emperor is pictured (right) with their father and younger brother in front of a beautiful picture .","Puren was the youngest brother of Puyi, who ruled from 1908 to 1912 .

Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge has revealed that Prince George went looking for his father in the cupboards after being told he was 'in China' Gordon, who owns Naples Luxury Travel Advisors in Naples, told news-press.com: 'I asked her if Prince George was excited about the new Prince or Princess that was coming and she said yes and that he is a toddler and is talking and walking. 'Then she told me that his daddy was visiting China. After hearing this he went to the china cabinet, opened it and proclaimed ""daddy is not here."" 'She said they would work on his geography.' Kate made the adorable revelation during a party to celebrate the 105th birthday of the Goring Hotel in London, the luxury hotel she stayed in the night before her wedding to William in 2011. The Duchess of Cambridge's lunchtime event at the hotel was not part of her official schedule and, according to Kensington Palace, the 33-year-old was attending in a private capacity, having received a personal invitation from the hotel . Prince William had left pregnant Kate and son George in London while he undertook a week-long tour of the Far East. His visit to China was one of the most high-profile – and diplomatically sensitive – tours of his fledgling royal career. With China on course to overtake the United States as the world's largest economy, the UK government is keen to foster positive diplomatic relationships - and William's visit was seen as a key part of those efforts. Stepping foot for the first time on Chinese soil, the second in line to the throne became the most senior member of the Royal family to visit the country since the Queen nearly 30 years ago. The Duke, pictured with Chinese deputy president Li Yuanchao, was asked to pass on an invitation to visit to the Queen.

Meanwhile in London the Duchess of Cambridge's lunchtime event at the hotel was not part of her official schedule and, according to Kensington Palace, the 33-year-old was attending in a private capacity, having received a personal invitation from the hotel. Kate obviously has fond memories of the property situated opposite Buckingham Palace after spending her last night as a single woman and non-Royal there with her parents and siblings Pippa, 31 and James, 27. She also visited the hotel last December for a meeting of the board of the 1851 Trust, the sailing charity of which she is patron.

"The widow of a cardiac surgeon shot dead at a Boston hospital by his patient's son has given birth to their fourth child, a baby girl, less than three months after the doctor's slaying. Brigham and Women's Hospital announced Monday that Mikaela Jane Davidson was born April 4. Mikaela's father, Dr. Michael Davidson, was killed at the hospital January 20, leaving behind his wife, Dr. Terri Halperin, daughters Kate, 10, Live, 8, and their 2-year-old son, Graham. Scroll down for video . New life: Mikaela Jane Davidson was welcomed into the world April 4, less than three months after her father, Boston heart surgeon Dr Michael Davidson, was shot dead by a deceased patient's son . Heartbroken: Dr. Terri Halperin (left), a mother of fourth, said in a statement her late husband, Dr Michael Davidson (right), was looking forward to meeting his new baby daughter . 'Michael was very much looking forward to the birth of this beautiful baby girl,' Halperin said in a statement released through the hospital. 'At a time when my children and I are completely heartbroken over the loss of Michael, we are finding joy in Mikaela's arrival.' The hospital said the mother and baby Mikaela, who was named after her father, were both doing well. A beloved surgeon who was targeted and fatally shot by gunman at a Boston hospital on Tuesday was expecting his fourth child with his wife, who is seven months pregnant, it has emerged. Dr Davidson, 44, from Wellesley, Massachusetts, was shot by Stephen Pasceri, 55, on the morning of January 20 and passed away late that evening. Pasceri's relatives suggested that he was angry over the death of his mother, whom Dr Davidson had treated. Vendetta: Accountant Stephen Pasceri (left and right) opened fire on Davidson at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital January 20. The doctor died and Pasceri, a father of four, took his own life after the shooting . 'You all should be absolutely assured that Michael Davidson was one of the kindest, best possible men that ever walked on this earth,' colleague Dr. Andrew Eisenhauer said at the time, ABC News reported. 'We knew that and his patients knew that and his family knows that.' The gunman, an accountant and married father-of-four, had walked into the heart center and asked for Dr Davidson, before shooting him twice and taking his own life in a separate room. In the days after the tragedy, Davidson's father-in-law told the Boston Herald how the doctor had yelled for patients and staff to flee before he was shot. 'He was a hero - he told everybody to get out,' he said. 'He started yelling, ""Get out. Get out."" He knew it was coming.' He recalled how much he cared for his patients, and added: 'He loved his family. He loved his kids. He loved my daughter to death.' A fund has been set up for the family here. Left behind: Davidson and his wife Terri, pictured, have two daughters, seven and nine, and a son, two. She was seven months pregnant with their fourth child at the time of the shooting . Mourning: Brigham and Women's Hospital doctors, from the left, Charles Morris, Andrew Eisenhauer, Daniel Wiener and Pinak Shah appear emotional as they face members of the media to speak about Davidson . Pasceri's family have said they can't understand why he snapped, but they believe he could have been wanting to enact revenge on Dr. Davidson after his mother, Marguerite, died last fall. Davidson had treated Marguerite Pasceri for a cardiovascular condition during her stay at Brigham and Women's last year. She died on November 15, 2014. Pasceri, who was licensed to carry a firearm, may have also been holding a vendetta because of the health care his father Greg received during a fatal hear attack in December 2011. The Worcester Telegram reported that in 2012, Pasceri became so furious that his mother had been left with a $8,000 medical bill, he wrote to Senator John Kerry and US Rep. James McGovern to demand an investigation. However, the newspaper noted that the Pasceri family had no issue with the level of care received by their father at Massachusetts General Hospital. Pasceri's sister said she was stunned that her brother had attacked the doctor. Blame game: Marguerite E. (Olofson) Pasceri passed away on November 15, 2014 and it is thought that her son and executor, Stephen Pasceri blamed Dr. Davidson at Brigham and Women's Hospital for her passing . Heartbroken: Administrators and staff at a leading Boston hospital are mourning the death of a cardiac surgeon who was fatally shot at the hospital by a man who then killed himself . Sadness: The hospital's logo flag was lowered to half-staff during a Wednesday ceremony to honor Davidson . 'Everything seemed to be going really well. I have no idea why he snapped like this,' said Marguerite Jolym, according to the Boston Herald. According to Joly, her brother 'deeply loved' his mother and said her 'warm, compassionate, generous and understanding personality was a gift and example to the world'. 'I think it comes down to the fact that my brother thought it was the doctor's fault that my mother died,' Joly said. 'I don't know why my brother would blame him. I really don't know why.' According to the Boston Herald, Pasceri worked as an accountant for Waters Corp, which is based in Milford. Marguerite Joly said her brother served in the military for a time and was honorably discharged and was a married father of four. 'We can't even wrap our brains around this,' she said. 'There was no indication whatsoever that he would ever do anything like this... All his ducks were in a row,' she said. 'This was not a bad, evil man. Something happened, and I don't know what.' Response: Boston Police Superintendent-in-Chief William Gross, (center left), walks through a revolving door as he departs the Shapiro building at Brigham and Women's Hospital on Tuesday after the shooting . Evacuation: Medical personnel walk past law enforcement officials, (right), as they depart the Shapiro building after the cardiologist was shot . Multiple agencies: The FBI, Boston Police Department and the ATF all arrived at the hospital after the incident on Tuesday morning . Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said officers conducting a room-by-room search found the gunman dead in an exam room with the weapon. Shortly after the shooting, one witness said that the Shapiro building had been placed on lockdown and dozens of emergency vehicles had arrived on the scene. 'Once we were clear of the waiting room, there were police officers with their weapons drawn yelling, 'Get down! Get down,'' said one man to WCVB. Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said he was 'deeply saddened' by Davidson's death. 'This tragedy is the result of a senseless act of violence that has no place in our City,' he said in a statement a day after the shooting. Hospital employees are well-drilled for the nightmare scenario of a shooter inside the building. In November 2013, doctors and nurses and other staff at the world-famous institution underwent training for an active shooter situation and viewed a video for a so-called 'Code Silver' event.","Dr. Michael Davidson was shot dead by Stephen Pasceri at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston in January .

"A Labour frontbencher has expressed regret that the party cannot ‘get rid’ of the Trident nuclear deterrent. Shadow Welsh secretary Owen Smith said at a hustings event on Wednesday: ‘We view the world as being a very dangerous and volatile place at the moment. So our policy is that we will retain Trident, we will maintain a continuous at-sea deterrent.’ But he added: ‘So we will pursue an independent perspective, the next Labour government, but on the issue of Trident: would but we could get rid of it but I fear that we can’t.’ Shadow Welsh secretary Owen Smith has expressed regret that the party cannot ‘get rid’ of the Trident nuclear deterrent . Around three quarters of Labour candidates back scrapping Trident, which preserves a round-the-clock protection at sea in case of a nuclear strike. But the party has committed to maintaining the deterrent, which will need to be replaced in the coming years, in its election manifesto. The Tories have warned that Labour could ‘sell out’ Britain in a deal with the SNP which wants to scrap Trident. Replacing the deterrent with a ‘like for like’ system would cost around £100bn. Replacing the trident deterrent with a ‘like for like’ system would cost around £100bn (file picture) Last month a survey found three quarters of Labour’s candidates are opposed to renewing Trident. Yesterday shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said: ‘Let me be absolutely clear: we are committed to the renewal of Trident. 'We are committed to the retention of a Continuous At-Sea Deterrent and we will follow the advice of experts in terms of delivering that, who say current technology means four boats.’ A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘As Owen’s comments make abundantly clear, he supports Labour’s policy of renewing Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent as a continuous at-sea system.’","Shadow Welsh secretary Owen Smith made comments at a hustings event .

"Labour has moved two points clear of the Tories – despite just one in three voters thinking Ed Miliband is 'capable'. Mr Miliband's party has jumped to 35 per cent, up one point from last month. The Tories meanwhile remain stuck on 33 per cent, according to the pollsters Ipsos MORI. Despite Labour's growing lead ahead with just 21 days to go until polling day, Mr Miliband's poll ratings remain dire. Mr Miliband's party has jumped to 35 per cent, up one point from last month. The Tories meanwhile remain stuck on 33 per cent, according to the pollsters Ipsos MORI . Only a third of the public see the Labour leader as a 'capable leader' while just a quarter think he would be 'good in a crisis', according to the poll for the Evening Standard. David Cameron is seen as a better leader and is also ahead for having 'a clear vision' for the country. But almost two-thirds of the public say the PM isn't in touch with their lives, while 75 per cent think he favours some sections of society more than others. Mr Farage has suffered another dip in his ratings, which are now almost as bad as Nick Clegg's. Some 56 per cent are dissatisfied with him, which is his highest yet. The survey by Ipsos MORI also reveals that Ukip has fallen three points and is now languishing on just 10 per cent – only two points ahead of the Greens. The poll comes ahead of tonight's crunch 'Challengers' debate in which Mr Miliband squares up against four other party leaders – but not Nick Clegg or the Prime Minister. In other headline results from the state-of-play survey, Natalie Bennett's Green Party has recovered support since her infamous 'brain fade' gaffe on live radio, putting on two points to eight per cent. The Greens have pushed Clegg's Liberal Democrats into a humiliating fifth place, down one point to seven.

The Liberal Democrats are fourth on 7.9 per cent and the Greens are fifth on 5.4 per cent. The poll of polls is calculated using a rolling average of every nationwide poll published in the last seven days. Its figures suggest that, three weeks out from the election, the country is heading for another hung parliament, with no party likely to win the 326 seats needed to form a majority in the House of Commons. This is backed up by the latest projections of the election result. An average of current forecasts by The Guardian, the New Statesman and ElectionForecast.co.uk gives the Conservatives a one-seat lead over Labour, with the Tories winning 274 MPs and Labour 273.","Labour has jumped to 35% in the polls, up one point from last month .
