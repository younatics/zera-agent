"The Tesla Model S P85D's 'insane mode' may be fast, but a new electric car by Drive eO is set to be even faster. The Latvian firm is currently developing a one megawatt electric race car to compete in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in June. The stomach-churning vehicle, dubbed eO PP03, runs on 50 kWh lithium-ion battery pack driving six YASA-400 electric motors. Latvia-based Drive eO has created a vehicle, named eO PP03, which runs on 50 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that drives six YASA-400 electric motors and produces 1020 kW (1368 horsepower) It is capable of producing 1020 kW (1368 horsepower) and speeds of up to 160 mph (260 km/h), compared to the top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h) on the Model S. Drive eO says it will be the 'first one megawatt all-electric race car with peak torque of 2160 Nm and kerb weight is targeted at 2646lb (1,200kg). The car is still in development and the company has yet to reveal its range. 'We want to become the first overall winner with an electric vehicle,' said Kristaps Dambis, project director at Drive eO. Drive eO was the first to enter and complete the Dakar Rally with a hybrid electric vehicle. That was followed by the creation of eO PP01, a purpose built fully electric prototype race car to participate at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb competition. The one megawatt electric race car is set to compete in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb (pictured) in Colorado Springs. The race is the second oldest motor racing event in the US and runs on a challenging 12.42 mile (20km) course with 156 turns in Colorado Springs. All wheel drive .

It begins at 2,862 metre elevation (9,390 feet) and finishes at the 4,301 metre (14,110 feet) summit of the Pikes Peak mountain in Colorado Springs. The announcement of the Drive eO PP03 following the development of software upgrades to make the P85D even faster. 'Tesla P85D 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~0.1 sec soon via over-the-air software update to inverter algorithm,' Tesla founder Elon Musk tweeted earlier this year. Musk was referring to something known as the 'insane mode' which allows the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 in a little over three seconds. The D model, unveiled in October has two motors - one powering the front wheels and one powering the rear wheels. It has a top speed of 155 mph (249 km/h), compared with the current 130 mph (209 km/h) on Tesla's previous S model. In Insane Mode, the full 691 horsepower of the electric car's two motors is applied in one go. At the launch event, Mr Musk said the car reaches 60mph in three seconds from a standstill. During recent tests of the Insane acceleration, also carried out by DragTimes, the car achieved the speed in 3.17 seconds .","eO PP03 runs on 50 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that drives six motors .

"Zoe Hadley, also known as Zoe Hommel, who hanged herself in a hotel room after suffering a mystery illness . The teenage daughter of a leading solicitor hanged herself in a hotel room after years of suffering a mystery illness that left her unable to eat, walk or open her eyes for long periods, an inquest has heard. Zoe Hadley, 19, also known as Zoe Hommel, had been battling an undiagnosed illness since the age of 13 and was found dead at a hotel in Putney, south west London last year. An inquest at Westminster Coroners Court heard how her parents, solicitor Lisa Hommel and her GP father Laurence, struggled to treat her condition. The inquest heard how doctors could find no physical cause for her illness and that the teenager refused to accept she had mental health problems. She insisted on having a series of operations, including the removal of her healthy appendix and accused her father of conspiring to fake an operation to make her believe she'd had a surgery for a prolapse. The inquest also heard that Miss Hadley suffered from psychosis but hid the condition from doctors, making them think she was not a suicide risk. After her death, notes she had written saying she was 'tormented by voices' indicating she might have been suffering from schizophrenia, the hearing was told. A statement read to the hearing on behalf of her father, Dr Hommel, described how he and his wife fought to cope with their daughter’s illness and their vain attempts to help her. He said: 'She was a beautiful, intelligent, loving daughter. 'Up until the age of 13 she excelled at school. In 2009 she started to suffer terrible headaches and no physical causes were found. 'She was not eating, drinking or opening her eyes. It took her three months of treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital to open her eyes and look at us, four months to eat solid food, six months before she could get into a wheelchair. The cause of the illness was never found.' He said she recovered quickly and was 'so determined' to catch up with her friends after missing nine months of school she did a year’s work in just one month, later coming top of her class. However, she relapsed in April 2011 and became convinced she could not use her legs. Her parents tended to her while trying to convince her she was perfectly fit. Dr Hommel added: 'From the age of 16 she started to go to the doctors to seek diagnoses for a neurological disease she believed she suffered from and seek a cure for her paralysis. 'In September 2011 she cut off all her school friends and never spoke to them again.' During that time she was bedbound for 18 months in hospital, but decided one day she was better and started getting involved as an actress and planning to go to America to finish her studies, the inquest heard. When she was 18 she had her appendix removed without telling her parents. In May 2014, after going under anaesthetic for an 'unnecessary operation' she began to hear voices. She also suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and spent three to four hours a day washing herself and her possessions, leaving her skin raw and bleeding. At one point she was admitted to hospital after her body mass index dropped to 15, the inquest heard. The inquest heard that Miss Hadley, pictured, suffered from psychosis but hid the condition from doctors, making them think she was not a suicide risk . She was treated at the Priory clinic for OCD, but was released because she refused food and doctors feared she would starve herself to death unless she was allowed to return home and be treated there. Her father explained: 'We sought expert psychiatric help for her which she rejected. 'She became increasingly psychotic, the voices returned with intensity. She never accepted help. It was unintelligible to her that her illnesses were not physical. We hope she is finally at peace and her soul is in a better place.' Jonathan Bindman, who worked at Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust, took charge of Miss Hadley’s treatment after she was released from The Priory in October 2014. He diagnosed her with somatoform disorder, an anxiety-related condition whose sufferers feel real pain that can’t be medically explained. However, he said that had she revealed the extent of her psychosis he would have diagnosed her with schizophrenia and given her the treatment she needed. He added: 'Zoe was not prepared to cooperate. Westminster Coroner's Court, pictured, heard how Miss Hadley was an intelligent and gifted young woman until showing signs of mental illness . 'She experienced delusions around the issue her father and a surgeon had faked an operation and was conspiring against her.' Detective Constable William Hanlan, who carried out the investigation into her death, said she checked into the MK Hotel in Putney on the morning of January 26 last year. The next day her body was found by a cleaner. Recording a verdict of suicide, Westminster Coroner Fiona Wilcox said: 'She was an intelligent, gifted young woman, who until the age of 13 was normal but very clever. 'From 2009 she began to show signs of a serious mental illness. Her symptoms were persistent ideas she suffered from some illness that was undiagnosed by doctors. 'She was very intelligent and used her intelligence at times to share with those around her as much as she wanted them to know and did so successfully. 'Her illness was incredibly disabling and completely affected every aspect of her life. 'She was suffering from a psychotic illness which impacted on her decision to take her own life. Maybe she intended to take her own life to escape from the illness or she took her own life suffering under a delusion. I don’t know. 'Her parents, clearly for many years, did everything possible for their daughter who was very clearly troubled and unwell.'","Zoe Hadley, 19, was found dead in a hotel in Putney, south west London .

"An MS sufferer who died in an alleged assisted suicide left a recording of her nightmare life and frustration with not being able to travel to Switzerland to die, a court has heard. Bernadette Forde was found dead in a wheelchair in the sitting room of her home in Dublin on June 6, 2011, with a dictaphone which had recorded her 'suicide note'. In the first trial of its kind in Ireland, the carer of the 51-year-old, Gail O'Rorke, has been charged with helping her to kill herself. Gail O'Rorke, pictured centre, has pleaded not guilty to helping Bernadette Forde commit suicide in June 2011. She was found dead in her wheelchair with a recorded 'suicide note' saying she couldn't live anymore . The jury sitting at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court (pictured) were played the tape recorded by Ms Forde, aged 51, who said: 'I just can't live with his anymore. It's just my life is s**t... everything is just a nightmare' The 43-year-old taxi driver pleaded not guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to three charges. On Wednesday the recording left by Ms Forde, from Donnybrook, was played to the jury and heard he say her plan to die was 'me, totally me, and nobody else'. 'I knew what I wanted to do. I just can't live with this anymore. It's just my life is s**t,' she said. 'I just can't keep going on with everything ... everything is just a nightmare.' O'Rorke, who started working for Ms Forde as a cleaner before becoming her carer, is accusing of making arrangements for the wheelchair-bound woman to travel to Zurich in Switzerland, and also helping her to buy and administer a toxic substance between April and June 2011. She is also alleged to have helped Ms Forde plan her funeral. The court heard a letter had been sent by Dignitas general secretary Ludwig A Minelli which gave Ms Forde the 'provisional green light' to attend the clinic in Zurich. It was also revealed that gardai were alerted to Ms Forde's plans to travel to Switzerland by a travel agent in Rathgar, south Dublin. O'Rorke (pictured) was a cleaner and carer for Ms Forde. It is alleged that she helped the MS sufferer buy a 'toxic' substance over the internet so she could kill herself. O'Rorke was in Kilkenny the night Ms Forde died . Ireland decriminalised suicide in 1993 but the jury was told assisting a suicide remains an offence. The trial heard Ms Forde was confined to a wheelchair in 2008 after suffering substantial injuries in a car accident in the car park of department store Brown Thomas in Dublin. She spent four months in St James' Hospital and underwent three liver operations and had both her knees shattered after leg spasms forced her foot on to the accelerator of her car causing the crash. Ms Forde told how she could not use a specially ordered bed, she could not raise her legs on to a mattress, she was losing the ability to write and even medical appointments were becoming too difficult. O'Rorke did her hair, her shopping and hitched Ms Forde's dresses up to allow her to go to the toilet while sitting. Ms Forde was given the provisional green light to go to the Dignitas Clinic in Zurich, Switzerland (pictured) for an assisted suicide, but her travel agent tipped off the police before she was able to make the journey . In a recording played to the court, Ms Forde said she used a dictaphone to record her final words because her ability to write had deteriorated, and had sourced the drugs she used to kill herself over the internet . The dictaphone recording revealed her hopes of a death in Dignitas had been dashed and how she had been unaware assisting her to travel could be illegal. 'After the Dignitas experience I realised that I had to do whatever I did on my own that I can't even talk to someone in case they are implicated,' Ms Forde said. 'I have no help now at all. It's very difficult. I can't even talk to someone now.' Ms Forde said she saw information about Exit International, which advocates the legalisation of euthanasia, while watching the Late, Late Show on Irish television. The court heard allegations that O'Rorke (pictured) helped Ms Forde commit suicide by helping her buy the drug that killed her. She denies all the charges . She said she had sourced drugs for her death online. 'It's just so difficult that, you know, I just can't do any of this again or any more,' she said. 'Hiding it from friends has been difficult. It's just so unfair that you can't come in contact with anyone that I have to be totally alone. No-one, that's just it.' Ms Forde said a suicide note might not be possible because her writing had deteriorated. 'That's why I'm using this, I hope that it will make my wishes, my intention clear to anyone who wants to question it afterward because it's me and totally me and nobody else,' she said. 'I suppose I'm just very frustrated that it has to be this way - why it's like that in Ireland, why I can't get to Dignitas where it could all have been done.' Ms Forde is heard apologising a number of times and insisting that she did not want anyone to get into trouble in connection with her death. She added: 'It should not be a question mark because it's what I wanted and what else can I do. 'I'm sorry again but it's just ... I don't know ... I have to say, this bloody country.' The trial is expected to last about two weeks. Remy Farrell, senior counsel for the Irish State, said that the death of Ms Forde's sister from cancer in 2010 acted as a catalyst for her to consider euthanasia. He told the jury she had bought a 'toxic substance' over the internet, and alleged that O'Rorke was instrumental in obtaining the drug, making payment and that she was in the house with Ms Forde when the package was delivered. O'Rorke was on a hotel break in Kilkenny on the night of the death. Mr Farrell ended his opening statement to the jury by advising them that the trial was not a forum to debate the controversial subject of assisted suicide. The trial continues.

"Kate Winslet was a vision in blue at a London film premiere this week. Her stunning body-con dress (top) had clearly been made to measure by Stella McCartney. But my, what big feet — and big leopard-print stilettos — she has! At 5 ft 7 in, the 39-year-old Oscar-winner is certainly no towering Amazon, but nonetheless she commands an out-of-the-ordinary UK size-nine shoe. Kate is endearingly frank on the subject, telling interviewers that Titanic co-star Leonardo DiCaprio found the size of her feet hilarious: ‘I’d put my foot up and he’d fall about laughing because my feet are exactly the same size as his and he’s 6 ft 1 in. He’d refer to them as my canoes!’ The average shoe size in the UK has risen from a dainty 4½ in 1900 to a roomy six today. But fascinatingly, just like Kate, lots of stars from Elle Macpherson to Gwyneth Paltrow all have surprisingly huge feet, as we reveal here. Titanic feet: At 5ft 7in, the 39-year-old Oscar-winning actress, who loves a strappy stiletto, wears a roomy size-nine shoe . Bigfoot: Kate Winslet has revealed that her co-star Leonardo DiCaprio referred to her feet as 'my canoes' Jerry Hall Size: 8 (US 10) Elle Macpherson Size: 9.5 (US: 12) Katie Holmes Size: 8 (US: 11) The tall Texan, 58, is famous for her long legs and hanging onto Mick Jagger for 21 years. She said: ‘I have big feet, and they keep you firmly on the ground.’ The Aussie supermodel, 51, is also a canny businesswoman. She markets her own brand of foot spa — perfect for feet of all sizes, not just Elle’s sizeable twelves. Even at 5 ft 9in, Katie towered over her pint-sized former husband, Tom Cruise. The 36-year-old actress does have large feet for her height - size 8. Scarlett Johansson Size: 7 (US: 9.5) Sandra Bullock Size: 7.5 (US: 10) Gwyneth Paltrow Size: 8 (US: 11) She’s only 5 ft 3 in, but Scarlett, 30, has feet  larger than the average woman. The star admitted: ‘I like my feet — I think they’re cute.’ America’s sweetheart, 50, hasn’t confirmed her shoe size, but is said to wear 7.5 despite being only 5 ft 6 in. They certainly look big — and match her large hands. Gwynnie, 42, is known for her love of toweringly high heels — Michael Kors, Brian Atwood and Giuseppe Zanotti. Her size eights  seem large on her 5 ft 7 inframe. Angelina Jolie Size: 6.5 (US: 9) Uma Thurman Size: 8 (US: 11) Cate Blanchett Size: 6 (US: 9) Her size nines were derided as ‘weird’ and ‘gigantic’ after Jolie, 39, appeared barefoot in a Louis Vuitton campaign. At 5 ft 7in, her tiny figure emphasises her shoe size. Uma, 44, is a modest 5 ft 11in. She says: ‘I’ve always felt too tall, with big feet.’ Quentin Tarantino disagreed, and insisted on close-ups of her size eight feet in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. At 5 ft 9 in, Cate, 45, struggles to walk in her shoes at times — shedding her Givenchys at a press conference, revealing bunions and red, pinched toes.","Kate Winslet wears size nine shoes and her Titanic co-star Leonardo DiCaprio found the size of her shoes hilarious .

"When Leanne Bourne, a mother-of-four from Romford in Essex, began to suspect that her partner Steve  was having an affair, she was heartbroken. But in a twist that she could never have foreseen, the other woman turned out to be her younger sister Larissa Knipe. Now, three years after the affair that tore her family apart, Ms Bourne says she is still struggling to come to terms with what happens - and still has bad days when she can't stop crying. Scroll down for video . Family feud: Larissa Knipe (left) is pictured with her son Logun and sister Leanne Bourne (right) 'I was very protective of Larissa because she was my baby sister,' she says of her happy upbringing. 'She wasn't just my sister. She was like a best friend and I'd do anything for her.' But all that changed when Larissa, who is seven years younger than Ms Bourne, moved into her home when she was 17. Although Larissa says there was nothing between her and Steve to begin with, a night out when she was 20 resulted in a liaison with her sister's partner - and the start of an affair. 'I was 20 when it first started with Steve,' she confesses. 'I went out one night, had a few too many drinks, came back, saw him and we started kissing. It started like that. 'The next morning, I woke up and thought, ""What have you done?"" I don't know why I carried it on to be honest but I did. After the first few months, I did start getting feelings and began falling for him.' Upset: Leanne Bourne appeared on ITV's This Morning to tell her story . Rapprochement: Larissa is finally winning back her sister after more than three years in the cold . Caught in the middle: Sarah Guyton was caught in the centre of the increasingly acrimonious dispute . Noticing that the pair were spending increasing amounts of time together, Ms Bourne became suspicious but, believing that her sister would do nothing to hurt her, stayed quiet. 'I mentioned it to a couple of friends, to a couple of work colleagues,' she remembers. 'One or two of my friends actually said, ""What you're thinking, it's probably feasible"". 'Everybody else, including my mum, said, ""What are you thinking? That's your sister. She loves you. She would never do that to you"".' Then, a few months later, Larissa revealed she was pregnant and claimed not to know who the father was. 'Larissa had never really had a boyfriend. If she had, I'd never met any. Then one day I came home from work and she said she was pregnant,' Ms Bourne recalls. But she was left even more suspicious by her sister and Mr Allsop's reaction. 'Larissa and Steve were both over the moon about it, really happy,' she says. 'I was quite concerned. I really felt like I was going crazy, like I was losing it. I was having a battle in my own mind.' Putting her fears to one side, she supported her sister and was there when Larissa gave birth to her son Logun in August 2011. Speaking on ITV's This Morning, Ms Bourne says she was convinced that her sister was the other woman the moment she saw the newborn. Shock: Leanne also spoke of the moment that she realised her sister's baby had been fathered by her partner . 'I had suspicions anyway but as soon as I saw the baby, I knew because not only did it look like Steve, it look like my children when they were babies. It was just too much for coincidence. 'I had to run out of the room. I saw a friend straight after and I said, ""That baby is Steve's"". Larissa, who moved out into a council flat of her own shortly afterwards, continued to deny all talk of an affair. But then, consumed with guilt, she finally confessed the truth to their mother Sarah Guyton in a text message that read: 'Well what's she going to do when she finds out Logun is Steve's? I can't hide it any more.' 'I answered the phone and my mum's in a panic,' remembers Ms Bourne. 'She was actually crying, so I said, ""Calm down mum, what's happened?"" 'And she said, ""I'm sorry to tell you but what you've been worrying about is true"".' Ms Bourne was, she says, left 'utterly devastated' by the news and furious that despite repeated questioning, both Larissa and Steve had point-blank denied having an affair. Then, a few days after the bombshell hit, Steve moved out of Ms Bourne's home and in with her sister. 'It was a nightmare,' remembers Ms Bourne. 'I did send her some nasty text messages. I called her every name under the sun. I think most people in my position would have.' Larissa responded angrily and more than three years on, the sisters are still estranged and struggling to come to terms with what happened. 'It's still heartbreaking really,' adds Ms Bourne. 'To think we were really close and that's all gone. It's vanished. It's non existent now.'","Leanne Bourne, from Essex, discovered her partner was having an affair .

"Following heavy defeats at Tikrit in Iraq and the appalling costly siege of Kobane, Islamic State have launched their own  social media rules to censor coverage on its recent defeats. The image of the rules began to circulate on social media, two weeks after Islamic State was forced to abandon the Iraqi city of Tikrit. With ISIS propaganda team releasing endless sets of dull publicity photos from life inside Iraq and Syria, the senior commanders appear keen to eradicate any hint of problems within the group's territory. The media crackdown appears to be an attempt by ISIS senior commanders to eradicate any knowledge of the extremist group's defeats or internal problems. Some ISIS supporters on social media appear to be exasperated by the apparent leaking of information and discussions of the defeat at Tikrit. Specific details like the manufacturing of new weapons and any pictures of ISIS fighters, have been deemed by ISIS as a breach of online security. Perhaps the strangest and most unclear rule reads: 'The stupendous spread of Mujahideen along a specific locations' It appears unknown what the extremist group meant by 'the stupendous spread of mujahideen.' Whilst it remains unknown how Islamic State will manage to enforce these rules, the jihadi group has previously struggled to keep any control of its fighters and supporters on social media. One exasperated ISIS supporter wrote: 'Brothers, please stop posting news about anything in Tirkit or Ramadi walla. You are doing more harm to the mujahideen than good. Fear Allah.' Some of the rules, particularly regarding the publishing information on the location of fighters and the use of tactics, appears to come after a series of calamitous social media errors by some fighters. Islamic State fighter Mark Taylor, originally from New Zealand, shot to fame after accidentally tweeting his location whilst fighting in Syria. Taylor forgot to turn off the geo-locator setting on his account, allowing intelligence services to successfully track his every movement. He even managed to give away where he was living in al-Tabaqah, south west Raqqa. Known as Ali Al-Farsi, 19-year-old Ali Kalantar's death was first tweeted by Halane, under the nom de guerre, Umm Jafar al-Britaniyah. British terror twin Zahra Halane (left) and Kiwi fighter Mark Taylor (right), have both been criticised by ISIS supporters for giving away information on fighters and locations. Islamic State commander fear that with the deadly coalition air strikes decimating their ranks, such lapses in security is proving costly. In particular female jihadis have been criticized by fellow ISIS supporters for their loose lipped attitude on social media. One of the British terror twins, Zahra Halane, has previously broken the rules by announcing the death of her husband on social media. Known as Ali Al-Farsi, 19-year-old Ali Kalantar's death was first tweeted by Halane, under the nom de guerre, Umm Jafar al-Britaniyah. Halane quickly deleted the tweets but not before a screenshot had sent them viral. Islamic State propaganda remains highly important to their strategy for recruitment and legitimacy. ISIS media continue to churn out endless propaganda photos from inside ISIS territory. Islamic State fighters have recently made worrying gains near the Iraqi city of Ramadi, Anbar province. Shiite paramilitary groups and other reinforcements are reportedly heading to Ramadi to provide support against the ISIS threat. New propaganda photos from Anbar province claim that ISIS were warmly welcomed as they entered a nearby town near Ramadi. Islamic State continue to launch new offensives, targeting the strategic Iraqi oil fields at Baiji and the city of Ramadi in Anbar province. Islamic State continue to launch new offensives, targeting the strategic Iraqi oil fields at Baiji and the city of Ramadi in Anbar province. Using suicide bombers to destroy the surrounding fence, Islamic State fighters have been managed to fight their way inside the oil field compound in Salahuddin province. Parts of the oil fields have frequently changed hands between the Iraqi army and militants from Islamic State. Due to its remote desert location, it has proved to be a difficult base to maintain. Newly published photos and a brief video shows dozens of ISIS fighters celebrating inside the oil field's facilities. It remains unknown how long they will manage to hold out before the Baghdad forces re-take it.

"A beautiful sunny evening and I am having a drink in the garden with friends. All is right with the world, apart from one thing — my head is itching horribly. Without thinking, I scratch behind my ear, then near the crown, before my fingers move to my neck — where I can feel a smattering of small bites. I don’t just want to scratch, I want to rake my nails across my scalp and draw blood. Feelings of well-being evaporate and my stomach lurches. I edge away from my unsuspecting friends. Daisy Goodwin has has problems with head lice since she was 19 and says she has suffered with them almost 100 times since then . It’s happened again. I have nits. I make my excuses and sneak inside to scrape my hair into a ponytail. I am desperate for my guests to leave so I can take out my nit lotion and special comb to get rid of the varmits. Through the bathroom window, I can see my teenage daughter laughing with a couple of friends, all of them shaking their glossy, waist-length hair. My eyes narrow, those flowing locks are the enemy — a breeding ground for the bane of my life: pediculus humanus capitis, or head lice (a nit is the egg sac laid by the female louse on the hair shaft of their human hosts). I have had nits at least 100 times. Never as a child, but as an adult it has been one infestation after another. I should stress I wash my hair pretty much every day and have no other body-borne parasites, such as fleas — but my scalp is El Dorado for lice. My first experience was at 19 when I was studying at Cambridge. I had just been home, visiting my two sisters who were still at primary school. A week later I was sitting in the university library opposite a boy I had a crush on. Our eyes met, he smiled, I grinned back then scratched my head. I heard something hit the paper I was taking notes on, and there on the page of white A4 was an object the size of an eyelash, with six wriggling legs. Dais (pictured as a child) says she was never affected by head lice when she was younger, only getting them for the first time when she was 19 . It was my first sighting of a live louse. I ran to the nearest chemist and doused my head with the industrial-strength chemicals that were then usual treatment for nits. I didn’t tell anyone, I was too embarrassed, but made sure the next time I saw my sisters I kept them at arm’s length. I don’t know if the boy in the library saw the nit fall from my head — in my memory it was the size of a small mouse — but somehow I never found myself sitting opposite him again. In retrospect, I think he may have been giving me a wide berth. After a few nit-free years in my early 20s, my relationship with the parasites resumed when I became a mother. It’s a rite of passage for most parents of primary school children. The note comes home with them in the homework folder, announcing that nits have been found in the class and would parents please check their children’s heads for the critters and treat them accordingly? Easier said than done, as nits are masters of disguise — it takes 20:20 vision or a very high-powered magnifying glass to spot a live one. It’s much easier to pinpoint the eggs, tell-tale white flecks that cling to the hair shaft. Daisy (pictured) was lucky to have a few nit-free years in her early twenties but didn't escape the parasites entirely as they returned when she had children . My eldest daughter began school in 1996, and a nit invasion swiftly followed. They leapt with enthusiasm from her head to mine, and back again — completely ignoring the head of my husband — leading me to spend a small fortune on louse-busting treatments. This sector of the pharmaceutical market is worth £185 million a year in the UK, and I know why. As those who have experienced it know, nit-combing is the closest most mums get to being a gorilla, grooming its offspring for fleas. When my daughters were young (they are now 24 and 14) I would regularly grab them by their lustrous locks and scrutinise their scalps for those tiny flecks. ‘Oh Mum,’ they would complain, ‘lay off, there’s nothing there.’ But I knew better. I had seen the scratching and I could feel the prickle on my own scalp. Their heads and mine were five-star hotels for head lice and no sooner had I eliminated one nit invasion, another would follow. Daisy (pictured as a child) says you can win the battle with headlice but you can never win the war . Nits are the Forth Bridge of infestations, no sooner have you spent a good half-day combing the hair of a wriggling eight-year-old, than you have to do it all over again, and again and again. I have tried everything, and I mean everything to get rid of them. Chemicals, suffocation, endless combing — there was even a point where I made my daughters put on hats when they came home from school so I wouldn’t get them. But there is no way to avoid them. The only thing I haven’t done is to shave their heads — or mine. You can win the battle against head lice with nit combs and conditioner and weekly combings, but you can never, ever win the war. Relax your vigilance for a millisecond and they are back. Christmas is peak time for nits in my experience — all that conviviality is party-time for the critters. Over the past ten years, I must have spent at least five festive mornings hovering over my daughters with a nit comb, squeaking with horror as I extract yet another fat troublesome specimen from their hair. Pretty much every foreign holiday I have taken in 15 years has involved one shaming incident where I have to mime the action of headlice in a foreign chemist’s shop — in Italy they are called pidocchi, in Germany, kopflause. What the Thai word for them is I do not know, but I do know that scratching your head in a Bangkok chemist will give you some pretty powerful stuff. I once missed a New Year’s Eve party in France because the local pharmacist told me to douse my head in olive oil overnight and then wash it off with Coca-Cola. Desperate for a solution, I followed her advice and ended up with hedgehog hair that took a week to return to normal. The worst experience was a holiday in Ireland with my best friend who has a head of expensively highlighted hair. After a week with me and my daughters, her head started to itch. The only remedy available in the pharmacy at Schull, Co Cork, was so pungent it turned her ash tints a dull green. We are still friends — just. I thought that when my second daughter left primary school four-and-a-half years ago my nit ordeal would end, but no — it appears head lice are just as virulent among teens as they are among younger children. My nephews and nieces have become resigned to their aunt doing a quick once over when they visit — if I could install the head lice equivalent of a sheep dip, believe me I would. Daisy (pictured) thought she was safe when her youngest daughter left primary school but it seems that headlice are just as virulent among teens as they are among younger children . When my daughters were young, I would quite often have a quick snoop over the scalps of their visiting friends just to check. Sadly, that isn’t an option with teenagers — peering at adolescent scalps is a human rights issue. Understandably, I have accumulated quite a bit of knowledge about nits in my near 30-year relationship with them. I have discovered, for example, that not many grown men seem to get them. Could that be a hormonal thing or is it because men don’t get down with the kids as much as women (nits can’t fly but they can jump downwards, so you never want to sit below a potentially nit-infested child). In New York, the louse-infested head straight to the nit pickers of Crown Heights — Hasidic Jews who comb every hair until they have eliminated them. Over here, there is a thriving service called The Hairforce, which will come to your house and de-infest the whole family. But it’s not cheap (close to £1,500 for a family of four, including two home visits) and if you get them as often as I do, you would be bankrupt. According to Richard J. Pollack, the only failsafe solution is to avoid all physical contact with other people as the nits can only jump a very short distance from head-to-head . My only comfort has been assuming that my attractiveness to head lice is something to do with having super-powerful feminine pheromones, which made me irresistible to both men and the pesky pediculus genus. Yet according to Richard J. Pollack, senior environmental public health officer at Harvard University, that is not the case. Head lice do not discriminate, he insists: ‘Scalp hair is a prerequisite. Being alive is another — they won’t infest corpses. Head lice only infest human beings.’ Pollack says regular infestation in adults is rare, happening in less than 1 per cent of cases. His website, identify.us.com, has all the latest research on nits. But even he can’t explain why I’m a nit magnet. The only failsafe solution, he says, is to avoid all physical contact with other people; nits can only jump a very short distance from head-to-head. Of course, now I have told the world about my nit problem, that might not be a problem!","Daisy Goodwin has had problems with head lice since she was 19 .

"A woman of Arab and Jewish descent who was strip-searched at a Detroit-area airport has reached a settlement in a lawsuit filed on her behalf, the American Civil Liberties Union said Tuesday. The federal government will give Shoshana Hebshi $40,000 as compensation for being humiliated on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks after armed agents forced her from a plane at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, made her undress during a search and held her for hours.

Hebshi, who has a Jewish mother and Saudi Arabian father, has said she was ethnically profiled based on her dark complexion. 'I filed this lawsuit because I didn't want others to experience the kind of unnecessary trauma that I did, and it has given me faith that the justice system can work to protect constitutional rights,' Hebshi said in a release. 'This settlement gives me some peace of mind. Now, I feel like I can finally put the incident behind me.' Hebshi of Sylvania, Ohio, was traveling home after visiting a sister in California when was removed from the Frontier Airlines flight after it landed Sept. 11, 2011.

'I strongly support their actions. We remain committed to vigilantly protecting the safety of the travelling public.' As part of the settlement, Frontier will amend its employee handbook to more clearly state its zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and provide all new employees with training on that revision. The airline also will amend its customer complaint policy to ensure allegations of discrimination are given appropriate attention. Frontier Airlines declined to comment on the settlement.

"Three generations of one family were saved from their car last week by a police officer seconds before the vehicle was pulled out to sea in Washington State. Peter Reece, his fiancee, baby daughter and mother from Kent were parked on an Ocean Shores beach on Thursday around 7pm in their new Nissan Infiniti when their tires got stuck in the sand. Reece told police that he and his family had been driving on the beach when they stopped on the edge of the surf to look at the water. Peter Reece, his fiancee, mother and six-month-old daughter were parked on an Ocean Shores, Washington, beach on Thursday when the tide came in and trapped the family . The wheels of the car sunk into the wet sand, so they were unable to move. Reece and his fiancee got out of the car, but his mother and daughter were trapped inside . In Ocean Shores there are roads that lead on to beach approaches, where drivers can go from road to beach. Reece and his family parked near the West Chance ala Mer beach approach. Reece said that the tide was 30 feet from where they were parked, but within a few minutes it had already reached so far up that it was hitting their car. The tires sunk into the wet sand and the family was unable to drive away, according to KXRO. 'There were waves coming back to back and crashing against the car like really loud and really hard,' Reece told Komo News. Reece and his fiancee were able to get out of the car, but the grandmother and child were stuck in the car because the wet sand surrounding them was keeping the doors shut. Seconds after Ocean Shores police officer Kyle Watson saved the grandmother and baby, a wave hit the car, flipping it and pulling it out to sea . The car was recovered shortly after the incident and a bulldozer was used to flip it on its right side before it was towed to the road . 'I was just trying to get us out as quickly as possible because I know when the tide gets higher it takes everything with it,' Reece said. Ocean Shores police  arrived on scene, finding Reece in the car with his mother and six-month-old baby, according to KBKW. Officer Kyle Watson had to force the door to the car open because the car had sunken so far into the wet sand. He helped the woman and baby out of the car and led them up the beach. Reece was able to get out on his own. They were only about 20 feet up the beach when another wave hit and lifted the car up into the water, flipping it on to its roof. 'And another wave hit and the car was on its top. So if we stayed in 30 second longer we would have been upside down,' Reece said. After being lifted up by the sea, the car eventually beached and had to be flipped by a bulldozer, before it was taken back to the road by a tow truck. Tow truck driver Christopher Macasieb, who helped get the car out of the sand, said that the car kept rolling on to its side because of the waves. In Ocean Shores there are roads that lead on to beach approaches, where drivers can go from road to beach, which is how the Reece family made their way to the surf . Police officer Paul Henderson said that because of the approaches, beached cars are not an uncommon problem in the city . 'It's unfortunate because it is a brand new car. But cars can be replaced. Lives cant,' he said. The Reece family, too, said they were grateful that all that was lost was the car. Ocean Shores officer Paul Henderson told Daily Mail Online that because there are beach approaches for people to drive on to, having cars get stuck in the sand is a somewhat common issue. 'You're allowed to park and drive on the beach within certain areas. Usually people are more aware of the tides,' Henderson said, adding that the Reece family was close to the surf. He said that some cars have gone out so far into the water that they have to be recovered at a later time. But the Reeces' car was recovered 'a short time later'. The car flipped on the Ocean Shores beach just before 7pm on Thursday. Henderson said that cars are allowed to drive and park on the sand in some areas of the beach . Police arrived on scene within minutes of getting a call about the trapped Reece family. The entire family was able to get out of the car before waves took the vehicle away .","Peter Reece, his fiancee, baby and mother were parked on an Ocean Shores beach on Thursday when the tide reached their vehicle .

"A family of four are lucky to be alive after a bedroom ceiling collapsed in their home. The damage was just part of the destruction caused by cowboy builders who had been called in to fix a leak in the Beckle-Raymond's three bedroom property in North London. Instead, they left Phillip, his wife Gaby and their two young children, Orion and Aurielle, in an unsafe building with no roof while they ran off with £17,000 of their money. Scroll down for video . Phillip and Gaby outside their London home which was left a wreck thanks to cowboy builders . 'When the builders walked out, we only had tarpaulin protecting the house throughout winter,' Gaby explains on Channel 5 show Britain's Horror Homes. 'When it rained, water started coming in, it was raining inside our house. The box room caved in, the bathroom became bowed, the ceiling will fall in the children's room. 'The most terrifying experience was the ceiling falling in the bedroom where we used to sleep. It collapsed where our bed used to be. We weren't in room at time thankfully.' For six months, the family were forced to live in one room of the house as they couldn't afford to get the problems fixed straight away, having already shelled out to the cowboy builders who left them in the lurch. Phillip, a civil servant, said: 'The house was crumbling around us, we had to turn off the lights as water was getting into electricity, it was that time of year when it was getting dark at 4pm, it was miserable. I hated leaving Gaby and the children like that when I had to go to work.' Phillip and Gaby had used all their savings to buy the property five years before for £325,000. The builders left the family with no roof and just tarpaulin protecting the house from the winter elements. As a result, rain got into the property causing ceilings to collapse . The parents say they are devastated at being 'taken for a ride'. It will cost £35,000 to repair their home . As they started a family, they worked hard to turn the house into a happy and comfortable place to raise their children. When they sprung a small leak in part of the roof, they called in a builder who recommended they re-tile the roof at a cost of about £3,000. But after removing all the tiles, he then told them that the roof structure was unsound so he wouldn't be able to re-tile. He suggested they use the opportunity to expand their home and add value to the property by adding a loft conversion. The couple thought it was great idea and decided to use a sub contractor their builder recommended and pay a £7,000 deposit for the work. Gaby said: 'The first builder appeared to be trustyworthy and was very professional, very likable. 'We didn't have time to check out the sub contractor he recommended as we were without a roof which we needed to be fixed.' A back view of the property shows how the garden was left looking like a rubbish tip while the house had no roof. The family had to live in one room for six months as they couldn't afford the repairs . So far the couple had paid the first builder £10,000 in total - and had a home with no roof to show for it. After the sub contractor began to work on their home, the first builder then disappeared. Phillip said: 'We heard from sub contractor that the builder's uncle was sick in Ireland so he was going there - we never hard from him again.' Meanwhile, the sub contractor began work on their loft conversion after asking for £7,000 for materials and labour. But as the sub contractor got to work, the couple became suspicious about his competency. Gaby said: 'He was trying to build a loft conversion without steel supports - which we had paid for. 'That's when we realised he was trying to take us for a ride like the first guy.' Phillip added: 'When we told him it wasn't acceptable, he walked off the job. We were left with a roof no longer salvageable.' Shocking: The collapse of the roof left their home filled with rubble . Daylight: With the tiles gone, the family were left with bare rafters and no protection from the elements . The couple were unable to contact the first builder and have reported the sub contractor to Trading Standards. They have been left devastated by the state of their home - as well as £17,000 out of pocket. 'We have lost the home we have been building over the last few years, our whole house has been destroyed, it's been a living nightmare. We wish they have never knocked on our door,' Gabby wept. 'I just want it fixed. I still can't believe someone would leave me my husband and our two children in so much danger. They didn't need to leave us in such an unsafe way.' But the family's trust in humanity has been partly restored thanks to the friends, family and strangers who rallied round to help them. A friend set up a fundraising page so people can donate money to help the couple reach the £35,000 they will need to repair their home. Unsafe: The family are devastated that they have been left to live in an unsafe home . Damage: A local builder Darren Louis has been helping the family to clear up the mess left behind . A local builder, Darren Louis, has been working on the property at weekends - so far without payment - so the family have a roof over their heads again. He said: I wanted to help as this is my trade and they are a lovely family. They didn't need to do the work in the first place, they were scaremongered into it and then left with a house that's unsafe.' Gaby said: 'I feel terrible he's coming here and we haven't paid him. He's coming in trust that we will come through with money in the end.' Phillip said it's thanks to their friends, family and neighbours they have got through their ordeal. He said: 'We were left thinking ""can we trust anyone anymore?"" and now we know we can.'","Parents Phillip and Gaby Beckle-Raymond discovered a leak in roof .

"A clock based on a design from 300 years ago has stunned experts by keeping accurate to a second for 100 days. The modern-day Martin Burgess Clock B is based on John Harrison's 18th century clock, which he thought up to solve the problem of determining longitude at sea. It has been part of a 100-day trial at the Royal Observatory, in Greenwich, to see if the claim - that the clock would neither lose nor gain more than a second in 100 days - was true. The Martin Burgess Clock B (left), which is based on a design by carpenter John Harrison (right) from 300 years ago, has stunned experts by keeping accurate to a second for 100 days . The clock, which was built using modern materials, was initially set ticking a year ago after being strapped to one of the Observatory's supporting pillars. But it quickly became apparent the trial would be a success and wax seals were placed on its case so its accuracy could be verified, the Independent on Sunday reported. The time was measured using a radio-controlled clock, which received the national time signal, and the BT speaking clock. Jonathan Betts, a member of the Antiquarian Horological Society, said: 'As soon as we set the clock running it was clear that it was performing incredibly well, so then we got the case sealed because nobody was going to believe how well the clock was running.' He added that the clock was not a replica of Harrison's, but used his design and concept. 'It is important to realise his design goes against everything the establishment has claimed is the best throughout history,' Mr Betts added. The modern-day clock has since been certified by the Guinness World Records, which the National Maritime Museum confirmed on Twitter . The Martin Burgess B clock has been part of a 100-day trial at the Royal Observatory (above), in Greenwich, to see if the claim - that the clock would neither lose nor gain more than a second in 100 days - was true . The clock has since been certified by the Guinness World Records. When it was measured it was reading UTC time to within a quarter of a second. The National Maritime Museum confirmed the record on Twitter yesterday. It wrote: 'Our 100 day trail of ""Clock B"" won @GWR for ""most accurate mechanical clock with a pendulum swinging in free air""!' Rory McEvoy, the Observatory’s curator of horology, added: ‘What we’ve seen here is something approaching a perfect clock, but we are not there yet.’ Harrison died in 1776. He has since been the subject of Dava Sobel's bestselling book Longitude, as well as a film with the same name starring Michael Gambon (right) and Jeremy Irons (left) John Harrison was a carpenter born in 1693 in Lincolnshire. In the early 18th century a lot of Royal Navy ships were being lost at sea. Although latitude was relatively easy to determine using the sun, longitude was harder. The problem was considered so important Parliament offered financial rewards of up to £20,000 to anyone who solved it. Clockmakers argued that a heavy pendulum bob and short swing would be the best. But Harrison dismissed this theory and thought a clock with a lighter pendulum bob and wide swing would work better. He designed his first clock in 1713 aged 20. His 'longitude' clock, which was the basis of the Martin Burgess Clock B, would solve the problem of determining longitude at sea, he claimed. By knowing the amount of time the ship had been at sea and the local time by using the sun, sailors would be able to determine longitude accurately. Local time is one hour ahead for every 15 degrees of longitude east and one hour behind for every 15 degrees of longitude west. He was not taken seriously by any of his contemporaries and the possibilities of his clock were not explored until the 20th century. Harrison died in 1776. He has since been the subject of Dava Sobel's bestselling book Longitude, as well as a film with the same name starring Michael Gambon and Jeremy Irons.","Martin Burgess Clock B is based on John Harrison's 18th century design .

"It is the image which the Tories hope will scare floating voters into their arms – the prospect of Nicola Sturgeon forcing Ed Miliband to implement her radical policies. Launching a new poster campaign showing Ms Sturgeon manipulating a puppet Labour leader, Conservative chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘The only way that Ed Miliband might crawl through the gates of No10 now is if he’s carried there by the SNP. ‘Nicola Sturgeon would pull the strings and demand weaker defences, more spending and unaffordable welfare handouts. It would be a disaster.’ Scroll down for video . New poster: It is the image which the Tories hope will scare floating voters into their arms – the prospect of Nicola Sturgeon forcing Ed Miliband to implement her radical policies . The campaign comes as Ms Sturgeon uses an article in today’s Scottish Mail on Sunday to claim that she can help ‘lead the UK’. The SNP leader reveals that her party’s manifesto, to be published tomorrow, will include pledges in policy areas which don’t even directly affect Scotland. It will be the first time that the SNP has ever set out policies designed for other parts of the UK – even though people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland cannot vote for them. Her comments are certain to rile many in England, who will be aghast at the prospect of a party for which they cannot vote trying to run their country. Ms Sturgeon also gives an ‘absolute guarantee’ that she will not use success in this year’s General Election as a reason to push for another poll on breaking up Britain. ‘We will be pursuing policies which can change things for the better for people right across the UK, such as in health, where we will oppose any attempts to further privatise England’s NHS, ensuring more public funding for healthcare north and south of the border,’ she writes. Campaign trail: The leader of the Scottish National Party is applauded by former leader and local candidate Alex Salmond during campaigning in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire yesterday . ‘I can also give an absolute guarantee that this Election is not about independence or about delivering another referendum, no matter how many SNP MPs may be returned to Westminster in May.’ But Alistair Darling, who led the campaign to save the Union last year, today warns voters not to believe her claims. In his first major contribution to this year’s Election campaign, the former Labour Chancellor says an influx of SNP MPs at Westminster would turn Scotland into ‘Neverendum land’. Also writing exclusively in today’s Scottish Mail on Sunday, he says: ‘Nicola Sturgeon will decide when to hold another referendum and it will be when she thinks she will win it ... [The SNP] need to spell out what exactly they intend. The vote was clear. What’s more, most Scots do not want to live in Neverendum land. ‘We are now told that the General Election is not about independence. Really? 'That’s what the SNP said in 2011 in the Scottish elections. It was all about health and education, they said. Not after the result it wasn’t.’ Revelation: It was also claimed this weekend that Ms Sturgeon has privately vowed to keep voting down an Ed Miliband Budget until he agrees to her party’s policy demands . It was also claimed this weekend that Ms Sturgeon has privately vowed to keep voting down an Ed Miliband Budget until he agrees to her party’s policy demands. With polling experts saying that Labour has only a 1 per cent chance of forming a majority Government in its own right, the SNP’s support is likely to be vital in passing any Budget drawn up by a Miliband administration. Until now, it had been assumed Ms Sturgeon’s party could not vote against a Budget without triggering a vote of no confidence and another General Election. But SNP sources told the BBC’s Newsnight that since the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this is no longer the case.","Tories will be hoping to scare floating voters with puppet-master image .

"If you sometimes get the feeling that good manners are in short supply these days then take heart from the boy who sent a handwritten apology to a bookstore after being sick there – and included a Ben & Jerry’s gift card. The boy, 14-year-old Jack Cordero, from Portland, Oregon, vomited all over the floor of a Powell’s bookstore in the city in March. The manager said the mess was ‘gigantic’ and had to clean it up, along with her assistant manager. Good manners: Jack Cordero, from Portland, wrote this sincere apology to staff at a bookstore after being sick . However, her spirits were raised when she received a handwritten apology about the vomit from the boy responsible, along with a gift card for ice cream. The letter, which arrived at Powell's on April 1 and was marked ‘attention barf cleaners’, read: ‘This Ben and Jerry’s card is for the people who cleaned up the throw-up of a kid on Friday 28. ‘I don’t know their names but I thank them a lot and I’m sorry again for throwing up and hope you enjoy your ice cream.’ The manager of Powell's bookstore in Portland (pictured), was forced to clean up Jack's vomit - but said his apology letter and gift card made her day . It was signed ‘Jack, aka the kid that puked right next to the bathroom’. Manager Jennifer Wicka told BuzzFeed that the mess was ‘gigantic in diameter’, perhaps stretching to about 12 feet, and that the apology made her day. She said: ‘I opened it up and read it and it totally made my day. I’m pretty grumpy about people and humanity. Oh man, some people are good.’ A picture of the envelope and letter was uploaded to Twitter by a friend of Ms Wicka’s, Liz Crain, and it subsequently went viral. Hundreds of people have since commented on Jack’s good nature. Writing on BuzzFeed, Caitlin Lindberg said: ‘Jack your mama must be hella proud because you’re a good person, way to go on restoring faith in humanity man!’ Margaret Thym, meanwhile, said that Jack ‘is on his way to being a fantastic adult’.","Jack Cordero, 14, from Portland, has won praise for his etiquette .

"Around 16 million tourists visit Florence every year. It's popularity is not surprising - the city contains over sixty per cent of the world's art heritage. But for its population of 350,000, that's an overwhelming figure. So a new initiative set up by Prince Ottaviano de’Medici di Toscana, representative of the Historic House of the Medici, is aiming to reclaim the city, saving it from the ruins of mass tourism. Around 16 million tourists visit Florence every year, visiting historical sights such as the Duomo, pictured here . The last ten years have seen a steep incline in the amount of visitors to the city. Vandals have destroyed historic monuments, an influx of fast-food outlets now line the major thoroughfares and binge-drinking tourists have been seen urinating in the streets and sleeping rough. About 1.5 million cruise tourists arrive via bus from Livorno and La Spezia each year, staying in Florence for just a couple of hours, clogging the streets and adding little to the economy. And as large franchises move in, local shopkeepers and artisans have moved out. And as many as 100,000 native Florentines have left the city to escape traffic  and high property prices. Vandals have destroyed historic monuments, an influx of fast-food outets now line the major thoroughfares and binge-drinking tourists have been seen urinating in the streets and sleeping rough . Prince Ottaviano worries that Florence's cultural significance has been radically altered. 'There is an absolute lack of laws to protect the city from uncontrolled mass tourism and insufficient maintenance of buildings, monuments, urban spaces, and works of art,' he told the National Geographic. 'The situation became even worse to my eyes when I discovered that the police don’t have any agent—not even one!—who can certify the state of decay of building façades and require owners to make repairs.' Snapping a selfie at the Duomo, left, and tourists at the fountain of Neptune, Piazza Della Signoria, right . Prince Ottaviano has proposed adding Florence, already a World Heritage City, to UNESCO's endangered list. The Save Florence campaign aims to appeal to 'true travellers' rather than tourists blitzing the city in a couple of hours. Rather than mass tourism, the prince wants to attract visitors with its traditions of food and craft, its lesser known museums and smaller hotels. And another Florence aficionado, tour operator Mark Gordon Smith, is aiming to bring the city's decline into public view, through a series of short video documentaries. The Italy specialist is hoping to fund his project, to showcase Florence's hidden gems, the neighbourhoods tourists usually miss, as well as the damage being done by disrespecting visitors, via Kickstarter. Tour operator Mark Gordon Smith wants to show the city's decline through a series of short documentaries . On his fundraising page, he says: 'The city of Florence Italy is in peril'. 'The monuments and streets which lead from the Accademia through the Piazza Duomo to the Piazza della Signoria and the Uffizi are showing immeasurable damage; graffiti on historic monuments, visitors using the streets as a bathroom, people sleeping in the loggias of Santissima Annunziata and the Ospedale degli Innocenti.' He is hoping the short films will be distributed across the world to raise awareness.","Around 16 million tourists visit Florence - population 350,000, every year .

"A writer and victim of date rape has revealed why she is pushing for 'yes means yes' sex contracts to become mandatory on college campuses across the country. New Yorker Amanda Chatel explained in her essay for Your Tango that adoption of the 'yes means yes' law, which defines consent as 'affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity' from each partner, is just one step in combating society's prevalent rape culture. 'As a victim of date rape, when it comes to consent I strongly feel there is no grey area,' she wrote. 'Unfortunately, at the time, I was too young and naive to realize that because I never actually said, “No,” I was a willing participant.' Inciting change: New Yorker Amanda Chatel explained in an essay that she is a victim of rape who is advocating for 'yes means yes' laws to be passed in states across the country . The 'yes means yes' law, which was first passed in California in 2014, is a spin on the old sexual assault mantra 'no means no'. The legislation declares that all colleges and universities taking financial aid funding from California must adhere to the standard for consent outlined by the law, which reiterates that a lack of resistance or objection does not imply consent - a concept that Amanda struggled with years following her sexual assault. Amanda explained for a long time she blamed herself because he 'came on strong' and she was a 'bit inebriated' 'But now, several years later, I know, more than ever, that my consent was not given, and it was rape. End of story,' she wrote. Amanda even noted that she was unable to attach the word 'rape' to what had happened to her and instead referred the assault as 'sex I didn’t want'. At the time, she said that like many women, she didn't even consider going to the police after she was raped, a mistake that she noted she will 'never make again'. According to statistics, an estimated one out of five women will be sexually assaulted during their college careers. No shame: The New Yorker wrote that she blamed herself for years after her sexual assault because never actually said 'No', even though she wasn't a willing participant . 'It’s both disheartening and disgusting that we even need a law that stipulates that a woman must be able to give consent or else it’s rape,' Amanda said of today's rape culture. In Connecticut, state officials are now considering the adoption of a similar 'yes means yes' bill. And while Amanda said the law is 'great in theory', she explained that 'we need to change the way people think of rape' before the law will prove to be effective. 'I believe more than anything is that we need to teach boys and men NOT to rape,' she said. 'We need to make them see that women and girls are not their personal playthings, that we were not put on this earth for their pleasure, and if we drink too much at a party, that we sure as hell aren't ""asking for it"",' she added. And at least two California lawmakers agree with her. Last month, Senate President Kevin de Leon and Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson announced that they were introducing legislation that would call for school districts with mandatory health education requirements for graduation to include sexual violence prevention as a mandatory part of the curriculum, including instruction on the recently approved 'yes means yes' law. 'If we want to prevent sexual assault, it’s important that we start early,' Ms Jackson explained in March. She continued: 'This bill will ensure that discussions about healthy relationships and consent are taking place in high school, with young women and young men, so we can help establish boundaries of acceptable behavior.'","Amanda Chatel explained that nationwide adoption of the  law is just one step in battling society's prevalent rape culture .

"Shocking: Nyia Parler, 41, was taken into custody by authorities in Montgomery County, Maryland overnight Saturday on charges she wheeled her quadriplegic son into woods in Philadelphia then went to visit her boyfriend . A Philadelphia mother accused of abandoning her quadriplegic son in the woods before skipping town to see her boyfriend has been arrested. Nyia Parler, 41, was taken into custody by authorities in Montgomery County, Maryland overnight Saturday on charges including aggravated assault, simple assault and neglect of a care-dependent person. Police say she traveled to Maryland from Pennsylvania either last Sunday or Monday after leaving her 21-year-old wheelchair-bound son in a wooded park with nothing but a blanket and a Bible.

He'd allegedly been left there by his mother five days earlier . The son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a cut to his back and eye injuries. According to Philly.com two of his aunts, who are with him in hospital, have been trying to obtain guardianship for years. Parler's other son, a 16-year-old, is said to be in the custody of an aunt. A neighbor, who declined to be identified, told DailyMail.com: 'She used to push him out to the school bus in his wheelchair, she seemed to care for him. Whenever I saw him, I saw her.' Another, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I would see them outside together in the summer when he got home from school. Nothing looked wrong, I didn't suspect anything.' Walker said the son was exposed to the elements and other dangers. 'A lot of things could have happened out there,' he said. Abandoned: A passerby noticed the 21-year-old here in a wooded Philadelphia park . 'Obviously he's in the middle of a wooded area. You have wild animals there ... this kid could not defend himself. He does not function at all.' Walker added : 'What we've learned so far is that the 21-year-old child lives with his mother, completely dependent on mom as a result of his condition.

"A homeless couple forced to live in their car after pay-day loan debts spiralled out of control are getting their lives back on track - thanks to a caring businessman. Philip and Victoria Sherlock have been living out of their car for three months, after a stomach operation meant Philip could no longer work as a £400 a week gardener. Their loss of income saw Victoria take on more hours as a shop assistant, but the desperate couple then had their benefits cut. Philip was given a lifeline by local businessman Jasen Jackiw (right) a Manchester business owner who heard about the story on a TV programme . Philip and Victoria Sherlock have been living out of their car for three months, after a stomach operation meant Philip could no longer work as a £400 a week gardener . With no choice but to sell furniture and take out pay-day loans, Philip and Victoria were eventually forced to leave their home and live in their Ford Focus in Warrington to be closer to Victoria's job. The distraught couple even celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary by sharing a Twix chocolate bar while sleeping in their car. Driving to various supermarkets and public toilets to wash and brush their teeth before Victoria went to work, and Philip went to the job centre, became the norm each morning. But thanks to the kindness of Jason Jackiw, a Manchester business owner who heard about the heartbreaking story on a TV programme, Philip, 42, has been thrown a lifeline. He has now started work as a stock manager at Jason's firm Prymo, a specialist re-surfacing company based in Sale. Managing director Jasen Jackiw, 30, said: 'I saw Philip was getting a lot of hate from some people saying he was just lazy, and I thought well I'll give him a job if he really wants one. He started two weeks ago and he's just been brilliant.' Philip lost his job as a gardener following a stomach operation and then the pair lost their benefits . It became commonplace for the pair to wash in public toilets or at the facilities of local supermarkets . And Philip, who has been desperately looking for work for months, is proving to be a much-needed asset to the company. Jasen added: 'He runs all the warehouse and stock now, and does a bit of the maintenance stuff too, and we have never been so organised there as we are now. 'And he even goes out marketing for us too. He's been absolutely fantastic, and I've already said to him, ""right you're going nowhere."" 'All I saw was somebody who was desperate to get into work, and we needed somebody to manage the stock so it made sense. 'I was given an opportunity to start my business and I knew he needed an opportunity to get back on his feet. We did say to him that if he struggled with the job then we might not be able to keep him on, but he's grabbed it with both hands and hit the ground running.' Despite things looking up, the pair are still living out of their car but they stay in hotels whenever they can . Philip couldn't believe it when the offer of a job came through, and although the couple still spend some nights living in their van, whenever they can afford it they treat themselves to a bed in a hotel - and hope to get their own flat in the future. Philip added: 'We were fighting for months to keep a roof over our head, but in January we couldn't fight any more. 'Whenever we can afford it we'll get a hotel, but Jasen gave us a van because we had to get rid of our car, so we sleep in there too.' And the ex-gardener is enjoying his new job managing the stock for Prymo. Philip, 42, added: 'Jasen saw what I was going through, and it's heart-warming that there are people out there who will do this for a total stranger and I'm really enjoying the job. I'm a bit older than most of the people there so I try to make a difference.'

"Aaron Hernandez looked full of promise in his 2007 high school yearbook picture . Aaron Hernandez was  a rapidly rising star in the NFL. He was a key part of the New England Patriots offense, played in the Super Bowl and had signed a massive five-year contract extension that would pay him nearly $40million. He had a baby girl, a beautiful fiancee and an expansive $1.5million mansion in the Boston suburbs. But even before the murder of Odin Lloyd in June 2013 - a crime for which he will now spend the rest of his life in prison - Hernandez was not the golden boy he seemed to be. His arrest for Lloyd's murder was not the beginning of his criminal career - but rather just the first time he's been held accountable for his actions. Hernandez has been accused of shooting a total of six men - killing three and severely wounding three other. Two of them, Lloyd and a man who says Hernandez shot him through the eye, were supposedly the star's friends. After his father died, he had no one in his life to keep in on the straight and narrow. That, combined with his desire to be involved in the 'thug life' on the streets in his hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, and escalating drug and alcohol use set the stage for the murders, family and friends have said. Scroll down for video . Hernandez was captain of his high school football team and rated as the best football player in the state of Connecticut in his senior year . Hernandez, seen here in a candid shot from his senior yearbook at Bristol Central High School, grew into a troubled, and very powerful, young man . Add into it, a history of escaping trouble thanks to coaches and cops allegedly covering for him. He had had at least three major run-ins with the law prior to his murder arrest - and managed to escape without charges every time. The 25-year-old made it out of a tough neighborhood in Bristol, Connecticut, but never seemed to leave the streets behind. A 2013 Rolling Stone article claimed that he maintained gang affiliation - and even allegedly got a Bloods gang tattoo - even after making millions in the NFL. As his career wore on, he became more distant from his family and closer with his alleged gang friends, Rolling Stone claimed. Additionally, he became increasingly paranoid and carried a gun everywhere he went. Rolling Stone claims he also began smoking the hallucinogen PCP, or angel dust. A family friend told the magazine that Lloyd's murder was a result of Hernandez's drug abuse. 'Don’t matter what it’s about: Aaron’s out of his mind. He’s been twisted on dust now for more than a year, which is when all of this crazy s*** started.' The magazine accuses Hernandez of being involved in a 'thug life' that was apparent even to New England head coach Bill Belichick. When he was arrested he was only 'one step' from being cut from the team over the issues, it was claimed. A friend told Rolling Stone that Hernandez chose to surround himself with a 'crew' of so-called gangsters, rather than hanging out with his team mates or other athletes. 'One of his uncles went to Boston to talk to him, and these scary-looking dudes are hanging out in his game room. They wouldn’t say hi or shake his hand, and when he brought it up to Aaron, he laughed him off,' a friend told the magazine. Star: Aaron Hernandez played in the Super Bowl as a key piece of the New England Patriots offense in 2012 . Hernandez was a star high school player from a bad neighborhood in Bristol, Connecticut. He revered his father Dennis Hernandez, who was himself a local sports legend - and also a  petty criminal as a teen. According to former coaches from Bristol, Dennis kept his son on the straight-and-narrow. When his father died in January 2006 from complications from a routine surgery, Aaron  became withdrawn. 'It was very, very hard, and he was very, very angry,' his mother Terri told USA Today. 'He wasn’t the same kid, the way he spoke to me. The shock of losing his dad, there was so much anger.' When Aaron's father died, his mother Terri moved her new husband into the family house. According to police reports, the new husband was violent and physically abused Terri. Jeffrey Cummings was also a convicted drug dealer. In July 2010, he allegedly stabbed Terri Hernandez during a fight. Following the death of his father, as a 17-year-old senior, Hernandez was named as the best football player in Connecticut. Also in Bristol, he met his longtime partner and future mother of his young daughter, Shayanna Jenkins. She has continued to stand by the troubled star - even enduring arrest for perjury for refusing to disclose exactly about what happened following Lloyd's murder. In 2006, an offer to play football for the University of Florida Gators  on scholarship seemed like a fresh start. Coach Urban Meyer helped counsel him during his time there and even assigned Tim Tebow to look after him. Hernandez scored one the Patriots' two touchdowns during Super Bowl XLVI in 2012 . April 28, 2007 - Police called after Hernandez, a University of Florida football player, punches a waiter at a bar .

In 2009, he helped lead the team to a national championship. But problems began to emerge as well. In April 2007 as a 17-year-old freshman, Hernandez ordered two drinks at a Gainesville, Florida, bar then refused to pay. When a waiter escorted him outside, the football star waited until his head was turned then allegedly punched him in the head, bursting his eardrum. Police were called and recommended that Hernandez be charged with felony assault. Meyer, Florida's legendary football coach, intervened and no arrest was ever made, according to Rolling Stone. That same year he was also questioned in connection with a drive-by shooting in which two men were shot, one in the head, following a fight over a gold necklace with Florida Gators football players at a nightclub. He was never charged and no one was ever arrested. Shayanna Jenkins, seen here in her 2007 yearbook picture, met Hernandez in high school . In 2008, he was suspended from the first game of the year for testing positive for marijuana. Rolling Stone claims that his drug violations may have been even more pronounced and that he failed more drug tests than the one that was released publicly. Following those incidents, he seemed to turn a corner. He was drafted in 2010 in the fourth-round by the Patriots. Many scouts said his talent merited a first-round pick, but teams were so concerned about his off-the-field behavior and connections to street gangs that they refused to draft him. His return to New England after being drafted by the Patriots allowed him to reconnect with the bad influences from his childhood, friends have said. On the Patriots, he made massive impact on the field. He quickly became one of quarterback Tom Brady's favorite targets. In three seasons, he scored 18 touchdowns and had nearly 2,000 yards receiving. In February 2012, he appeared in Super Bowl XLVI and caught a 12-yard pass from Brady for a touchdown. In 2012, the Patriots signed their star to a 5-year, $37.5million contact that included more than $12.5million in signing bonuses. In June 2012, he went to Los Angeles with his fiancee Shayanna Jenkins. While there, police were called to his apartment on a domestic violence call after neighbors dialed 911. When cops arrived, Hernandez was dismissive and Sayanna made it clear that she didn't want to press charges, so they left. On July 16, 2012 Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, who immigrants from Cape Verde, were found murdered in their car in South Boston following a drive-by shooting. They had reportedly gotten into a fight with Hernandez and his crew at a night club prior to their murders. In May 2014, prosecutors indicted Hernandez for both killings. He still faces trial on those murders. On the same month that Lloyd was murdered, a former friend filed a lawsuit against Hernandez claiming the NFL star had shot him in the mouth in February 2013 following a fight at a Miami strip club. The man, Alexander Bradley, lost his eye in the shooting and subsequently testified against Hernandez at his murder trial. In February 2014 - following his arrest for murder - he was allegedly involved in a jailhouse fight and for threatening a jail guard. He was later indicted on those charges and faces trial for them, as well.","Aaron Hernandez, 25, has been accused of shooting six people - killing three, including Odin Lloyd .

"A Chinese millionaire has splurged on a vast 217 hectare New Zealand island which she refers to as her 'toy.' The buyer, Wendy Wei Mei Wu, is reportedly yet to decide what she wants to do with Slipper Island, which is located 4 km off the coast of the New Zealand's North Island. The 2.7 km long, 1.8 km wide landmass is a 15 minute ferry ride from North Island. It boasts two airstrips and six houses, all with nearby beaches and sweeping ocean views.

"When Stacey Johnson was diagnosed with a brain tumour, her whole family was heartbroken. The pain of a cancer diagnosis never went away, but after eight years of battling the condition, they cared for her and began to live with the disease. But though she had experienced enough grief, Stacey Johnson was soon delivered another cruel blow - doctors discovered her younger sister Dannii also had a growth in her brain. Stacey, now 22, was diagnosed with an inoperable  tumour in 2007 and has undergone gruelling rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Her sister, Dannii, now 20, helped her mother care for her throughout her teenage years, and became her full-time carer last year. Stacey Johnson (left), 22, from Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, had just been told her brain tumour had grown when she was dealt another blow - her sister Dannii, 20, also had a tumour . Stacey (left) and Dannii (right) have grown up sharing their toys and clothes, and now find themselves both battling ill . In December 2014, Stacey was told her brain tumour, called an astrocytoma, had grown. The family, who live in Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, began to process this frightening news, wondering what treatment Stacey would now have to undergo. But they then suffered another shock – as Dannii was diagnosed with a brain tumour. She had been feeling ill and had suffered headaches, so had gone to her doctor who had referred her for tests that confirmed there was a growth in her brain. She describes her surprise at being told her headaches were being caused by a brain tumour. Dannii said: 'I had never expected it to be a tumour. 'I have been with Stacey through it all and it never even occurred that me that that's what it could be. 'I was really shocked when they told me, but I just got on with it really. Dannii had been Stacey's full time carer since last year, but began to suffer headaches and feel ill. She was shocked to discover she too had a tumour, although hers is benign . Stacey has never been able to work since her diagnosis eight years ago, and has undergone gruelling chemotherapy. She is pictured here with her sister in 2012 . 'I was down for a few days after I was diagnosed, but I thought I can't do anything about it, so I just thought I had to get on with it.' Stacey, who is due start her next round of chemotherapy soon, said the news was so shocking it didn't seem real. She said: 'It sort of felt like a dream and I thought I was going to wake up from it. 'She is one of those types of people who just gets on with it. We are helping each other through it.' The sisters live with their mother, Sharon, 47, their father Brian, 48, and brother Charlie, 28. They were both born with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) - a condition that causes café au lait spots (flat brown birthmarks) on the skin, freckles in unusual places, and benign lumps and bumps. One third of people with the condition will have one or more medical complication during their lifetime, which can include either benign or cancerous brain tumours. However, it is unclear whether the NF1 is related to the sisters' growths, and they say they have been told there probably is no link. Dannii is now awaiting a scan to see if it has grown and what the best course of treatment will be. Both sisters were born with neurofibromatosis type 1 - a condition that causes benign lumps and bumps, although they do not know if it is related to their development of brain tumours . Dannii said she was shocked when she too was diagnosed. She said: 'I have been with Stacey through it all and it never even occurred that me that that's what it could be. The sisters are pictured  in 1997 . She has been told her tumour is not cancerous, and is classed as Grade 1, the lowest risk. However, her mother, Sharon Johnson, 47, is worried the tumour could grow and endanger her health. Mrs Johnson, a housekeeper, said: 'I thought it was a joke when they first told us, I just couldn't believe how this could happen to us again. 'They started to explain more about it and I realised it was nothing like Stacey's. 'Dannii's is at the front of her brain and Stacey's is right at the back.' They have now set up a charity providing days out for children with terminal illnesses . Doctors say Dannii does not need surgery yet, but Mrs Johnson said when Stacey was first diagnosed with a tumour, doctors believed it was benign. She wants Dannii to have the tumours removed, so that it cannot grow and turn into cancer. She said: 'First of all they said they would take it out, but then they did a biopsy and found it wasn't cancerous, so they have decided to monitor for the next few months. 'I am annoyed that they're not doing anything. 'Exactly the same thing happened with Stacey, they said it wasn't cancerous but then it grew within three months. 'If they just take it out now then it wouldn't have the chance to grow. 'They've said that surgery is dangerous and they only do it when absolutely necessary though.' In an effort to help others in the same situation, Stacey has set up a charity called ""Kisses for Kids"" providing days out for children with terminal or long term illness. The two sisters now spend their time fund-raising for it. Sarah Lindsell, chief executive of The Brain Tumour Charity, said: 'A brain tumour diagnosis is a huge shock for anyone. 'For a family to experience it twice is extraordinarily cruel and our hearts go out to the Johnsons. 'For the sake of all of those like Stacey and Dannii whose lives are turned upside down by a brain tumour, we are absolutely determined to improve treatments through research and raise awareness of this devastating disease.'","Stacey Johson, 22, was diagnosed with cancer in her brain eight years ago .

"A brazen thief has allegedly taken a diamond engagement ring from Christine Davidson just days before she passed away on Thursday . The family of a woman who battled  a cancerous brain tumour for 14 years has claimed her diamond engagement ring was 'forcefully removed and stolen' from her finger at a nursing home just days before she passed away. Christine Davidson, from Adelaide, South Australia, was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2001, and told she only had between nine months to three years to live. After enduring an incredible 14 years of chemotherapy and radiation, the mother of two lost her battle to cancer last Thursday morning at an Adelaide nursing home at the age of 61. But four days before she died, her husband Ronny and their two daughters Symantha, 40, and Kelly, 38, noticed her  ring was missing from her finger. 'Dad  noticed the bruises around her finger and asked us if we managed to get the ring off,' Symantha told Daily Mail Australia. 'Three weeks prior to her passing, we tried to remove the ring because it started to cut her circulation but we had no luck after trying everything we could think of.’ The family has launched a desperate online appeal in a bid to have their mother's ring returned. Christine Davidson (left) who was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, pictured with her husband Ronny (right) and their daughter Symantha (centre) Christine and her husband Ronny were happily married for 41 years before she passed away . Kelly took to her Facebook account last Wednesday to post an emotional appeal and has since attracted more than 117,000 shares and almost 17,000 likes. 'We just don't understand how someone could steal from a dying woman,' Symantha said. ‘The ring was a sign of mum and dad’s long lasting love and their strong marriage – they were happily married for 41 years before she passed. ‘Mum also promised to give the ring to her only granddaughter who she was very close to - My daughter Jayda, 17, but now she’s devastated.' Christine was working at an insurance company before her sickness came on suddenly 14 years ago . Christine, who fell suddenly ill 14 years ago, pictured with her grandchildren last Christmas . On March 28, the family was told their mother, grandmother and wife was on her 'final stage of life'. ‘She was a nanna to four amazing grandchildren and she was the best mum we could ever ask for,' Symantha said. 'The last 14 years was hard on our family because we were forced to watch her suffer but we're happy she's at peace now and she’s not in pain anymore. ‘Multiple neurosurgeons were blown away with what she had accomplished after she fought hard to kick the rare long-lasting tumour - she was a brave fighter.' Christine was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and was told she only had up to three years to live . Symantha said she has informed the police about the missing ring. Daily Mail Australia has contacted South Australian police for comment. Christine lived at the retirement home, which the family has asked Daily Mail Australia to keep anonymous, for more than four years. 'The majority of the nurses were fantastic and mum was cared for very well,' Kelly said. Jewellery store SA Gold Diggers in Salisbury, South Australia has offered a $1000 reward for anyone providing information that leads to finding the missing ring. ‘The generosity and kindness of people everywhere has absolutely blown us away,’ Symantha said.

"When Clarence David Moore escaped from a North Carolina prison as a 23-year-old inmate, President Richard Nixon occupied the White House, US forces were still fighting in Vietnam and a single ride on the New York City subway cost 30 cents. Moore has been on the run from the law for more than four decades, until Monday afternoon when he called the Franklin County Sheriff's Office in Kentucky and admitted to being a fugitive. Sheriff Pat Melton says Moore, 66, was at the former Polk Youth Institute in Butner, North Carolina, serving a sentence of more than 10 years for larceny when he broke free June 10, 1972. Scroll down for video . Captured: Clarence David Moore, 66, is seen being wheeled from his home in Frankfort, Kentucky, Monday, after he admitted to being a fugitive who escaped from a North Carolina prison in 1972 . Medical necessity: Moore suffers from several medical conditions and cannot walk, but because he has no Social Security card of any form of ID, he has been unable to receive medical treatment . At 4pm Monday, nearly 43 years after Moore’s escape, he finally emerged from the shadows. ‘I need to make this right and get through this,’ Moore was quoted as telling Sheriff Melton. After sheriff's deputies verified Moore's story, he was taken into custody. The 66-year-old, who suffers from several unspecified ailments and apparently cannot walk on his own, was captured by the station WTVQ being wheeled out of his Frankfort home on a gurney and taken to a hospital before being sent to jail. He explained to investigators he has not been able to get medical treatment because he does not have a Social Security card or any other form of identification. According to the sheriff's office, the man’s unexpected decision to give himself up after all these years was motivated by his desire to see a doctor. Now it will be up to prosecutors in North Carolina to decide whether to pursue extradition in Moore's case. Hiding in plain sight: Moore had worked on a ship for many years before moving to Frankfort and settling in a tidy red-brick home with white columns along a tree-lined residential street . According to North Carolina Department of Public Safety prison records obtained by WHAS11, Clarence Moore, who also went by the name David Moore, had been convicted of larceny in July 1967. Moore told deputies in Kentucky that the charge stemmed from the theft of two television sets. He was originally scheduled to be released June 1, 1978. During his time as an outlaw, Moore had worked on a ship for many years before moving to Frankfort and settling in a tidy red-brick home with white columns along a tree-lined residential street. When in 2009 he was involved in a car crash, Moore gave his name as Ronnie Dickinson to protect his true identity. He is now facing a charge of contempt of court in Kentucky for misrepresenting himself to police five years ago. Prison break: Moore, then, 23 years old, took off from a prison formerly known as Polk Youth Institute in Butner in June 1972 .","Clarence David Moore was serving a sentence for larceny when in June 1972 he escaped from North Carolina prison .

"A skier in Switzerland proved that his dog is certainly his best friend when he brought it along to a snowy slope for a day of skiing. Videoed descending the crisp ski runs of the small resort of Minschuns in Val Müstair, Adrian Schaffner is initially featured ascending the mountain on a button lift. Perched on his shoulders looking entirely at ease is his dog Sintha – an Appenzeller mix according to the owner, who noted alongside the upload of the original video that he only knows the breed of the dog's mother. The dog named  Sintha appears to be entirely at ease as it sits across its owners shoulders . Once at the top, Mr Schaffner points his skis down the mountain and takes off at speed with the dog remaining calmly sat on his back. The dog appears to be enjoying the sensation of speed as it points its face into the wind and the camera angle changes to show the skier’s descent. After a long ski to the bottom, Mr Schaffner comes to a stop and the dog jumps from his shoulders and onto the ground.

The video concludes with the dog – who obviously loves snow – chasing after some more skiers as they make their way down another section of mountain. Discussing the video, Mr Schaffner wrote: ‘She grew up on a farm in the mountains pretty wild and more or less without any supervision. Mr Schaffner said the dog is used to being held because she spent a lot of time being carried after an accident .

So she was used to it from the beginning. ‘After some months her injuries completely healed – but we kept trying to prevent long walks in her first year – the doctor advised so. ‘That time I started to carry her on my back.

"More than half of Scots plan to back the SNP in the general election, shattering Ed Miliband's hopes of securing a Labour majority. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has been buoyed by a series of TV debates opposing austerity cuts, despite threatening another referendum on independence. A new TNS survey shows the SNP has almost doubled its lead over Labour in a month, with 52 per cent now backing Ms Sturgeon with only 24 per cent of Scots planning to vote for Mr Miliband. Scroll down for video . A new TNS survey shows the SNP has almost doubled its lead over Labour in a month, with 52 per cent now backing Ms Sturgeon with only 24 per cent of Scots planning to vote for Mr Miliband . The 28-point lead is nearly double last month's figure, when the parties scored 46 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. The Conservatives scored 13 per cent (down one percentage point), the Liberal Democrats 6 per cent (up three points) and the Greens 3 per cent (down one point). Support for Ukip in Scotland is 'almost negligible', TNS said. The SNP surge since the independence referendum in September puts Labour on course to lose dozens of seats, robbing Mr Miliband of any chance of winning the election outright. It comes on the day that Mr Miliband used Labour's manifesto launch to insist he is 'ready' to be Prime Minister. Ms Sturgeon has offered to work with Labour to lock the Tories out of power, even if David Cameron wins more seats on May 7. The poll is a blow to Mr Miliband on the day he used Labour's manifesto launch to insist he is 'ready' to be Prime Minister . But Labour and the SNP have clashed on Ms Sturgeon's call for full fiscal autonomy for Scotland, and her suggestion that another referendum could be held before 2020. The TNS survey covered the period of the UK-wide TV debates, although it closed before the impact of the Scottish leaders' TV debates could be taken into account. Tom Costley, head of TNS Scotland, said: 'The official election campaign has got off to a great start for the SNP, undoubtedly helped by Nicola Sturgeon's strong performance in the UK-wide TV debate. Not only has Labour's hopes of a recovery in support been dashed but, even worse, it appears to have gone backwards. 'The SNP seems to be building on the momentum which they carried forward from the independence referendum, while Jim Murphy is still struggling to win back Labour's lost supporters. Indeed, the latest poll shows some evidence that the growth in SNP support is mainly coming from disaffected Labour supporters. 'But it's important to remember that the campaign is really only beginning and 29 per cent of those who say they are certain to vote have not made up their minds who to vote for. It will be interesting to see what difference the campaigns of the various parties make to people's intentions by polling day.' Support for the SNP continues to be very strong among younger voters who are certain to vote and express a preference - 71 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds, against 57 per cent for 35 to 54-year-olds and 40 per cent for those aged . 55 and over. Among the oldest age group, Labour scores 32 per cent and the Conservatives 20 per cent. However, fewer of the younger voters say they are certain to vote - 52 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds against 67 per cent overall. In the event of a hung parliament, 44 per cent of Scottish voters would prefer a Labour-led government compared with 15 per cent who back a Tory-led administration. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has been buoyed by a series of TV debates opposing austerity cuts, despite threatening another referendum on independence . The most popular single option is a Labour-SNP coalition, with 25 per cent support. Both parties have ruled this out, but the response suggests that some form of SNP-Labour co-operation has significant backing, TNS said. The next most popular option is 9 per cent for the continuation of a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. Nearly a third (31 per cent) of Labour voters would prefer the option of co-operating with the SNP, while 28 per cent opted for a Labour minority government. If the SNP holds a majority of Scotland's 59 seats in a hung parliament, voters are evenly divided between those who want the SNP to work with Labour (34 per cent) and those who want the SNP to remain a separate bloc in the Westminster Parliament (32 per cent). SNP voters are also evenly divided - 42 per cent want to work with Labour and 45 per cent would want the party to remain separate. Ms Sturgeon yesterday  left the door open to a second referendum on Scottish independence before 2020. Before last year's historic vote, Scottish nationalists insisted it was a once-in-a-generation chance to decided on the future of the 300-year-old Union. But Ms Sturgeon has refused to rule out demanding a re-run within the next five years, prompting opponents to claim she had 'broken a promise the size of Ben Nevis'.","52% of Scots backing the SNP, doubling lead over Labour trailing on 24% .

"President Barack Obama proved he is very popular in Jamaica on Thursday. Crowds across the country cheered for President Obama as he made multiple stops and became the American president to visit the island nation since President Ronald Reagan in 1982. And it seems no one was more excited, or starstruck, than Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller. Scroll down for videos . President Barack Obama (above with Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller) became the first president to visit Jamaica since President Ronald Reagan in 1982on Thursday . Prime Minister Simpson Miller told President Obama the citizens of her country loved him, and she loved him as well . 'I just want to say to you, you might not know, but you are very loved in this country,' Prime Minster Simpson Miller told President Obama . 'So I just wanted to say you're well-loved in Jamaica. Well, first of all I can say to you publicly, 'I love you.'' Simpson Miller said she hoped Obama understood how important his visit is to Jamaica. 'It is a great pleasure to visit Jamaica, known for its beauty and the extraordinary spirit of its people,' Obama wrote as he signed the guest book at Jamaica House, where the prime minister and her staff have offices. 'May the deep and abiding friendships between our nations continue for generations to come.' Jamaican sprinters Usain Bolt (left) and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (right) watched President Obama as he spoke at a town hall . Jamaica's leader also asked President Obama to exonerate black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey, who was convicted in the U.S. of mail fraud in the 1920s. Prime Minister Simpson Miller says she told Obama that it is the 'deep desire of the government and people of Jamaica' to have Garvey exonerated of the U.S. criminal conviction that got him deported to Jamaica in 1927. She says she asked Obama to 'consider the matter and to offer any support within his authority.' Garvey was the first person named a Jamaican national hero following the island's independence in 1962. He died in 1940. Obama arrived in Jamaica late Wednesday. He met with Simpson Miller and other Caribbean prime ministers Thursday before departing for the Summit of the Americas in Panama. He is off for another historic meeting there, this time with Cuba's President Raul Castro. What's more, President Obama signaled Thursday he will soon remove Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism, boosting hopes for improved ties as he prepared for his encounter with President Castro. President Obama signaled Thursday while speaking in Jamaica he will soon remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism . Many at the town hall in Jamaica cheered and screamed 'I love you' as President Obama spoke . President Obama said the U.S. State Department had finished its review of Cuba's presence on the list, a stain on the island nation's pride and a major stumbling block for efforts to mend U.S.-Cuba ties. A top senator confirmed that the agency had recommended removing Cuba from the list, all but ensuring action by the president within days. 'We don't want to be imprisoned by the past,' said President Obama. 'When something doesn't work for 50 years, you don't just keep on doing it. You try something new.' With his optimistic assessment, Obama sought to set the tone for the U.S. and Cuba to come closer to closing the book on more than a half-century of estrangement, when he and Castro come face to face at the Summit of the Americas. Obama arrived Thursday evening in Panama City. The highly anticipated interaction with Castro will test the power of personal diplomacy as the two leaders attempt to move past the sticking points that have interfered with their attempt to relaunch diplomatic relations. Last night Secretary of State John Kerry met Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez in a Panama City hotel .

During the talk, Kerry at times gesticulated to Rodriguez with his hands as security officials stood guard outside. The US has long since stopped actively accusing Cuba of supporting terrorism, and Obama has hinted at his willingness to take Cuba off the list ever since he and Castro announced a thaw in relations in December. Yet Obama has stopped short of the formal decision amid indications that the White House was reluctant to grant Cuba's request until other thorny issues - such as restrictions on U.S. diplomats in Havana - were resolved. Cuba is one of just four countries still on the U.S. list of countries accused of repeatedly supporting global terrorism; Iran, Sudan and Syria are the others. The designation not only offends Cuba's pride but also restricts Havana's access to credit and financial systems. Cuban President Raul Castro (above) arrived in Panama Thursday, where he will attend a dinner with President Obama on Friday . Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Senate's foreign relations panel, called the recommendation to delist Cuba an important step toward forging a more productive U.S.-Cuba relationship. 'The United States has a unique opportunity to begin a fresh chapter with Cuba - one that advances our national interests on the island and in the hemisphere,' he said. Yet while recent polling has shown broad support for the thaw in both Cuba and the U.S., the change has attracted fierce opposition from many other members of Congress - especially those who represent the large Cuban-American population in Florida. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Thursday there were 'serious questions' about the wisdom of taking Cuba off the list 'while this dictatorship, which practices repression at home and supports violence throughout the region, continues to hold power.' This year's summit is the first to include Cuba, and for Castro it's a powerful opportunity to prove his country can be a responsible player on the world stage. President Obama arrives having amassed some goodwill in Latin America by upending the US policy of isolating Cuba, a policy that had irritated others in the region, and by loosening immigration policies at home. How much face time Obama and Castro will have at the summit was unclear. Although no formal meetings were scheduled, the White House said the two would surely cross paths. Obama and Castro shared a handshake in 2013 at Nelson Mandela's funeral, a jarring image for those who still recall the levels of US - Cuban antipathy during the Cold War. While in Panama, Obama was to meet Friday with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and other Central American leaders. He planned to speak at a forum of CEOs before joining other leaders for dinner at Panama Viejo, home to archaeological ruins dating to the 1500s. A visit to the Panama Canal was also likely. In a nod to lingering U.S. concerns about human rights and political freedoms, Obama is making a point to attend a forum bringing together both dissidents and members of the Cuban political establishment. On Wednesday, Castro supporters aggressively heckled a group of Cuban dissidents at a civil society forum in Panama City, drawing criticism from the U.S. Although taking Cuba off the terror list would remove one major obstacle to warming relations, Obama acknowledged that progress hasn't been as swift as some had hoped. Both nations called in December for quickly reopening embassies in each other's capitals - hopefully in time for the summit. That hasn't materialized, in part due to disagreements about U.S. diplomats' freedom of movement in Havana. The U.S. sees those restrictions as an attempt to stifle dissent by limiting Americans' interactions with Castro's political opponents. 'They are proceeding as I expected,' Obama said of the talks between Havana and Washington. 'I never foresaw that immediately, overnight, everything would transform itself.'","President Barack Obama became the first president to visit Jamaica since President Ronald Reagan in 1982 on Thursday .

"Trevor Noah has moved on to become a  US TV star, and he left behind a stunning South African physiotherapist to pursue his American dream, the Daily Mail Online can reveal. The new host of The Daily Show has separated from long term girlfriend Dani Gabriel after the pair had a heart to heart about his future plans. Noah has known Gabriel for at least four years and it’s believed they began dating early in 2014. The comedian quickly became smitten with the beautiful brunette and took her around the world to be by his side while on tour. But following behind-the-scenes talks earlier this year with Comedy Central – the producers of The Daily Show – it was clear Noah’s career was about to explode. Scroll down for video . Separated: Trevor Noah and his stunning South African girlfriend Dani Gabriel broke up after the pair discussed his future plans and exploding fame . Smooch: It's believed that the love birds started dating in early 2014 and have known each other for at least four years . Vacation: Noah and Gabriel, pictured here making silly faces while on holiday, reportedly separated a few months ago . Laughs: Though the pair split, a source close to Noah said that they are still friends, and Gabriel has said she 'couldn't be prouder' of her ex . Noah’s Lost in Translation comedy tour took him back to Cape Town from February 24 until March 1 and it’s likely he and Gabriel had a heart-to-heart during this time. Self-employed Gabriel, 28, runs her own physiotherapist practice in Cape Town and has several family members in the city meaning she will have been reluctant to relocate to America. A source close to Noah told Daily Mail Online: ‘Dani is an ex-girlfriend. They decided to go their separate ways and are not together anymore, they split a few months ago but are still friends.’ Despite the split Gabriel is still right behind Noah as he takes over from Jon Stewart in the biggest seat in world comedy. She told Daily Mail Online that she’s ‘very supportive’ of Noah’s newfound fame and has said she couldn’t be ‘prouder’ of her ex. And while previously little known Noah is set to become a household name for millions of people, Gabriel still doesn't see him as a ‘celebrity’. Speaking in Cape Town, she said: ‘Yes he’s going through this huge transition but at the end of the day he’s not a celebrity to me and he’s never treated himself like that and I don’t treat him like that, I don’t bring that in to my life.’ Gabriel was coy about their relationship and refused to discuss the split. She said: ‘I don’t need to show my support publicly for Trevor, it doesn’t need validating to anybody else besides me and him. Anything that needs to be said I’ve said to him personally. Goofing around: Noah, pictured here with Gabriel making funny faces at the camera, was in Cape Town for his comedy tour at the end of February. It's likely the couple talked about their relationship at this time . Having fun: The couple had several pictures together on Facebook, and Gabriel had a picture of the pair kissing as her main profile picture until recently . Adventures: Gabriel told Daily Mail Online that she's 'very supportive' of Noah's new-found fame, but would not discuss their relationship . Smiles:  Noah poses with a group of statues in one of Gabriel's many pictures of the two of them during their travels . ‘This world is not a very healthy one, so we can’t really involve ourselves in it now regardless of how big it is. ‘It doesn’t make a difference to my life. I don’t talk about my stuff, Trevor doesn’t talk about my stuff. ‘There’s really nothing more that I need to say, whatever’s there is there, beyond that, it is genuinely between me and him.’ But it's clear that Gabriel has struggled with the split, keeping her Facebook status as ‘in a relationship’ and keeping a large photo of the couple kissing on her home page wall. However, the physio quickly changed her wall photo to one of three pretty dresses when Daily Mail Online asked why she kept Noah’s picture on display now they've split. It’s a sad turn of events for the couple who had seemed madly in love. In January it was suggested the glamorous pair was even engaged – rumors Gabriel was quick to quell on Twitter. Dozens of intimate photos posted on their social media pages also gave the appearance of a couple very much in love. Noah, 31 – originally from Soweto near Johannesburg – even bought a love nest in Cape Town so he could be close to Gabriel during visits. Local media reports claimed the jet-setting comic snapped up a luxury penthouse apartment in the exclusive 15 on Orange Hotel in Cape Town’s city-center. Staff at the hotel – which boasts a roof top swimming pool and spa - say they spotted Noah at his apartment as recently as last Friday during a brief visit to Cape Town. Strong: Gabriel, who runs her own physiotherapy practice in Cape Town, is also a blue belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and has won gold medals in competitions . It’s believed Noah and Gabriel also bonded over their similar backgrounds in that they both have parents from different ethnic backgrounds against the backdrop of Apartheid in South Africa. Noah was born the son of a black South African woman and a white Swiss man who met when interracial relationships were illegal in South Africa. Gabriel runs her D Gabriel Physiotherapy practice out of the posh Virgin Active gym in Century City, Cape Town. And fortunately for Noah their split wasn’t a fiery affair as Gabriel is a blue belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. She became ‘hooked’ on the grappling based martial art in 2011 as she opened her practice and trains at the renowned Renzo Gracie Jiu Jitsu Academy. In June 2013 she won two gold medals for Gi and no-Gi in a Jiu Jitsu competition at the Mother City Winter Open. In a testimonial on a Jiu Jitsu enthusiasts’ site Gabriel says she has ‘trained hard’ and competed in various events around Cape Town to earn her blue belt. She has also trained at the Roger Gracie Academy in London and the Renzo Gracie Academy in New York while she was travelling with Noah. Jet-setting: When Noah brought Gabriel on tour last year, the couple posted selfies in front of several landmarks on Instagram . When she was in New York she got to meet Renzo Gracie, in person. Gabriel posted a photo on her Twitter feed posing next to the world-renowned Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu expert. And she is so crazy about the sport that during a trip to LA in August last year with Noah she dropped in on the Metamoris 4 Jiu Jitsu tournament. She told unan1mous.co.za: 'I genuinely love the sport and how it constantly challenges and equips your brain as much as your body. ‘More than anything, it gives you a universal language that gains you an instant family/home base when traveling. Just remember to pack in your gi and you’re good to go!’ During Noah’s US tour last year Gabriel posted loved-up couple selfies of them seeing the sites in New York and Washington on Instragram. On September 29 last year Gabriel tweeted the cover of GQ magazine featuring Noah. She wrote: ‘Oh, you know... Just perving over my bf on the new @GQdotcoza cover.’ Gabriel also regularly retweeted her boyfriend’s Twitter jokes and show dates and is a big fan of Daily Mail Online often posting stories from our site. And on January 27 this year while Noah was in America, Gabriel, who was clearly missing her boyfriend, tweeted: ‘Hey New York, get your s****together so my man can fly home. I need help opening this jar ;(.’ Judging by the photos they had shared, the pair would have made the perfect celebrity couple, especially if Gabriel had made the move to be by her man’s side in the States. On Valentine’s weekend last year Gabriel posted a series of stunning shots of them together on a boat sailing around the Cape Peninsula with Noah’s good friend, South African radio DJ Anele Mdoda and her boyfriend. Support: Even after the couple split, Gabriel has been supportive of Noah, having tweeted a proud message after it was announced that Noah would be Jon Stewart's replacement on The Daily Show . But after their split Gabriel was supportive. As recently as March 30, after news broke that Noah was Jon Stewart’s replacement, Gabriel tweeted: ‘I knew you had it in you and they saw it too Now the world gets to share it. Couldn't be prouder.’ But perhaps the writing had always been on the wall. Interestingly, while things seem to be going amazingly well in their relationship, Daily Mail Online has learned that Noah never introduced Gabriel to his family in Johannesburg. Mom Patricia, 56, revealed: ‘I’ve not met her, I don’t know anything about the two because Trevor hasn’t told me. ‘I leave the kids to enjoy themselves, I don’t ask about such things. As a mother I ask one favor from my sons, “keep your women away until you decide to settle with them”.' Patricia said one of Noah’s other ex-girlfriends was ‘controlling’ over him. ‘She was a German girl and I saw her and I really liked her, I was hooked. But then it was broken. She was very controlling over Trevor and he didn’t like that,’ she said. Even Noah admitted during an interview that one of his ex girlfriend’s tried to stop him from going in to comedy. He told Interview magazine in May, 2013: ‘I was dating her and I said, ""I want to be a comedian."" And she said, ""You're not that funny, don't be stupid."" So I said, ""Okay."" And I didn't do it. Then, after we broke up, I thought, This is the perfect time to do everything I couldn't do when I was with her, like date other girls and do comedy. So I did.’","Trevor Noah was in a relationship with South African beauty Dani Gabriel but the couple have split in recent months .

"Arizona officials who botched an investigation into the rape of a 13-year-old girl - allowing her rapist to continue to assault her for four years - have agreed to pay her $3.5 million. The payout by Maricopa County, which was revealed on Wednesday, comes after it emerged that Patrick Morrison continued to assault the mentally-disabled girl, his niece, and even got her pregnant when detectives failed to properly investigate the case. Her rape was among more than 400 sex-crime cases that were inadequately investigated or not looked into at all by Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office over a three-year period ending in 2007. Morrison, from Mesa, first raped his niece Sabrina Morrison in March 2007, and after she told a teacher the following day, authorities performed a rape kit on her. Payout: Sabrina Morrison, pictured left in an interview in 2012, will receive $3.5 million after sheriff's deputies failed to arrest her uncle, Patrick Morrison, right, after he raped her when she was 13 . Even though the kit showed traces of semen, the sheriff's deputies did not collect a blood sample from Patrick Morrison - as requested by the lab - and left him walking the streets. Sabrina's mother, Vikki Morrison, said her daughter was known to make up stories, so when sheriff's deputies told her the rape kit had shown no evidence of a rape, she believed them. 'I was told straight to my face there was no evidence of any trauma or any sexual assault, so we thought she was lying the whole time,' she told CBS5AZ in a 2012 interview. It meant that for the next four years, Morrison continued to rape his niece and even got her pregnant in 2009. But because of physical complications, the baby was aborted. He threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the assaults, Sabrina said as she spoke out about the ordeal in 2012. Her family said she was acting out so badly, that she was sent to live in a group home. Finally, four years after the initial attack, the case was re-opened and deputies gathered the blood sample from Morrison. The following year, he was arrested. Victim: Sabrina, pictured as a child, told a teacher she had been raped when she was 13 but authorities falsely said there was no evidence of the attack. It meant her uncle continued to rape her for four years . Locked up: The case was re-opened in 2011 and Morrison, pictured in court, was sentenced to 24 years . He pleaded guilty to one count of child molestation and two counts of attempted child molestation and was sentenced to 24 years in prison. 'That slipped through the cracks, we did due diligence after the fact that we found out, and we acted on it,' Sheriff Joe Arpaio explained at a Wednesday press conference. But the family was outraged. 'How do you feel when you find out your daughter's been telling you the truth and you didn't know it the whole time?' Vikki Morrison asked in the CBS interview. Sabrina's family filed a lawsuit against the department. The lawsuit alleged that the subsequent attacks on the girl could have been avoided if Arpaio's office arrested the suspect after he first abused her in March 2007. 'An eighth-grader could have solved this case,' attorney Charles Surrano said. 'They sat on the evidence, closed the case and never obtained the sample necessary to have the DNA testing done.' The decision to resolve the lawsuit marks the latest in a long string of legal settlements against Arpaio's office. Anger: Sabrina's mother, Vikki Morrison, said the sheriff's department had told her a rape kit showed there was no trace the teenager had been attacked, so she thought her daughter was lying . The county had previously paid more than $68 million in judgments, settlements and legal fees for the sheriff's office during Arpaio's 22-year tenure. Some settlements resolved lawsuits filed over the treatment of inmates in Arpaio's jails and the sheriff's failed corruption investigations of political foes. The settlement Wednesday applies only to Sabrina Morrison's lawsuit. It's unknown whether other victims in the botched investigations have filed similar lawsuits. The sheriff reflected on the legacy of the botched investigations at a Wednesday news conference, which was called to discuss a recent jail beating. 'We're talking about old history, but sometimes you learn from old history,' Arpaio said of the bungled cases. 'You try to do everything you can to hope that it never happens again.' He said he hopes the settlement money will go toward helping the victim and characterized the case's resolution as a good business decision, considering the girl's family had sought $30 million. Hot water: Her rape was among more than 400 sex-crime cases that were inadequately investigated or not looked into at all by the office of Sheriff Joe Arpaio (pictured) over a three-year period ending in 2007 . The sheriff apologized in December 2011 for the bungled cases, and his office has since said it has moved to clear up the investigation and taken steps to prevent the problem from happening again. An internal review attributed the failures to understaffing and mismanagement. A former supervisor says her investigators were pulled away from time to time to help with training efforts and Arpaio's immigrant-smuggling squad. But Maricopa County Supervisor Steve Gallardo said the sheriff failed to apologize to Sabrina Morrison as the settlement was reached, Fox10 reported. 'It's unconscionable that a mentally challenged girl be raped for four years… and law enforcement failed to act,' he said. The sheriff rejected the claim. '[Gallardo has] always been blasting me for the last five years, you don't think he'll say ""thank you Sheriff for rescuing all the animals,"" or ""Sheriff we feel sorry for your detectives"",' said Arpaio.","Patrick Morrison first raped his mentally-disabled niece Sabrina Morrison in 2007 and after she told a teacher, a rape kit was carried out .

"When it comes to playing tricks on people, especially parents it's important to know when to stop. However, this did not appear to cross the mind of teenager Lily Sharp, who lives in the UK, when she decided to prank her own mother. Rather than put a whoopie cushion on her chair or balance flower on top of a door, Lily decided to amuse herself by faking her own kidnapping- any parents worse fear. As mean-spirited as the joke appeared, Lily certainly took the steps in order to make the prank as convincing as possible. Scroll down for video . Lily Sharp perhaps took a joke too far after convincing her own mother she had been kidnapped . She began by texting her mother a seemingly innocent message: 'You didn't tell me the decorator man was coming mate!' Before adding in a quick reference from the famous Liam Neeson kidnapping film Taken. She continued: 'I thought I was guna get taken man. Thought he was tryna trick me into getting into the house' (sic) before adding, 'Not happy young lady.' Lily began her prank by convincing her mother that she had allowed a stranger to enter their home . She then took the prank a step further by pretending to her panicked mum that the intruder had her phone, informing her mother that the kidnapper would require £4000 for her return . Her suspicious mother replies immediately with: 'Whaaaat? What decorator?!?!! Call me. There is no decorator.' Lily then plays on her mother's fears by pretending that the intruder now has possession of the phone simply replying: 'She knows that now.' At this point Lily's mother is completely fooled and has become more frantic insisting that her daughter calls her immediately. 'Who knows it!! Call me please' she replies before adding, 'Now' After her mother reveals that she is sending the police round Lily reveals that it was all a trick . She convinces her mother by sending a picture of herself, her mother does not find it amusing . At this point many would have called their panicking parent however Lily decides to take it up a notch. 'My name is Victor' she replies before demanding a ransom 'I have your child. I want £4000 to get her back.' Lily's mother tries to keep calm texting back: 'Sending a neighbour round now' But Lily simply insights more panic in her mother when she replies: 'Good luck with that. I've already gone. She's with me.' At this point Lily's mother informs who she believes to be the intruder that she has called the police: 'Ok well police will be.' Lily attempts one more cheeky text as the intruder with 'She says hello' before revealing that it was all a trick. She then reassures her mum by sending a picture of herself perched on their sofa. Predictably the mother does not take this well ending the conversation by swearing at her daughter. Although her mother may not have found the joke funny, after posting a photo of the messages on Twitter, Lily received 18,000 retweets and 25,000 favourites.","Lily Sharp convinced her mother that she had been kidnapped .

"Most people might believe that being covered in face tattoos would make it impossible to land a job; but for one inked-up Canadian man the decision to cover his head, neck and arms in crude body art has actually earned him a lucrative career as a model. Vin Los, 24, gained notoriety last year for his tattoo-covered visage and his dreams of becoming the most famous man in the world; despite facing heavy criticism about his unique ink, Vin insisted that the Sharpie-like tattoos on his face, neck, chest, and arms 'embody pop culture', create 'a myth, a mystery' and would one day help him to achieve his goal of global fame. And while many may have doubted his chances of succeeding, it seems his unique look has actually started to pay off, as the Montreal-based model has landed a campaign for underwear brand Garçon Model. Scroll down for video . Inked in his underwear: Vin Loss, 24, stars in a new campaign for underwear brand Garçon Model that showcases his extensive body art . Baring it all: Modeling underwear allows Vin to show off his many tattoos, which include the names of cities like Baghdad, San Francisco, New York, and Kuala Luampur . The ads, which feature Vin posing in boxer briefs, put his tattoos on full display, spotlighting phrases like 'scream my name', 'iconic face', and 'my man is str8', as well as tattooed-on chest hair. 'You could look at me in a hundred years from now and really get the idea of what pop culture was like in the early 2010s,' he told Vice last year, adding that the words and phrases he chooses are inspired by YouTube songs, places, and other 'superficial' things. 'I want to be an image for people to look at, something that has an impact,' he says. 'Everybody who sees me is bound to ask questions: “Why fame? What’s his life like?”' Art history: Vin says he got his first tattoo around the age of 16; it's the logo for Le Coq Sportif on his chest . Flashing his fame: One of his most prominent tattoos, the word 'fame' written across his forehead summarizes Vin's biggest goal . Vin's extensive body art has taken him years to cultivate — while he now has 24 tattoos on his face and others on his arms, neck, chest, legs, and stomach, he started with a single rendering of the Le Coq Sportif logo when he was 16. He also insists that his tattoos are real, and has gone so far as to prove the designs are permanent by filming himself washing up, in order to show that the ink doesn’t come off when scrubbed. 'If I was indecisive, I don’t think I would write on my face,' he explains. Don't forget this face: Vin likes that his many tattoos make him memorable and thinks they make him a 'myth' and a 'mystery' Adding them up: Vin has 24 tattoos on his face alone, including the words 'guilty', 'play', and 'famous' Before breaking into modeling, Vin worked at a supermarket where he says he 'wanted to die'; now he hopes to build an empire and bring a paparazzi culture to his hometown of Montreal because he is disappointed that the city doesn't have a 'star system'. He also designs wallets, which he sells for $98 on his newly-launched website. Vin is not the first heavily-tattooed model to use his body art to earn modelling gigs; photographer Christian Saint recently released a book called Tattoo Super Models that features women covered in ink.","Vin Los, 24, poses in boxer briefs for underwear brand Garçon Model .

"Former Olympic swimmer Eamon Sullivan has revealed the details of his romantic proposal to his girlfriend, Perth lawyer Naomi Bass. The smitten couple were holidaying in Japan and were out for a walk one evening when Bass mentioned how the beautiful setting among the cherry blossom trees would be perfect for a proposal, Sullivan, 29, told Woman's Day. The sporting hero has won two silver Olympic medals and a number of gold and bronze at the Commonwealth games. 'We were walking one night and came across a lone tree in full bloom, complete with white doves,' he told the magazine. Scroll down for video . Former Olympic swimmer Eamon Sullivan and girlfriend Naomi Bass recently got engaged on a trip to Japan . The couple met in Perth in 2011, and Sullivan proposed to Bass beneath a cherry blossom tree in Kyoto . 'Naomi said ""Gee this is so romantic; it would be a good spot for someone to propose"". So i dropped to one knee and asked her to marry me,' the former swimmer revealed. Sullivan said he had planned to pop the question on that trip, but not until a few days later. However he took the opportunity and surprised his girlfriend so much she wasn't even able to respond straight away. Bass, 28, told Woman's Day she was so overwhelmed that she just 'kept laughing and crying' and had to calm herself down before she could respond. Her now-fiance presented her with a two-carat solitaire set among 14 pale pink diamonds the colour of cherry blossoms, a reminder of where the special moment took place.

"Rating: . Poets House is a swish new hotel in Ely, a three-minute walk from the cathedral, offering terrific value. It's quite a venture - and must have been a huge investment. There are 21 rooms, all with copper standalone baths placed near luxurious double beds. I keep thinking about Phil Neville, the former England footballer whose home once appeared in Hello! and which forever more is held as the gold standard for unadulterated bling. Which is to say that Poets House is glossy and lavish, but manages to stay on the right side of kitsch, not least because the finish is so good. There isn't a scuff in sight. State of the art: Poets House is as much a Sex And The City retreat as a hideaway in genteel Ely . No, it might not be to all tastes (there are mirrors everywhere with poetry written on them, such as lines from Kipling: 'Since my house to thy house no greater can send than thy house but my house, friend comforting friend') and the floors are given over to black-and-white squares with embedded stars. But you would be hard pressed not to have a good time here. We arrive on a wet blustery evening. I pop into reception and ask where we can park and am told to leave the car exactly where it is. Valet parking will sort it at no extra charge. Then a man who says he has a Hungarian father and German mother escorts us purposefully to our room, opens the door and says: 'You have every shade of grey in here.' He must have used the line dozens of times, but still gets a kick from it. We unpack our whips (sorry, wash bags) before hurrying down to the shiny, funky bar and order two glasses of bubbly. Black and white: Poets House incorporates smart, clean lines, elegant décor and crisp white tablecloths . We're in the zone, sitting on stools at the flashy bar as if auditioning as extras for a Sex And The City sequel, and have to pinch ourselves that this is Ely. The main dining room is a more formal, carpeted affair with crisp, white tablecloths and huge, bulbous wine glasses. There's an amuse bouche (naturally), followed by impressive, but over-elaborate, scallops and then perfectly cooked steaks. Back in our room, there are gadgets galore: a TV that connects to the internet, a Bose sound system accessible via Bluetooth, a tablet computer playing the role of the hotel directory. The carpet is thick, the shiny bedhead and curtains so over the top they make us chuckle. After breakfast, we tell a member of staff that we want to visit the cathedral. 'Just leave everything packed in your room and we will put it all your car, which will be waiting for you when you return.' It is, too. Poets House used to be an old people's home. For any lingering ghosts from those days, it must seem like a thousand years ago. Poets House . St Mary's Street Ely . Cambridgeshire . CB7 4EY . 01353 887777 . www.thehousecollection.com .

"Dramatic footage has emerged of the moment police in Texas pulled an unconscious man from the burning wreckage of his car mere moments before it was engulfed by flames. Officers in Mesquite early Sunday came upon the burning SUV belonging to 25-year-old Hector Valles, who was unresponsive and wedged behind the wheel. Valles' clothes had begun to burn as Officers Ryan Nielson and Autumn Soto finally unpinned him from the car and pulled him down onto the safety of the interstate service road. Certain death: Police in Mesquite, Texas arrived to find a crashed car burning as the driver lay unconscious behind the wheel . Pulled him out: The dashcam rolled as Officers Ryan Nielson and Autumn Soto managed to get 25-year-old Hector Valles out of his SUV and stamp out his burning clothes . Moments later, while Nielson and Soto were still dragging Valles across the pavement, the fire in his SUV erupted ever further, fully engulfing the interior. Bystanders alongside Valles car can be heard yelling, 'He's still breathing' in the dashcam footage that shows Nielson and Soto's heroic rescue. The level-headed officers tell Valles 'Relax dude,' and 'c'mon man' before realizing he's out cold. Officer Soto can be heard begging him to 'Stay with us' as they drag Valles' limp form along the concrete and out of harm's way. Tense seconds pass before Valles can be seen to move his body on his own as the relieved officers assure him help is on the way. Nick of time: While the officers were still dragging Valles across the pavement, flames fully engulfed the interior of his car . 'Stay with us!': Valles was unresponsive and some tense moments pass in the footage before he's seen to move under his own power . He was transported to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, the Morning News reports, where he remained hospitalized in the intensive care unit as of Monday. Valles' mother Olivia Valles told KDFW that her son was going to pull through as she thanked the officers who made his recovery possible. 'We would like to thank the Mesquite police officers and witnesses whose heroic efforts saved our son,'  Olivia Valles said in a statement. 'Hector is strong. He is a fighter. We are thankful to the Lord that he is here, he is recovering and is in good hands.' Meanwhile, Hector's accident remained under investigation Monday as police revealed only that he crashed into a steel pillar after swerving off I-30 and onto the adjacent service road. Victim: By Monday, it remained unclear why 25-year-old Valles (pictured) veered off of I-30 before crashing into a pillar, nearly ending his life Sunday .

"Easter is over for the wild rabbits of greater Sydney as councils and parks prepare another attempt to kill them off with strategically placed carrots that have been laced with a deadly virus. Public land managers are desperate to reduce the most recent 'significantly rampant population' of the pest, which causes millions of dollars of major agricultural and environmental damage each year. 'This year, because of really high summer rainfall - which led to great food availability - there has been a big surge in the rabbit population in Sydney. They are really abundant,' Graham Wilson, the manager of biosecurity at Greater Sydney Local Land Services, told Daily Mail Australia. Feral rabbits, which are deemed a pest in NSW, are liekly to br targeted with the Calicivirus, also known as Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), in May . It comes after over 30 government bodies scattered carrots laced with calicivirus around public areas in March . 'The way we introduce the calicivirus in rabbit populations is first we chop regular carrots up and distribute them to different areas and see if they are going to eat them. 'Then, the virus is produced in a laboratory with spreading agents and its mixed with carrots - so that it's coating the carrots - and then we take them and give them to councils to put out where they want.' While rabbits under one year old have a higher chance of surviving, about 70-100 per cent of rabbits die once infected with the calicivirus, also known as rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), which damages the animal's liver and gut and causes haemorrhaging and bleeding. The program has been implemented annually for the last nine years as a way of managing the pests and 'bringing the population back down again before damage becomes too severe,' Mr Wilson said. 'In other parts of NSW this virus spreads naturally, but you get bushland fragmented by houses and things in urban areas so we are just artificially introducing it into these places.' The feral animals compete with native wildlife for food and habitat and are believe to be responsible for the extinction of and population decline of a number of mammals. They also damage vegetation and prevent its regeneration by feasting on seedlings. About 30 public land managers and councils in Sydney, across 160 localities, scattered the infected vegetable in public areas in March, but a second smaller scale program is likely to be implemented in May across 10 areas as well as the Central Coast. 'It's just because in some areas the numbers have shown the rabbit populations haven't gone down as much as we'd like,' Mr WIlson said. Pet owners are being urged to vaccinate their domestic rabbits, but Mr Wilson assured the virus does not harm cats, dogs or humans. Rabbits were introduced to Australia by the British settlers in the First Fleet. They breed quickly, producing up to five litters of five young each year, and can be found right across Australia in various habitats . 'It's important that people who own pet rabbits vaccinate for calicivirus now to ensure that if their domestic rabbit comes in contact with the virus, which is mainly spread by contact between other rabbits and insects, they are immune.' While there are fears of immunity building in local populations, a test ahead of this year's program implementation found only 20 per cent of the local population was immune. 'This means you'd get about an 80 per cent population reduction and that makes a big difference in terms of the damage that they're doing,' Mr Wilson said. Rabbits were introduced to Australia by the British settlers with the First Fleet. They breed quickly, producing up to five litters of five young each year, and can be found right across Australia in various habitats.","Rabbit populations are rampant in greater Sydney due to high summer rain .

"Quarter of a century after his last number one, Paul Simon is back at the top of the charts. The 73-year-old - who rose to fame as part of Simon & Garfunkel - has forged ahead of more youthful musicians to reach number one in the UK album chart with The Ultimate Collection. His album outsold those by the likes of Ed Sheeran, James Bay and Sam Smith. Number one: Paul Simon topped the UK albums chart for the first time in 25 years. His latest release, The Ultimate Collection, beat albums from more youthful musicians such as Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith . Simon's recent tour with Sting (left) is believed to have been the catalyst in helping to propel him to the top of the charts. It is the first time he has reached the top of the album chart since The Rhythm of the Saints in 1990 . The greatest hits record includes 19 tracks from Simon’s 50-year career, including Mrs Robinson and The Only Living Boy in New York, from his days recording and performing as Simon & Garfunkel with Art Garfunkel, prior to their break up in the 1970s, and some of his solo hits such as 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover. It marks a return to popularity for the Grammy Award-winning singer, 73, as the first time he has reached the top of the album chart since The Rhythm of the Saints in 1990. Simon is currently on his On Stage Together world tour with Sting. It is thought the success of the pair’s live shows, which have been met with rave reviews, is what propelled the album to number one.

"The woman falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo has been snapped cutting lines of a suspicious-looking white powder. Sarah Watson, 34, had a brief liaison with the Manchester United defender at a Christmas party for the team. But the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort £100,000 from the footballer. Sarah Watson, who was falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo, has been snapped with a suspicious white powder . Ms Watson is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of the unknown white powder on the glass table . The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her. Last month a judge  ruled the player had tried to buy her off to keep his cheating secret from his partner, and Rojo was ordered to pay her £25,000 legal costs. 'I just wish I'd never got involved with the likes of them,' she said after the court case. 'This has been a total nightmare. Now pictures have emerged which appear to reveal Ms Watson's party girl lifestyle. In one, she is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of an unknown white power in Las Vegas. In another, she is pictured with a kingsize roll-up while in one, a scantily clad Ms Watson is seen making a V-sign as she poses on the bonnet of a police car. A close friend told the Mirror that single Ms Watson was a regular at trendy spots San Carlo and Neighbourhood in Manchester. The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo (left) and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her . It was a last-minute decision to go for a 'girls' night out' with six friends in December last year that landed Sarah in her gruelling legal fight. The 34-year-old had met Rojo at Manchester United's private Christmas party in a Manchester bar. She said the footballer had approached her and complimented her looks and dress. Despite calling his approach 'cheesy', she had decided to give him her phone number. Later that evening Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. 'My love, where are you?' he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's – known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit – made a shocking proposition. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed . 'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.' But she did find the Argentine star's dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. 'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. She had been shocked when he started bombarding her with astonishingly explicit messages and naked photos. But she rapidly found herself pitched against the might of the football club, the spoiled multi- millionaire player and lawyers who act for several Manchester United stars who went to extreme lengths to keep the story out of the papers. She was depicted in court – and in the national press – as a scheming blackmailer who demanded £100,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. Rojo's wife, Eugenia Lusardo (pictured with Rojo last month) is a lingerie model . And it was on this basis that the player's lawyers obtained a High Court order preventing her from speaking out. ‘People who look after Marcos claimed I had demanded £100,000 to keep quiet about our encounter,’ she said.. ‘But it was a lie and they knew it. They tried to trap me.’ ‘I didn’t set out to do a kiss and tell, but the chance to make some money to pay for my personal training course was very tempting. I’m a single woman and I had not done anything illegal or that I was ashamed of. '[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me £100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah's estimated £25,000 legal costs. The defender has not spoken about the incident publicly, while his friend Bereit - who Sarah claims offered her the money - declined to comment.","Sarah Watson had a brief liaison with married footballer Marcus Rojo .

"Emergency services in Laos have recovered a body in the search for Johanna Powell, from Cardiff. The 37-year-old is feared to have drowned while on holiday in Laos after a tourist boat she was travelling in hit a rock and sank in the Mekong river . A body has been recovered in the search for a missing BBC worker, who is feared to have drowned while on a dream holiday in south east Asia. Johanna Powell, a picture editor working for BBC Wales, was reported missing on Saturday after a cruise boat she was in hit a rock and sank 'within a minute'. The 37-year-old was sailing on a traditional wooden cruise boat along the Mekong river in Laos with three friends when it hit a rock in a stretch of rapids. The crew, tour guide and other passengers - including her friends - all swam to safety, but Ms Powell, from Cardiff, disappeared in the strong current. Rescuers launched a massive search along 20km of the river to try and find her, in one of the most isolated parts of the country. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) confirmed a body has been found, but it has not yet been identified. A BBC Wales spokeswoman said: 'We are aware that a body has been found in the area where Jo went missing following a boating incident on Saturday. 'Our thoughts remain with her family, friends and colleagues at this difficult time.' Ms Powell - who combined working at the BBC with helping to run a hotel - was in the country as part of a three-week holiday, starting in Bangkok. One of her group was marking their 40th birthday . Ms Powell was travelling on a boat like this along the Mekong river, when it hit a rock in a stretch of rapids. While the rest of the passengers and crew managed to swim to safety, she disappeared under the water . A spokesman for BBC Wales, where Ms Powell worked as a picture editor, said they were 'very concerned' about their missing colleague. The Foreign Office confirmed a British national has been reported missing . They spent Friday night on the chartered boat, and had an overnight stay at the DP guesthouse in the village of Pakbeng. The boat set sail at 8am on Saturday, before the accident happened at 9.30am. Passengers on the trip are not required to wear life-jackets and one survivor said the water was very rough 'like a washing machine'. 'It was terrifying. We all thought we were going to die', she added. Her brother-in-law Dean Price said the family was told she was asleep when the boat hit a rock in rapids causing it to tip, take on water and capsize, said the BBC. The tragedy happened in a remote part of Laos in the Mekong river, pictured.  Emergency services in the country have now launched a massive search, covering 20km of the river, to try and find missing Ms Powell . A work colleague described Cardiff resident Ms Powell, 37, as 'lovely, outgoing and always smiling' Adisak Star, the co-owner of cruise company Negi of Mekong that owned the boat, said they did not know what happened to her. He said: 'Ms Powell was travelling with three women friends who have all been accounted for. 'The boat which has a steel bottom but is otherwise made of wood hit a rock in the rapids and sank in a minute. It was that fast. 'Everyone on board went into the water but there were rocks for people to cling to. 'They were all able to get to the river bank except for Ms Powell.' Friends in Cardiff are taking care of her dog called Agatha Christie. A work colleague, who asked not to be named, paid tribute to the University of East Anglia graduate, saying: 'She is lovely, outgoing and always smiling. 'She had been looking forward to the trip for a long time.' After the accident her friends and the other survivors were taken to Luang Prabang and have been flown to Vientiane where they were being dealt with by consular officials. The owner of the cruise company whose boat sank while Ms Powell was a passenger vowed they would not give up looking for her. The survivors of the accident clung to rocks on the Mekong river to help keep afloat . Alex Chitdara, co-owner of rival company Shompoo Cruise said the accident happened on a very isolated stretch of the Mekong river. 'There are few roads and no telephones or mobile phone signal', he said. 'The water level is low, you have to know what you are doing to get a boat that big through the rapids.'","Johanna Powell from Cardiff is feared to have drowned in the Mekong river .

"Cadbury has snatched two chocolate Fingers from its famous packs – reducing the number to 22. The move is the latest evidence of how the nation’s favourite brands and supermarkets are cutting back on pack sizes without a corresponding cut in prices. The ploy means shoppers are being subject to stealth price rises in what economists have dubbed ‘shrinkflation’. Going down: Cadbury has snatched two chocolate Fingers from its famous packs – reducing the number to 22 . Now 114 grams: Cadbury chocolate Fingers have come down by 11g - the equivalent of two chocolate Fingers . In most cases, the price remains the same when the amount in the pack is cut, however in some rare examples the change comes with a price rise. Packs of Cadbury chocolate Fingers have come down by 11 grams – the equivalent of two chocolate Fingers – to a weight of 114g. While the popular biscuits carry the Cadbury brand, they are actually made under licence by another manufacturer, Burton’s Biscuit Company, which is responsible for the changes. Burton’s said it did reduce the wholesale price of the packs to supermarkets to reflect the lower weight, but it had no say over whether this was passed this on to customers. The price at Sainsbury’s has risen from £1 to £1.50 over the past year, however it has come down from £1 to 80p at Tesco, according to figures from the MySupermarket website. Last month, the Daily Mail revealed how the makers of PG Tips have reduced the amount of tea in its teabags – cutting the weight of a box of 80 by the equivalent of six teabags . From the archive: Boxes of Cadbury FIngers weighed 150g when this photograph was taken in March 2002 . Makers: The popular biscuits are made under licence by another manufacturer, Burton’s Biscuit Company, which is responsible for the changes. Its head office is pictured (above) in St Albans, Hertfordshire . We also detailed how the Kit Kat Chunky is less chunky than it used to be after it was reduced in weight from 48g to 40g. When challenged, the manufacturer, Nestle, claimed this was partly because of rising costs and partly because of its desire to help customers lose weight as its contribution to the Government’s anti-obesity campaign. In the news: The makers of PG Tips have reduced the amount of tea in its teabags – cutting the weight of a box of 80 by the equivalent of six teabags . Tesco reduced the size of cartons of pasta sauce, such as Tomato & Mascarpone, from 375g to 350g yet the price remained the same and it was still promoted as serving two people. John West cut the size of its tins of No Drain Tuna Steak from 130g to 120g, but again there has been no corresponding fall in the price. Cadbury has something of a track record for shrinking packs in a move that protects its profits. It famously cut back on the number of crème eggs in its multi-packs ahead of Easter from five to six. Before Christmas, Burton’s reduced its £5 Cadbury Collection biscuits from 380g to 335g. In 2011, Cadbury reduced the size of the 140g bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk to 120g, so losing the equivalent of two chunks. It then cut the size of its traditional circular Roses tins from 975g to 850g – effectively snatching away 11 of the chocolate favourites. The firm was taken over by Kraft of the US in 2010 in a deal worth £11.5billion, which has come under fire for a series of cost cutting measures that have undermined the historic British brand. The firm’s American bosses have never been forgiven for reneging on a promise to keep open a Cadbury factory at Keynsham, near Bristol, when it took over the company. They have also come under fire for shifting large parts of their chocolate production to cheaper facilities in Poland. No corresponding fall in the price: John West cut the size of its tins of No Drain Tuna Steak from 130g to 120g . Which? recently highlighted a number of big brands that have been shrunk, such loaves of Hovis ‘Best of Both’ bread are down from 800g to 750g; Birds Eye Select Mixed Vegetables down from 750g to 690g; Aunt Bessie’s Homestyle Chip are 50g lighter at 700g; and Philadelphia Light Soft Cheese is down 20g to 180g. The executive director at Which?, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘Shrinking products can be a sneaky way of putting up costs for consumers because pack sizes shrink but the prices don’t. ‘It’s now time for action on dodgy pricing practices that stops people from easily comparing products to find the cheapest.’ The Food and Drink Federation said: ‘Food and drink pricing always reflects the economic climate of the day, whether that’s the impact of changing utility prices or ingredient costs which can be volatile. ‘Businesses seek to offset these costs wherever possible through improvements in efficiency and productivity, but these actions can only go so far and in some cases companies will reduce the pack size rather than increasing the price for consumers.’ Burton’s confirmed the reduction in the pack size and insisted the chocolate fingers remain good value.","Packs of Cadbury Fingers have come down by 11 grams to weight of 114g .

"A San Fransisco Giants fan beaten and left for dead outside the LA Dodgers' stadium in March 2011 has thrown the first pitch of the new baseball season . Bryan Stow  was left severely brain damaged after two men attacked him on his way to the car park following a game. The father-of-two, who had been a paramedic, was left in a medically induced coma for several months while medics waited for the swelling in his brain to subside.

They continued to punch and kick the stricken paramedic. Several of the most serious blows landed on his head causing life-changing  injuries. At the time of his injury, Mr Stow worked as a paramedic for the San Jose Giants, who are the Giants' farm team. The team promised Mr Stow and his family that he would receive the honour of pitching the first ball during the opening game of the season. Dan Oram, president of the San Jose Giant told Fox Bay News: 'It's a comeback story. Just to see what he's come through, and to be able to give him something back like this — it's just the kind of thing that resonates with everybody.' Last year, Stow shouted 'Play Ball' during a World Series match between the Giants and Kansas City Royals. Following the brutal assault, Los Angeles Superior Court awarded Mr Stow and his family $18 million against the LA Dodgers and the two men  who attacked him Louie Sanchez and Marvin Norwood. However, the family has still not received any of the cash due legal delays. Before suffering catastrophic injuries, right, Mr Stow, right, worked as a paramedic in San Jose . Louie Sanchez, left, and Marvin Norwood, right, were jailed for eight and seven years respectively . Both Sanchez and Norwood faced a criminal trial where they were jailed for eight and four years respectively.

As a result of the assault, Mr Stow has been left permanently brain damaged and has short-term memory problems. He also relies on a walker and a wheelchair when travelling long distances. Mr Stow spent two years in a specialist hospital until his insurance company refused to continue paying . Police said the men were looking to assault a random San Fransisco Giants fan in March 2011 .

"TV presenter and motorcycle racer Guy Martin is facing a police probe after boasting of reaching speeds of up to 180mph in a 40mph zone while reviewing the new Aston Martin. The 33-year-old, who presents Speed with Guy Martin on Channel 4, wrote a review of the Vanquish Carbon Edition supercar, which costs £203,000, after test driving it on the Isle of Man's TT course. He wrote of how he pressed the accelerator 'flat to the floor' before seeing the speedometer reach 180mph as he entered the village of Sulby, which is part of the TT race and has a speed limit of 40mph. TV presenter and motorcycle racer Guy Martin, who is facing a police probe after boasting he drove an Aston Martin at 180mph in a 40mph zone during a review . In the review published in the Sunday Times Driving magazine, he wrote: 'I saw 180mph down Sulby Straight, one of the fastest sections of the course, and the car wasn't even in top gear.' He also added of how he roared around the course at 6am in the morning and that he probably completed the course only two minutes shy of the record for a car, which is 19 minutes and 26 seconds. Mr Martin also wrote: 'As soon as I passed Union Mills, on to a section with no speed limit, I thought: “Right, let’s have it.” 'I was revving with excitement. I hadn't been trying to set a time; I just wanted to see what the car would do an a road I knew well and it was something like a 22-minute lap.' Mr Martin was driving an Aston Martin Vanquish, similar to the one pictured, when he claimed he reached the top speed .

"When it comes to glamour, the bride is expected to be the centre of attention on her big day. But when Andy Murray and his long-term girlfriend tie the knot today, Kim Sears will have stiff competition from the mothers. Judy Murray, 55, who has had a makeover since her appearance on Strictly Come Dancing last year, is said to have spent months planning her outfit. But she could be outshone by Leonore Sears, 53, who has long been admired on the tennis circuit by gentlemen of a certain vintage. Scroll down for video .

"Ed Miliband pledged to crackdown on the illegal exploitation of migrant workers by promising a Home Office task force to boost prosecutions and fines on bad employers. Exploitation has driven low-skilled migration and held down wages for British workers, the Labour leader said during an outing in Wirral West earlier today. A new unit of 100 staff would work with the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, specialist police units and Home Office enforcement staff, he added. But Nigel Farage and Tory Immigration Minister James Brokenshire dismissed Mr Miliband's ideas and said he was doing nothing to control immigration. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband, pictured during his speech today, pledged to crackdown on the illegal exploitation of migrant workers by promising a Home Office task force to boost prosecutions and fines on bad employers . The Ukip leader said he was right about some migrants being exploited but insisted it was not the main issue. He told Sky News: 'It's a big diversion. Is he right that some people who come here are exploited and abused? Yes of course he's right, there's no doubt there are problems out there. 'But it is not the main issue. The main issue is we have too many people allowed to come here which is pushing down people's wages.' In his speech Mr Miliband insisted that there was an 'epidemic of exploitation'. He said: 'So many of the secure jobs that once defined the places people live have gone. 'Low pay. Low skills. Temporary jobs. Poor prospects. Zero hours contracts. This is the story of our economy for so many people in this country. 'And it is in these low skill, insecure workplaces where migrant labour is often concentrated. 'Too often this anything-goes economy damages the interests of the working people of the country. People who live in the most appalling, cramped conditions, sleeping 20 to a house; people who are paid well below the minimum wage; people who have their wages stolen.' But Nigel Farage (right) and Tory Immigration Minister James Brokenshire (left) dismissed Mr Miliband's ideas and said he was doing nothing to control immigration . In his speech in Pensby, northern England, Mr Miliband insisted that there was an 'epidemic of exploitation' He added that the exploitation was driving down standards for other employers. 'It makes it harder for responsible employers to do the right thing and pay decent wages,' he said. 'It is an epidemic of exploitation and we will end it.' He also used the speech to promise Labour would do more to secure the borders - with 1,000 extra staff at ports - and help integration. This will include requiring people to speak English, particularly when they work in the public sector and NHS. Mr Miliband said: 'Labour got it wrong in the past. We have listened. We have learned and we have changed. 'Let me be clear. It is not prejudiced to be concerned about immigration. As Prime Minister, I will always address concerns not ignore them. As Prime Minister, I will always put working families first. 'That's why we'll have proper controls and rules because at the heart of our programme in 2015 is working people.' He even referred to his parents fleeing to Britain from Nazi Germany in an attempt to win the audience round. The Labour leader, pictured greeting staff and students at Pensby High School, also used the speech to promise Labour would do more to secure the borders - with 1,000 extra staff at ports - and help integration . Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron (left) took part the Vaisakhi Nagar Kirtan procession at Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara with his wife Samantha (right) He said: 'They found a country that welcomed them and offered them the opportunity to build a new life. To start a family. To work hard and make a contribution. 'I wouldn't be standing here today, asking you to elect me your Prime Minister, if it wasn't for the generosity of this great country.' Steve Murphy, general secretary of the building workers union Ucatt, said: 'This commitment demonstrates that Labour is serious about ending the misery caused by the exploitation of migrant workers and rightly targets the employers who profit through the mistreatment of workers.’ But Mr Brokenshire, speaking before Mr Miliband's speech, said that 'nothing' in Labour’s proposal would help. He said: 'Labour sent out ""search parties for people"" and under them net migration increased more than five-fold. 'Since 2010, the Conservatives have stripped more than 850 bogus colleges of their rights to sponsor foreign students, cracked down on illegal working and sham marriages, made it harder for people to live in the UK illegally and reduced the number of appeal routes to stop spurious attempts to remain in the country. 'And the next Conservative government will seek changes to the operation of European free movement rules as a key part of our plan to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU. ‘A vote for Ed Miliband would risk all of that with a Labour-SNP stitch up.'","Exploitation drives low-skilled migration and holds down wages, he said .

Passenger Jin Pai, 35, was standing on the rim of a toilet in Hefei Xinqiao International Airport in the city of Hefei, the capital city of eastern China's Anhui Province, when it smashed to the ground. According to airport officials he had not wanted to let his bottom touch the seat because he was 'worried it might not be clean'. Passenger Jin Pai, 35, was standing on the rim of a toilet when it collapsed, leaving him hospitalised . The smashed up toilet in Hefei Xinqiao International Airport in the city of Hefei . But he was caught out when the porcelain toilet then tipped over and shattered on the floor, cutting the man in several places. The injured man was found bleeding on the toilet floor after he had telephoned his travelling companions for help. He had been too embarrassed to shout for help and had hoped they would assist but he was too badly hurt for anything other than an immediate trip to hospital. Authorities and emergency personnel arrived to check the man into a Hefei hospital, where he received several dozens stitches on his left leg and buttocks. Then man broke the toilet in Hefei Xinqiao International Airport in the city of Hefei .

"Murder-accused teenager Heather Mack was today given the star treatment in the Bali prison where she is being held over her mother's death. The ‘body in suitcase’ teen and her baby received a personal visit from a government minister who offered extra comforts. Mack, 19, from Chicago, could spend 15 years in jail for the murder of her mother, 62-year-old socialite Sheila von Wiese-Mack, whose body was then stuffed inside a suitcase. Scroll down for video . Behind Bars: Heather Mack has been keeping her baby with her in a crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison . Yasona Laoly, Indonesia’s Justice and Human Rights Minister, has offered Mack the chance to place the baby with a family to care for the child . Indonesia’s Justice and Human Rights Minister called in unexpectedly at Kerobokan Prison to visit the teen . Yasona Laoly, Indonesia’s Justice and Human Rights Minister, called in unexpectedly at Kerobokan Prison, where the 19-year-old  is caring for  baby Stella. He checked on the conditions in her cell, which she shares with eight other prisoners. ‘I’m not happy to be raising my baby here,’ said Mack, who is expected to learn on Tuesday whether a panel of judges will agree to prosecution demands that she should serve 15 years for the murder. The minister later said he was perturbed that a three-week-old baby should start her life in a prison. He said he had offered Mack the chance to place the baby with a family to care for the child. ‘I’ve given her the chance to think over the offer,’ Mr Yasona said outside the prison. ‘There are families in Bali who would be happy to take the baby in and care for her. ‘While she is considering this, I have also told her that I will arrange for her to have a room to herself inside the prison where she can care for the baby properly without other prisoners being around.’ Motherhood: Little Stella Schaefer is being cared for in prison by Heather Mack, 19, who is accused of murder . Allegations: Heather Mack is accused of the murder of her socialite mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack (pictured) Locked up: Mack, from Chicago, could spend 15 years in jail for the murder of her mother, 62-year-old socialite Sheila von Wiese-Mack . Judges have accepted the prosecution's case of Mack's guilt for the murder of her mother in a luxury Bali hotel last August. During the minister’s visit, Mack not only told him of her concerns about the crowded cell, but she also said she wanted baby Stella Schaefer - named after her  boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21 - to be baptised. Mr Yasona said he would make arrangements for a church pastor or priest to come to the prison to perform a  ceremony. It is understood that Schaefer - who is facing 18 years in jail after admitting  he beat Mrs Mack about the face and stuffed her body in a suitcase after she allegedly attacked him - has not been made aware of the offer to have the baby he has fathered given to a Balinese family. It is expected, however, that Mack will ask for a message to be passed to him in another part of Kerobokan prison seeking his reaction to the offer. Tommy Schaefer pictured here in prison with baby Stella, who was born by caesarian on March 17 this year . During the minister’s visit, Mack (right) not only told him of her concerns about the crowded cell, but she also said she wanted baby Stella Schaefer - named after her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer (left), 21 - to be baptised . Another prisoner, an Indonesian woman, is sharing a cell with her seven-month old baby and several other women. The minister’s compassion for the convicted teenager is at odds with his hard-line stance over the fate of two members of the Australian so-called ‘Bali Nine’ heroin-smuggling gang. The two men, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, are anxiously waiting for the result of a final appeal in the Indonesian constitutional court to avoid the firing squad. Mr Yasona had said earlier that ‘we are ready to carry out the executions’. However, he has also displayed a lenient attitude to prisoners, putting forward a plan to parliament to revise the treatment of inmates serving time for corruption, terrorism and drug offences. According to his proposed regulations, an inmate who has spent six months behind bars and who agrees to a number of conditions could have his or her sentence reduced.","Heather Mack is accused of murdering her mother and is in a Bali prison .

"Two brothers exonerated after being sentenced to death for a 1975 slaying have been awarded more than $1.6 million in compensation from the state of Ohio for decades of wrongful imprisonment. The Ohio Court of Claims on Friday granted the money to Wiley Bridgeman, 60, and Kwame Ajamu, 57, and the brothers' attorneys said compensation for lost wages has yet to be determined and awarded. Bridgeman, Ajamu, and Ricky Jackson, now 59, were sent to death row after aggravated murder convictions in the slaying of Cleveland money order salesman Harry Franks. Scroll down for video . Wiley Bridgeman, 60 (left) and Kwame Ajamu, 57 (right) were awarded a collective $1.6million from an Ohio court on Friday after spending decades in prison for wrongful murder convictions (file photo, Nov. 2014) The brothers served a collective 66 years in prison for the murder of Cleveland businessman Harry Franks in 1975. Above, they celebrate after Bridgeman was exonerated in November 2014 . Last year, the three men were exonerated after the case against them fell apart when the prosecution's key witness Edward Vernon — a 12-year-old boy at the time of the killing— recanted his testimony as an adult and said he never witnessed the crime. Jackson, 58, was awarded more than $1million in compensation in March. Terry Gilbert and David Mills, attorneys for Bridgeman and Ajamu, said Friday the amount in lost wages will be determined through negotiations. Mills said Ohio law allows wrongfully imprisoned individuals to be paid about $51,000 for each year of incarceration. The $1.6 million includes calculated damages amounting to about $969,000 for Bridgeman and $647,000 for Ajamu, according to the court. Previous inmates exonerated after periods in prison have received up to $1million for each year spent incarcerated. An Illinois man who spent nearly 20 years in jail after being wrongly imprisoned for rape and murder received a $20million settlement in March, setting a new national record. Gilbert said no amount of money could really compensate the two men for the time that was taken from them. Bridgeman, Ajamu and Jackson were convicted after a 12-year-old said that he saw how businessman Harry Franks was murdered . Ricky Jackson, was the longest serving person ever exonerated after his 1975 (left) conviction. He was released last year (right) after the prosecution's star witness recanted his testimony . Ajamu was only 17-years-old when he was given the death penalty. Ajamu, Bridgeman and Jackson had walked past the scene where Franks was shot and asked what happened, soon becoming prime suspects in the murder. No physical evidence linked them to the crime, which included an acid attack. In 2013 Vernon said that police had fed him details about the case, Cleveland.com reported. Late last year the inmates became emotional after being told that they had been exonerated and the court would not make any objections to their innocence. All three's death sentences, which were given when Bridgeman was 20 and Jackson was 18, had been commuted to life in prison after the Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment in 1978. Jackson, holding his first cell phone, received more than $1million last month after being released. The trio of wrongfully convicted men said that they have missed out on important parts of life such as having children . 'They deserve a lot more, but the state has limits on what they pay,' Gilbert said. 'But obviously they are grateful to have some resources to start their lives again.' Ajamu, known in 1975 as Ronnie Bridgeman, was released in 2003 after 27 years in prison and exonerated in December. He took his new name after leaving prison and has married. His brother Wiley Bridgeman and Jackson were released in November after nearly 40 years behind bars. The Ohio Innocence Project says that Jackson was the longest-serving person in US history to be exonerated at the time of his release. After they were exonerated, the trio said that they had missed out on much of life, such as having children. Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, was reached after office hours Friday. He said attorneys with DeWine's office would review the ruling Monday. The case against the three men first attracted scrutiny after a piece in Cleveland Scene cast doubt on Vernon's testimony.","Wiley Bridgeman, 60, and Kwame Ajamu, 57, sentenced for 1975 killing .

"Forget dogs' dinners, stylish cook Gizzi Erskine's fussy feline loves poppadoms, tortilla chips and taramasalata. In an interview with Puss Puss magazine, the stylish cook, 35,  posed at a feast fit for only the classiest cat, that included bowls brimming with caviar and salmon roe, jellied fish heads, a seafood sculpture made of octopus, lobster and prawns. Although the lavish feast was in fact a set (created by food stylist Iain Graham), the cat fancier admitted that her British shorthair, Kimchi, has such a discerning palate he loves crunchy 'human food'  and that taramasalata would be his 'death row dish'. Draped in peach silk and surrounded by cat delicacies, TV chef Gizzi Erskine appears with her pet Kimchi in cat magazine, Puss Puss . The TV chef seen baring her back tattoo with pet cat Kimchi says: 'I’d love a really small cat tattoo either behind my ear or somewhere discreet' In the shoot for the publication that pitches itself as a Vogue for cat lovers, the east London-based cook told writer Gemma Lacey: 'She won’t eat anything unless it’s proper meat.' Adding that Kimchi, 'loves human food and will steal it off our plate if we’re not looking. 'She loves anything crunchy, so if there are poppadoms or tortilla chips around that’s it. I don’t like her having it as they’re not supposed to, but she just takes it. But Gizzi insists that living in a foodie household isn't to blame. 'It’s not my influence at all, she’s just a pig!'

But Kimchi occasionally indulges in cat food and is 'obsessed' with Dreamies cat biscuits. 'It’s insane,' says Gizzi. 'She purrs as she eats and she doesn’t do that normally.' Gizzi also recently added a new addition to her cat family, Ponzu, named after her favourite Japanese dressing. 'I was also thinking about calling him Neeps or Haggis as he’s Scottish, but it didn’t suit him, so eventually I just went with what suited him best. He was nameless for a week,' she says. 'Kimchi is called Kimchi because of my love of Korean food,' she adds. The new addition to the Erskine feline family is also a food lover - and has even more unusual tastes.

"A top Queensland barrister with a handsome income will use case law dating back 200 years to try to avoid a $146 speeding fine. Tony Morris QC is mounting a landmark legal challenge against Queensland's speed-camera laws, The Courier-Mail reports. Mr Morris says he wasn't driving when his Volvo was photographed doing 57km/h in a 50km/h zone last year. But he won't say who was behind the wheel. He has invoked a spousal privilege case from 1817, arguing it's unconstitutional for a Queensland court to fine him when there's evidence he was not the driver. Scroll down for video .

He says he was in a meeting with top judges when the Volvo was snapped, and they are willing to testify that he was with them. He argues the spousal privilege principle, established in England 200 years ago, means a husband can't be compelled to provide information that incriminates his wife. 'I decline to identify the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the relevant time,' Mr Morris reportedly wrote in a letter to the Department of Transport. Earlier this year, Mr Morris wrote to federal, state and territory attorneys-general saying he planned to challenge parts of Queensland's speed-camera laws.

During a Family Court hearing, judge Michael Kent was told the teen had considered suicide and gone to extreme lengths such as binding his chest by wearing tight bras and starving himself because he was so unhappy in his female body. The teen has been taking puberty blockers for a year, has worn a boy’s uniform for two years and most of his friends are male. ‘I had the mentality of a dude... not the mentality of a girl,’ the teen told her therapist during a counselling session, the court heard. Scroll down for video . A 16-year-old who was born a girl but identifies as a boy has been granted the opportunity to go through male puberty thanks to hormone treatment . The Queensland teen is just one of many young Australians who have to seek permission from the Family Court and prove they are making an ‘independent’ choice before they can be granted second-stage gender-changing hormones. Currently a child wishing to change gender has to apply to the Family Court for this second stage of treatment after they have first taken puberty blocking hormones. Before a child is given any treatment at all they are assessed by at least five doctors. An official diagnosis of gender dysphoria, which describes people who are significantly unhappy with the sex and gender they were assigned at birth, also needs to be given by psychologists and physicians. Family Courts then assess the extent to which a child’s wishes “reflect true, stable and independent choices” – using the Gillick competency test - before they grant permission for gender-changing hormones. A child wishing to change gender has to apply to the Family Court for the second stage of gender changing treatment . Teens must be 16 years old before they can go to court to ask for this second stage of treatment. In Australia, that task is said to be made easier through the appointment of independent children’s lawyers and the commissioning of family reports, as well as through the use of expert evidence. However, in November 2014, Family Court Chief Justice Diana Bryant told the ABC’s Four Corners documentary that she would like an examination into whether courts needed to be involved at all. In the show, Jamie, a 14-year-old transgender girl, agreed:‘I don't think it's necessary that we have to go back to the court so they can decide if I'm Gillick competent, because that's just up to the parents and doctors I think. ‘They will make just as good a decision as anybody, even better because they're the experts.’ If you or anyone you know is in need of support, contact Lifeline Australia on 13 11 14, Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800 or visit BeyondBlue.","Queensland teen was born a girl but wears a boy's school uniform .

"Searchers are desperately combing bushland and the banks of a lake for an autistic boy who went missing there on Friday morning. Luke Shambrook was last seen leaving Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park, central Victoria at 9.30am on Good Friday. The 11-year old was camping in the national forest with his family, and it is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since. Luke has limited speech and his family says he is probably confused, and he may not even be aware he is lost. Scroll down for video . Luke Shambrook was last seen on the national park at 9.30am on Good Friday. It is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since . They say the disappearance is completely out of character for him. A widespread search is being carried by search and rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES members, along with campers around the surrounding areas. Sergeant Greg Paul said the search was focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland. 'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush,' he told reporters on Saturday. 'We've also got people walking the banks of the lake.' But he outlined a serious hurdle for the search efforts, according to ABC. 'With the autistic condition, Luke might not respond to searchers, he may not even know that he's lost,' he said. 'He won't necessarily respond to his name being called, but that might change a little bit as he gets hungry maybe.

Sgt Paul said there were hundreds of other campers in the area over the busy Easter period, so there was a chance someone else could spot Luke. Police also said conditions are favourable for his survival overnight, with warm temperatures through the day. Luke is described as being of medium build, about 150 cm tall with olive skin, brown hair and brown eyes.

"Toby Perkins, deputy chairman of the Labour election campaign, revealed in an email that his interns are paid just £4 per day for 12-hour shifts . Labour has been accused of 'utter hypocrisy' after it was revealed interns working for one of their election chiefs are paid just £4 per day while the party claims to champion the low paid. An email sent by Toby Perkins, who is deputy chairman of the Labour election campaign as well as MP for Chesterfield, revealed that interns are paid just £25 per week for working 12-hour days. Now Labour is trying to get around the problem by saying the interns will be paid nothing at all, making them volunteers rather than workers. The email, published in The Sun, reveals that alongside their measly wage, interns could expect to be reimbursed for travel, as well as being put up in accommodation during the campaign. Mr Perkins had last week denied employing any interns, despite advertising for five 'enthusiastic, motivated and hard-working Campaign Interns' online on March 8. The advert, which says the interns will be paid for travel, food and accommodation, adds: 'This is an excellent opportunity to receive training in and get first hand experience of Labour Campaigns, as part of a driven and highly motivated team.' Labour's 2015 manifesto has sought to champion working-class Britons by increasing the minimum wage to £8 per hour, promoting the Living Wage, and banning zero-hours contracts. Julia Cambridge, who is running against Mr Perkins in Chesterfield, said: 'This smacks of utter hypocrisy. 'You can't one day bang on about giving workers a living wage, and then do the exact opposite.' Mr Perkins, who was first elected MP in 2010, is defending a narrow majority of just 500 votes over the Lib Dems in Chesterfield. He said that the email, entitled 'The Interns Are Coming' was intended to drum up support and give the impression campaigners are working hard. Julia Cambridge, a Lib Dem who is running against Mr Perkins in his Chesterfield constituency . In a statement he added: 'The people working on my election campaign are doing so in a voluntary capacity. 'Two of the volunteers are students on four-year politics degrees who have during their third year been based in my office in Westminster and wanted to volunteer in the General Election campaign. 'The other two are local young party members who were between jobs and were wanting to dedicate themselves to the General election campaign. 'The local party arranged to cover their expenses.'","Email from MP Toby Perkins reveals that interns are paid £25 per week .

"It may be a British staple but the traditional fish and chips is in peril. As waters around the UK get warmer, popular species of fish including haddock, plaice and lemon sole could become less common as they migrate to more preferable water temperatures. And this could see the prices of these fish soar, or see them being taken off the menu completely. Researchers have developed a model that combined long-term fisheries data with climate model projections from the Met Office. From this they predicted the abundance and distribution of popular fish, such as haddock and plaice, could fall as the North Sea warms and this could increase the price of fish and chips . In the past 40 years, reports suggest the North Sea has warmed four times faster than the global average. And with further warming predicted over the coming century, fisheries and scientists are studying the impact on so-called commercial species. This includes research by Dr Steve Simpson, senior lecturer in marine biology and global change at the University of Exeter and Dr Martin Genner, senior lecturer in fish ecology and evolution at the University of Bristol. The researchers developed a model that combined long-term fisheries data with climate model projections from the Met Office. From this they were able to predict the abundance and distribution of the UK's fish over the next 50 years. As the North Sea warms, species won't be able to migrate north to avoid warming temperatures because habitat of a suitable depth is rare. As a result UK fisheries will need to replace current species with those that prefer warmer water such as red mullet (left) and John dory (right), for example . Their research found that as the North Sea warms, species won't be able to migrate north to avoid warming temperatures because habitat of a suitable depth is rare. And due to higher temperatures, numbers of many of the species are predicted to fall. Marine biologists have found that shellfish take on a sour flavour if they are reared in slightly acidified sea water. They warn that as the planet's oceans grow more acidic, due to rising carbon dioxide levels, many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising. Climate change experts predict that over the next century, the acidity levels of the world's oceans could drop from pH8 to pH7.5. Many have warned this could lead to shrimps and prawns struggling to build the shells and skeletons they need to survive. 'We will see a real changing of the guard in the next few decades,' said Dr Simpson. 'Our models predict cold water species will be squeezed out, with warmer water fish likely to take their place. 'For sustainable UK fisheries, we need to move on from haddock and chips and look to southern Europe for our gastronomic inspiration.' These fish include John dory and red mullet, for example. According to the study, fish distributions are limited by water temperature and some species can only thrive in certain habitats and depths. Dr Martin Genner, senior lecturer in Fish Ecology and Evolution at the University of Bristol, added: 'Long-term standardised fisheries surveys from many European countries, alongside leading climate models for the region, mean it is a unique region to develop and test new modeling approaches.' 'The modeling technique used in this analysis performed remarkably well when tested on available long-term datasets. 'This provides real confidence in the model's ability to predict future patterns of fish distributions around the UK. The study was published in Nature Climate Change.","Researchers developed a model that combined long-term fisheries data with climate model projections from the Met Office .

"The Old Bailey was told that Kazi Islam, 18, sent texts to Harry Thomas, 19, who had learning difficulties, persuading him to buy parts for a bomb . A teenager bullied and groomed a friend with learning difficulties into helping him make a pipe bomb in a series of coded text messages which were given away when the friend failed to grasp that 'cake' was a codeword for 'bomb', a court has heard. Kazi Islam, 18, sent messages via his Blackberry to Harry Thomas, 19, praising Lee Rigby's killers and encouraging him to buy a knife to attack soldiers with, along with the ingredients to make an explosive device, the Old Bailey was told. Islam, who is accused of preparing for acts of terrorism, used  'cake' as code for bomb in his messages, but failing to understand his ingenious ruse, Thomas replied: 'Cake? U mean the b o m b', the jury was told. The court heard that Islam, from Manor Park, east London, met Mr Thomas at Barking and Dagenham College in October 2013, and immediately began manipulating him. Messages taken from Islam's phone show that Mr Thomas had confided in Islam about a break-up with his girlfriend, and Islam lied to him about suffering a break-up of his own, saying: ‘Coming back to Islam helped me.’ Prosecutor Annabel Darlow QC said Islam then used his friend to help assemble parts for a pipe bomb, including fireworks, hydrogen peroxide, pipes, metal end caps and glue. She said: ‘The defendant carefully groomed Mr Thomas over many months, flattering him when he appeared willing to do his bidding and bullying him with implied threats of what people associated with him would do if he didn’t carry out his wishes when he didn’t appear to be going according to plan. ‘During the same time period, Kazi Islam carried out research on the internet for information which could assist him in the construction of an explosive device. ‘He also applied liberal encouragement to Thomas to murder a British soldier, inciting him with stories about the murder of innocent children by the military forces and referring approvingly to the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich.’ Ms Darlow said Islam’s messages on WhatsApp and BlackBerry messenger show he was trying to radicalise others at the same time. She added: ‘His activities centred upon two particular planned acts of terrorism. The first of those was a plot to construct an improvised explosive device. The pair met while at Barking and Dagenham College (pictured) in October 2013 after Mr Thomas confided in Islam about breaking up with his girlfriend. Islam then began bullying and grooming Mr Thomas . ‘He also entered into discussions about a second scheme of his, that was to murder a member of the armed forces, although the evidence would seem to show us that the first plot had reached a far more advanced stage than the second. ‘In respect of both enterprises, he sought to use a vulnerable and impressionable young man with mental health difficulties.’ Shortly after the pair met in October 2013, they began talking about buying 'ingredients' for their bomb, with Mr Thomas telling Islam where to find steel and brass caps, the Old Bailey heard. In messages on November 1, Islam admonishes his friend for buying ten inch pipes instead of five inch ones, the jury was told. In a text message Islam then adds: ‘What you need to do is get me the fireworks mate. Ones dat have flash powder in them. The explosions gonna make a big noise.’ Four days later Islam sends Mr Thomas a picture, and Mr Thomas replies asking: 'Is that what we're going to make?' While the image was not shown in court, Ms Darlow said it could be inferred from the response. She added: ‘As the messages between Mr Thomas and the defendant expose all too clearly, Mr Thomas was a vulnerable, not particularly bright young man who was desperate to impress Islam and to try and forge some sort of friendship with him. The court heard that Islam tried to use 'cake' as a codeword for the bomb, but not understanding Mr Thomas replied, saying: 'Cake? U mean the b o m b' ‘Islam exploited to the utmost his friend’s vulnerability and obvious wish to try and ingratiate himself with Islam.’ In December 2013 it appears that Mr Thomas began having second thoughts about the plot, so Islam told him that British soldiers had murdered an innocent 10-year-old boy, the court heard. Mr Thomas then asked Islam if a report in a newspaper saying one of Lee Rigby’s killers had raped a teenager was true, the jury was told. Islam responded: ‘If you read it in the newspaper it’s lies, the media will do anything to give Muslims a bad name.’ Islam also suggested that Mr Thomas change his first name from Harry to Haroon, saying it sounded better. Later that month Islam began messaging Mr Thomas about killing a soldier with a knife, Ms Darlow told the Old Bailey. In messages shown to the court, Islam wrote: ‘David Cameron is sending troops to kill innocent people, his soldiers are committing mass murder. ‘If the war doesn’t stop, there should be another soldier killed.’ Thomas replied: ‘U want me to get one’ and Islam told him ‘yeah’. Islam then asked if Mr Thomas would carry out an attack on a soldier. He replied: ‘I don’t agree with what Cameron is doing. I would kill a soldier because they are scum. They have no right to kill these children.’ Pleased with the reply, Islam told him: ‘Well done Harry. I’m glad you understand mate.. I’m proud of you.’ Around the same time Islam began asking Mr Thomas to buy hydrogen peroxide from a shop in order to make into explosives, the court was told. In February the following year Islam also downloaded issues of Al Qaeda's magazine Inspire to his laptop, along with a guide on how to make semtex, Ms Darlow said. However, messages revealed that around this time Islam discovered that Mr Thomas had been telling other people about the bomb, and began threatening him, it was said. He wrote: 'The brothers are gonna come after me and kill me and they’re gonna kill u as well.' Police raided Islam's home in August and recovered a Lenovo laptop computer where they found the bomb-making guides, along with evidence of searches for extreme preachers and extremist material. Islam also sent Mr Thomas texts praising Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right), Lee Rigby's killers, and asked his friend to get a meat clever to kill a soldier, the Old Bailey heard . The court heard Islam’s phone had been used to look up the Al Qaeda propaganda magazine Inspire and the article ‘44 ways to support Jihad’. Islam had also looked up the name of hate preacher Anjem Choudary, killer Michael Adebolajo, and former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, police said. Ms Darlow said that when Islam was arrested, police also raided Mr Thomas’ home. She added: ‘Nothing was found to suggest Harry Thomas had in fact gone on to purchase any of the items the defendant had asked him to purchase.’ Islam denies engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, contrary to section 5 (1) of the Terrorism Act 2006.

"Most dog owners would say they were dedicated to their pets. But Dave Rickard and his wife Brenda are so devoted to their West Highland terrier Daisy that they didn’t think twice about giving her the kiss of life after she was feared to have drowned. Mr Rickard, 72, and his wife Brenda, 67, were on holiday when Daisy fell 10ft from a quay into the sea. Very quickly the strong currents began to pull her under. Dave Rickard, 72,  and his wife Brenda, 67, with their beloved West Highland terrier Daisy . Mr Rickard, a retired industrial engineer, said: ‘Daisy was off the lead and she just slipped off the side. She was swimming okay but the current was taking her away and eventually she got so weak and gave up. ‘Her head went under the water, it was horrendous.’ Daisy was pulled from the water by a passing fisherman on a boat who hooked a pole through her collar. The family were on holiday in Caernarfon, North Wales, pictured, when the drama unfolded . Mr Rickard said: ‘He handed her to me. She was just totally motionless, there was nothing there. I started rubbing her chest and there was lots of water coming out of her mouth and nostrils. Daisy has now recovered from the ordeal . ‘I instinctively started breathing in her mouth and after about four or five minutes of me and my wife doing it I put my cheek to her nose and could feel a slight breath. ‘We wrapped her up as warm as we could and drove to the vet. In the car I treated her as if she was a human and kept calling her name and trying to keep her with us and to keep her eyes open.’ He said the vet put Daisy on oxygen and kept her in overnight. ‘They said she might have pneumonia or brain damage but she pulled through,’ he added. ‘She doesn’t seem to have been affected at all.’ The couple, from Rugby, Warwickshire, had been on holiday with their family in Caernarfon, North Wales, with their daughter Karen, 36, and two grandchildren. The couple’s daughter, who witnessed the rescue said her parents had performed a miracle. She said: ‘We were all crying and screaming because Daisy had drowned. ‘My folks got to work quickly, pressing her chest and giving her mouth-to-mouth. We couldn’t believe it when her eyes opened.’","Daisy fell 10ft from quay into sea during holiday in Caernarfon, North Wales .

"Dancing With The Stars co-host Erin Andrews surfaced for the first time after her NHL star boyfriend Jarret Stoll was busted at a pool party at the MGM Grand Hotel, allegedly with cocaine and Molly tucked into his swim trunks. Stoll, 32, who currently plays with the Los Angeles Kings, was booked for drug possession and released on $5,000 bond Friday. TMZ reports the NHL player passed through security on his way to the Wet Republic pool at the Las Vegas hotel when a security guard found a 'pink baggie' filled with 3.3 grams of cocaine and 'gel-caps' containing 8.1 grams of Molly. Scroll down for video . Spotted: Andrews, who co-hosts Dancing With The Stars and works as an NFL sideline reporter for Fox Sports, was seen being visited by a friend at the home she reportedly shares with Stoll the day after he was arrested . 'Molly' is the name given to the powder or crystallized form of MDMA, the drug compound also found in ecstasy. After being patted down, Stoll was asked whether the powder in the pink baggie was cocaine and answered yes, according to the police report. Stoll was previously in the news for non-sports related reasons back in 2013 when he was rushed to the hospital after having a seizure at his home in Hermosa Beach, California during the offseason, with the Kings later saying they did not know what caused the incident. Jarret Stoll, 32 (left), is the longtime boyfriend of Dancing With The Stars host Erin Andrews, 36 (right) Busted: Erin Andrews's beau Jarret Stoll, 32, was booked into jail in Las Vegas on possession charges after reportedly being found with cocaine and Molly in his swim trunks at a popular hotel . He was arrested on suspicion of possession of cocaine at the Wet Republic pool at the MGM Grand (above) Stoll (seen partying at the MGM Grand in 2014 after the Kings Stanley Cup win) was arrested on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada, on drug possession charges, according to many reports . Stoll, who will make a cameo in the upcoming film version of the popular HBO show Entourage, was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and was listed as having a hearing on Saturday. The charges include possession of Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy. Friday was the two-year anniversary of MGM Grand's popular club Hakkasan, an event featuring Tiesto that brought out names like Christina Aguilera. In both 2012 and 2014 Stoll headed to the MGM Grand to celebrate at the end of the hockey season. It seems that Stoll went on a date with Andrews on Thursday night, as she posted a photo of a romantic-looking candle that was seemingly taken at Italian restaurant La Sosta Enoteca in Manhattan Beach, California, on her Instagram page, and a fan snapped a photo with Stoll earlier in the day. The caption, which did not mention Stoll by name, read: 'Always a great date night.' The popular television personality recently spoke about her boyfriend while participating in the Grub Street Diet, a weekly feature in which celebrities keep a diary of what they eat for the week. Andrews posted a photo of a candle that was seemingly taken at Italian restaurant La Sosta Enoteca in Manhattan Beach, California, on her Instagram page on Thursday. That location is four hours from Vegas . A fan snapped this photo with Stoll on Thursday in California . Stoll had 17 points in 73 games this season and was a member of the Kings' Stanley Cup championship teams in 2012 and 2014. He will become an unrestricted free agent on July 1. The Kings failed to qualify for postseason play after winning the Stanley Cup last year and in 2012. The team said: 'We are aware of police reports out of Clark County, Nevada regarding Jarret Stoll. 'Our organization is concerned and has begun conducting a thorough internal investigation. 'While we continue to actively gather facts, we are withholding further comment at this time.' Veteran had 17 points in 73 games this season and was a member of the Kings' recent Stanley Cup teams . Andrews, 36, sparked engagement rumors after she posted an Instagram of her wearing a very large, square-cut diamond ring last month. Fans thought the picture meant Stoll had proposed, but Andrews said the ring was on loan. 'I've definitely dropped hints here and there,' the Fox broadcaster shared with ABC News in July. 'But we haven't looked at rings... Nothing there yet, the ball's in his court.' She added: 'But no we are fine! We've had enough on our plate for the last two years of dating and haven't really gone there yet.' He was previously engaged to actress and model Rachel Hunter, the former wife of singer Rod Stewart.

"Peter Morris was devastated when his sister, Claire, died in a car crash when she was just 32. Only a year before, he had walked her down the aisle to give her away to her husband, Malcolm Webster, from Surrey, then aged 33, who seemed equally bereft at the loss of his wife. Peter, from Gillingham, Kent, believed Claire had died in a tragic accident that happened in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1994. Scroll down for video . Peter Morris, left, was devastated when his sister, Claire, pictured right on her hen do, died in a car crash . It took two decades for the truth to be revealed - Claire had in fact been murdered by Webster so he could cash in on her life insurance. Webster had drugged his wife at their home in the Scottish village of Tarves, where they had settled after their wedding, before taking her for a drive. He then deliberately crashed their car and, after making his own escape, set it on fire so Claire had no hope of survival. Last year Claire's story was turned into an ITV drama starring Sheridan Smith. And now Peter has gone in front of the cameras to talk about his grief and to reveal the shocking detail of his sister's death, which he is still coming to terms with 21 years later. 'The fire brigade said it was the most intense fire they had ever seen from a mile away, the flames were leaping 20, 30 feet, it was just ridiculous,' Peter reveals on the latest episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos. 'A very brave fireman tried to retrieve what was left of Claire. There wasn't much left of her, poor love.' Peter said he was shocked and heartbroken when he was told his sister, a qualified nurse, had lost her life in just terrible circumstances. Claire and Malcolm Webster pictured on their wedding day in 1993, the following year he murdered her . He had no reason to suspect Webster, who Claire had met at a party, had drugged and then burned her alive. Claire had been besotted with him and was delighted when they tied the knot in 1993. Peter recalls: 'He seemed like the perfect gentleman which is exactly what she would have wanted. He was a sort of Colin Firth type character.' He said he and Webster consoled one another at the funeral and Peter believed he was suffering just as much as he was. 'He didn't say a lot at the funeral, he appeared to be in a complete state of shock as well,' he said. 'We were all standing round the graveside, in my right hand I was holding on to Malcolm's left hand. 'I was in floods of tears, and I looked at Malcolm, and he, he was also in floods of tears. And that more than anything else convinced me that it had been a genuine accident.' For years Peter continued to believe the car crash had been accidental, and while some officers who investigated the scene of the crash had their misgivings, they had no concrete evidence to suggest anything different. Felicity Drumm, pictured on Britain's Darkest Taboos, was Webster's second wife. He attempted to kill her in circumstances similar to Claire's death . Peter lost touch with his brother-in-law when Webster moved to New Zealand - but it was there that his true colours were revealed when he tried to murder again. He married Felicity Drumm and they had son together. Unbeknownst to Felicity, he started faking her signature to take out life insurance polices in her name and also began poisoning her like he had done to Claire. Felicity also appears on Britain's Darkest Taboos and reveals how it felt to be drugged. She said: 'These episodes would often begin with a feeling of blurred vision or double vision and unsteadiness on my feet, my speech was sometimes become a little bit slurred, I would stagger around as if I was drunk and then would fall into a deep sleep.' She couldn't believe her husband could be the cause of her illness but a pattern was forming. 'These events occurred after he had prepared a meal or a drink for me, they were always at the weekends, never inconveniently when I had to be able to go to work,' she said. Then in circumstances similar to Claire's death, in 1999 she was driven by Webster to a remote location when she was feeling tired and drowsy. It seems Webster could have been about to commit murder again - until he was interrupted by a phone call from Felicity's concerned parents. Felicity recalls how Webster was angry that the call had woken her up and urged her to ignore it but she persuaded him to drive her home so she could see her father. Webster then fled while Felicity learned some shocking truths from her parents. Webster pictured in 2011 when he was jailed for life after being found guilty of murder . 'We discovered that he'd opened up a private mail box, he had redirected all of our mail including bank mail which had prevented me from discovering that gradually the account was being fleeced,' she said. 'There were enquiries to real estate agents back in the Cornwall and Devon area suggesting he would be returning shortly to the UK with his infant son. At the bottom of his briefcase there was a total of nine life insurance policies, which collectively was in excess of a million dollars on my death, and they had my signature forged on them.' Chillingly, they also discovered a petrol canister in her car and Felicity is convinced she narrowly escaped death that day. Webster went on the run back to the UK while Felicity reported him to the New Zealand police. After investigating, they urged Scottish police to reopen the case into Claire's death. The lead officer in the case was Charles Henry. He said: 'The original fatal road accident was highly suspicious and it bore all the hallmarks of what was happening in New Zealand. At that particular point we were facing a highly dangerous individual who was a threat to any women that he was going to be with.' Felicity pictured in 2011 when she gave evidence against Webster during the trial in which he was dubbed 'the black widower' However, it would take years for the police to build a strong enough case to prove Claire's death was not an accident and gain enough evidence to charge Webster. By then, he was back living in Scotland and was planning to marry another woman who had no idea of his murderous history. In May 2011, after a long running trial during which he was dubbed 'The Black Widower', Webster was found guilty of murdering Claire, attempting to murder Felicity and attempting to bigamously marry a third woman to gain access to her estate. Now aged 55, he is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years. 'I think his sentence aptly reflects the horribleness of his crimes, and the fact that he feels no remorse, that it was all premeditated and, given the opportunity he was about to do it again,' said Felicity, who gave evidence against the father of her child at his trial. Peter, who had to wait 21 years to get justice for Claire, said he and his family can now finally move on even though their lives will never be the same again. Peter says Claire's death nearly destroyed their family but now they are rebuilding their lives . He said: 'If anything it taught me that you just have to be a little bit more cautious in life as to who you trust and when you trust them, because we could all be living next door to the next Malcolm Webster. 'It was an experience that did nearly destroy me and it nearly destroyed my family but thank God it didn't and thank God over a period of time we've managed to put the pieces back together and move on.'

"A road rage incident caught on camera shows a man as he brutally beats an elderly truck driver for hitting his car on one of America's busiest highways. The aggressor is seen on video as he throws and punches the old man along the side of Route 95 near Baltimore, Maryland, this after the old man hit the aggressor's car as he changed lanes and, according to the truck driver, cut him off. That is when Tommy Solis, who filmed the incident, drove by with a friend, and tried to break up the fight. Scroll down for video . A man (left) was caught on video savagely beating an elderly truck driver (right) along the side of Route 95 near Baltimore, Maryland . 'He punched him through the window, and he proceeds to open up the door and pulls him out, and he hits him again and he falls,' Solis told Fox DC. 'He was just a poor old man, he was just defenseless, you could see it in his face.' The truck driver tried to ward off his attacker, even swinging what appears to be a tire iron at one point, but still the beating continued. The aggressor, driving a Toyota, even refused to stop fighting as Solis and his friend tried to end the attack, and at one point got in the face of Solis' friend. That is when the friend clocked the man, leaving him out cold on the side of the highway. 'It was more of instinct than anything. We weren't looking for any kind of trouble.

"A young woman says she lives on almost nothing but Rice Krispies – and insists she is still healthier than most people. Natalie Swindells, 26, eats four bowls of the cereal every day. She can’t face eating much else and has not tasted a vegetable for nearly two decades. The bank worker, who says she has never taken a day off sick, stopped eating most other foods from the age of two. She now believes overeating causes more health problems than having a very restricted diet like her own. In a typical day, Miss Swindells will have two bowls of Rice Krispies with milk for breakfast, followed by a slice of bread and butter for lunch, and two bowls of Rice Krispies again for dinner . ‘I think doctors overestimate the amount of vitamins that we need to be healthy,’ she said. ‘I think it is about how much you eat, not what you’re eating.’ In a typical day, Miss Swindells will have two bowls of Rice Krispies with milk for breakfast, followed by a slice of bread and butter for lunch, and two bowls of Rice Krispies again for dinner. Consultant dietician Sian Porter said: ‘It might not sound like it but Natalie is actually getting a pretty balanced diet . She will also occasionally eat milk chocolate, ready salted crisps and chips. Although she consumes fewer than half of the recommended 2,000 calories for women Miss Swindells still has an active lifestyle. She lives in Macclesfield with her boyfriend Daniel Walsh, 26, who she says has grown accustomed to her strange eating habits. ‘He’s pretty cool with it,’ she said. ‘When we first got together he tried to make me eat different things but it didn’t last very long. It was just pointless. Everything he made me try I didn’t like.’ In fact, the last time she tasted a vegetable was 18 years ago, when her mother tried to make her eat a roast dinner – and failed. Consultant dietician Sian Porter said: ‘It might not sound like it but Natalie is actually getting a pretty balanced diet. She’s getting protein and calcium from the milk and of course Rice Krispies are fortified with lots of vitamins and iron so this could explain why she’s stayed so healthy.’ But nutritionist Dr Carina Norris warned: ‘Her diet is lacking massively in minerals and vitamins. It is miles from any dietary recommendation.’ ÷ Each Kellogg’s Rice Krispie is made from a single grain of rice that is toasted. ÷ The breakfast cereal has added sugar, salt and barley malt flavouring, as well as added vitamins and minerals. ÷ A small, 30g serving of Rice Krispies contains 115 calories of energy (6 per cent of the recommended daily allowance), 0.3g of fat (less than one per cent of the RDI), 26g carbohydrates (3g of which is sugars) 0.3g fibre and 1.8g protein. ÷ Rice Krispies arrived in British shops in November 1928. ÷ The brand’s famous Snap, Crackle and Pop elf characters first appeared on cereal boxes in 1941. ÷ Jonathan Ross made his television debut in an advert for the cereal aged ten in 1970. ÷ In 1963, the Rolling Stones recorded a song for a TV ad for the cereal.","Natalie Swindell, 26, eats four bowls of Rice Krispies a day and little else .

"A lawsuit filed by former Gossip Girl actress Kelly Rutherford attempting to have a judge order her kids to return to the U.S. from their father's custody in France has been dismissed once and for all. The case was dismissed with a court order stating that it did not have the jurisdiction to force the kids, son Hermes, 8, and daughter Helena, 5, to come back to the United States. Rutherford, 46, claims her children were illegally deported to France when a California Court awarded custody to her ex-husband Daniel Giersch, 40, and she pleaded for the order to be reversed. Scroll down for video . Kelly Rutherford, pictured with her children, Hermes and Helena, during a party in the Hamptons in August 2013, was shut down by the courts again in a final plea to gain custody of her children . Rutherford's lawsuit stating that her children were illegally deported from the United States was dismissed once and for all by a New York court . She claimed that no other U.S. court has ordered children to live in another country when they have an able parent in the United States. Giersch, who is a German citizen residing in France, was deported from the U.S. over allegations of visa fraud. But the dismissal of her case states that Rutherford failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in her custody dispute with Giersch. 'Petitioners allege that the California state court's custody order had the effect of deporting the children in violation of their Fourteenth Amendment right to remain in the United States,' the document reads. The document added: 'There is no authority establishing the unconditional right of minor children to reside in the United States when one of their custodial parents lives abroad. 'Likewise there is no ""plainly defined and peremptory duty"" requiring Respondents to interfere with the custody order - nor is there, as Petitioners contend, a general affirmative duty on federal agencies requiring them to intervene against what is claimed to be unconstitutional state action.' After divorcing in 2010, Rutherford and ex-husband Daniel Giersch went through a nasty custody battle which ended with Giersch being awarded custody while the children were to visit Rutherford on vacations . Kelly left Daniel Giersch in 2009 while she was pregnant with their second child after the German businessman's visa was revoked. A judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012 . Further, the court states 'the children have not been deported; they retain their United States citizenship and, once they reach the age of majority, they will be free to choose where to reside. 'There is, therefore, no non-frivolous constitutional question, only an attempt to seek federal judicial intervention in a state court custody dispute' The order affirmed the original order and said it would be improper for the federal court to intervene in Rutherford's custody battle. Because of this, there will be no intervention and the appeal will be dismissed. A California court ruled two years ago that the children should live in France with ex-husband Daniel Griesch, who she divorced in 2010 after four years of marriage. Rutherford has said that the court in Monaco, where Giersch lives, decided on a new custody order that lets her only see her children on holiday and during the summer. It has left Rutherford emotionally exhausted, desperate and having filed for bankruptcy with $2million in debt after spending all her earnings from Gossip Girl on legal fees and flights to France to see her children. In it's dismissal of her case, the court said it failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in the custody dispute . Daily Mail Online revealed in August that Rutherford had filed a lawsuit at the Federal Appeals Court of the Southern District of New York in Manhattan on behalf of herself and her children. She sued the U.S. government, including Attorney General Holder and Jeh Johnson, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, because she claims that an earlier ruling by a California Superior Court judge that her children should live in France was unlawful. Only federal courts can deal with matters of deportation. she argues. She wanted the US District Court in New York court to grant her ‘temporary emergency authority’ over her children and an order saying the previous ruling was ‘unconstitutional’. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security said on November 24 that Rutherford's case was nothing more than her being dissatisfied with the result of the child-custody proceeding. The departments demanded on that her appeal be dismissed and said she's forcing the departments to become part of something they were never involved in. Rutherford argued her case in a New York court on March 18, but the appeal court shut down her plea and ordered the original order to remain in place.","She claims a California judge deported her children illegally in 2012 .

"A father-of-five has been stabbed to death at a Wisconsin river following an argument with three other fishermen. Peter Kelly, a 34-year-old volunteer high school wrestling coach, was stabbed in the chest beside the St Croix River at 9.45pm on Tuesday as he fished with a friend. The two men were on the Minnesota side of the river when they heard three men being loud and rude on the Wisconsin side and asked them to quieten down, authorities said. For the next three hours, Kelly and his friend exchanged heated words with the three other anglers. Scroll down for video . Loss: Peter Kelly, 34, was stabbed in the chest after he and a friend asked a group of rowdy fishermen to be quiet at a river on Tuesday. The argument escalated and Kelly was attacked and died at the scene . 'The group on the Minnesota side was making statements like, 'Why don't you clean up your act',' . Captain Steve Smith with the Polk County Sheriff's Office in Wisconsin told CBS Minnesota. 'The challenge was made – 'why don't you come over here?'' Kelly and his friend drove to Interstate Park on the Wisconsin side, where the argument escalated and one of the men pulled out a knife and stabbed Kelly in the chest. He died at the scene. After the stabbing, the attackers fled the scene and authorities are still searching for them. The Polk County Sheriff's Office said the three men are believed to be in their late teens or early 20s and were with a dog named Gunnar, who was either a golden retriever or a yellow lab. They were traveling in two vehicles with Minnesota license plates: a blue Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck and a small passenger car. Left behind: Kelly and his wife Christie, pictured, have four sons and a daughter all under the age of nine . Authorities are also asking for help tracking down five people who were in the area at about 7.30pm as they have witnessed the argument that ultimately escalated. Now his small community in St Croix Falls, which has just 2,100 people, is mourning the loss of the family man who volunteered as a coach at the high school's football, baseball and wrestling teams. He would often go to work at 4am so he could get back in time to coach before dinner, fellow high school coach Dan Clark told the Star Tribune. His day job was at Andersen Windows in Bayport, where he worked in quality control. 'He worked 10 to 12 hours a day at Andersen Windows, and he would come home and volunteer four hours a night to our wrestling program for four or five months a year,' Clark toldFox9. 'He was one of the greatest human beings that I ever hoped to meet.' His wife, Christie, stayed at home to care for their children, who are all under nine. They have four boys, Kellen, Payton, Miles and August, and last year welcomed a baby girl, Molly. Devastated: His brother, Mike Kelly, said the man's children did not understand what had happened . Confrontation: Kelly and a friend were on the Minnesota side of the St Croix River, pictured, and told men on the Wisconsin side to stop making so much noise. Kelly was stabbed at Interstate Park . 'I don't think they fully understand the implications of what happened,' his brother, Mike Kelly, told KARE. 'His daughter will never even get to know him.' Friends and family added that they do not believe Kelly was to blame for the confrontation. 'He did good things, and did what was right all the time,' his brother added. 'And that's probably what cost him. Some knuckle heads swearing and being silly.' Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 715-485-8300. A GoFundMe page has also been set up for the family.","Peter Kelly and a friend were fishing on the Minnesota side of the St Croix River on Tuesday when they heard three rowdy men across the water .

"Famished and queuing despondently as far as the eye can see, these  images will have the Islamic State's slick propaganda unit spitting feathers. In scenes more familiar in the most impoverished refugee camps, scores of downtrodden Syrians wait in line for hours for food in the terror group's self-declared capital Raqqa. It's a far cry from the all-conquering image of prosperity its jihadi PR machine would like the world to believe. The pictures were posted on Twitter by a member of the anti-ISIS campaign group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently who risk their lives every day by documenting atrocities from inside the city. Scroll down for video . Impoverished: Dozens of Syrians queue for food in the Islamic State's self-declared capital of Raqqa . Downtrodden: In scenes more familiar in the most impoverished refugee camps, the pictures are a far cry from the all-conquering image of prosperity that terror group's slick PR machine would like the world see . Abu Ibrahim Raqqawi one of the group's founders, wrote the accompanying message: 'Lines waiting for some food. Yes this is the #ISIS State. Hunger, poverty and homelessness.' For those lucky enough to have a home, he paints a bleak picture of life spent in the dark and cold for hours on end. 'The city suffers from a shortage of electricity where the power goes off for 21 hours in the day,' he wrote in another tweet. ISIS prides itself on its well-oiled propaganda offensive, pumping out images, videos and even a weekly English-language magazine designed to recruit and radicalise would-be jihadists. Co-ordinated by its AlHayat Media Centre, the terror group makes extensive use of social media to keep in near-constant contact with supporters in the West - even selling branded merchandise such as T-shirts, baseball caps and cuddly toys. But as seen here, that ease of disseminating information can easily backfire. Most of the Syrians in this line appear to be woman and children. The pictures were posted on Twitter by the anti-ISIS group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently who risk their lives leaking information from the city . The food queue pictures emerged days after ISIS took their draconian rule to bizarre new levels by threatening to jail any man caught wearing skinny jeans in an apparent crackdown on hipsters. The terror group said it would also imprison anyone caught with music on their mobiles, smoking or turning up late for prayer in the city. Violators will be jailed for ten days, during which time they will be made to take an 'Islamic course'. At the end of their prison term, they will be forced to take a test, with those who pass being released immediately. Those who don't will be fined and kept in prison until they do. Other sickening sentences involve people being stoned to death for alleged adultery and thrown off buildings after being accused of being homosexual. Bleak picture: Abu Ibrahim Raqqawi one of the group's founders, wrote the accompanying message: 'Lines waiting for some food. Yes this is the #ISIS State. Hunger, poverty and homelessness' One resident, named only as Jassem, told the group how dozens of people had fled the city in the wake of the jihadi network's brutal enforcement of its twisted form of sharia law. He said: 'ISIS tightens penalties and uses the principle of intimidation in dealing with public, which led to the migration and escape of many people.  Freedom of expression has become a crime.' In a separate development, ISIS has announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English - something the NHS still hasn't introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in Raqqa, the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age, must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists, and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place, with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates.","Syrians line up despondently in scenes more familiar inside refugee camps .

"The scene in the Old Government House Hotel could not be further removed from the horrors of war. There is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served, a clink of cutlery on crockery, the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups. Somewhere outside, the clouds part and light floods the lounge. I reach for another scone, ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream, and marvel that, in this context, 70 years seems an eternity. Rewind those seven decades and Guernsey's only five-star hotel – pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital St Peter Port – would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere. Seventy years on: St Peter Port in Guernsey is one of the key locations for the Heritage Festival . During the German occupation of the Channel Islands (30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945), this stately retreat was commandeered as the General Staff Headquarters. Invading officers would have stalked its corridors. By April 1945, they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on Berlin, and the Channel Islands – bypassed by the D-Day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation. That eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month – and with gusto. The ongoing Channel Islands Heritage Festival (3 April–11 May) is a five-week hurrah of history, parades, concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago – Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey, Herm and Sark. This is no small feat. Fiercely individual, the islands have never before combined to stage a big event. But here they have common cause. Liberation Day itself will turn St Peter Port and Jersey's capital St Helier into swirls of people and music. It is not difficult to find traces of Guernsey's harrowing half-decade. The occupation lingers in the old German fortifications that litter the coastline – the swarthy, sinister tower of Fort Saumarez which rears up on the west coast; the similarly menacing Fort Hommet in the north. Intrigued, I stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of Pleinmont Tower, on the south-west shore. It is an oddly unnerving experience, the pillar-box slots in the bastion's sides eyeing me quietly. When I face the water, I almost expect to feel the chill metal of a machine-gun barrel on my neck. Coastal curves: Guernsey's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of Portelet Bay . You can go further into Guernsey's wartime heritage. What appears to be a car park behind La Colinette Hotel on the western outskirts of St Peter Port reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the Channel Islands. Hidden down a damp flight of stairs, the former German Naval Signals Headquarters is all but invisible unless you know it is there. This, of course, was the point. Its unremarkable door gives onto a vast underground space which once hummed with radio chatter, semaphore murmur and serious conversation. German signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls. The bunker will be open to the public as part of the festival – its secrets brought into the light. The German Occupation Museum at Les Houards offers further perspective, flitting from frivolity to fear – on one hand the photo album of Freda Oliver, a local girl who dated (and married) a German officer; on the other, exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island's Jewish population, and copies of the Guernsey Evening Press turned to propaganda sheet. The darkness of life under Nazi rule is most obvious at the German Military Underground Hospital, at La Vassalerie. This enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave-labour sweat of prisoners of war – plenty of whom died in the process. As did many of the injured German troops brought here from France after the D-Day landings. With its dank passages and horror-film ambience, the hospital is the definition of an unhappy building. An island guardian: Mont Orgueil Castle has protected the east coast of Jersey since the 13th century . The picture is replicated 27 miles to the south-east. Jersey is a short hop from Guernsey – around an hour by fast ferry, less by air. Here, the Jersey War Tunnels – another military-medical complex – have been restored into something less frightening, with museum displays and fascinating facts slotted into the long tunnels. The side-effects of occupation can be seen here – the breakdown of society apparent in transcripts of letters where neighbours informed on each other about hidden radios and petty jealousies. But so can the joy that liberation brought. Glorious video footage shows euphoria in St Helier as the news of German surrender broke; the Union Jack being hoisted at the Pomme D'Or Hotel. The hotel came to symbolise the Channel Islands' moment of deliverance. In a way, it still does, peering across what is now called Liberation Square, where a tall bronze sculpture captures seven people in the act of raising the flag – laughing, as if they are flying a kite. Other echoes resound across St Helier. The Jersey Museum and Art Gallery has a catalogue of copies of the Jersey Evening Post dating back 125 years, its photos recalling the war era in day-by-day detail (albeit through a fog of strict German control). The nearby Maritime Museum proffers the Occupation Tapestry Gallery – a montage of bright images, stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995, which depict Jersey brought to heel – armed troops in the streets, the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire. And the Jersey Archive is host to a remarkable resource – over 30,000 of the Occupation Registration Cards which were forced on islanders by the Nazi authorities. There are no smiles here – just a series of furrowed brows and unhappy faces. Bright days ahead: A view of the pretty coastal enclave of Gorey from the ramparts of Mont Orgueil Castle . The heaviness of the German bootprint is perhaps summed up by Battery Lothringen – a concrete watchdog which looks like it might still bite. This colossal bunker – which will also be accessible during the festival – 'protected' St Helier from the far side of St Aubin's Bay. The stairs into its depths seem to go down forever, to gun posts, control rooms and sleeping quarters – the decades peeling away as I walk in the firm footsteps of the enemy. And yet, just seven miles north-west, it all feels like a bad dream. St Brelade's Bay Hotel gazes at the water in a rather more benign manner. In the summer of 1940, it was another German outpost, requisitioned as a hang-out by Luftwaffe pilots. It is not difficult to grasp why it was coveted. Over breakfast, I peer out of the wide restaurant windows – at waves rolling gently up to the beach, and at St Brelade's, a pretty block of an 11th century church whose graveyard hovers above the sand. There is no stomp of marching boots this morning – but for five weeks, the Channel Islands are remembering a time when there was.

"Presidents, kings and dukes will gather in Los Angeles this weekend to represent their great nations, but you've probably never heard of them. The leaders of places with names like Molossia, Westarctica, Vikesland and Broslavia are coming together at the Anaheim Central Library for MicroCon 2015, which has been dubbed the first North American gathering of micronations. These self-proclaimed countries print their own stamps, wave their own flags and mint their own money. Many have also created sashes and pendants for their royalty. But most of their citizens have a population of less than 10. Many don't even live on the land at all. Scroll down for video . Molossia, population five, is just one of the small, self-proclaimed micronations that will be represented at MicroCon 2015 in Los Angeles this weekend . MicroCon 2015 was organized by Kevin Baugh, who is the President of the Republic of Molossia. Molossia can be found in Reno, Nevada. At 1.3 acres, the country is the size of a football field. Only Baugh and his wife and children live in Molossia, although it has 27 citizens, as well as its own passports, railroad, phone system, bank, post office and general store. Baugh himself will give you a personal tour of the country, as long as you call ahead. Travis McHenry, the Grand Duke of Westarctica, posing in his uniform. McHenry will be giving a talk at MicroCon 2015 called 'Micronations that matter', to encourage more micronations to become nonprofits . 'When you come to visit you see as much as possible a functioning nation,' said Baugh. But Baugh knows there are some things he won't be able change, even if he is the president of his own great nation. 'Can I lower the drinking age? Well no, I can't,' he said. 'Come on, let's get real.' 'We all want to think we have our own country, but you know the U.S. is a lot bigger.' The Grand Duchy of Broslavia has realized the same limitations, but with its military. Founded in Albuquerque by Grand Duke Jacob Felts, whose name inspired the nation's capital of Feltasia, Broslavia has only five citizens - but its own volunteer military. But instead of guns, the military is armed with cardboard copies of AK-47s. They fire rubber bands. Broslavia claims to have recently expanded its territory by annexing planet Pluto. Travis McHenry, the grand duke of Westartica, will also be in attendance at MicroCon 2015. Westarctica is a much larger nation than Molossia, with more than 620,000 square miles in Antarctica to its name. None of the nation's 300 citizens live on the frozen land. No one does. McHenry, also a recruiting coordinator in a Los Angeles media company, said he was 'really inspired' when he found out there was a piece of Antarctica that had never been claimed. But Westarctica is not just an empty country. It's also a nonprofit, advocating for the protection of native penguins and researching how climate change is impacting Antarctica's ice sheet. McHenry will give a talk at MicroCon 2015 called 'Micronations that matter,' which he hopes will encourage other leaders to use their countries for a good cause. 'It's just sort of encouraging other micronations to become nonprofits,' he said. 'So they're actually doing something rather than just walking around wearing fancy capes.' His Imperial Majesty George II of the Empire of Atlantium (left), Prince Paul Delprat of the Principality of Wy, (center) and his princess Susan chat during   Australia's first conference of micronation leaders in 2010 . The Republic of Molossia . Founded by Baugh and a buddy as teenagers in 1977, it existed mainly in Baugh's bedroom until he bought 1.3 acres of property in Northern Nevada in 1998 and built a railroad and private phone company. Molossia pays taxes to the United States but likes to think of that as foreign aid. Its creation was inspired by the Peter Sellers comedy ""The Mouse That Roared,"" about a small nation that declares war on the United States so it can receive foreign aid after it loses. Grand Duchy of Westarctica . One of the world's largest micronations, it encompasses 620,000 square miles of the Antarctic, but nobody actually lives there. It was founded in 2001 by His Royal Highness Grand Duke Travis McHenry after he learned no other nation had laid claim to the area. McHenry says he would like to eventually make Westarctica a real country. If he does, he jokes that he'll probably promote himself from grand duke to king. The Kingdom of Vikesland . Located adjacent to picturesque Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba, Canada, it was founded in 2005 by Christopher Barry Joseph Beyette, a TV newsman who prefers to be called King Christopher I. The king says his fascination with micronationalism led him to create the country. He says he'd like to eventually produce a documentary on the micronation movement. Royal Republic of Ladonia . Located on a rocky shoreline in southwest Sweden, this micronation came into being as the result of a lengthy legal battle over a gigantic pop-art sculpture made of 70 tons of driftwood. After Swedish authorities demanded that it be torn down artist Lars Vik went to court. . After vandals torched it, he built another and went back to court. In 1996 angry supporters declared the site, in a nature preserve, an independent nation. Ladonia claims to have 17,000 citizens now, although none actually live there. It is ruled by Queen Carolyn I, whose coronation took place in 2011 by the disputed sculpture. The Grand Duchy of Broslavia . Founded in 2014 in Albuquerque, it is ruled by His Majesty Grand Duke Jacob Felts and lists its capital as Feltasia. Although it has only five citizens, Broslavia claims to have a volunteer military armed with cardboard copies of AK-47s that fire rubber bands. It claims to have recently expanded its territory by annexing the dwarf planet Pluto.","MicroCon 2015 is the first North American gathering of micronations .
Places like Molossia, Westarctica and Vikesland will be in attendance .
One country is the size of a football field, another is as large as Alaska .
They print their own stamps, wave their own flags, and mint their own money .
But most of their citizens don't actually live on the land ."
"Mourners at the memorial service for celebrity cosmetic surgeon Dr Frederic Brandt, who killed himself a week ago, said a TV show that parodied his appearance was partly to blame for his death. Many believed that he was 'hurt' by the show and it was a factor in the 65 year old's decision to take his own life. 'Fredric was a dear friend but he was also very vain and to be parodied this way must have hurt,' said Edith Newman, a friend for 30 years. 'It would have had an affect on his thinking. It is just so sad.' Memorial: More than 200 friends, family and former patients attended an hour-long memorial service overseen by Rabbi Tom Heyn for dermatologist to the stars Dr. Frederic Brandt .

Brandt, who counted numerous celebrities and models among his clients, was found hanged at his home in Coral Gables, Florida, on Easter April 5. Some friends said he had been left 'devastated' by a character said to have been based on him in the Netflix comedy show 'The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.' In the series Martin Short plays a dermatologist called Dr Grant who has a shock of white hair and flawless skin – almost a mirror image of Dr Brandt.

More than 200 friends, family and former patients attended the hour-long service overseen by Rabbi Tom Heyn. Mourners leaving the memorial were split over whether the TV show made by Hollywood star Tina Fey was a factor in the suicide. Many of the women at the service were walking adverts for the man known affectionately as the 'Baron of Botox'. One woman in her 60s said: 'We will never know if the show pushed him over the edge. No one had any idea that he was depressed. It is just so sad.' Another, who did not want to be named, added:'He was obviously depressed and when that happens minor things take on a bigger significance. ' Edith Newman, who attended the memorial with her sister Rebeca Sobie, said she though the TV caricature would have hurt her friend.

'It is just so sad but Fred would not have liked people laughing at him,' she said. 'He would have been offended.' Other friends have also said the series would have had an effect. In an interview with the New York Times Kyle White said Dr Brandt would have put on a brave face to mask his hurt. 'He never thought it was fun. He was about putting on a happy face in public.' Tina Fey, the writer and producer of the comedy show, has so far refused to comment on the inspiration for the character. Sources close to Brandt said the doctor, who suffered from depression, told People magazine he was 'definitely hurt' by the caricature.

"Football-mad Logan Kehoe, 13, was having a final dip in the pool at a holiday complex in Costa Teguise when accidentally drowned . A British schoolboy has drowned in a swimming pool on the last day of a family holiday in Lanzarote. Football-mad Logan Kehoe, 13, was having a final dip in the pool at a holiday complex in Costa Teguise when he died in what Spanish police have described as an 'accidental drowning'. Emergency services dashed to the pool on Saturday afternoon but despite paramedics performing CPR on Logan, they were unable to save him. A spokesperson for the Guardia Civil said: 'Emergency services were called to the scene at 14.30 and tried in vain to revive him using CPR. 'Every indication is the cause of death was accidental drowning.' Logan was on holiday in Costa Teguise on the eastern side of island - a busy tourist spot which is known for its beaches. Tributes have been paid to the youngster who was a pupil at Bishop Challoner Catholic College in Kings Heath, Birmingham. Head teacher Kevin McEvoy said: 'We were very saddened to hear the news about a much-loved and valued young student. 'Logan was fully involved in the daily life of the school and in after school activities. 'He was highly regarded as an excellent young footballer who represented the school with distinction. 'As a school, we are providing support for children and staff, working in liaison with Birmingham Educational Psychology Service. 'We are in close contact with Logan's relatives and our thoughts and prayers are for Logan and his family at this sad time.' 'We are in close contact with Logan's relatives and our thoughts and prayers are for Logan and his family at this sad time.' Logan also played as an centre-half for Birmingham City Football Club’s under 13s. The club has expressed its dismay at the young man’s death. The BCFC’s trust director Dean Holtham was quoted by the Birmingham Mail as saying the group was ‘deeply saddened’ to learn of Logan’s death. He described the teenager as a smashing lad and a valued member of the Junior Blue’s under 13s. The trust, which works to develop young talent, rather than the club's youth academy plans to call off its league games this weekend as a mark of respect. Friends and loved ones have also left emotional tributes to Logan on his Facebook page. Friends left Tribute to Logan on his Facebook wall, one said 'miss you Logan and that cheeky smile you always had, words can't describe how I'm feeling' Kane Avfc Mcmahon wrote: 'Rest in Paradise Logan, can't believe you're gone.

"While David Cameron has long played up to his image as a family man, Nigel Farage has preferred posing with a pint in the pub. But with the general election getting ever closer, the Ukip leader has resorted to traditional campaign methods to get out the vote. Mr Farage was out in Thanet South today after polls showed he had fallen behind the Tories in his campaign to be elected to Parliament. Scroll down for video . Ukip Leader Nigel Farage meets local people in Broadstairs, Kent, as he continues his campaign trail for the South Thanet seat at the general election . Mr Clegg was in Kingston and Surbiton to campaign with Cabinet colleague  Ed Davey where he met seven -months-old Elise Popperwell and her mother Melissa Popperwell . The Deputy Prime Minister was heckled by anti-tuition fees campaigners during his visit to south west London . A ComRes poll last weekend found Mr Farage trailing his Tory opponent Craig Mackinlay, by 1% with Labour’s Will Scobie just behind on 29%. The unlikely images of Mr Farage come after the Prime Minister and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg were also snapped on the campaign trail posing for photographs with mothers and their babies. In the last few days alone the Prime Minister has been pictured cuddling babies, brushing his daughter’s hair and even feeding an orphaned lamb. On Friday last week, Mr Cameron was overheard telling his wife Samantha they should have another baby. Mr Cameron looks on as his wife Samantha holds seven-week old Regan in a showhome during a general election campaign visit to a housing development  in Chorley last week . Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota, left, and Jo White, right, eat lunch as they talk David Cameron, on the election campaign trail near Poole, Dorset . The PM, visiting a young family helped onto the housing ladder through a government help-to-buy scheme, was pictured cooing over a new-born baby held by his wife. Mr Cameron was heard quipping: 'Come on darling, maybe another one?' The Prime Minister, already a father of four, later admitted he could not help thinking about having more children when he was around young babies. After sympathising with the couple about sleepless nights he said: 'Whenever I see a small baby I feel broody, but don't worry, nothing is going to happen on that front.' Today, Mr Cameron stopped for lunch with supporters near Poole in Dorset, while Mr Clegg spent the day campaigning in South West London and Bath. Mr Farage, meanwhile, sent an email to Ukip supporters pleading with them to help him regain the momentum in Thanet South. Mr Farage asked his supporters to do ""him a personal favour"" and join him on an 'Action Day' to help deliver leaflets, adverts for Ukip public meetings alongside canvassing on the doorstep. Mr Cameron was joined for lunch in a garden with the Docherty family from Poole as he ramped up his campaign for re-election with an attack on Labour's tax plan . Mr Cameron feeds orphaned lambs on Dean Lane farm near the village of Chadlington in the Cotswolds yesterday . The plea for help follows comments from Diane James, Ukip MEP for South East England, who told Pienaar’s Politics there were people ""waiting"" to put themselves forward as the next Ukip leader. “There are people there waiting. When the leadership race is announced, I’m sure individuals will put their hats into the ring,” she said yesterday.

"A historic SpaceX launch that was set to take off today has been scrubbed due to bad weather. A historic SpaceX launch that was set to take off today has been scrubbed due to bad weather. Liftoff of the 208ft (63 metre) tall Falcon 9 rocket was scheduled for 4:33pm EDT/2033GMT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. But poor weather conditions meant the countdown was halted at the 2 1/2-minute mark. Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, tweeted: 'Launch postponed due to lightning from an approaching anvil cloud.' The company will now attempt to launch the uncrewed Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, in Florida, at 4:10 pm ET tomorrow. But more bad weather is forecast. If the weather holds out, SpaceX is hoping to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform in the Atlantic Ocean. The main aim of the flight is to deliver more than 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing, equipment and science experiments to the station, which flies about 260 miles (418 km) above Earth. On board the Dragon capsule is an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. SpaceX is hoping to show that affordable, reusuable rockets are possible for future commercial missions. The plan is for the capsule to be released on a two-day journey to the International Space Station. Once this takes place, the rocket's first stage will flip around and fire engines to steer its descent. It will then deploy landing legs to touch down on a customised barge stationed about 200 miles (322 km) off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida. At a pre-launch press conference on Sunday, SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsmann put the odds of a successful landing at 75 or 80 per cent. Nasa this morning said: 'The weather remains the primary concern for today with the most recent report calling for a 60 per cent chance of acceptable conditions at launch time.' During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform. A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. Scroll down for video . Fast-approaching storm clouds prevented the unmanned rocket from blasting off Monday from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The company will try again Tuesday. But more bad weather is forecast . The launch will be the easy part. After liftoff, SpaceX will attempt to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform in the Atlantic Ocean . Liftoff of the 208ft (63 metre) tall Falcon 9 rocket was scheduled for 4:33pm EDT/2033GMT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The company will make a second attempt on Tuesday . The ISSpresso machine uses a normal Lavazza coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine. Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated. The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. After demonstrating a successful ocean landing, SpaceX intends to bring its rockets back to a landing pad at the launch site so the boosters can be refurbished and reflown, slashing launch costs. 'It's a long-term goal,' Koenigsmann said. As well as the espresso machine, the SpaceX Dragon supply ship also holds experiments for Nasa's one-year space station resident Scott Kelly, who moved in a couple weeks ago. Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko also will remain on board until March 2016. This will be the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. A version of the coffee maker is scheduled for launch to the International Space Station aboard a supply capsule which will also include 4,000 pounds of food, science research and other equipment . Elon Musk - whose Southern California company delivers supplies to the International Space Station and aims to haul astronauts as well in two years - wants to start retrieving and reusing his rockets to save time and money. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit. The company also is working on a heavy-lift version of the Falcon rocket, which uses 27 engines, compared to the nine currently flying. The Falcon Heavy is expected to make its first test flight late this year. At Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex 40, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket stands ready to boost a Dragon capsule on its fifth commercial resupply mission . Saturday's mission was the group's first to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea, which was held in position using deep-sea oil rigs.

"A Kansas mother who uses marijuana to treat a debilitating disease has lost custody of her 11-year-old son at least temporarily and could face possible charges following comments the boy made during an anti-drug education program at school. The case of Shona Banda, 37, was forwarded on Monday to the Finney County district attorney's office for a decision about charges, Garden City Police Capt. Randy Ralston said. Possible charges include possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of drug paraphernalia and child endangerment. No arrests have been made. Medical marijuana activist Shona Banda, 37, has said she will continue to fight for custody of her 11-year-old son after Kansas authorities placed the boy into protective custody . The divorced Garden City mother said she did not get custody of her son back following a hearing on Monday in Finney County District Court, after Kansas authorities had placed the boy into protective custody. 'That's OK — I am not giving up,' Banda said. 'I will, I will get him and I am not going to stop until I do.' Banda, a motivational speaker and author on the medical marijuana issue, has been at the center of a social media storm after she went public with her story. Several supporters rallied on Monday at a park near the courthouse. 'It is a hot topic all across the United States,' Ralston said of the social media attention. 'It doesn't surprise me.' Banda is the author of a book 'Live Free or Die: Reclaim your Life . . . Reclaim your Country!' that recounts her use of a concentrated cannabis oil to treat Crohn's Disease. A gag order has since been issued in the custody case, Banda said. Banda wrote a book that detailed how she used cannabis oil to treat her debilitating Crohn's disease . Police asked to enter the activist's house (pictured), but she denied them entry until they arrived with a warrant . Banda's legal problems began on March 24 when police were called to her son's school for a child welfare check following a drug and alcohol presentation. Investigators allege the boy told school officials that his mother and other adults in his home were avid drug users and that there was a lot of drug use occurring at the home. Banda refused to allow officers to search the home, and police stayed at the scene and denied her entry to it until they could obtain a search warrant. A search subsequently found about 1¼ pounds of marijuana and a lab for manufacturing cannabis oil on the kitchen table and counters, drug paraphernalia and other related items, police said. Authorities said the items were within easy reach of the child. Video posted on YouTube shows the officers standing in her backyard (left) and denying Banda entry into her home (right) because she may have disturbed evidence . 'The most important thing here is the child's well-being,' Ralston said. 'That is why it is a priority for us, just because of the danger to the child.' Authorities took the boy into protective custody and placed him with his father, Ralston said. But when the boy ended back with his mother again, authorities then took the boy back into protective custody. 'For him to have spoken up in class I can't be upset about because he hears me daily on the phone talking with people, encouraging people to speak up and speak out,' she told Ben Swann of her son. A Go Fund Me page has raised more than $28,000 for Banda's legal defense. Fifty-three percent of Americans now say the use of marijuana should be legal, an all-time high in CBS News polling; 43 percent think it should not be legal.","Shona Banda, 37, has lost custody of her 11-year-old son at least temporarily .

"It has been nicknamed 'the Da Pinchi Code'. The seemingly meaningless symbols have been daubed on walls or pavements. But the squiggles are actually thought to be a 'code' for crooks, giving potential housebreakers details about the building, such as whether it is a good target or has an alarm, or been targeted before successfully. Other marks could suggest that the occupant is vulnerable or that there is nothing inside the property worth taking. Cracking the code: Lanarkshire Police has urged anyone who has seen these symbols on their properties to call them . So far the code has only been spotted in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire, where 'X' marks were daubed on several garden sheds. Lanarkshire police tweeted: 'Breaking the Housebreaker's code. These signs have been seen in East Kilbride, please retweet & report all sightings.' The officers' post features a graphic with eight different codes and what they might mean. While police are keen for anyone who sees suspicious markings to report them, they were also keen yesterday to stress that the message was for crime prevention guidance and not to spark fear or alarm. They also said there was nothing to suggest the markings in the area correlate to a particular meaning. Warning: Lanarkshire Police took to social media to warn homeowners about the 'housebreakers code' A spokesman for Police Scotland said: 'It has been the case that some garden sheds in the East Kilbride area have been marked with a cross. 'We issued general crime prevention guidance and asked anyone who noticed anything suspicious to contact police on 101.' The spokesman added that the guidance was in response to a number of housebreakings in the town. The practice of crooks using a secret system to identify potential victims has been dubbed the Da Pinchi Code. The shape of an open book means a vulnerable female resident is the occupant, while another symbol of interlocking squares indicates a homeowner who is 'nervous and afraid'. The practice of crooks using a secret system to identify potential victims has been dubbed the Da Pinchi Code (file picture) In January, an elderly couple in Devon were mystified when a series of dodgy tradesmen kept calling at their home. The visits took place over five years, but the homeowners could not work out why they were being singled out. Following an investigation it emerged that a rogue builder who paved their drive had left a code in a pattern of blocks to tip off other cowboy traders that the owners were a vulnerable target. The builder, who overcharged the couple by £4,000, left the job unfinished in August 2009 but he created a squared pattern of different coloured blocks at the centre of the driveway. The residents had not asked for the pattern but thought nothing of it until other tradesman began calling at their home in Plymstock offering to carry out work that was not required.","'X' marks have been spotted on garden sheds in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire .

"An artist with a surreal take on the natural world uses Photoshop to create whimsical, mind-bending pictures that would give Salvador Dali a run for his money. Anil Saxena, from Mumbai, uses ingenious retouching to create pictures of anything from a woman hanging a zebra's stripes on the line to dry to a pair of hands knitting a green field. He prides himself on his digital manipulation techniques, saying: 'If the image is a success but my work goes unnoticed, I'm doing my job well.' A woman in a colourful sari hangs up a zebra's stripes on a washing line . The photographer who has a background in graphic design and CGI, initially retouched his pictures by hand. Once he  started digital retouching he was able to turn his pictures into more complex flights of fancy. According to his biography on Design Taxi, the artist,  says the real work begins when 'lesser mortals might think that the image is just perfect.' The art website Behance says: 'Anil enjoys developing stunning imagery. He believes colour grading is paramount.' A painter colours  a giraffe as he leans a ladder against the animal . A sink is utilised as a swimming pool by a group of tiny people . Anil's photo manipulations blend the everyday with the bizarre, such as a man in a boiler suit climbing a ladder to paint a giraffe's distinctive coat pattern. In another a crystal swimming pool in which beautiful people lounge in bikinis or take a dip, is realised as a sink and instead of a giant diving board, they're all underneath a huge chrome tap.

"It's not uncommon for parents to want their children to follow in their footsteps - even if it's limited to just shared interests. But it seems that some are setting their kids on the chosen path earlier than expected. Especially these mothers and fathers, who have projected their geeky interests onto their slumbering newborns in a series of adorable photographs. Art and photography community, BoredPanda have created a thread encouraging parents to showcase their 'true nerdy colours' by dressing their babies up as sci-fi characters, like Princess Leia from Star Wars . Another baby is dressed up as widely-recognisable Nintendo character Mario, complete with tiny dungarees, the red flat cap and even a fake felt moustache . One sleeping newborn is sporting a completely knitted Wonder Woman costume . Art, design and photography community BoredPanda has created a thread encouraging parents to upload cute images of their babies showcasing their parents' 'true nerdy colors.' And of course, obliging parents have taken to the thread with professional photography shots of their trussed up newborns. Dressed as characters ranging across fantasy and sci-fi movies, books, TV shows and comic books, the adorable babies are seen in different scenarios and positions that have clearly been carefully arranged by their parents. A few of the images have even been subject to careful doctoring via Photoshop, in order to make the scenarios more realistic. Spiderman's a popular choice! Another baby is pictured alongside toy replicas of his superhero comrades . These babies are dressed as Star Wars Jedi knights, complete with light sabers and the characteristic brown cloak . One baby has been incorporated into a complicated Harry Potter scenario, complete with round-framed glasses, suitcases for Hogwarts and a magic wand . Some parents have really taken the geek-factor to the next level and have dressed their babes as characters from sci-film films such as Star Wars. One baby is seen as Princess Leia, surrounded by cuddly toy versions of the characters, while she herself is laid comfortably in the middle, wrapped in lace swaddling and sporting a hilarious knitted version of the famous hair-buns. Another baby is dressed as a Jedi, wrapped in a brown cloak characteristic of the monastic characters with an illuminated lightsaber propped up next to him. One newborn is kitted out as widely-recognisable Nintendo character Mario, complete with tiny dungarees, the red flat cap and even a fake felt moustache. To complete the illusion, the baby has been gently laid on an old-school Nintendo gaming device. Two sleeping newborns have been dressed up as comic book characters. One as Flash (pictured left) and one as a Ninja Turtle (pictured right) Down the rabbit hole: One slumbering babe is in a sweet Alice - from Alice in Wonderland - costume, complete with a knitted pocket watch and a grinning Cheshire cat . Other babies have been dressed up like characters from well-known children books. One soundly-sleeping newborn has been incorporated into a scenario from J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter franchise. The baby sports the character's signature round-frame glasses, while laid on top of a pile of suitcases - possibly alluding to his journey to wizarding school, Hogwarts - and is surrounded by the world-famous books, as well as a makeshift wand. Another little-one is undoubtedly dressed as Alice from Lewis Caroll's much-loved, Alice in Wonderland. The sleeping baby sports a blue ribbon hairband and clutches a pocket watch as well as a toy replica of the grinning Cheshire cat. One of the images sees a baby dressed up as a Ninja Turtle, with a full knitted costume, even complete with pizza slice props, one of the characters' idiosyncracies . A newborn has been incorporated into a toy line-up of the much-loved recent Disney film, Frozen . Some parents have chosen to project their love of comic books on their babies, with some newborns kitted out as immediately recognisable superheroes, such as Flash, Wonder Woman, Spiderman, and Ninja Turtle. These costumes are complete with props such as string for Spiderman's webspray, inflatable swords in place of real ones, and even pizzas for the Ninja Turtles. One parent has decided to go with a recent much-loved Disney animation: Frozen. Their newborn is seen emulating Olaf, the enthusiastic snowman, photoshopped next to a line-up of toy versions of the other characters. Another soundly-sleeping babe is a medieval knight and is cushioned up on a toy horse, sporting fleecy-looking grey knitted 'armour' and 'helmet', while another newborn is simply a 'geek' with oversized glasses, a bow tie and a smart-phone.

"A college basketball coach, a bar owner and a businessman were among seven killed in a private plane crash as they returned from the NCAA championship game. Illinois State associate coach Torrey Ward, meat processing business owner Scott Bittner and bar owner Terry Stralow have been confirmed as among the dead when the Cessna 414 crashed near Bloomington, Illinois, shortly after midnight on Tuesday. The party had been at the NCAA championship game between Duke and Wisconsin in Indianapolis, and Ward had made a last tweet showing off his transport to the game. He posted a picture of an aircraft different to the Cessna on Twitter with the words 'My ride to the game wasn't bad'. Bittner was married with a ten-year-old son and a twelve-year-old daughter. ISU's deputy director of athletics for external affairs, Aaron Leetch, was also killed in the crash about two miles away from Central Illinois Regional Airport. Scroll down for video .

Aaron Leetch was a shining star in this business. He had a gift in dealing with people and building relationships. Our external units were making incredible progress under his leadership, and he was on that trip doing what he does best. Torrey Ward was a big part of the success taking place with our men's basketball program. He had a big personality, was a talented coach and recruiter, and our fans loved him. Our hearts go out to the families and loved ones of those involved. There is no play in the playbook for times like these. We will miss Aaron and Torrey deeply, and we will support their families in any way that we can.

"Rescuers were given quite the surprise after a horse that was stuck in a muddy ditch for six hours turned out to be white when it was hosed down. Eighteen firefighters freed the Havana cob called Cody after he went for what turned out to be a lengthy dip in a bid to cool off in the warm weather. Relieved owner Tracey Hannant, from Bexleyheath, south London, said her horse looked like Black Beauty when it emerged from the ditch. Rescue: It took 18 firefighters to free white Havana cob Cody. He was trapped in a muddy ditch for six hours . Clean: How Cody looks when he hasn't been swimming in a ditch. The photo was taken after the horse's lengthy ordeal. The white Havana cob is pictured with Tyler Whimster, 13, son of his owner Tracey Hannant . She said she thought the horse had probably jumped in for a swim and praised London Fire Brigade crews who came to the rescue. 'They saved my boy's life,' she said. 'They were covered from head to toe, they stank, and they just kept doing everything they could. Cody, who is naturally white with ginger markings, found himself trapped in Anderson Way, Belvedere, for up to five or six hours last Friday. He was finally freed at 2.55pm by firefighters and the shaky horse was taken to his stables to see a vet who gave him painkillers, vitamin injections and a booster. Ms Hannant added: 'It was the most awful thing in the world. I was completely hysterical. 'If you can imagine your child stuck in there, that's what it was for me. 'He kept looking at me and there was nothing I could do.' Not a habit: Ms Hannant said it was the first time Cody had escaped from his field in six months of living there . Almost there: Cody was glad when he could finally touch down on dry land again. He was taken to his stables to see a vet who gave him painkillers, vitamin injections and a booster . Ms Hannant feared the firefighters would accidentally break Cody's leg or the 15-hand horse would panic and colic (stomach cramps), which is potentially fatal. The mum-of-three, who also has a baby grandchild, praised London Fire Brigade saying: 'They were all trying to keep him calm. 'They were talking about getting a crane at one point.' It took crews an hour-and-a-half to rescue Cody, who was lifted from the water by a device under his stomach. Ms Hannant said: 'No one could believe he was a white horse. 'When he got out he looked like Black Beauty.' It was the first time Cody escaped from his field in six months of living there. She thinks her water-loving horse broke out through a hole in the fence and jumped in for a swim, not realising he would get stuck. Horsing around: There was even talk of a crane having to be used at one point but rescuers eventually freed the Havana cob. His owner, Tracey Hannant, believed the horse had probably gone for a swim to cool off . Back at home: Cody's owner Tracey Hannant spoke of the moment he was rescued. She said: 'No one could believe he was a white horse. When he got out he looked like Black Beauty.' Her son Tyler, 13, with the horse . On dry land: Cody is enjoying being back home in his field with Tyler, who was out riding the horse again following the animal's rescue from a ditch in Anderson Way in Belvedere, south London on Friday last week . She spent all day Monday building a new electric fence to keep Cody and her other four horses safe. Ms Hannant added: 'Cody is not just a horse, I have brought him up since he was six-months-old. 'I felt so helpless. That was the worst pain I have ever known in my life.' She plans to take Cody to Erith fire station when he is fully recovered, to thank the 'amazing' firefighters in person.","Owner of white Havana cob Cody said her horse looked like Black Beauty .

"Frances Bean Cobain has admitted she's not a big fan of her dad's music in a candid new interview. Speaking to Rolling Stone Magazine about  her documentary Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck, the frontman's daughter revealed she's not really into Nirvana. 'I don't really like Nirvana that much,' she said. 'Sorry, promotional people, Universal.' Scroll down for video . Nevermind: Frances Bean Cobain, pictured here in September, has revealed she isn't a huge fan of her late father Kurt's music . SAINT LAURENT Babies 40 suede boots . Buy at Net a Porter . Visit site . She’s the daughter of the once ultimate rock power couple, Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain, so it’s no surprise that Frances Bean Cobain has evolved into a rock chick with very expensive taste. Instead of wearing Converse like many young girls of her age might do, Frances turned to the grungiest high fashion designer of them all, Saint Laurent, when it came to choosing a pair of boots to invest in. Rocking a pussy bow black blouse with black embellished leggings, Frances made her knee-high suede booties the key piece of her outfit and they certainly make a grand statement with their luxe finish and eye-catching tan hue.

'The grunge scene is not what I'm interested in.' However she does recognise her late father's genius, and admitted some of his songs still bring her to tears. 'Territorial P*ssings is a f**king great song. And Dumb, I cry every time I hear that song. It's a stripped-down version of Kurt's perception of himself; of himself on drugs, off drugs, feeling inadequate to be titled the voice of a generation.' The 22-year-old, who lost her dad to suicide when she was just 20 months old, said it wasn't awkward for her as a child not being a huge fan of his music. Abandoned: The 22-year-old was just 20 months old when the Nirvana frontman committed suicide, which she describes as being 'abandoned in the most awful way possible' 'I would have felt more awkward if I'd been a fan,' she said. 'I was around 15 when I realized he was inescapable. Even if I was in a car and had the radio on, there's my dad. He's larger than life, and our culture is obsessed with dead musicians. We love to put them on a pedestal. 'If Kurt had just been another guy who abandoned his family in the most awful way possible . . . But he wasn't. He inspired people to put him on a pedestal, to become St. Kurt. He became even bigger after he died than he was when he was alive. You don't think it could have gotten any bigger. But it did.' In the revealing interview, Frances also divulges why she thought her father shot himself exactly 21 years ago today, aged just 27. 'Kurt got to the point where he eventually had to sacrifice every bit of who he was to his art, because the world demanded it of him. 'I think that was one of the main triggers as to why he felt he didn't want to be here and everyone would be happier without him. Left behind: Frances and her mother Courtney Love at the January premiere of documentary film Kurt Cobain: Montage Of Heck at the Sundance Film Festival . 'There is, with any great artist, a little manic-ness and insanity. So many people are content to settle. 'My dad was exceptionally ambitious. But he had a lot thrown on him, exceeding his ambition. He wanted his band to be successful. But he didn't want to be the f**king voice of a generation. 'In reality, if he had lived, I would have had a dad. And that would have been an incredible experience.' While serving as an executive producer on the acclaimed documentary, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival this year, Frances said she told writer director Brett Morgen she didn't want to focus on the romanticism or mythology of her father. 'Even though Kurt died in the most horrific way possible, there is this mythology and romanticism that surrounds him, because he's 27 forever,' she said. 'The shelf life of an artist or musician isn't particularly long. Kurt has gotten to icon status because he will never age. He will always be that relevant in that time and always be beautiful. Too soon: Cobain was found shot dead in his home in Seattle exactly 21 years ago on Wednesday, aged just 27 . The visual artist also revealed that her fathers ex bandmates Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear get the 'K.C. Jeebies' when they see her, partially because she sounds just like Kurt. 'His speaking voice is sort of similar to mine. It's sort of a monotone,' she said. 'The depth to it is similar to the way I speak. I don't know what the f**k that is. I wasn't even talking when he was around. 'It's very weird how genes are. Dave, Krist and Pat came over to a house where I was living. It was the first time they had been together in a long time. And they had what I call the ""K. C. Jeebies,"" which is when they see me, they see Kurt. They look at me, and you can see they're looking at a ghost. They were all getting the K. C. Jeebies hardcore. 'Dave said, ""She is so much like Kurt."" They were all talking amongst themselves, rehashing old stories I'd heard a million times. I was sitting in a chair, chain-smoking, looking down like this,' she said, pretending to look bored. 'And they went, ""You are doing exactly what your father would have done."" 'But I was glad they came over,' she smiled. 'It was a cool experience, like having a Nirvana reunion minus one. Except for his spawn.' Frances also said of her dad's relationship with her mother Courtney Love: 'I always knew that their relationship was toxic. And I don’t promote having a fix-it baby, which is what I was - to fix their problems. 'But I know from the video footage and letters that I have that Kurt wrote me... my dad did love me.' Spooky: The visual artist said she gave Kurt's ex Nirvana bandmates the 'KC Jeebies' when they see her, because they are 'looking at a ghost'","Tells Rolling Stone in revealing interview how she was never a fan of her father's band, preferring Oasis .

"Tommy Connolly hadn't seen his teenage cousin in 10 years when she added him on Facebook out of the blue in December. The 23-year-old Sunshine Coast University student was enjoying semester break and training hard in the hope of one day representing Australia as a champion sprinter. He messaged his 17-year-old cousin Angela* (name has been changed for legal reasons) to see how she was doing and soon found out she was homeless, illiterate and 32 weeks pregnant. Mr Connolly picked her up from where she was sleeping rough on the Gold Coast, let her move into his flat, took care of her through the final stage of her pregnancy and is now helping to raise her four-week-old baby boy. Tommy Connolly, a 23-year-old Sunshine Coast University student, took in his homeless, pregnant 17-year-old cousin and his helping her raise her four-week-old baby boy . The 23-year-old Sunshine Coast University student says he didn't think twice about helping her . 'I went and picked her up and she basically started telling me about her situation, which was hard for me to hear because she was my favourite little cousin when I was growing up,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'To my knowledge she was OK... but in reality she wasn't at all. 'Basically she was living on the streets, she became addicted to ice and was doing terrible things to get by. She didn't have anything.' Mr Connolly said Angela – whose last year of schooling was Year Six – had stopped taking hard drugs by the time she was 15 but at 16 she fell pregnant, and her baby's father was sent to prison soon afterward. By the time Mr Connolly met up with her she was 32 weeks pregnant, and he said he didn't think twice about taking her in. 'It's not her fault she's just a little girl who needed help,' he said. Angela (not her real name) added Mr Connolly on Facebook after they hadn't seen each other in 10 years . 'Obviously I'm not going to let her stay on the streets. 'Everyone likes to tell me this is such a big responsibility, but I wasn't thinking about uni or work or anything, all I was doing was thinking that she needed me.' Because Mr Connolly was on university holidays at the time he had been working full time in his job at a fruit and vegetable wholesaler and he had saved $2800, just enough to cover the cost of moving into a new house and buying items for the baby. He put his athletics training on hold so he could work enough hours to save money, but he returned to university as normal at the beginning of March because he didn't want to delay his studies. Mr Connolly (pictured in the U.S. while studying there in 2013) still studies and works three days per week to support the three of them . When Angela gave birth to her baby Joshua* (name has been changed) on March 17, he was finishing off university assignments due the next day in the hospital waiting room. 'I went into uni the day after, I hadn't slept but I needed to do a presentation,' he said. Now that Joshua is four weeks old, Mr Connolly continues to go to class and is working three days per week to support the three of them. And while many other 23-year-olds would rather be spending their spare time partying with friends or travelling, he says he doesn't mind the impact that looking after Angela and Joshua is having on his social life. 'My closest mates are from training, so they're athletes, and they don't go out all the time,' he said. 'Most of the time they work, train and study, so I'm around a good crew of people.' His brother Liam has started a GoFundMe fundraising page in an effort to make Mr Connolly, Angela and Joshua's financial situation more stable. Mr Connolly said that, since sharing his story online, he has been getting messages from people all over Australia congratulating him for what he is doing. The champion sprinter says he doesn't mind the impact of his social life, as most of his friends are athletes and don't spend their spare time partying . 'I know what I've done is a really good thing but I feel guilty I'm getting all this attention,' he said. 'We've had all these messages which has made us realise there are so many other people in this situation, I don't want people to think it's a unique thing. 'I can't believe how many people have been in these shoes before, and have had no help or support when they were pregnant.' Mr Connolly added that he wasn't worried about how his situation would affect his plans to start his own family one day. 'Growing up everyone thinks about that stuff but you can't control that sort of stuff, it's not something that came into my head,' he said. 'At first when Joshua came into the world I didn't have an emotional attachment, all I was doing was looking after Angela. 'But I really do care for him and in a way he is my kid, I've taken on the father role as you'd imagine. 'Angela does 90 per cent of the work – and if it's one or two years of my life I have to put on hold to make sure two lives are going to be saved it's nothing at all.' 'If it's one or two years of my life I have to put on hold to make sure two lives are going to be saved it's nothing at all,' said Mr Connolly, pictured with his friend and fellow athlete Olivia Tauro .","Tommy Connolly hadn't seen his teenage cousin Angela* in 10 years .

He received £100,000, performed at the 2011 Royal Variety Performance and was signed to Syco Music. However by 2012, due to poor album sales, the singer/songwriter was dropped after fulfilling his one-album contract. He then, ironically, bought a house on Fail Avenue. In 2013 Jai performed at the March & Rally for Scottish Independence in Edinburgh, and in 2014 he was the support act on the Gareth Gates UK tour. Jai McDowall failed to set the music world alight after winning Britain's Got Talent in 2011 and was dropped by Syco records after his first album. But the singer continues to play gigs and last year he supported Gareth Gates on the Pop Idol singer's UK tour . Ashleigh and Pudsey . Series 6 - 2012 .

But once the spotlight comes off - what happens to them?"
"Probably the most extraordinary thing about the island of St Helena is that it was ever found at all. A tiny ten by six mile speck in the South Atlantic 1,200 miles from the coast of West Africa, it lay undiscovered for around 14 million years able to evolve its own unique flora and fauna untouched by the outside world. But almost from the moment Portuguese explorer Juan de Nova was blown there by the Trade Winds in 1502 it assumed an importance out of all proportion to its size. Jamestown is the capital of the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, discovered by in 1502 by Juan de Nova . It was a key stopping place for the ships of the East India Company and other vessels - at its peak it serviced a thousand a year. It played a role in both slavery and its abolition: when the trade became illegal it was the base from which the British sought to capture the perpetrators and free their human cargo. And it was the place to which Napoleon was exiled after his defeat at Waterloo. The emperor who had escaped Elba was not going to get away so easily from the most isolated place on earth. Framed by cragged volcanic cliffs soaring 800 metres (2,600 feet) above sea level, the island is just 122 square kilometres in total . The island, which is smaller than central Paris has just 4,200 inhabitants - and 850 of them live in the small capital of Jamestown . Early next year a £218m airport will open and make this British Overseas Territory no longer quite so isolated. At the moment though the only way to get there is still by sea and for most that means the RMS St. Helena. This Royal Mail Ship is the island’s lifeline. It carries in all its supplies and up to 150 passengers who range from returning or departing Saints (as the residents are known) to tourists with a taste for something different as well as, more recently, construction workers, entrepreneurs and conservation experts. Early next year, an airport will open on the island. The £218 million project will make this British Overseas Territory far more accessible . Once the airport is open in February 2016, the ship service - which takes five days from Cape Town - will be retired . Here, the runway of the future airport is visible. The upcoming airport will be located in the Prosperous Bay Plain area of the island . This means it’s a ship of two halves: the front laden with dozens of huge containers, the back a sun deck where we take dips in the little swimming pool and play quoits, shuffleboard, skittles and passengers v. crew cricket. In between are a couple of lounges with bars where travellers can listen to talks and watch films. These are not compulsory, of course, and many of the Saints for whom the voyage is basically just a bus service sit and watch benignly. For the rest of us they’re a wonderful ice-breaker and a source of great fun and fierce rivalry: passions are running particularly high by the final of the three night accumulator quiz. As it stands, the only way to reach Saint Helena is via ship - the RMS St. Helena, a Royal Mail Ship that transports all supplies to the island . Traveller Liz Gill describes the ship as a 'ship of two halves': the front laden with dozens of huge containers, with a sundeck out back . We are fortified in all this by the most enormous hearty meals: there’s even an extra savoury course after the cheese at dinner though I never get that far myself. Sailing on the St. Helena has been like stepping back in time. Captain Rodney Young himself tells me that sometimes he surveys the deck and thinks this is still a bit of Empire on which the sun has not yet set. For me at times though it seems even further back and I think a lot about all those ancient mariners crossing this vast ocean where in a ten-day round trip we sight only two other ships and even the wandering albatrosses say goodbye after a couple of days. It’s good preparation for the island itself which emerges from the waves at dawn like a dream. There is in fact something rather Alice-in-Wonderland-ish about St Helena as if everything has shrunken to produce a geography and a society in miniature. The edge of the runway will offer spectacular views of the blue water, nestled among the jagged rocks of the coastline . While visiting, Liz climbed the island's infamous Jacob’s Ladder: a 699-step staircase that towers 600 feet in the air . So within only 47 square miles of land mass there are barren deserts and lush cloud forests, a black sand beach and towering crags, rolling pastureland and peaks of up to 2,700 feet. On a central ridge it’s possible to look in one direction on the empty moonscape of Sandy Bay and in another on sheep scattered fields which could be in Sussex. Similarly in human terms for a population of 4,000, barely the size of an English village, there is a governor, a legislative council, a hospital, three primary and one secondary school, a cathedral with a bishop plus places of worship for several different denominations, a police force, a prison, two newspapers and two radio stations. What this means for the visitor is a wide range of activities. I seemed to fill almost every hour of the nine days I spent there while the ship sailed on to Ascension Island and back. Despite being barely the size of an English village, the capital boasts a legislative council, several schools and two newspapers . Two were spent walking: there are lots of trails graded in difficulty and many routes have ‘post boxes’ which hold visitors books and rubber stamps. One day we climbed Diana’s Peak in the company of David Pryce, a mine-of-information Englishman known locally as The Bug Man who is on a three year project to catalogue the local invertebrates. On another we walked with a young Saint Aaron Legg to Lot’s Wife’s Ponds, Lot and his wife being giant geological features and the pool being a serene inlet protected by rocks from the crashing waves beyond and filled with colourful fish. The walk was an hour’s climb up a steep rocky hillside and half an hour’s descent down the other side ending in having to slither down a rope for the last 30 feet but more than worth it. It was one of the loveliest places where I have ever swum. Marine life is a big attractions for snorkelers and divers – there are also several wrecks to explore – and fishermen who can chase tuna, wahoo and marlin. We were too late for the seasonal visit of whale sharks but 200 dolphins did their best to compensate, cavorting around our boat as we sailed out to the seabird colonies. I also had an enchanting afternoon watching wirebirds, the island’s only endemic bird so called because of its spindly legs and something of a conservation success story. The island is full of trails - of varying levels of difficulty - as well as fabulous swimming and diving opportunities . As well as there being several ship wrecks to explore, the marine life is another major draw for snorkellers and divers alike . By contrast there was a Napoleon themed day: a visit to Briars Pavilion where he stayed briefly when he first arrived, Longwood House where he lived for six years until his death in 1821 and his tomb in the pretty valley setting he chose himself. Though his body was repatriated to France 19 years later and much of Longwood’s contents like the clothes and the death masks are replicas, the places are still resonant if melancholy. And it’s not every day one can stand on the exact spot where an emperor passed away.. Other experiences included a cookery lesson making tuna fishcakes, pumpkin stew and pilau – pronounced plo – a spicy legacy of St Helena’s diversity, which its people made up from arrivals from India, China, Madagascar, Britain and West Africa. There were also visits to the ‘world’s remotest distillery’ run by ex-pat Brit Paul Heckling who produces among other drinks a spirit called tungi made from prickly pear and’ the world’s remotest coffee plantation’ run by another ex-pat Bill Bolton who decided to revive the Bourbon Arabica bushes originally brought over from Yemen in 1732. Saint Helena is also home to the 'world's most remote distillery' and the 'world's remotest coffee plantation,' both run by British ex-pats . Then there was the small but excellent museum, the forts, batteries and cannons dotted around the place, the fine collection of St Helena prints and drawings at Prince’s Lodge (in pre-photography days ships had their own artists on board) , the Boer cemetery (6,000 were imprisoned here during the Boer War but given freedom to work, trade and organise events) and the Plantation House grounds to see Jonathan the tortoise who is at least 182 years old and probably the world’s oldest reptile. And finally I did what any self-respecting visitor has to do and climbed Jacob’s Ladder. Once a tramway for hauling goods up the cliff side in the capital Jamestown this is now a terrifyingly steep 600 ft high staircase of 699 steps. Not wanting to risk passing out halfway up, I took it very slowly, pausing every 50 steps and reaching the top in 28 minutes. I was pretty puffed up with pride but quickly deflated when I learned the record stands at 5 minutes 11 seconds.

"Britain is paying professional aid workers up to £1,000 a day. David Cameron has been criticised for ramping up aid spending . Britain is paying professional aid workers up to £1,000 a day to work in Africa and Asia as part of a huge push to meet government targets on aid spending, it was claimed last night. Spending on consultants has doubled to £1.4billion over the past four years and now makes up more than ten per cent of all foreign aid spending, an investigation revealed. Hundreds of ‘team leaders’ working on aid projects earn at least £120,000 a year once the costs of their expenses, security and accommodation are taken into account, an investigation found. Daily rates of between £800 and £1000 are commonplace, the Times newspaper claimed. The revelations will return attention to Britain’s growing aid budget, which now accounts for some £12 billion of public spending a year. The Coalition government committed to spending 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid – and even passed legislation to enshrine the target into law. That target means that aid spending will increase every year if the economy grows, even if other areas of government spending face swingeing cuts. David Cameron has been criticised for ramping up aid spending while slashing funding for the police, defence and justice. The details of consultant spending sparked outrage among backbench Tories who have opposed the aid target. Philip Davies, who is Tory parliamentary candidate for Shipley said: ‘When people think of overseas aid they think of people who have aid their homes damaged by an earthquake, a hurricane or a tsunami. They don’t expect to be lining the pockets of consultant fat cats. ‘This is what happens when you are judged only by how much you are spending. How you actually spend the money becomes immaterial. It leads to grotesque waste and overspending.’ The Department for International Development said it uses private sector companies as well as charities to deliver aid projects if they were the best placed to do the job. But officials insisted that spending on external consultants giving advice to the department had fallen. A spokesman said: ‘DfID has slashed spending on external consultancy and advisory services by 98.9 per cent since 2009, down to just £200,000 last year, but we rightly continue to use the private sector where it delivers aid projects on the ground that are effective and the best value for money.’ Afghan widows queueing up and waiting to receive aid in Kabul, Afghanistan . The Times quoted anonymous ‘insiders’ claiming that private firms were making huge profits of 50 per cent on aid projects. A report in January by the National Audit Office found civil servants at the department went on a £1billion spending spree over eight weeks to hit the government target. Money was spent at the end of last year on humanitarian programmes but MPs questioned whether the rate of spending meant it achieved value for money. The coalition aid commitment – meant Dfid was required to spent some £11.46 billion in 2013.. But in June that year officials realised they would have to spend another £2.7billion in November and December to hit the target. Months later that target was revised up again by another £1billion over those two months, taking the total to £3.7billion. The NAO report said the burst of spending that raised concerns the money was not used wisely. It said: “Given the limited time available the department could only choose activities where funds could be paid out during 2013. It may therefore have missed opportunities to get the best outcomes from this spending.”","Spending on consultants doubled to £1.4billion over the past four years .

"The chilling details of a 'resurrection ceremony' held for a 'possessed' two-year-old boy in a Texas residence have emerged following the arrest of a pastor who is accused of helping to starve the boy to rid him of a 'demon.' Witnesses told police that pastor Aracely Meza, 49, and the boy's parents believed he had a 'demon' inside of him, and that he was starved for 25 days, being given only water four to five times a day. Church member Nazareth Zurita said the toddler, whose name has not been released, fell and hit his head several times, but she hesitated to help him 'due to his demon possession.' The chilling details of a 'resurrection' ceremony held for a 'possessed' two-year-old boy in a Texas residence have emerged following the arrest of a pastor who is accused of helping starve the boy to rid him of a demon (above Aracely Meza during the alleged resurrection holding the two-year-old boy) In the video, Meza is seen next to a man who appears to be her husband Pastor Daniel Meza, as she uses oils and prays while trying to bring the boy, identified by a witness as Benjamin, back to life (above scenes from the attempted resurrection) In the shocking video capturing the 'resurrection ceremony', which reportedly lasted for hours, Meza places oil on the child's head while reciting prayers as she holds him in her arms. In the video, the boy is identified by a witness as Benjamin. Police believe the child was dead during the ceremony but that his parents took his body to their native Mexico for burial without reporting the death, said Balch Springs police Lt. Mark Maret. During the ceremony, Meza invokes Jesus to give life to the child saying 'in the name of Jesus, I’m utilizing this oil to try to get him back to life', according to the Dallas Morning News. Maret said: 'They didn't give the child any food for about 25 days. They just gave him some water, which ultimately caused the child to die.' Delia Guadalupe Oyervides Herrera, another church member, told police she tried several times to feed the child during the 25-day fast, 'but was scolded by the pastors of the church,' according to the affidavit. She asked the child's mother why she would allow her child to be starved and was 'advised that it was God's will.' Meza was charged on Monday with injury to a child by omission. She is currently being held on a $100,000 bond . Meza was charged on Monday  with injury to a child by omission, according to NBCDFW. She is currently being held on a $100,000 bond, a police spokesman told Daily Mail Online on Monday. She was taken into custody for helping starve the child and then holding a resurrection ceremony at the Balch Springs residence shortly after he died to try and revive him, investigators said on Tuesday. Maret said an anonymous tip about the ceremony at Meza's home on Duke Drive - which also operated as Iglesia Internacional Jesus es el Rey Church - where several other church members also lived, led to the investigation. He noted that more arrests are likely to follow. 'Apparently, they had a ceremony called ""the rising"" trying to resurrect the child back to life,' said Maret. Zurita said she saw the child 'looking frail and weak' the day before the resurrection ceremony, according to a police affidavit. She said the next time she saw the child was the following day during a ceremony held by church leader Daniel Meza, who is married to Aracely Meza. He was trying to revive the boy through a miracle during the ritual. Zurita, who identified herself as the secretary and third-ranking officer, said 'it took her a while to figure out' the child was dead, according to the affidavit. Police believe the child was dead during the ceremony but that his parents took his body to their native Mexico for burial without reporting the death, said police . A report from earlier this month said that services took place at the residence on Duke Drive which also operated as Iglesia Internacional Jesus es el Rey Church with services presided by Daniel and Aracely Meza (both pictured above) Investigators believe the boy died on March 21 or early the next day, and that the ceremony was held March 22 at the residence. Meza 'was considered a prophet' who 'would advise to the other members of the church what God has spoken to her,' according to Zurita. She said Meza's husband was the church's leader and Meza was its second-ranking officer. Last month, police went to the home on March 26 in Balch Springs to do a welfare check and were told by residents that a two-year-old child had died and a 'rising ceremony' was performed, according to CBS. Meza and her husband are pastors who presided over the church services held at the residence  and also lived there along with other families including that of the two-year-old boy, according to WFAA. Witnesses told police the boy went 25 days without food before he died and was only given water four to five times a day . Members of the Igelisa Internacional Jesus es el Rey Church re-enact a scene from the crucifixion which on Facebook was titled as 'Drama Crucifixion & Resurrección Pascua 2014' In a report earlier this month, neighbors told WFAA that cars would fill the street for services, presided by the Mezas, but that no one knew what was happening inside of the home operating also as Iglesia Internacional Jesus es el Rey Church. 'When it was church hours they would set it up as a church, then when it was over, back to a home,' neighbor Bryan Cruz told WFAA who grew up with the children in the home. The home was not registered or zoned to operate as a church, code inspectors for the city said, however its website states the national headquarters are at the home's address. Emergency services do not appear to have called until police received an anonymous tip four days later. Police said there is no record of the child's death being reported. The child's parents took the body to Mexico the following day. Two phone numbers listed for the single-story home were disconnected. Police went to a home on March 26 in Balch Springs, Texas, (pictured) to do a wellness check and were told that a two-year-old child had died . A neighbor told Daily Mail Online earlier this month that five children under the age of ten, both boys and girls, were also living at the home and had been taken away by Child Protective Services. Joy Donaldson said that she once complained to the woman who lived at the home about two of the boys, who had been bothering her dogs. The woman, whose name she did not know, told her that the children did not know any better 'because they had been taken off the streets of Mexico'. A second neighbor, Jean Turnipseed, told Daily Mail Online that she had heard  that church services were taking place at the home on Saturdays and Sunday nights, where people were being charged at the door. Mr Meza along with the boy's parents are a part of the investigation as it continues.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Detectives investigating the Hatton Garden gem heist missed the most crucial CCTV footage so far until it was flagged up by a shocked worker more than one week later, it is claimed. The 'crystal clear' footage - said to be of a significantly higher quality than the video currently in the public domain - was handed into the Metropolitan Police by a worker based 50ft from the crime scene. The worker had reportedly contacted 101 - the police non-emergency number - on Monday last week, believing detectives would already have similar images of the £60m raid. Scroll down for video . Detectives investigating the Hatton Garden gem heist missed the most crucial CCTV footage so far until it was flagged up by a shocked worker more than one week later, it is claimed . But, even though police raced to obtain the CCTV once the report was made, the force has refused to make the images public – despite claims it is the best footage yet. It comes after the force was criticised  for ignoring an alarm that went off just after midnight on Good Friday - four days before the raid was discovered. A veteran trader in the London ­jewellery quarter told The Sunday Mirror: 'It is unreal it took this employee to bring these images to the attention of the police. The ­footage could be crucial in collaring the crooks. 'You would assume the officers had done everything to get CCTV footage.' Scotland Yard has already come under fire for its handling of the heist, with the ex-head of the Flying Squad John O’Connor criticising the decision to ignore the alarm as 'totally incompetent'. The Southern Monitoring Alarm Company had contacted the Metropolitan Police’s Central Communications Command after the robbers set off the alarm  on Good Friday. But although police recorded the call, it was graded so that ‘no police response was deemed to be required’. It was not until Tuesday morning that detectives realised what had happened. When asked why the new footage had not been released, a police spokesman said the force would not discuss 'specifics' of CCTV being examined and would release appropriate footage when needed for a public appeal. The 'crystal clear' footage is said to be of a significantly higher quality than the video currently in the public domain, which was released last week (pictured) Last week, questioned were raised over the police's handling of the case after CCTV footage showing the robbers at work was published in The Daily Mirror - 21 hours before they were released by Scotland Yard . They said: 'The Metropolitan Police has ­obtained and is examining a substantial amount of CCTV footage in relation to the burglary at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit. 'This footage has come from many different places. We will not discuss the specifics of the CCTV we are examining and will release information in a timely manner for appeal purposes only. 'Police continue to seize CCTV with assistance from members of the public as the investigation progresses.' Last week, questioned were raised over the police's handling of the case after CCTV footage showing the robbers at work was published in The Daily Mirror, 21 hours before they were released by Scotland Yard. Mahendra Bavishi, joint director of the safe deposit company, said he was furious at police for ignoring an alarm which went off just on Good Friday . The tabloid claims it handed the images to police, who were 'delighted' with the find. One source said the footage 'blows the case wide open'. But detectives later insisted they already had the CCTV footage, which they claim was recovered 'at the earliest opportunity'. Hours earlier, police had refused to tell MailOnline whether they had the footage. The furore raised questions about why the police chose to keep the footage to themselves - or whether they even had the footage - despite it being one of the largest ever burglaries in the capital. But officers from Scotland Yard's Flying Squad did release images of three suspects. They refused to release a picture of the supposed ringleader, likely because he has already been identified. Earlier this week, Mahendra Bavishi, the joint director of the safe deposit company robbed in the raid, said  he believed it was an inside job. Mr Bavishi, who lives in Sudan, said detectives had asked to put some ‘sensitive’ questions to his British-based son Manish who runs the business - including whether he suspects someone connected to the company or other firms in the same premises had links with criminal gangs. He added that the robbers almost certainly had some inside information because they appeared to know that several CCTV cameras in the building where his firm is based were not working when they broke in. The 69-year-old also told of his fury at police for ignoring the alert from the state of the art alarm in the vault while the gang were carrying out the raid. The incident took place over the Easter weekend, when the gang forced their way into 72 safe deposit boxes by sneaking into the block, abseiling down a lift shaft to the underground vault and drilling through a 7ft-thick concrete wall. It is estimated that anything from £60million to £200million of jewellery and cash was removed from the company’s vaults in London’s diamond district. Meanwhile, police are investigating links between the Hatton Garden incident and a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in Berlin. In a case which has strikingly similar traits to the £60m heist in London, thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break-in at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013. The gang, who fled the bank with diamonds, gold and silver worth more than £8.3m, have never been found. It now appears that the Berlin heist bore all the hallmarks of the Easter weekend raid in London, including the use of a heavy-duty drill to bore through concrete walls, and the belief that the well-planned burglary was carried out with the help of an insider. German detectives are now keen to find out whether any DNA was recovered from the scene of the Easter weekend raid and whether it matches forensic samples found in a tunnel used in the robbery.","'Crystal clear' footage was found by worker based 50ft away from scene .

Salim Mulla, chairman of the halal sub-committee at the Lancashire Council of Mosques, said: 'I think there are quite a few manufacturers who sell halal sweets but this is the first major supermarket to sell halal confectionery. I really welcome that. Halal  involves specific methods of killing animals which adhere to Islamic laws. Livestock or poultry must be slaughtered by cutting the jugular vein and carotid artery while the animal is alive and healthy. The blood is then drained from the carcass, while a Muslim recites a dedication. Views differ over whether the animal can be stunned before being killed. Halal sweets include only gelatin from halal slaughtered animals and do not contain any other animal-derived ingredients from non-halal animals. 'It is definitely something the Council of Mosques would support. Sweets are very popular with the Muslim community. I think the pick and mix will do really well.' Until now, Muslims have had to look at the ingredients to see if the sweets are suitable to eat as some contain animal products which are not halal. Abdul Hamid Qureshi, chairman of the Lancashire Council of Mosques, added: 'More and more supermarkets are introducing halal products to meet the needs of the customers, but this is the first halal pick and mix I have heard of. 'There will be financial reasons behind it. Businesses will not just sell products for social needs. 'Chains such as KFC have started offering Halal products to attract a new, younger audience and a larger demographic.' Tolu Oshinowo, Deputy Store Manager, at Morrisons, Blackburn enjoys some of the 36 sweets on offer .","Supermarket giant becomes first to introduce halal-only sweet counters .

"James Ward (pictured) was left with a severed finger and wounds all over of his body after being attacked at his home by axe-wielding intruders . A father-of-six who was attacked with an axe lost a finger in the incident which left him needing 38 staples to seal wounds all over his body. James Ward, 31, of Burnley, Lancashire, also had several other fingers partially severed and surgeons were forced to use staples to seal wounds to his head, legs, and back. They managed to reattach his left index finger. Mr Ward is now in hiding and is too afraid to return to his home and see his children because he fears his attackers will kill him if he does. He said: 'I'm too scared to go back. I think they thought the job was done. I have done things in the past but nothing to warrant this attack.' He was painting his kitchen  just after midnight when he heard a noise at the front of the house. 'I ran towards the front door and turned to talk to my four friends who were there when the door went through,' he said. 'I was hit in the back with an axe. 'All the others ran upstairs. After they cut my finger off there was a lot of blood so I think panic set in.' As Mr Ward put his hands up to protect himself, his left index finger was chopped off, while several others were also partially severed. The pair then struck him repeatedly on his arms, head, legs, and back. Mr Ward said: 'I'm only a few stone wet through and they could have beaten me up with just their hands. I was on the floor when they hit me in the head with the axe. 'And if the axe had been sharp instead of blunt, they would have chopped my arm off.' 'I don't know why they stopped. They said if I went to the police they would kill me. 'I have done things in the past but nothing to warrant this attack.' Mr Ward is pictured shortly after the attack - he needed 38 staples to seal the wounds all over his body . The frenzy was finally over when Mr Ward dragged himself to safety under a kitchen counter. He stumbled outside and was spotted by a neighbour, who called the emergency services. Mr Ward said: 'I was woozy because I had lost a lot of blood. My neighbour asked if I was all right and I was saying, 'I can't find my finger.' He was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital before being transferred to Preston, where he was kept for treatment and his own safety until his family could fetch him and take him to his hometown of Manchester, where he is now recovering from the ordeal. He said: 'I'm having to get my mum to help me wash. I feel like a child again. 'I feel like crying all the time and I can't go out on my own. I'm too scared to go and see my own children. 'I can't get it out my head. I can't sleep at night and I don't know what to do.' Detectives investigating the attack on Saturday, April 4, are urging anybody with information to come forward as the search for the bloodied weapons continues. Mr Ward is now in hiding and is too afraid to return home because he fears his attackers will kill him . Mr Ward said: 'Near to my house is spare ground, a lot of woodland and the canal so they might have thrown them in there.' Det Sgt Alisa Wilson said: 'This was a horrific attack on a young man in his own home. 'I am appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the offence, the aftermath or has any information in connection with it to make contact. 'Despite charges being brought against one man, the investigation is continuing and I am appealing for witnesses to come forward.' A 23-year-old man appeared before magistrates in Burnley yesterday charged with aggravated burglary and grievous bodily harm. He was remanded in custody and will make his next appearance at Burnley Crown Court at 9.30am on Thursday, May 7. A 22-year-old man was also arrested and was released on bail pending further enquiries.

"Our young Earth may have collided with a body similar to the planet Mercury, says a new paper. The dramatic event could explain why our planet has a hot core that gives it its magnetic field. And it could also explain why certain rare-earth elements in Earth’s mantle do not seem to originate from the planet’s other building blocks - meteorites. Oxford scientists say a Mercury-like body struck the young Earth (artist's illustration shown). The object would have been the heat source for our planet's core. The same object could have been responsible for creating the moon. It also explains where some rare-Earth elements came from . The study, by two scientists from the University of Oxford, was published in the journal Nature. Our current theory of Earth’s formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body. However, this model cannot explain where the heat source for Earth’s core - and ultimately its magnetic field - came from. In addition, Earth’s crust and mantle appear to have a higher ratio of the rare-earth elements samarium and neodymium than most meteorites - suggesting there was more at play in Earth’s formation than first thought. To address this discrepancy, scientists believe that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars - but like Mercury in its composition - early in its life. This likely would have happened about 4.5 billion years ago. The body would have been rich in sulphur but very poor in oxygen - just like Mercury. Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. But one mystery has persisted, revealed by rocks the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and Earth so similar in their composition? Several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of Earth and the moon. Perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the Earth and then later condensed to form the moon. Or Theia could have, coincidentally, been isotopically similar to young Earth. A third possibility is that the moon formed from Earthen materials, rather than from Theia, although this would have been a very unusual type of impact. Our current theory of Earth’s (left) formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body. Now scientists think that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars, but like Mercury (right) in its composition, early in its life. In the young solar system 4.5 billion years ago, illustrated, various planetesimals and other small bodies coalesced together to form larger bodies like Earth . As it collided with Earth, it would have produced radioactive uranium and thorium, generating the heat needed to drive the ‘dynamo’ of molten iron in Earth’s core. And they do not rule out the possibility that this is the same Mars-sized body that formed the moon. ‘We think that that is quite conceivable,’ said study co-author Bernard Wood, reported the LA Times. ‘It's kind of exciting to think that this reduced body could actually be the thing which caused the moon.’ In an accompanying News and Views article for Nature, Dr Richard Carlson of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC said the theory could open up new avenues for thought.. For example, if true, it would raise further questions about ‘how Earth ended up in its present oxidised state, which it has apparently retained for more than three billion years.’","Oxford scientists say a Mercury-like body struck the young Earth .

"Condition: Jessica Knight can't stop eating carpet underlay and the stuffing from soft furnishings . It's not the first time a child has been accused of eating her parents out of house and home – but in Jessica Knight’s case, it’s literally true. The four-year-old has an unusual appetite for furniture, soft furnishings and fittings, and doctors say they are unable to treat her. Hardly anything is off the youngster’s menu, with the filling from a rocking horse, padding in an armchair and even carpet underlay taking her fancy. Other non-food items she devours include sand and chips of cement from paving blocks. Jessica suffers from pica, a rare medical disorder that leads to an appetite for non-nutritious substances. It is more commonly recognised among pregnant women, some of whom develop unusual cravings. ‘I was really shocked when I realised just how much she was eating. If you lift up the carpet in her room now you can see there is no underlay left,’ said her mother, Kelly Will. ‘We are at our wits’ end. We try to keep her busy so she doesn’t do it, but if we try to stop her she will find a way to do it. ‘I’d have to remove everything from my house, including all chairs and sofas.’ Miss Will, 36, first noticed the problem when Jessica was two and began eating the filling from a children’s armchair. Staff at her pre-school also spotted her licking her hands and placing them in a sandpit before sucking the grains from her fingers, before tell-tale signs of snack-attacks became clear from the damage to items around the house. Jessica, who has a three-year-old sister, Jennifer, is now allowed to keep a small purse filled with some of the spongy underlay to eat. Cravings: Jessica's Pica makes her want to eat substances including sponge, sand and even rocks . Worry: Kelly Knight says doctors are unable to treat Jessica until she is six years old . Her mother, who lives in March, Cambridgeshire, with partner Chris Knight, 40, an engineer, said: ‘We’d rather she ate the underlay because it is non-toxic. If we try and stop her we fear she will eat something with chemicals in it.’ Pica is an eating disorder that is characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value. These can include stones, sand, paint and dirt. It is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy. It can cause a range of serious complications if the person is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible. These include being poisoned by toxic ingredients and having a part of the body obstructed (which is often seen in people who eat hair). It can also lead to excessive calorie intake, but also nutritional deprivation if the person eats a substance with no nutritional value instead of nutritious foods. The person can also damage their teeth and be infected with parasites. Experts have examined Jessica but said they cannot intervene until she is six, and old enough to make conscious decisions about what she eats rather than acting on impulse. Fortunately, she does like plain sausages, cheese strings, rice pudding, bread, Weetabix and fish fingers. But her unusual snacks can leave her in agony because they cause stomach cramps and constipation. Despite her tender years, Jessica is aware that her diet is highly unusual, and does worry what people would think of her craving different food. She also shuts her little sister out of their shared room when she is satisfying one of her cravings, saying: ‘I don’t want her to be poorly.’ The family will find out this month if Jessica is on the autistic spectrum, which is often linked to pica. The Challenging Behaviour Foundation, a learning problems charity, said: ‘It is estimated that four to 26 per cent of people with learning disabilities display pica behaviour. ‘Whilst some objects pass through the body without harm, pica can potentially be life-threatening. Risks include vomiting, blockages, choking and poisoning.’ Dr Alison Sansome, clinical director at Cambridgeshire Community Services NHS Trust, added: ‘Pica is a complex condition and treatment is dictated by the specific circumstances in each case.’ Damage: Half of the carpet underlay in Jessica's bedroom has vanished because she has eaten it . Control: Jessica's parents have given her a purse full of bits of sponge to eat .","Jessica Knight loves eating carpet underlay and furniture stuffing .

"A 24-year-old widow from Virginia has been charged with first-degree murder after police say she killed her former father-in-law because she blamed him for introducing her husband to drugs at a young age and driving him to suicide. Amanda Taylor, of Blacksburg, was apprehended in North Carolina last Sunday following a multi-state manhunt sparked by the murder of her former relative by marriage, 59-year-old Charles Taylor, who was discovered stabbed to death at his home near Ellet April 4. Taylor's suspected partner in crime, 32-year-old Sean Ball, was found wounded on the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina after the 24-year-old woman allegedly tried to kill him. Widow's rampage: Amanda Taylor (left), 24, has been charged with murder after she allegedly stabbed her former father-in-law Charles Taylor (right), 59, in retaliation for last year's suicide of her husband, Rex (pictured right) 'Accomplice' turned victim: Sean Ball, 32, who is also facing charges in Charles Taylor's death, was seriously wounded when police say Amanda Taylor turned on him as the two were fleeing police . Confession: While out on a lam, Taylor took to Facebook apparently confessing to the deadly stabbing . The young widow, who had an apparent fascination with serial killers and violence, has made multiple confessions on social media before she was ultimately apprehended following a brief police pursuit. Initially, Taylor was charged with second-degree murder, but on Monday the charge was upgraded to first-degree murder carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years to life, reported the local station WDBJ7. The mother of two, who is currently being held in Western Virginia Regional Jail, also faces federal attempted murder, assault and weapons charges in North Carolina for allegedly trying to kill Sean Ball as the two were fleeing police. The 32-year-old man, who remains hospitalized with life-threatening injuries, has been charged with second-degree murder in the killing of Charles Taylor. According to friends and family, Amanda Taylor was devastated when her husband, Rex Taylor, hanged himself last August. The 24-year-old reportedly believed that her father-in-law was to blame for Rex's suicide because he was the one who had introduced the young man to drugs at age 15. Blame game: The 24-year-old mother of two reportedly blamed her father-in-law for introducing Rex to drugs at age 15 . Chilling post: The fugitive uploaded a photo of a silver revolved resting in her lap, accompanied by a message suggesting that Taylor was planning to take her own life . Left for dead: Sean Ball (left) was discovered unresponsive on the side of a North Carolina highway after police say Taylor (right) shot him . In her own defense: Sometime before her arrest, Amanda Taylor again took to Instagram to defend her violent actions . Rex Taylor's addiction presumably triggered his depression, which ultimately led to a suicide by hanging last summer. Seven months later, in late March, Amanda voluntarily checked into Saint Albans Hospital following an incident at her husband's gravesite, where her friends feared she was going to take her own life on the day of their shared birthday, reported Roanoke Times. Taylor was supposed to undergo a 72-hour psychiatric evaluation, but to the surprise of her mother and friends, she was unexpectedly released April 1. Three days later, on the night of April 4, investigators say Taylor and her acquaintance, Sean Ball, drove down to Charles Taylor's home in the Ellet area and allegedly stabbed the man to death as he rested on the coach in retaliation for his son's suicide. Dark obsession: According to friends, Rex and Amanda Taylor had a fascination with the macabre and were in correspondence with incarcerated serial killers . The next day, Ms Taylor took to social media while on the run from police confessing to the crime. On her Facebook page, the young widowed mother wrote in a status update Sunday morning: 'I proudly did this for Rex. I love my children but charles killed my husband.' Around the same time, the fugitive uploaded a photo of a silver revolver resting in her lap behind the wheel of her getaway car. The photo was accompanied by a message suggesting that Taylor was planning to take her own life. 'Alright..its about that time. Im going to go find my husband in Hell & finally be at peace,’ she wrote. ‘I love you mom & my beautiful crazies, i know youll give them the life i just couldnt after everything. Mariah ill always love you & those monsters. I cant apoligize cause im finally going to be free.' Amanda Taylor was apprehended by police later that day after a short chase near Asheville, North Carolina. A strip with spikes stretched across the road by officers helped stop her car. Her alleged accomplice, Sean Ball, was discovered at a nearby hospital, where he was taken after being left for dead on the side of the road. Sometime before her arrest, Amanda Taylor again took to Instagram. From her chilling post it becomes apparent that the 24-year-old was under the impression that she had killed Ball, but he survived the attack. 'Everything i did was for the right reasons,’ she stated. ‘I stabbed my father in law to death because he destroyed my husband with drugs ..depression. ‘i wasnt the perfect wife but this was one last good thing i could do for rex i dont care what anyone thinks i loved rex more than the world. This was for you <3 seans dead, but i finally have closure with rex after charlie. ‘If you keep looking for me more will die. Just let me get to the place rex & i always wanted & ill be free without having to kill more. Till we rot rex, till we f***ing rot<3’ Reckoning: Sean Ball faces second-degree murder charges, while Amanda Taylor has been charged with first-degree murder . The widowed mother of two is also facing federal charges in North Carolina in connection to Sean Ball's attempted murder . Taylor also allegedly came clean about the stabbing death to Charles Taylor's ex-wife Melissa in an emotional phone conversation. Mrs Taylor told WDBJ7 that her former daughter-in-law called her just after noon Sunday telling her she had to kill Charles for the things he had done to Rex. According to Melissa Taylor, Amanda discovered letters from her late husband that were meant for her. ‘She said in the note that it said that Charles had done really bad things to Rex,’ Melissa Taylor said. ‘She was crying. She said “Melissa, I had to do this for closure. For you, and me, and for Rex. She said Rex done it ’cause what Charlie put him through.”’ Mariah Roebuck, a close friend of the family, told The Roanoke Times that there have been warning signs that Taylor might turn to violence, but the woman refused offers of help. Ms Roebuck also said that the 24-year-old and her late husband had had an obsession with death and the macabre. The couple reportedly had become pen pals with  serial killer and rapist Paul Runge. Rex Taylor even changed his Facebook user name to ‘Rex Runge’ in honor of his jailed friend and expressed admiration for Dark Knight gunman James Holmes and Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik . Following Taylor's suicide, Runge sent his widow $1,000 from behind bars.","Amanda Taylor, 24, charged with first-degree murder in stabbing of her former father-in-law Charles Taylor .

"At the helm of the NYPD from 1934-45 was Lewis Valentine (pictured), a stalwart of the force for more than 30 years who had a reputation for brutality . Today they are everyday heroes, New York's finest, but the New York Police Department has had a more chequered past than most would imagine. Bernard Whalen's new book 'The NYPD's First Fifty Years' is a tale of kickbacks, mob violence and secret KKK members. Whalen charts the early rise of the world renowned police department from it beginnings in 1898 when the New York area's 18 independent police forces merged into one. A variety of men led the force through its formative years, 21 in total. Some were forward looking, some were practical but more than a fair share were scoundrels, larcenists or at the very least guilty of dereliction of duty. The department's first chief of police, William Devery, who held the post from 1898-1901, was known as the king of kickbacks. A former bar tender, Devery had to give a backhander just to get into the force, and was never shy about trading dollars for ranks, the New York Post reported. Police officers of the time had to pay exorbitant fees, more than year's starting salary to become a captain, but for Devery the under the table payments could easily be recovered through other means. In his early career, when taking command of a lower East Side Police Precinct, Devery was recorded as saying that there was a great deal of 'grafting' going on among his subordinates and that he would put a stop to it so he could line his own pockets. On the back of bribes paid to him Devery was able to buy a baseball team, the New York Highlanders, a forerunner to the New York Yankees, which he eventually sold for $300,000 in 1915. Theodore Bingham who held Devery's former post from 1906 to 1909 had his own unique set of character traits and is described in 'The NYPD's First Fifty Years' as being pathologically blunt. A former Brigadier General, Bingham lost his leg in an Army engineering accident in Buffalo. He worked throughout his career to remove special civil service protections on police inspectors who he could not promote or demote. When he won his battle to fire the people he wanted he turned his attention to NYPD captains who had the same status. He was recorded as saying 'I wish that about 40 police captains would die overnight. They are no good.' Bingham's tendency for indiscretion landed him in hot water again when he let slip the whereabouts one of his top lieutenants who had become famous for tracking down the mob. The police chief decided to tell reporters that his star lieutenant was on a secret mission in Italy tracking down the criminal backgrounds of Mafioso, Black Hand members. The officer was later found, shot dead outside a Palermo café. Devery (left) was the king of kickbacks while Theodore Bingham (right) was 'pathologically blunt' Richard Entright who presided over the NYPD from 1918 to 1925 has become infamous for his decision not to root out Klu Klux Klan members in his own force. He was handed orders from the then mayor of New York to look into allegations that one of the city's Baptist ministers was allowing the white supremacist group to recruit from among his parishioners. The extent of KKK influence in the city was far greater than either Entright or Mayor John Francis Hylan knew and an astonishing 800 suspected Klansmen were found to be living in New York – 30 of them were police officers. Richard Entright (pictured) failed to even try and remove the KKK from within his own police force . Presented with the size of the problem and information that as far as it was known none of the individuals had broken the law, Entright decided to do nothing. Joseph Warren, chief of police for only one year from 1927 to 28 became famous for incompetence rather than any particularly nefarious acts. Upon the death of Arnold Rothstein, once New York's most notorious gangsters and the real-life inspiration for F. Scott Fitzgerald's character, Meyer Wolfsheim, in 'The Great Gatsby', warren told his top detective to take a holiday. Warren, who it has emerged may have suffered from mental problems, fumbled the open and shut case and, as Warren was pushed from his post, the key suspect walked free. At the helm of the NYPD from 1934-45 was Lewis Valentine, a stalwart of the force for more than 30 years. Valentine, whose autobiography was appropriately titled, 'Nightstick' and who would later host a radio show, 'Gang Busters,' was the embodiment of a tough cop. Under his tenure NYPD officers were encouraged to mercilessly beat their suspects and promotions were on offer to those who could – in Valentine's words 'throw the gorillas around'. Following the slow death of one officer who had been killed a week earlier Valentine ordered his men to shoot 'wise guys' on sight, telling them they shoulf 'draw quickly and shoot accurately'.","NYPD's secret history from first 50 years unveiled in book about the force .

"Bernie Madoff allegedly tried to persuade his drug dealer's girlfriend to become his mistress . Bernie Madoff, who carried out one of the world's largest frauds, tried to persuade his drug dealer's girlfriend to become his mistress, it has emerged. Madoff is serving 150 years in prison for carrying out a $65 billion Ponzi style fraud - which became the largest in financial history. A new book about the financier claims he had put pressure on an Israeli model who was working for him as a stock analyst and dating his dealer Silvio Eboli to sleep with him. He is said to have met Eboli at a Christmas party in 1997 at the Montauk Yacht Club with his son Mark, who later committed suicide over his father's fraudulent activities, Page Six reported. 'Bernie had put enormous pressure on 'Leah' to sleep with him and be his mistress, offering her practically anything if she just let him f*** her,' the book by Toby Rogers states. Eboli is believed to have never confronted Madoff but warned he would injure him if he ever crossed the line with his girlfriend. After 'Leah' became pregnant with Eboli's child in 2001 Madoff apparently summoned her into his office to say she had made a mistake. In the book Madoff is described as bellowing 'You could have had gold. You could have had me. You could have had an apartment, a car, a driver. But instead you throw all that away for some f****** hippie!' Madoff was arrested in December 2008 after he confessed his multi-billion dollar fraud to his two  sons and they reported him to the FBI. He pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies in March 2009. The charges included securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, making false statements, perjury, theft from an employee benefit plan and making false filings with the SEC. Mark Madoff killed himself on the second anniversary of his father's prison sentence. Andrew Madoff, who had been head of equities at his father's New York based company, died last year after a battle with lymphoma, and had previously blamed the stress caused by his father for his relapse. Madoff (left) is pictured with his wife Ruth and his son Mark, who killed himself after his father's arrest . Andrew Madoff, on the Today show with fiance Catherine Hooper, left, and mother Ruth Madoff, right, said he would never forgive his father - not even on his death bed . Earlier this year 76-year-old Madoff wrote a letter from prison saying the pain he inflicted on victims of his Ponzi scheme is nothing compared to having to deal with losing both his sons. Defrauded Madoff investors have long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his lies. But they were never criminally charged - and never forgave him. The allegations about Madoff's advances towards his dealer's girlfriend are contained in Rogers' book The Ganja Godfather.","Bernie Madoff is serving 150 years in prison for $65billion Ponzi style fraud .

"Shops offering everything for £1 or less have become a magnet for wealthier shoppers who have also flocked to Aldi and Lidl, a new study revealed today. Almost half of all people who have visited  discounters such as 99p Stores, Poundstretcher, B&M Bargains and Wilkinsons are middle class and among the country's highest earners, research has found. A new report says  57 per cent of adults in the UK claim to use a discount store like Poundland every week because the 'stigma' of shopping in budget stores has ended, experts have said. Of those 53 per cent are in the top A/B social class, who on average earn more than £35,000-a-year, a significant increase  from the 37 per cent figure a year ago. Shopping habits: Almost half of all people who have visited discounters such as 99p Stores, Poundstretcher,  and Wilkinsons are now middle class and among the country's highest earners, new research has found . The news comes on the back of the massive rise in popularity of Aldi and Lidl, which are attracting increasing numbers of middle class shoppers, dubbed the 'Lidl class'. Last week Aldi's growing share of the grocery market saw it overtake Waitrose to become Britain's sixth biggest supermarket. But the latest research by retail consultancy group 'Him!' found that variety discounters selling everything from sweets to stationery for £1 or less are also booming, especially with wealthier shoppers. B&M bargains grew its sales by 66 per cent to £1.3 billion last year and Poundland's sales grew 13 per cent to £998 million in the same period. 77% are attracted by cheap prices . 7.73 - number of items bought per visit . £8.93 - average spend per visit . 33% have visited a variety discounter once a week in the past month . 31% use variety discount stores for top-up shopping . Source: Retail consultants Him! Katie Littler, communications director of Him!, said: 'There has been a considerable shift in higher income households using variety discounters, just as we have seen them using Aldi and Lidl regularly. 'Any stigma is slowly disappearing and they are becoming just another retailer, albeit trusted for a more limited range of missions and categories.' The report, revealed by The Grocer magazine, said people who most use variety discounters also tend to be young. Nearly a third (30 per cent) are under 34 and two in three (66 per cent) of 18 to 24 year olds say they have visited a variety discounter. Poundland has been especially successful in attracting young shoppers with 31 per cent  visiting a branch in the past week, up from 26 per cent a year ago. Men are increasingly visiting cheap chain stores - 44 per cent of men said they had visited a Poundland branch in the previous week, up from 37 per cent a year ago. More popular than ever: Poundland's sales grew 13 per cent to £998 million last year as more people head to the store . Experts say the variety discounters have successfully taken over the gap left on high streets by Woolworths, which sold a range of general merchandise from pick and mix sweets to hardware and CDs. The Him! report says most people visiting a variety discounter do so for so-called top up shopping, but grocery items are crucial. Some 57 per cent of shoppers buy confectionary, 54 per cent go for food, 48 per cent for health and beauty, 40 per cent household items and 40 per cent crisps and snacks. Katie Littler said: 'The food and drink items bought are much less about fresh and chilled, which have become the big footfall drivers for Aldi and Lidl. However, the report found that average basket spend at variety discounters is just £8.93, the lowest for any grocery retailer and behind £11.81 in a convenience store and £31.30 in a supermarket. The Grocer commented: 'Posher, younger and with a sweet tooth, loyal shoppers have been successfully pulled in by variety discounters.

"Expensive clothes, fast cars and glittering industry parties: to the average person, the lives of the rich and famous may seem way out of reach. But the growing slew of celebrity gaming apps, from the likes of Kim Kardashian and Lindsay Lohan (and soon, Katy Perry), promise to immerse you in it all, temporarily. Femail investigates what it's like to 'live' the life of a celebrity for a day. Scroll down for video . Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is the app from the reality star, which uses her likeness and voice. Users have to build a celebrity empire similar to Kim's . The 34-year-old launched the highly lucrative app last June, and has an estimated 28 million downloads . Kim Kardashian's highly lucrative app, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, developed by Glu Mobile, has already been downloaded an estimated 28 million times since it was launched last June. The quest-based adventure game requires users to create a character (customising a 'cute' look is compulsory), become friends with Kim Kardashian and then embark on social-climbing, empire-building adventures. The character of Kim, voiced by the reality star herself, is your best friend in the game . YOU'RE NOBODY UNTIL YOU MEET KIM . At the beginning of the game, your character works in retail, takes public transport everywhere, her apartment is essentially bare and can't even afford to adopt stray cats. That is, until you meet Kim Kardashian by chance (voiced by the reality star herself), and she slowly introduces you into the industry. The game puts an emphasis in being charming and friendly to almost everyone, and also taking every opportunity . TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY . At the beginning, your boss trusts you to lock up the clothes shop, and Kim Kardashian turns up begging you to help her. You are given no choice but to break into the shop, choose her an outfit and give it to her for free. Luckily she rewards you by inviting you to a impromptu photo shoot. This type of sporadic activity is rife throughout the game and actively encouraged. MONEY AND CHARM IS KEY . Obediently completing mini-quests will win you cash and K-stars (which you can collect by paying real money), but as is expected, to actually complete many of the tasks and buy new clothes, money is also required. Kustomise yourself: It's necessary to constantly change your outfit and appearance in order to fit in at all the industry events . IMAGE IS EVERYTHING . Within ten minutes of living Kim Kardashian's life, users have changed their outfits three times and checked their reflections twice. Seemingly, no one makes it big in Hollywood without constantly considering how their image can be improved. Vogue's Andre Leon Talley (pictured left) makes an appearance in the game. No doubt as a career booster . PEOPLE FIT INTO 3 CATEGORIES . Strangely, it seems Kim is your only friend in the game, and you'd be wrong if you think you're allowed to make new ones. Characters fit into solely three categories: potential love-interests, career-boosters, or an arch-nemesis. Your very own 'momager': Early on in the game, Kim sites that a necessity of making it in the game involves having your own 'momager' (mother/manager), just like real-life parent Kris Jenner (pictured right - in the game) (Pictured left to right) the cartoon recreations of Kourtney, Khloé, Kim and Kris Kardashian. They are characters you eventually meet later in the game . YOU'LL NEED A 'MOMAGER' One of the first things Kim Kardashian mentions to you is that you need a 'momager'. Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian's very own, makes an appearance later in the game. You eventually also meet Kim Kardashian's real life family, who have all lent their likeness and voice to the app. This includes Kris, Kourtney, Khloé, Kendall and Kylie (but no Rob). Opportunities for fame come in all shapes of sizes, including dating (and marrying) people for exposure . YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO . Although the game allows you to fly to Milan with Kendall, and hang out with Vogue's Andre Talley Leon eventually, you have to do many things that aren't entirely favourable. This includes: dating (and marrying) people you don't want to for exposure, 'charming' people with K-Stars (which is a currency in the game) and partaking in sketchy photo shoots. Fame Game: Lindsay Lohan also launched her own game, The Price of Fame . Uncanny: Lohan's game is a lot sillier and almost works to poke fun at celebrity culture . Lindsay Lohan's game is comparatively sillier, and works more as a tongue-in-cheek critique of celebrity culture. If living a day in the life of Lindsay Lohan can be derived purely from playing her game, it's a lot sillier and crass than Kim Kardashian's. Although in both games you're similarly working towards meteoric fame, in Lindsay Lohan's you play for fans. You begin the game with no identity and no fans. Fans are earned  by spending coins on items that will boost your star status. Players must try and collect as many fans as possible, by engaging in ridiculous or unfavourable activities . All the fans: Success in Lindsay's game is judged by how many fans you can generate and also how quickly you can . ANKLE BRACELETS WILL WIN YOU FANS . Oddly enough, ankle bracelets are one of the purchases that can be used to win fans at a faster rate. Here's where the silly element of Lindsay Lohan's app really rears its head. Lindsay Lohan's game offers less trend-led outfits as Kim Kardashian's and seems to criticise the vacuity of showbiz . LOOKS AREN'T EVERYTHING . Unlike Kim Kardashian's app, Lindsay Lohan's game instantly tells you at the beginning, while you're choosing your outfit: 'Don’t worry, nothing is permanent in show business.' Your character starts off completely naked, with just stars covering her private areas. The game almost seems to critique the humiliating, vacuous process of turning into a Hollywood star. Rather than placing an emphasis on outfits and make-up, it's more about the ridiculous things you can choose to do. To generate fans quicker, you can choose to invest in publicity stunts, which include releasing nude selfies, having an elevator fights and even faking your death . SKETCHY ACTIVITIES ARE THE NORM . Publicity investments can bring you an endless barrage of fame and increase your notoriety. Options include: leaking a nude selfie, releasing a ghostwritten rap album, having an elevator fight, buying bum implants (one cheek at a time no less), faking your death, and sleeping with a poet laureate. Other investments also include phony rap beefs and nip slips. Among the ridiculous activities that can bring you press and publicity, you can also choose to engage in embarrassing photo shoots (pictured) IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COUNT . Again, the idea of using money to directly buy your fame and influence is a key idea. Coconut water and paparazzi repellent are amongst the ridiculous things you can purchase that will earn you fans. KATY PERRY: Unnamed app . To be released at the end of 2015, the pop star has teamed up with none other than the app developers of Kim Kardashian's lucrative app: Glu Mobile. The app is likely to work on the same premise as Kim's, whereby users attempt to become Hollywood celebrities. But specifics have not yet been announced. TOM HANKS: Hanx Writer, Free . Inspired by the actor's real-life fascination with type-writers, the app recreates the nostalgic experience of an actual type-writer (noise and imagery included), but with the easy functionality of an iPad. In September of last year, the app topped the iTunes charts. DAVID HASSELHOFF: Ask The Hoff, Free . In the style of a Magic 8 Ball, the actor's app allows befuddled users to ask him for advice. It generates hilarious Hoff-appropriate answers that will see you through any problem. SAMUEL L JACKSON: iSamJackson, £0.79 . The first thing to consider before downloading the actor's app, is the warning: 'Explicit'. It works as a soundboard, whereby the user can select famous lines and Jackson will deliver them with recordings of his world-famous sass(and profanity). MARIAH CAREY: Mariah Carey-oke, £2.99 . Exactly what is says on the tin, users can test their knowledge of the diva's lyrics and vocal abilities. It uses voice recognition software to tell how well you can hit Carey's high notes. SNOOP DOGG: Snoopify, Free . Wildly popular, the app transforms users into virtual 'gangsters' with the help of digital stickers. There are sunglasses, wads of cash, gold 'bling' and neon wristwatches.","Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and Lindsay Lohan's The Price of Fame apps .

"Cradling your stomach with a hot water bottle might seem like the norm at 'that time of the month'. However, if you are doubling over with debilitating pain, it could actually be a sign of something much worse. While most 'normal' period pain can be fixed with ibuprofen or a over-the-counter anti-inflammatory, a doctor tells Daily Mail Australia that more severe symptoms such as nausea, back or leg pain or bleeding at unexpected times of the month can all point to a more serious condition - endrometriosis. Dr Lara Briden explains that endometriosis is a condition where bits of the uterus lining grow in other places outside of the uterus such as the ovaries, bladder or intestines. Painful periods: 90 per cent of women will experience period pain in their life time . 'Women who experience some degree of menstrual pain, caused by prostaglandins, will be suffering from your run of the mill, standard period pain,' she says. 'You can easily lower prostaglandins with an anti-inflammatory or it can be  addressed and removed with diet.' However, Briden says it's when pain is abnormal and can lead to sever pain and vomiting that women should go straight to a doctor. 'Normal period pain should be on the first or second day of bleeding, not  later in the bleeding cycle or before. So  timing is all part of the warning signs,' says Briden. Spine symptoms: Back and leg pain can be symptoms of endometriosis according to Dr Briden . 1. Severity: Extreme pain that over the counter medication can not ease . 2. Location: Lower back or leg pain . 3. Timing:  Pain during first two days of bleeding is normal, any other time during the cycle is not . 4. Other factors: Pain during sex, bleeding between periods can be other symptoms of endometriosis . 'Standard pain is also most commonly in the lower belly where the uterus is. However extended pain that makes you vomit or that reaches the lower back or legs shouldn't be considered a routine thing.' So what are the other symptoms women should look out for? 'Pain during or after sex can also be a key symptom, according to Dr Briden. 'Patients might a deep stabbing pain, maybe not every time they have sex -  it could be in middle of their cycle or any time, not  just during their period.' Bleeding between periods is another key sign. 'Seeing blood a day or two before is normal, but other times during the month is definitely a reason to see doctor,' says Dr Briden. Sex side effects: Endometriosis can also lead to stabbing pains in the abdomen during or after sex . Dr Lara Briden gives us her top remedies for preventing period pain... 1. Cut the sugar . Foods like sugar are inflammatory so you should avoid it throughout the month, not just at the time of your period. 2.Up the supplements . Research has found zinc can relieve period pain and is effective for removing prostagrandins. It also should also be taken throughout the month. 3. Try turmeric . A great herbal remedy - taken in tablet form it has a higher concentrate, more so than in something like a curry. 4. Work out often . Exercise helps maintain healthy circulation in the pelvis. Things like walking or yoga help lympathic drainage in the pelvis and translates to less period pain when the time comes around. 5.Stress less . When we’re stressed we make less of the hormone progesterone that prevents period pain so the happier and less stressed you are during the month, the more you prevent period pain occurring. Lastly, there is also a genetic component attached. Dr Briden says often women might have a mother or sister who has had severe period pain and so they think it's normal, but as a doctor, if she finds out a patient's relative has endometriosis then it's instantly taken more seriously. The most difficult problem for women though, is even if they are dealing with some symptoms, Dr Briden says it can take up to ten years to diagnose properly. 'It is so easily dismissed and something often I am the first health practitioner to raise that it could be endometriosis. The only definitive way to know is from performing keyhole surgery, where a doctor will put someone under general and cuts into their abdomen and look what's inside,' says Dr Briden. She says while she is hopeful there will be a blood test for the condition to diagnose it soon, the biggest issue is no one yet knows what causes it, despite there being a few main theories. 'A popular idea used to be that there is a retrograde flow that goes through the fallopian tubes, the  ovary normally goes down the tube, but theory says it goes the wrong way and  as embryos, the cells on the uterine lining get inflamed and grow.' The other theory that there is definite evidence, for according to Dr Briden, is that most women have cell tissue outside of the uterine lining, but that it stays dormant all their lives, whereas for others it becomes activated and responds to hormones. But because there isn't conclusive evidence, there is yet to be a cure. Currently Dr Briden says women who do have endometriosis can have surgery to remove the uteral lining that causes it. This can be particularly successful, for women suffering from infertility. One of my most rewarding cases she has had was with a woman who had been struggling to fall pregnant. While her blood tests,  hormones and husband's sperm all appeared normal she then turned to Dr Briden for other answers. Spice things up: Dr Briden says adding herbal spice turmeric to your diet will ease period pain symptoms . 'I met with her and asked her details about her period, and she admitted she experienced pain during other times of her cycle and also painful sex. I got her to then see a gynaecologist and request whether she might have endometriosis, and be able to get surgery,' says Dr Briden. 'The doctor found out she did, removed it, and three or four months later she was pregnant and had a beautiful baby boy.' 'That drove home how severe it can be and important to fix it. It's quite a common story now with my patients, once they have endometriosis removal they have greatly enhanced fertility,' says  Dr Briden. Although while it can help provide a quick fix, Dr Briden says it can't stop it all together. 'It can grow back, so things like hormonal suppression are important. By preventing stimulation of oestrogen it can prevent the bits of uterine tissue) becoming active again.' Naturopathic approach: Dr Lara Briden takes a natural approach to dealing with period pain by cutting foods and increasing supplements . As a naturopathic doctor, Dr Briden has a unique approach to dealing with it. 'There is growing evidence that endometriosis is a autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases attacks different parts of body so calling endometriosis one is still quite controversial, but it's the approach I've been taking for many years,' she says. 'To prevent regrowth occurring, applying dietary changes that help regulate immune function such as nutritional supplements and probiotics with good bacteria are helpful.' So far she believes her approach is successful both in preventing regrowth and also helping lessen or alleviate pain all together. 'I think periods are still an unnecessary taboo subject - especially when half the population has them,' says Dr Briden. Having just written a book 'Period Repair Manual: Natural Treatment for Better Hormones and Better Periods,' Dr Briden, a naturopathic doctor with nearly 20 years experience in women's health, is not adverse to discussion and believes it's  time to put it out there. 'Most haven’t heard of endometriosis and when one in ten suffer from it, it's about time we talk about it and give women help they need,' she says. Lara Briden is a naturopathic doctor with nearly 20 years experience in women's health. She's just released her new book Period Repair Manual: Natural Treatment for Better Hormones and Better Periods.","90 per cent of women experience menstrual pain during their period .

"A recruiting army sergeant raped a female cadet after telling her cousin 'I hope she is as sweet as she looks', a court heard today. Edwin 'Jock' Mee, 46, who now lives in Scotland, allegedly targeted 11 cadets, aged between 15 and 25, many of whom were young black women, on a military base in south London, during the army interview and screening process. It is claimed that the divorced father-of-five went on to rape one of the cadets at the Mitcham Barracks Army Careers and Information Office in Croydon. Edwin 'Jock' Mee arriving at Southwark Crown Court, where he is facing 16 counts of sexual assault and two rapes. It is claimed that he hold the cousin of his alleged victim 'I hope she is as sweet as she looks' Today, the cousin of Mee's alleged rape victim told jurors at Southwark Crown Court that she called the sergeant after becoming concerned he wanted to start a sexual relationship with the cadet. She told the court: 'What he said was ""don't worry, I will take care of her, I hope she is as sweet as she looks"".' But when she asked Mee to repeat what he has said she explained how he went quiet and then hung up. Lisa Wilding QC, for Mee, then asked the witness: 'In light of what she had told you about her concerns about him wanting a relationship, if that was said it must have made you quite concerned?' Mee, formerly of south London, but who now lives in Scotland, has denied all the charges against him . She replied: 'Obviously... it came across as inappropriate to me and the meaning I get from that was it had some sexual undertones.' The witness also claimed that during the phone call, Mee told her 'I will give it to her hard or rough.' Ms Wilding then asked: 'The man you have concerns about has just told you he is going to have rough sex with your cousin, what did you do about that?' The witness replied: 'After our conversation I did tell her that I want to talk it over based on the conversation I had with the gentleman and she said to me it will hamper her application. 'I asked her if he had threatened her and she said “just leave it, I’m not going to encourage him”. 'I said, well, it was dangerous,’ she told the court. 'Culturally there are certain things, especially when it involves my younger relative - culturally and religiously... it was very difficult for me to report that. ‘Those things, to say them for me, I am religious, it was difficult.’ Ms Wilding then asked: ‘Why did you not immediately ring the Army officer and ask to speak to one of his superiors - did you think that was appropriate, that way to speak?’ She replied: ‘Of course, hence my visit there but I was in the middle of going against what she was preventing me to do and so at the same time how was I going to complain without strong evidence that this man had said that? 'I was waiting to see what would happen next.' ‘I feel like I have let her down - she was in my care, I was her guardian,’ she added. Earlier Mee’s alleged victim told the court she had ‘no reason to lie’. She insisted: 'I swear by my parents - mother and father’s grave and the Koran... that this happened.’ Mee was British Army recruiting sergeant at Mitcham Barracks in Croydon (pictured) in the Careers and Information Office . Mee denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration between October 2010 and September 2011. The alleged offences were initially investigated by the Royal Military Police, before the case was then handed to the Metropolitan Police. The trial, which is expected to run for six weeks, continues.

"A large gas pipeline exploded into a tower of fire on Friday in Central California, closing both directions of a major highway and injuring at least 15 people, four of them critically, authorities said. It was not clear what caused the explosion at the Fresno County Sheriff's gun range that brought traffic in the area to a halt. The explosion on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas happened while an equipment operator and a group of county jail inmates were expanding a road alongside Highway 99, according to Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims. Scroll down for video . A fireball erupts after a large gas pipeline exploded in Fresno, California, on Friday. The explosion and fire closed both directions of Highway 99, authorities said . A firefighter watches the blaze shot well over 100 feet into the air. Eleven people were injured, three critically, in the explosion . The flames shot well over 100 feet into the air, witnesses said. Traffic heading north and south on Highway 99 in Fresno was halted by the explosion about 2.30pm as flames towered over the roadway, the California Highway Patrol reported. The highway was reopened three hours later, the CHP said. The driver of the front-loader was a county public works employee who had been working at the shooting range all day working on a tall berm that confines gunfire to the range, Mims said. Ten inmates and the operator were hospitalized, she said. Three inmates were evaluated and sent back to jail, and two deputies were being evaluated for ringing ears and exposure to the hot blast. Four patients were being treated at Community Regional Medical Center's burn and trauma unit, spokeswoman Mary Lisa Russell said. Three of them are in critical condition and one is in serious condition. The explosion on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. pipe carrying natural gas happened at the gun range while an equipment operator and a group of county jail inmates were expanding a road, according to authorities . Pacific Gas & Electric crews are seen in the distance along the Fresno road after the massive explosion . Four other patients were taken to St. Agnes Hospital and three more to Madera Community Hospital. Asked whether the driver was scraping or digging the earth when the gas exploded, Mims said her office is investigating. 'Hopefully we'll be able to speak to the worker to see what action he was taking at the time,' she said. Mims noted PG&E had, some time ago, marked the location of gas lines in the construction zones. The flames prompted a two-alarm call of firefighters, said Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department. A nearby rail line was also halted out of concern that a passing train could spark leaking gas. Kevin Ling was driving by shortly after the blast, and he saw fire flying into the sky. 'As I got closer, the flames were just bigger and bigger,' he said. 'It was shooting up to 200 feet or more, and a fireball maybe ten-to-15 feet in diameter. It was like out of a movie.' 'My window was up and my AC was on and it still felt like a furnace inside my car,' he added. Emergency respondents gather near the scene of a gas line rupture. Those who were injured were taken to several different hospitals in the area . Highway 99, a major highway in central California, was closed in both directions after the gas-line explosion . The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Martinez said. A front-loader was in the area, but it's unclear if the vehicle was digging at the time of the explosion, he said, adding that 'it was a large explosion that shook the surrounding area'. PG&E spokesman Denny Boyles said the pipeline was damaged by a vehicle and that the line was buried but he didn't know how deeply. The flame from the pipe was extinguished at about an hour and a half after the blast, he said. Another PG&E spokesman, Keith Stephens, referred questions to local authorities. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are reported to be injured,' he said. The Fresno County Sheriff's Office is investigation as to whether the driver of a front-loader doing work in the area was scraping or digging the earth when the gas exploded . The California Public Utilities Commission said in a statement that it is investigating the explosion in cooperation with the Federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. PG&E's natural-gas operations have been under scrutiny following a fiery 2010 PG&E pipeline blast that killed eight people in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno. National Transportation Safety Board investigators blamed faulty safety practices by PG&E, and lax oversight by state regulators, for the 2010 blast. Earlier this month, state regulators leveled the state's biggest-ever penalty against a utility - $1.6billion - against PG&E for the San Bruno blast. California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker said at the time that continuing safety citations against the utility made him doubt that the utility had embraced a culture of safety, and he raised the possibility of breaking apart the utility's gas and electric operations. The 12-inch diameter pipeline involved in the fire belongs to PG&E, Pete Martinez of the Fresno Fire Department, said . Ten inmates and the operator were hospitalized, she said. Three inmates were evaluated and sent back to jail, and two deputies were being evaluated for ringing ears and exposure to the hot blast .","The explosion at the Fresno County Sherrif's gun range happened on a Pacific Gas & Electric Co pipe carrying natural gas .

"An American who suffered  third-degree burns to 70 per cent of his body in a childhood accident has faced his fears by becoming a firefighter. Terry McCarty was just six years old when he was engulfed with flames after his brothers filled a bowl with kerosene which was set alight and accidentally knocked on to him. The 29-year-old, from Hawthorne, Nevada, endured 58 operations as well as cruel taunts from bullies who called him Freddy Krueger because of the scars on his face, body and arms. But he was determined to overcome the harrowing experience that had crippled his confidence for years. Form victim to hero: Terry McCarty was just six years old (left) when he suffered third-degree burns to 70 per cent of his body in a childhood accident. He has now overcome his terrible injuries and cruel taunts from bullies by becoming a firefighter (right) after refusing to let 'fear take over my life' Endured 58 operations: Terry McCarty aged six with his mother Nancy. He was engulfed with flames after his brothers filled a bowl with kerosene which was set alight and accidentally knocked on to him . He said: 'After the accident I lived in a constant state of fear and uncertainty. 'I struggled to find work as an adult as people always told me I was a liability, and I had started to believe it. 'Becoming a fireman was a spur of the moment decision - I thought if I could do this, people would realise I could do anything.' Mr McCarty applied to a Washington fire service in October 2011. After his application was accepted in April 2012, he faced 12 weeks of gruelling training, where he confronted fire for the first time since his accident. 'If I could do this, people would realise I could do anything': Terry McCarty in his bunker gear aged 26 (left) and 27 (right). He applied to the fire service in October 2011 and passing his training in July the following year . He said: 'As part of my training I had to complete a live fire exercise, where fire is made using propane in an artificial setting. 'Fear washed right over me, just as the fire had all those years ago. 'I couldn't move, I felt like I was six years old again when I saw those flames shooting out of the ceiling. 'But I think it helped. In the end - I started to realise the fire didn't control me. Why should I let fear take over my life?' In July 2012, having passed his training, Mr McCarty won the admiration and respect of his colleagues and the public. He said: 'Attending events, or even just being out in public in my uniform, always attracted a mixture of shocked and awed reactions.' Agony: Terry McCarty aged six (left) and (right) after undergoing skin grafts aged seven. He suffered cruel taunts from bullies who called him Freddy Krueger because of the scars on his face, body and arms . Always there for him: Terry McCarty at his homecoming aged 16 with his father and brother Ryan . Mr McCarty lost part of his fingers and thumbs in the accident and had to teach himself how to quickly put on his uniform and air tank and properly brace himself with his hip when using a hose. Having spent two years as a firefighter, he quit the force to work with the Burned Children Recovery Foundation at Camp Phoenix, a programme in Bellingham, Washington, supporting children with burns. He said: 'Fire robbed me of my childhood - I wanted to give these children a chance to experience being a kid, even for a short time.' After his accident in 1992, he was placed in a medically-induced coma for two months at Shriners Hospital in Galveston, Texas. Mr McCarty was hospitalised for 12 months and remembers this time vividly, including the debridement process of scrubbing off his burned skin, and multiple skin grafts. He said: 'It was absolutely terrifying. I didn't understand anything - all I knew was that when I saw a doctor, I should expect pain. 'I'd be taken out of surgery just long enough to stabilise and then I'd be rushed back in.' Brave: Mr McCarty lost part of his fingers and thumbs in the accident and had to teach himself how to quickly put on his uniform and air tank and properly brace himself with his hip when using a hose . Terry McCarty shows off his nickname 'Char King' which he got tattooed onto his arm . After a year of recovery, he returned to school at the age of eight, where he became the victim of bullies who would call him 'monster', 'toast' and 'Freddy Krueger'. He said: 'The one thing that got me through was the love of my family - especially my brothers, Ryan and Jason. 'There was never any anger between us, and I don't know what I would've done without them.' He and his brothers became inseparable and with their encouragement and support he found the courage to stop hiding himself, and accept the stares and comments. He said: 'The emotional bond we had was vital to my recovery - they did so much for my confidence by just being there.' Apart from the scarring and damage to his hands, he suffered no major health issues as a result of the burns, and quickly adjusted to moving with his tighter skin. He is now focusing on opening his own foundation to fund programmes for children with burns. Although he has no immediate plans to return to firefighting, he hopes his foundation, which will focus on fundraising, will provide the financial support needed for other foundations that offer firefighting experience. Mr McCarty, now of Bellingham, Washington, said: 'Nothing like this programme has been done before. 'It's going to take a lot of work, but being able to support people who suffered like I did will make it all worthwhile.'","Terry McCarty, 29, suffered  burns to 70% of his body in childhood accident .

"Dear Lord Hall, . My jeans are too tight, my hairstyle is an exercise in holding back the years, my friends are all incredibly Right-wing and I’ve got hog-whimperingly drunk in the presence of David Cameron on more than one occasion. But none of these are the reasons why I want you to give me Jeremy Clarkson’s job. I know many men may baulk at the suggestion that a woman can take Jeremy’s place. Just look at what happened to Sue Perkins this week, who received a barrage of abuse on Twitter when her name was mentioned for the role, along the lines of: ‘Men do cars, women do cake.’ But I think I’m perfect for the job, and my principal qualification is entirely basic. I love cars. Scroll down for video . Sarah Vine says the BBC need to look further than just men when it comes to finding a TV presenter to replace Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear. Why? Because women love cars just as much men! I like the big ones with leather seats and walnut dashboards. I like the mad ones with three types of suspension. I like the small, nippy ones with exciting turning circles. I like the old-fashioned ones with manual chokes. I even like those weird French ones with the hydraulic suspension that feel and handle like ocean-liners. All the most memorable moments in my life feature the internal combustion engine. As a baby, the only way my parents could get me to go to sleep was to drive me round the block in their Mini Cooper. Several times. Once I’d nodded off, they’d reward themselves with a pint and a packet of crisps, leaving me happily slumbering in the pub car park. Those were more laissez-faire times. When I was four, we emigrated to Italy and the Mini was sold. I clung on to the bumper for dear life, as though they had come to take away my favourite teddy. In the end it was all right, though, because it was soon replaced by a far more exciting prospect: an orange Alfasud — an Alfa Romeo for poor people — in which we would whizz around Rome at breakneck speed. It wasn’t until my father landed a job with Fiat, however, that the motor car really became central to my life. We headed north to the car capital of the world, Turin. Back then, it was a frantic place of endless smog and honking horns. Just like Clarkson, 'my jeans are too tight and my hairstyle is an exercise in holding back the years,' says Sarah Vine, but that's not the reason she believes she'd be perfect for the vacant role on Top Gear . Here they made everything you can possibly imagine on wheels, from the great Iveco trucks to flashy Ferraris. Cars were the lifeblood of the city. Every year, when the time came to make the pilgrimage home to Britain to visit relatives, my parents would take turns driving, never stopping (they didn’t want to have to pay for a hotel room), as we children sat in the back eating our way through the vast supply of my mother’s tiny chicken sandwiches. My father, meanwhile, would smoke cigarillos, drink beer (he kept a coolbox in the front), burp loudly (much to my mother’s horror and our delight) and listen obsessively, over and over again, to whichever new music tape was grabbing his attention at the time. These trips gave me my musical education — and also instilled in me a great love of long-distance driving — not to mention an obsession with road movies: Thelma & Louise, Easy Rider, The Motorcycle Diaries, Mad Max, Disney’s Cars. Top Gear is definitely not just for male petrolheads — 40 per cent of the show’s audience is female. So you see, dear Lord Tony, to me, the motor car is so much more than a set of gears and an engine. It is freedom, possibility, adventure. And I’m no car snob either: over the years I owned cars of all pedigrees and prices, from my first, a burgundy mini van bought for £500, through various follies to a 1967 Karmann Ghia that burnt more oil than it ever did petrol. But perhaps my favourite was the old Irish-reg VW Beetle which stalled in front of the Houses of Parliament (the accelerator cable had snapped). By the time I returned from calling the AA from the phone booth — this was before mobile phones — the square had been closed off, the car surrounded by police cars and bomb disposal experts were preparing to carry out a controlled explosion on it. Oops. Now I drive a rather more reliable sky blue Fiat 500 — the new model. We have a family car, too: a tragically dull Nissan. But the Fiat is mine, and mine alone. Despite being the size of a peanut, it has six gears (I hate point-and-press automatics, they take all the fun out of driving) and a special button that says ‘sport’ on it. If I press it, the exhaust makes a pleasing ‘vroom, vroom’ noise, and my right foot itches to go all the way to the floor. You see, I like to be in control when I’m behind the wheel. I’m not one of those women who pootles along at a constant 70 in the middle lane of a motorway, rummaging around in her bag for lipstick, or surreptitiously checking her texts. When I drive a car, I really drive it. Sue Perkins (pictured) received a barrage of abuse on Twitter this week after her name was mentioned in association with presenting Top Gear . Perhaps it’s the fact that I learnt to drive in Italy, where every other driver is either a drunk or a lunatic, but I never take my eyes off the road. Driving for me is not just a means for getting from A to B, it’s a destination in itself, an exercise in judgment and quick-thinking. On the morning school run, I take great delight in achieving just the right degree of acceleration at just the right time, so that I catch a run of green lights and never end up trapped in the wrong lane. I scoff at those who drive with their eyes on the satnav instead of on the tarmac. On motorways, I check my wing and rear view mirrors every few seconds, to make sure I am at all times aware of other vehicles around me. I switch lanes constantly for speed and safety — and yes, I am one of those people who drives up behind you as you’re cruising half asleep in the fast lane and flashes their lights. It’s the fast lane, guys, the clue is in the name. As for parking — well, suffice to say, I loathe parking sensors. They’re far too jittery, and they seem to misunderstand the fundamental principle of bumpers, which is that they are for bumping. Gently, of course. Jeremy Clarkson (pictured) did not have his contract renewed with the BBC show after an incident with a member of the production staff . As for the idea of a self-parking car, it fills me with horror. I’m extremely proud of my ability to parallel park in the tiniest of places. There is huge intellectual satisfaction to be gained from judging the space just so. All this, as you can imagine, makes me the most intolerable car bore. As well as an infuriating person to have in the back seat. Which is why my poor husband, who went to immense lengths to obtain his licence after the children were born, never gets a look in. I pretend it’s because I don’t trust his driving (it took him seven attempts to pass his test). But actually his driving is fine. It’s just that I relish every and any opportunity to get behind the wheel. To feel the power beneath the pedals, to be mistress of the open road, to be in charge of the radio setting — these are some of the things that make me happiest in life. I drive, therefore I am. Yours hopefully, . Sarah . (aka Mrs Toad) PS. I have a full, clean driving licence.","Sue Perkins received abuse on Twitter when her name was mentioned .

"Prince George's birth in 2013 sparked a £247m sales bonanza for makers of royal memorabilia but experts say the second royal baby is unlikely to have the same effect. A more modest sales increase of between £60 and £70m is predicted, with most of that spent on champagne and cake rather than royal souvenirs. However, the baby is expected to make more of an impact in the long term - especially if the child turns out to be a girl. Scroll down for video . Smaller scale: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child will have a lesser effect at the tills . 'It’s not so much of a major event when you have another baby,' explains Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research. 'I think it will have an impact on the sales of prosecco and champagne and cake but not much more than that.' Despite his warning, scores of companies are hoping to cash in on the second royal birth, with plans for items ranging from mugs to beauty boxes afoot. Leading the charge to the tills is the Royal Mint which announced plans for a commemorative £5 coin last week, and the Royal Collection Trust. Potter Emma Bridgewater has designed a special mug, while beauty subscription company BirchBox is offering a 'royally good' box containing Korres showergel and Lola Barcelona nailpolish among other items. Bonanza: The birth of Prince George sparked a £247m sales boom between the 1st July and 31st August 13 . Prince of Sales: Since then, George has gone on to replicate his mother's impact on clothing sales . The new baby's grandfather Prince Charles is also hoping for a baby-related boost to his charity coffers via products sold in his Highgrove shop. Although no official memorabilia is planned, The Highgrove Shop, which turns over its profits to the Prince of Wales’s Charitable Foundation, already sells organic baby balm for £24.95, a Highgrove baby bear for £34.95 and a “happy and glorious” baby blanket, featuring guards in red tunics and bearskin hats, priced at £94.95. The flurry of royal baby memorabilia echoes that sparked by the birth of Prince George, when the market was flooded by everything from bibs to books. Other items included royal-themed potties, dummies featuring crowns, bibs proclaiming 'I love Aunty Pippa' and a book entitled Shhh! Don’t Wake The Royal Baby! While there's no shortage of choice this time around, Professor Bamfield says the baby's long-term impact on retail will be more significant than the initial flurry. 'When the baby has a certain sweater on, everybody will want to buy that,' he says, pointing to the ongoing Kate and George effects. Making his mark: Outfits worn by Prince George such as these Rachel Riley dungarees, sell out . New baby, new coin: The Royal Mint is producing a series of coins to mark the new royal birth . 'The impact of the baby is going to be over a longer period, particularly if it’s a girl. [It will be about] the equipment they use, her clothes, her toys.' Items that will be available in the short term include an as yet unseen collection of commemorative china from the Royal Collection Trust. The designs will not be unveiled until after the birth and confirmation of the baby’s sex and production is not likely to be completed until after the baby has been named. For George in July 2013, the Royal Collection produced items including a pillbox (£30), a small loving cup (£39), a dessert plate (£45) and a limited-edition loving cup (£195). More commemorative mugs will come from the Staffordshire potteries, who, along with Emma Bridgewater, traditionally mark royal events. The Royal Mint is also to produce a celebratory £5 coin - again repeating the routine after Prince George's birth when it produced 10,000 silver crown-sized £5 coins. Each one cost £80 while a further 2,013 22-carat gold sovereigns, all featuring St. George, were sold for £800 apiece.","Retail experts say sales of royal memorabilia are unlikely to top £70m .

"A man who died in Texas of the human version of mad cow disease last year likely contracted it from eating beef raised in Britain, a CDC report has revealed. The unnamed man, who died from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob (vCJD) disease in May 2014, just 18 months after he first showed symptoms, was a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from the Middle East. The report concluded the man's illness resulted from his eating tainted UK beef before he moved to the United States in the 1990s. The extreme rarity of the disease, especially in the United States, led the man--who was in his 40s--to be misdiagnosed with psychiatric symptoms before ultimately receiving the vCJD death sentence. Contracted in the 1990s: A man who died in Texas of the human version of mad cow disease last year likely contracted it from eating beef raised in Britain, a CDC report has revealed . American public health officials were concerned initially because the man hadn't previously lived in either the United Kingdom or Saudi Arabia, where all three previously documented victims of vCJD in the United States had lived previously. However, the joint investigation between the CDC and Baylor College of Medicine concluded the man likely contracted the disease over a decade before moving to the U.S. He'd lived in Kuwait, Russia and Lebanon--all countries where the United Kingdom exported its beef, reports Live Science. The man, after doctors finally came to suspect vCJD, had his blood, urine and spinal fluid tested for the disease, but only his urine came back positive. After his death, an autopsy allowed brain tissue to be tested. It indicated conclusively the man suffered from vCJD. 'The potential difficulty in making the clinical diagnosis in many patients with vCJD and the delay with which the disease is first suspected raises the concern that vCJD can be missed,' wrote the researchers. Destroys the brain and spinal cord: Brain tissue showing spongiotic changes in the cortex, and loss of neurons in a case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . WHAT IS MAD COW DISEASE? Mad cow disease is a fatal neurological disease in cattle caused by an abnormal form of a prion protein that destroys the brain and spinal cord. The disease was first identified in Great Britain in 1986, although research suggests that the first infections may have spontaneously occurred in the 1970s. The disease is believed to be spread by feeding calves meat and bone meal contaminated with BSE or scrapie, a prion disease in sheep. Illnesses similar to BSE also have been seen in elk, deer and exotic zoo animals. There were 36,000 diagnosed cases of mad cow disease in Great Britain in 1992, during that height of a mad cow epidemic there. Twenty-nine cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2011, according to the American Meat Institute. WHO GETS variant CJD? Since variant CJD was first reported in 1996, a total of 229 patients with this extremely rare disease from 12 countries have been identified. According to CDC.gov, 177 of those patients were from the United Kingdom. There has never been a case of vCJD that did not have a history of exposure within a country where the cattle disease, BSE, was occurring. It is believed that the persons who have developed vCJD became infected through their consumption of cattle products contaminated with the agent of BSE or in three cases, each reported from the United Kingdom, through receipt of blood from an asymptomatic, infected donor. There is no known treatment of vCJD and it is invariably fatal. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN vCJD AND CJD . This variant form of CJD should not be confused with the classic form of CJD that is endemic throughout the world, including the United States. The median age at death of patients with classic CJD in the United States, for example, is 68 years, and very few cases occur in persons under 30 years of age. In contrast, the median age at death of patients with vCJD in the United Kingdom is 28 years. In contrast to classic CJD, vCJD in the United Kingdom predominantly affects younger people, has atypical clinical features, with prominent psychiatric or sensory symptoms at the time of clinical presentation and delayed onset of neurological abnormalities, including ataxia within weeks or months, dementia and myoclonus late in the illness, a duration of illness of at least 6 months, and a diffusely abnormal non-diagnostic electroencephalogram.

"Parents need to keep their distance and trust schools and teachers instead of being 'dervishes ready to battle with anyone and anything on behalf of their child', a leading head teacher has said. Peter Tait, the headmaster of Sherborne Preparatory School in Dorset, claimed parents have become 'dervishes' about their children's education and should take a back seat to allow them to develop naturally. Writing in Attain, the magazine for the Independent Association of Prep Schools, Mr Tait said the modern trend of interfering stemmed from parents being bombarded with information about how to raise a child. Parents need to keep their distance and use their intuition to trust schools and teachers, a leading head teacher has claimed. Stock image used . Mr Tait warned that while parents naturally wanted the very best for their children, such interference could end up hindering their natural development, The Daily Telegraph reported. He said: 'What has made some parents put their own child at the centre of the universe and to hell with the rest?' Adding that parents must trust those responsible for their children's education, he added: 'To do this requires a certain detachment, a willingness to trust the passage of time, focusing on whether their children are happy, challenged and purposeful and are learning the right values.' Sherborne, which was founded in 1550 by Edward VI in the Dorset village of the same name, has educated prominent churchmen and army generals, as well as famous figures such as codebreaker Alan Turing and Downton Abbey actor Hugh Bonneville and Coldplay singer Chris Martin. The school has enjoyed strong academic performance recently. On A-Level results day it was announced that 40 per cent of all grades were A*s or As, with six boys meeting offers to study at Oxford or Cambridge. The phenomenon of parents placing their children before any others and pushes their children to high levels of achievement through a range of after-school activities has been termed Tiger Parenting. Last year, Gail Larkin, the president of the National Association of Head Teachers, also attacked parents saying that some children were being forced to sit through hours of unnecessary tuition by pushy parents competing with one another. She added that instead of two or three hours spent in more classes after school, children would benefit from joining a swimming club, taking up ballet, or playing in the park instead. Mr Tait is Headmaster of Sherborne Preparatory School (pictured) in Dorset, who has been writing in Attain magazine . She also took a swipe at parents, saying part of the drive for extra tuition was down to adults being unwilling to help their children with homework. Meanwhile a survey, by teachers' union NASUWT, revealed a disturbing picture of how parents are increasingly using Facebook and Twitter to intimidate staff. It showed families are using social media to post obscenities, threats, offensive photos, sexually explicit insults and even covert films of teachers - with 30 per cent of those polled confirming they had been the subject of parents' abusive internet posts. The poll of 1,500 teachers also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year – increasing from 21 per cent to 60 per cent. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: 'It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. 'Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse.' He added: 'The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers' health and wellbeing and undermining their confidence to do their job.'","Headmaster Peter Tait claimed parents should trust their child's educators .

The former Another Level star, 35, is accused of hitting 31-year-old glamour model Ms Cahill in front of her young son, causing a bloody nose. Bowers, of no fixed address, was charged with common assault in connection with an incident which took place in February. Former Another Level star Dane Bowers, 35, (pictured left) is accused of hitting his ex-fiancee, 31-year-old glamour model Sophie Cahill (right) in front of her young son in February, causing a bloody nose . He answered his police bail last Thursday and today Scotland Yard confirmed he is due to appear before magistrates in south London next month. The singer and the former Miss Wales got engaged in December 2013 when he popped the question during a sunshine winter break in Tenerife. 'I am the happiest man alive. Ecstatic to say the beautiful Sophie Cahill made me the happiest man alive by saying yes..when I said the amazing words...Will you Marry me!!' he tweeted at the time, shortly after presenting her with a diamond ring.

"A former prison officer has claimed staff at one of Britain's toughest jails regularly arrange brutal fights between rival criminals behind bars. Peter Hiett, a decorated former prison guard at Feltham Young Offenders Institution, said staff would put inmates in a cell padded with mattresses and leave them to fight out any differences. The 49-year-old, who worked at the jail for eight years and was commended for bravery, said some workers would even stay and watch the battle unfold, while others 'turned a blind eye to it'. He also said gangs controlled entire wings at the jail in Hounslow, south west London, leaving staff afraid to visit some areas of the prison for fear of being attacked. Scroll down for video . Peter Hiett, a decorated former prison guard at Feltham Young Offenders Institution in Hounslow (pictured), claims staff regularly arrange brutal fights between rival criminals behind bars at Britain's toughest jail . The claims echo scenes from 1999 film Fight Club starring Brad Pitt, in which gangsters organise mass brawls in underground 'fight clubs'. Mr Hiett told The Sunday People: 'It was like a sport for them. If two inmates had a grudge they'd put them together in a room to sort it out. 'They only stopped when one was knocked out or couldn't defend themselves any more.' His revelations come after he left the prison in January last year, amid claims he was forced out for trying to lift the lid on the goings-on. He claims the in-fighting was often kept hidden from the overriding authorities, with the prison's management setting up a Behaviour Management Group to 'fiddle the assault figures'. He said common tactics were to treat group attacks as just one assault and to encourage inmates to admit to the lesser charge of health and safety over assault. The former officer said: 'There would be 15 or 20 lads from the same gang on the same wing. They would protect each other, deal drugs. 'And if they saw another gang member all hell broke loose – their wars don't stop when they're behind bars. 'But if an inmate assaulted someone, the governor didn't want it written down like that. Staff would advise prisoners to admit a lesser charge.' There were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution last year , a report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons found (file picture) Claims from former prison officer Peter Hiett about Feltham echo that of scenes in 1999 film Fight Club (above) Earlier this year, it was revealed that inmates at Feltham represent 48 different gangs, fuelling a 'constant juggling' by prison officers to keep the boys apart. A report found there were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at the young offenders' institution, a significant amount of which was gang-related. Around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the London area - were placed on so-called 'keep apart' lists to tackle gang-related violence, inspectors from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said. Former Feltham prison officer Emma Beard pictured outside court ahead of being jailed . Former prison offer Peter Hiett was also among the guards who reported fellow worker Emma Beard for performing sex acts on an inmate in his cell. Beard, a married mother-of-four, had sex with teenage murderer Danny McLean, then aged 18, at Feltham Young Offenders Institution and even wrote love letters to him, which included intimate photographs. Beard, then aged 31, pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office and was jailed for 12 months at Isleworth Crown Court in 2010. Jailing her, Judge Oliver told her: 'You put the security of yourself and the other officers at the young offenders' institution at risk and that is a serious matter. 'It has to be prison for you, you cannot in your role, break the law and expect to get away with it.' The number of fights and assaults had reduced since the previous HMIP inspection, but remained 'too high' with 262 incidents between July 2014 and January this year, including 79 assaults on staff. Some incidents were deemed 'very serious' by inspectors and involved gangs of boys attacking a single boy or member of staff in a 'very determined way'. Feltham is divided into two sites, with boys aged 15 to 18 held in site A, and 400 young adults aged 18 to 21 in site B. Mr Hiett said he tried to raise his concerns several times internally before he eventually approached Jeremy Wright – who was the Minister for Prisons at the time. Mr Wright ordered an inspection of the prison in March 2013 and called for a radical overhaul of the way the jail was run. Inspectors said it was one of the most concerning visits they had conducted. Despite calls for an overhaul, Feltham was named last year as the most violent prison in England and Wales by the Howard League for Penal Reform. But the authorities believe improvements are underway and it is simply taking time to see the changes because of the 'multiple challenges that need to be addressed'. Following the publication of January's report, Lin Hinnigan, the chief executive of the Youth Justice Board, said: 'It is clear from the report that, since the last inspection in 2013, improvements to Feltham A have been made; and we are grateful to the inspection team for recognising the dedication of the staff who work there. 'However, and as the report also acknowledges, the young people placed in Feltham are some of the most challenging of the cohort we have across the youth secure estate. 'Improving Feltham A is very much a work in progress, and will take time because of the multiple challenges that need to be addressed.' In response to Mr Hietts' claims, a spokesman for HM Prison Service told MailOnline: 'These inflammatory and damaging allegations are completely untrue and do a huge disservice to the hard working staff at YOI Feltham. 'It is totally untrue to claim that staff have been complicit in any acts of violence, or that there are ""no-go"" areas within the establishment. 'It is also absolutely wrong to say that figures relating to incidents at Feltham have been in any way altered.'","Former prison guard claims fights between inmates are organised by staff .

The 37-year-old, who has defended her image against criticism that she's too 'Hollywood', told The Mirror: 'You're hot one year but completely out of favour the next.' But the mother-of-two, who joined the programme in 2011, said she'd love to stay where she is for 'a long time'. Scroll down for video . Ellie Harrison has spoken about how she believes that she will fall out of favour on Countryfile . She told The Mirror: 'It's a funny business and the nature of the beast with females is that what you get is not down to you.' She continued to say that she knew that she would become less popular. 'You are hot one year but completely out of favour the next. I know next year someone will be hotfooting it. I accept that and I know that.' For Ellie her appearance has always been a sensitive area on Countryfile as in December 2014 she revealed that she was told to tone down her look. After her first appearance on the BBC show in 2011 she was told her flowing blonde tresses were 'too present.' She was asked by producers on the Sunday evening show to be more countryside, 'less Hollywood' in her appearance - a statement she believes was related to the long blonde locks that have earned her fame. Ellie says that as a woman 'what you get is not down to you' and she wouldn't be surprised if she was replaced . In 2011 Ellie was asked by producers to be 'less present' a comment she believes was directed at her blonde hair. Pictured: presenters (L-R) Matt Baker, Ellie, Adam Henson, Tom Heap and John Craven . At the time she said the statement was an example of the problems she has encountered because of her good looks, as well as the different culture in the UK compared to the US - which she said was far more welcoming. 'It is celebratory over there; they really want you to do well,' the mother-of-two told Countryside magazine. 'It's like over here they would almost rather you were on the edge of a breakdown.' In 2009 Miriam O'Reilly successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination after being dropped by the show in a revamp . Ellie previously worked for the Countryfile Discovery Channel in America and has spoken about the problem of being viewed first for her looks and regarded as a 'blonde, fluffy thing.' Her long blonde hair has attracted much debate among viewers of Countryfile and the presenter previously admitted her tresses get much attention. She added: 'I get asked a lot about my hair. It's a subject that always seems to come up.' Ellie has previously spoken about her looks being a barrier to her career, with people presuming because she is attractive she will not be able to do her job properly. The journalist said: 'It can get in the way of people thinking you're credible, so I try and shrug it off. 'I've had people approach me – inside and outside TV – who are surprised I can string a sentence together.' This is not the first time the BBC has been under the spotlight for judging women by their looks and age, and Ellie was candid about being aware that her career in television could stop without much warning. In 2008 Miriam O'Reilly was dropped from the show and won a tribunal against the corporation three years later for age discrimination. Her case for sex discrimination failed. Miriam was axed from the show, along with Juliet Morris and Michaela Strachan, when it moved to a prime time Sunday evening slot. She was given three years to return to the BBC but decided to leave in 2012 to launch a service for women facing discrimination in the workplace. Miriam was replaced by Julia Bradbury, 43 and more than 10 years her junior.","Ellie Harrison says she 'accepts' that she will one day be replaced .

Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old  TV presenter from Dublin, teamed up with two male friends on a project they dubbed Twin Strangers to see who could find their closest lookalike within 28 days, and were soon inundated with submissions from all over the world. Incredibly, Niamh found her match in Karen Branigan, 29, a fellow Ireland native who lives just an hour down the road, making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin-like photos together. Scroll down for video . Uncanny: Niamh Geaney, a 26-year-old student from Dublin (left), found her 'twin stranger' in Karen Branigan (right), through a social media campaign she launched with friends . Speaking to MailOnline about her first meeting with Karen, Niamh said: I was ridiculously nervous about how I would react to meeting someone who looks like me. 'For the entire duration of our encounter I pretty much stared at her. I couldn’t get over her face, and some of the expressions she would pull I would think to myself or say aloud, ""Oh my God that’s my face."" 'I can’t remember the number of times I said ""this is so freaky"". It was truly amazing.' Karen, who is currently in between jobs, has five sisters and a brother. Niamh has a brother and two sisters, and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another. Niamh said the pair got on 'very well' as they both applied make-up before the shoot, swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities.

'I knew what search I was embarking on. I’m the weirdo that contacted Karen out of the blue and asked her to meet me in person.' Since meeting, Niamh and Karen - who are both single - say they've been chatting on Facebook 'constantly'.

'I think I have a two, maybe three at a push who resemble me. But they're definitely not as close a match as Karen to Niamh,' Harry says. 'I'm trailing further behind,' admits Terence. 'Must be a guy thing. They tend to be a bit too shy to participate. Not sure if being originally from sub-Saharan Africa has anything to do with it!'

"Ironing may be the Marmite of household chores. But, love it or loathe it, unless you want to look like you’ve slept on a park bench, you can’t avoid it. British company Swan, which sold its first iron in 1933, has just released a top-of-the-range steam generator iron, for £279.99. But does it really make things easier? Tessa Cunningham finds out. SUPER STEAMER . Swan SI9031N Steam Generator Iron, £279.99, swan-brand.co.uk . If you loathe ironing enough to splash out almost £300, then Swan’s luxury model could be the one for you. It cut my ironing time by half. It’s usually my least favouite chore, but when testing this one, I got to work in front of Poldark and was done within 20 minutes. Because all the water is in the separate 1,000ml generator tank, the iron itself is lightweight. The steam is forced out of the generator through a hose into the iron, shooting out at 90g per minute — twice as fast as conventional steam irons (think of the difference in power between jet-washing and using a hosepipe) — cutting through creases quicker. As well as being more powerful, it also produces twice as much steam, making shorter work of wrinkles. On the downside, despite the investment, you get only a two-year guarantee. 3/5 . PRECISION PERFECT . Philips Easy Speed Plus, £29.50, amazon.co.uk . The big selling point of this pretty aqua blue iron is the precision tip, which means you can get really sharp creases flat with minimum elbow grease, making it perfect for shirts and trousers. I also love the vertical steam option, which means you can smooth creases from hanging fabrics, such as curtains, by holding the iron vertically 2 in away and pressing the steam button. Steam output is 35g per minute — with a boost function of up to 120g to blast at stubborn creases. Impressive for the price. 4/5 . BARGAIN BUY . Swan Steam Iron SI1001ON, £19.99, argos.co.uk . This does an adequate job and you get a lot for your money — including a generous 350ml water tank and variable steam control, which means you can opt for continuous steam at 40g per min or a 140g per minute shot of steam. But it’s so heavy, at 1.3kg, that I’m in danger of developing muscles like Popeye if I keep using it. And while the dolphin-shaped nose helps me reach tricky areas, such as around shirt buttons, it makes the iron look downright ugly. I also found the soleplate scaled up quickly. 2/5 . POWER HOUSE . Braun TexStyle 7 TS755, £49.99, johnlewis.com . This looks like a fighter jet, and is so heavy (1.3kg empty and 1.65kg when the water tank is full) it makes ironing even more of an effort. On the plus side, the ergonomic handle is easy to hold. I also like the way the cable is 2.5m long — useful if you can’t get near a plug. It’s impressively powerful. Steam shoots out at 50g per minute and the precision shot also releases steam at 170g per minute. 3/5 . LIGHTWEIGHT PRO . Russell Hobbs Autosteam Pro Iron, £19.99, argos.co.uk . One of the cheapest irons I tried, this is beautifully lightweight at 1.14kg despite having a large 320ml water tank. There are lots of functions such as a non-stick soleplate and a vertical steam option. You also get a generous two-metre cord. But it falls down on the one job I’m paying for — ironing. Although it is supposed to be non-drip, it leaked at low temperatures and left unsightly marks on my silk shirt. 2/5 . VALUE FOR MONEY . Philips PerfectCare Pure Steam Generator, £119.99, robertdyas.co.uk . The nearest rival to the Swan iron and less than half the price, this is fantastic value for a top-range model bursting with extras. I normally dread ironing my grandmother’s thick linen table cloth, but I removed every crease in seconds with no effort. It’s all thanks to the impressive 1.5-litre water reservoir which pumps out high-pressure steam at 110g per minute. And the soleplate is designed so steam is distributed evenly — meaning fewer strokes and speedy ironing. The manufacturer boasts that you never need to change the settings as it creates the perfect temperature level whether you are ironing silk PJs or kids’ jeans. I tried it — and it was true. You also get a five-year guarantee. 5/5 . CORDLESS POWER . Tefal Freemove FV9970, £79.99, johnlewis.com . Tefal is hugely proud of its cordless iron. And with good reason. The base recharges the iron during each rest period, which means there is no cord getting in your way, and the control panel lets you know when you need to recharge. It’s powerful, too — delivering an impressive 180g per minute shot of steam. The handy steam on-demand trigger got rid of stubborn creases in my partner’s shirts. It also has a vertical steam option. I used it to blast away creases in a dress that had been hanging in my wardrobe for too long — much easier than dragging out the ironing board. If you’re happy to pay over the odds to dispense with a cord, this is a great option. 3/5 . TURBO STEAM . Tefal Ultimate Anti-Calc FV9603, £69.99, argos.co.uk . Lots of impressive features here — such as a unit which collects all the limescale from your iron. A turbo steam function delivers a mighty 200g per minute jet of steam and an anti-drip mechanism cuts down on the chances of water leaking. But this iron is too darn heavy: a stonking 1.5kg when empty; once the 350ml tank is full, it’s like lifting a brick. On the plus side, it provides the perfect excuse to hand over the ironing to my partner. 3/5 .","British company Swan has unveiled a new £279.99 super steam iron .

"Stephanie Scott was a 'favourite teacher' to many students at Leeton High School . Local Leeton parents have expressed anger over the loss of their children's 'favourite teacher' as the town continues to mourn the death of Stephanie Scott. A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their kids. 'Well said, my daughter has lost her favourite teacher, and she will never be the same,' wrote Glenda Goolagong. Meanwhile Jodie Salerno posted: 'Stephanie was my son and 2 daughters favourite teacher at leeton high this ... has put so much pain and sadness on our comunity [sic].' Ms Salerno told The Australian her three children 'don't want to return' to school because they are so upset over Ms Scott's death. This comes as police are due to begin an autopsy on Stephanie Scott's body to determine how she was killed. Ms Scott's remains have been transported to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, and a NSW Department of Justice spokeswoman confirmed State Coroner Michael Barnes has ordered that an autopsy be carried out this week. Detectives who are leading the investigation into the death of Stephanie Scott will reportedly make inquiries with authorities in the Netherlands in an attempt to run a background check on the accused killer. School cleaner Vincent Stanford, who moved to Leeton  from Holland over a year ago with his mother and brother, was charged with Ms Scott's murder on Thursday. The 26-year-old Leeton High School teacher was allegedly murdered and dumped in bushland six days before she was due to walk down the aisle to marry her partner of five years. A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their children . Police were lead to the place where Stephanie Scott's remains were found, by the family of her accused killer . Her body was discovered on Friday evening around 5pm in Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW . The high school where she worked turned into a memorial site after it emerged Ms Scott had been murdered . Stephanie Scott (right), pictured with her fiancé Aaron Leeson-Woolley, was last seen on Easter Sunday . NSW Police will get in contact with their counterparts in the Netherlands to determine if the accused 24-year-old murderer had any relevant history there, AAP reports. Stanford has reportedly been uncooperative with investigators. Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW police for comment. It has also emerged that one of the last actions of Ms Scott was to send an email to the bus company hired for her wedding, confirming transportation for guests. The revelation follows after police discovered the charred remains of a woman's body around 5pm on Friday after they were directed to Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW by  Stanford's family. It's further alleged a gasoline can had been found nearby. It is understood Stanford was familiar to the area and went on regular camping trips to the national park  on many occasions with his family. On Saturday - the day which English and drama teacher Ms Scott was set to marry her fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley - a memorial was held to honour the late bride-to-be.

On Saturday, the day Ms Scott was due to marry fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley, a memorial was held . Aaron Leeson-Woolley was comforted by friends and family at the heartbreaking service at the weekend . In a poignant move, the memorial service took place at the same time as when her wedding ceremony was due to take place. Her father Robert Scott spoke to the gathered mourners on behalf of his family and friends who were united in their grief on Saturday at Mountford Park in Leeton. The 26-year-old was last seen on Easter Sunday, when her disappearance sparked a widespread search for the much-loved teacher. 'Stephanie was a bright, intelligent and fun-loving woman who has impacted on many people here today,' Mr Scott said at his daughter's memorial on Saturday. 'Our wishes for the future are that this stays in your minds and you remember her. 'I'm sure she'd wish for that to be the case and you could remember her for the great little girl she was.' Ms Scott's grief-stricken fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley was too upset to take the stage, but was supported by loved ones to release yellow balloons into the air to commemorate her life.

"It looks like a clumsy bottle top, or maybe the missing part of a child’s toy. But according to a mother and daughter team behind this simple plastic device, it can achieve an Angelina Jolie-sized pout without resort to chemicals, needles or a hefty bill. The ‘Fullips’ device, a sort of suction-thimble, has already been seen at West End parties, and is going viral online. At a recent party in London’s Bulgari Hotel gaggles of models crowded around the bathroom sink mirrors together, not to powder their nose... but to suction their lips into the sort of look which is all the rage. Apparently, the device works by creating a mini-vacuum while you suck on the apparatus, and this draws blood to the surface of the lips, which swell. Scroll down for video . Lipsmacking: Charlotte puckers up with the Fullips device, a sort of suction-thimble, that has gone viral online . I’ve never been one to resist a celebrity fad, so I sceptically ordered a set – Arizona-based inventors Linda Gomez and her daughter Krystle sell them for £30. A day later the enhancers arrived in a selection of three sizes, each one claiming to give a different shaped pout to a different sized mouth. A long list of instructions comes with a link to a YouTube instruction video which has had more than a million hits. For seven minutes Krystle talks to camera about how her 50-year-old mother’s advancing age means she needs lubrication in the form of moisturiser to establishing ‘tighter suction’ around her mouth and other methods. Having watched carefully, I gave it a go and was shocked to find that the device does work... sort of. The results were not as dramatic as I had hoped, nor quite as long lasting. The reality is that my lips went rather blue and then got a bit puffy and then went back to normal after a few minutes. What lasted longer was the big red mark around my mouth. Indeed, the instructions warn that bruising is a danger. By the time I sat in front of the camera lens my lips had deflated, along with my enthusiasm and I was forced to resort to the tried-and-tested technique that has never failed me on a red carpet yet… the good old fashioned ‘mwah-mwah’ trout pout! Final result: The team behind Fullips claim it can achieve an Angelina Jolie-sized pout, but Charlotte found the results were not quite as dramatic as she had hoped .","Fullips device was created by Linda Gomez and her daughter Krystle .

"A father-of-two who brushed his ankle against a bin bag, scraping the skin, developed a flesh-eating bug and nearly lost his leg. Douglas Murphy was cleaning up after a children's picnic when he bumped his leg against a bin bag. Though the 47-year-old barely registered it at the time, the scrape almost cost him his right leg. A cut so small it was hardly visible, became infected, causing the rare condition necrotizing faciitis - a flesh-eating bug. So extreme was Mr Murphy's infection, surgeons were preparing to amputate his right leg. But as they were printing out the paperwork to authorise the procedure, the antibiotics Mr Murphy had been given finally began to show signs of working. Douglas Murphy, 47, from Brooklyn, New York, pictured with his daughters Livvy Grace and Eleanor, nearly lost his right leg after scraping it against a bin bag while clearing up after a party . 'I attended a picnic for my daughter's kindergarten class,' said Mr Murphy of Brooklyn, New York. 'The kids played and it was a wonderful day. After the party ended, I helped in the clean up. 'I filled a bag with trash and, as it neared filling, spun the bag so I could tie it off. 'The bag's bottom corner brushed – and we're talking barely touched – my ankle and left a little teensie bit of juice on my sock. 'There was no abrasion or anything visible.' That evening, Mr Murphy, who owns a summer camp company, was at home watching a movie with his daughters Livvy Grace, now 13 and Eleanor, now 11, when he began to feel feverish. 'My leg, foot and ankle began to swell and a nasty dark purple began to spread and grow. My temperature was rising, I started feeling awful,' he said. 'I thought it was a spider bite. I made my kids look but they didn't see anything.' By the following evening, his temperature had rocketed to 42°C and he could put weight on his ankle. He rushed to New York Methodist Hospital and collapsed at the intake desk. Mr Murphy was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and medics battled to save him from the grips of infection. 'For the next few days, I was incoherent, feverish – completely out of it,' he said. 'The infection spread and my temperature did not go down. I was in deep, deep trouble. A cut so small it was barely visible became infected, triggering the flesh-eating infection, necrotizing faciitis . Surgeons were preparing to amputate his right leg, when they noticed antibiotics given to the father-of-two had begun to work. As a result his leg was saved . 'They didn't tell me how bad it was but apparently told my mum, who flew in and stayed at my bedside, to get my paperwork in order as they might not save me.' As the infection took hold, Mr Murphy began to suffer 'crazy fever dreams', telling his mother he was due to fly via private plane to Tokyo to attend a party hosted by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Despite being hooked up to several IV drips and plied with different combinations of antibiotics, Mr Murphy's fever refused to slow. When red infection lines began to shoot over his knee, surgeons decided to prep him for amputation. It was not until they were printing out the paperwork to authorise the operation that the medicine finally began to work. Eventually, the infection was beaten and Mr Murphy was moved to a regular hospital room to recover. 'At first they put me in a shared room and it was really only then that I began to get coherent. 'There was a guy in the bed nearby and his wife sitting at the foot of the bed,' Mr Murphy said. 'They were both staring at me. I looked down at my massive, swollen, disgusting leg with flesh literally falling away, hair a mess, soaked in sweat – not the person you want to be wheeled into your room. 'Once I moved into a single room and washed up, I began to feel more human. 'My sister stayed in my room day and night and, while wearing gloves, peeled away layer after layer of dead, disgusting tissue.' Mr Murphy said he is grateful to be alive. His foot has now completely healed but still hurts a lot of the time . Mr Murphy was discharged and given crutches, which he found difficult to navigate. On his first day back home, he slipped, broke his hip and was sent back to hospital for a string of orthopaedic surgeries which ended in a total hip replacement. His lymph system was severely damaged following the infection and his foot is now covered in scar tissue. He is keen to raise awareness of his ordeal, working tirelessly with the National Necrotizing Faciitis Foundation. 'When I look at the pictures I have a hard time believing that it's me and I survived,' he said. 'The doctors think that a teensie abrasion from the trash bag and the presence of the bacteria on the bag was enough to let in the infection. The bacteria is present all over the world. 'My foot has healed completely mottled and hurts much of the time but I get used to it. 'It's good to be alive.' Necrotizing faciitis is often triggered by group A streptococci bacteria, pictured . Necrotizing faciitis is a rare but life-threatening infection affecting the deep layers of the skin. It progresses quickly after being triggered by various types of bacteria, including group A streptococcus and staphylococcus. Many infections are caused by organisms already residing on a person's skin. Group A streptococci is a bacteria commonly found in the throat and on the skin. The vast majority of infections are relatively mild illnesses, such as strep throat and impetigo. Occasionally, however, the bacteria can become life-threatening if entering parts of the body where not usually found such as the blood, muscles or the lungs. The bacteria is often spread through direct contact with the mucus of an infected person and through contact with infected skin wounds and sores. Invasive group A streptococcal disease, which may occur when the bacteria gets past the body’s defences, is a severe and sometimes life-threatening infection in which the bacteria has invaded parts of the body, such as the blood, deep muscle and fat tissue or the lungs. Two of the most severe forms of invasive group A streptococcal disease are  necrotising fasciitis and Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (a rapidly progressing infection causing injury to the major organs). The early signs and symptoms of necrotising fasciitis include fever, severe pain and swelling, and redness at the wound site. The early symptoms of Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome may include fever, dizziness, confusion, low blood pressure, rash and abdominal pain.","Douglas Murphy scraped his leg on a bin bag while clearing up after party .

"Lesley Conman's daughter Abbie, 12, was sent sexualised messages by an online pervert on Facebook . Two mothers have slammed police for failing to act after their daughters were targeted by an online predator. Both Lesley Conman and Kerry Green's young daughters were sent sexualised messages by an online pervert on Facebook - but police refused to investigate as no offence had been committed. Ms Conman's daughter Abbie, 12, was sent a message by the man after accepting a friend request from someone pretending to be a 17-year-old boy. After the horrified mother saw the provocative messages, she challenged the man herself, pretending to be Abbie. Ms Conman, 34, from Hull, said: 'There were four or five messages that he sent, before he actually blocked me. I think I scared him. 'You can only find my daughter on Facebook if you have a mutual friend and this guy was friends with 100 of her school friends, so she thought he was from school.' After tackling the pervert, Lesley posted the messages on her own account to warn other parents of the dangerous predator. She said: 'I shared it because I would say 90 per cent of my daughter's school were on his profile and he was talking to her friends and his profile had about 300-400 friends and they were all under 15.' In the case of Ms Green's daughter Emily, 13, the sick man threatened to post explicit pictures on her Facebook wall - which all of her friends would have then seen - if she did not play along with his sordid messages. The pictures were not of Emily, but it is thought that he planned to post them online as if they were her. Ms Green, from North Newbald, East Yorkshire, said: 'When I first saw the messages I flipped out, but I didn't to play the role of a paedophile hunter and lead him on because I didn't want him to think that my daughter was interested in him in anyway at all.' Ms Conman challenged the man (pictured left and writing in grey) when she found the messages on Abbie's Facebook (Abbie's messages in blue) After the horrified mother saw the provocative messages, she challenged (in blue) the man (writing in grey) herself, pretending to be Abbie . Both mothers contacted Humberside Police but the force did not take any action on either occasion. Ms Conman was told that no offence had been committed so officers could not do anything about the messages. She said: 'I felt disgusted by it. If nothing is done then surely we are sending a message out to these men that this is acceptable.' Ms Green, who says the police never responded to her complaint, said: 'It was upsetting and annoying. I understand they can't follow up everyone of these case because it takes a lot of time, but if they did chase them up there would be less of them.' Both mothers admitted that they do not like their daughters being on Facebook, but they'd rather allow it than running the risk of the girls setting up a secret account. A Humberside Police spokesman said: 'Unfortunately, there are people out there that do want to engage with people who are younger than themselves. 'Young people can help themselves by not engaging with them. Parents have a role to play in it, children have a role to play in it and we have a role to play in it once a crime has been committed. 'We are aware of Mrs Green's complaint and we have taken it seriously and given her advice as to how to prevent this happening in the future.'","Young girls were sent sexualised Facebook messages but police didn't act .

"Nicola Sturgeon is most definitely the most dangerous woman in Britain. Not because she might well cosy up to Ed Miliband and keep David Cameron out of office, but because she is living proof that women become sexier with age, income and office. No wonder her male rivals are terrified. While in 2001 she dressed according to the Angela Merkel school of leadership – a boxy, androgynous look from a woman who had lost her waist along with her sanity, topped and tailed with a Krankies haircut and orthopaedic shoes – today she has shed pounds, bleached her hair, squeezed her feet into Kurt Geiger heels, and for the leaders’ debate last week, rocked a coral two-piece by the aptly named Scottish design label Totty Rocks.

In 2001 she dressed according to the Angela Merkel school of leadership – a boxy, androgynous look from a woman who had lost her waist along with her sanity, topped and tailed with a Krankies (above) haircut and orthopaedic shoes . Her outfit made the male leaders’ dark suits seem as old as their arguments. She also eclipsed Plaid Cymru’s Leanne Wood (too feminine) and the Greens’ Natalie Bennett (too hemp). THE HAIR . 2001: I really don’t trust a woman who says she doesn’t have time to go to the hair salon, apply make-up, or steam the creases from her trousers... Now: Gone is the fright wig, and in its place is a chic, choppy, youthful but not frivolous, golden halo of Princess Diana-like loveliness – a ray of sunshine that says this woman means business. She has shed pounds, bleached her hair, squeezed her feet into Kurt Geiger heels, and for the leaders’ debate last week, rocked a coral two-piece by the aptly named Scottish design label Totty Rocks . THE ACCESSORIES . 2001: No one except the Queen looks good with a brooch, seen here as a last-minute addition to stop its wearer appearing too bland. Now: Simple stud earrings and an under-stated watch avoid too much frivolity. I’d like her to carry a bag though. THE DIET . 2001: I can hear female voters muttering, ‘She didn’t have time to get her hair done, but she certainly found time to eat!’ Sturgeon appears slow-moving and complacent. Now: I can hardly believe this is the same woman: she appears confident, fit, and full of dynamic energy. Here, Sturgeon is all womanly curves and upright posture. THE OUTFIT . 2001: This grey, rather Maoist trouser suit by Debenhams looks like an outsize school uniform. Shapeless, boxy and designed to shroud rather than flatter, it is the ultimate wallflower’s wardrobe choice, not a style statement for a parliamentary candidate who wants to be noticed. Now: The Queen knows a bright colour means she can be spotted easily, and I love this spring green (new leader, new shoots!) outfit by British label Hobbs: a silk and cotton blend jacket, £189, and a print dress, £149. The length is spot-on, while bracelet sleeves stop a jacket becoming too masculine. THE SHOES . 2001: These are the sort of shoes M&S does so well: navy, square and comfortable. We don’t want our politicians to be comfy, we want them to suffer! Sturgeon resembles a double-glazing salesperson at the annual works do. Now: While somewhat passé in fashion circles, thanks to the Duchess of Cambridge, the flesh-nude LK Bennett court shoe is nevertheless an eternally flattering choice that elongates the leg and emphasises a slender ankle.","Sturgeon has shed pounds, bleached her hair and mixed up her outfits .

"The boy dubbed China's 'miracle baby' after he was born the moment his mother was killed in a horrific car crash has just celebrated his first birthday. Zhao Pingan's mother was in labour when she and her husband were hit by a truck as they travelled on a motorbike to a hospital in Xiamen city, in south-eastern China's Fujian province. Both of his parents were killed in the accident, but not before the mother gave birth at the scene last March, reports The People's Daily. Pingan Zhao (pictured) was named China's 'miracle baby' after he was born as his mother died in a crash . Chinese media reported at the time that the baby boy had been 'catapulted' from his mother's womb' as the truck ran over her, ending up ten feet away from her. This unbelievable story of his birth led to him becoming something of a local celebrity and hailed as a 'miracle baby'. The baby was given the name Zhao Pingan which means 'safe and sound' in Chinese. Pingan was then adopted by his uncle  Zhao Yanchao and his grandmother Xiao Kaixing. On Saturday, Pingan celebrated his first birthday publicly - about a month after his real birthday of March 18 - in his hometown Xiamen, surrounded by family members and the volunteers and doctors who treated him at the time. Uncle Yanchao said: 'I lost my older brother to an absolute tragedy, now I have a duty to see him live on in Pingan. Chinese media reported  that the baby boy had been 'catapulted' from his mother's womb (left) when the truck ran over her, ending up ten feet away from her. Pingan (right) celebrates his first birthday with his family . Pimgan was dubbed China's 'miracle baby' by local media after his miraculous start in life (pictured) 'He already has his eyes and his mother's smile. I shall love and treasure him as I know they would have done.' To celebrate his birthday his aunt, Ms Zhang, in keeping with Pingan's native Sichuan tradition, gave some items for the little boy to 'hold on to' to determine his future. He immediately took a calculator, pen and an apple. 'These three items indicates Pingan will safely proceed with his studies and he will have a deep interest in learning.' said a smiling Ms Zhang. When Pingan was seven months old he was taken Beijing's Tiantan Hospital Neurosurgery department to have an operation to drain the build-up of water in his head. A doctor said because of Pingan's injuries his development may be a bit behind his peers, especially in his speech and ability to walk. Pingan enjoys a piece of cake as he celebrates his first birthday one year on from the horror crash . But despite his difficult start in life Pingan has developed into a happy and smiling little boy. Now Pingan's uncle and aunty are preparing to move and work away from home in order to bring in more money as they are concerned about the ongoing treatment he will need. 'Pingan may still need further operations,' said his uncle Zhao Yanchao. Baby Pingan suffered from minor bruises and scratches when he was found at the scene of the accident last year. Police spokesman Chan Chien said at the time: 'Eye witnesses said that when the woman was hit by the truck she gave birth on the spot. ' Pingan is a happy little boy - but his family are concerned he could require further hospital treatment for the injuries he received in the crash . 'Others said that the baby which was a healthy 4.2 kg had been thrown out of the woman's belly and had landed three meters away.' Police confirmed soon after the accident that they had arrested a 45-year-old truck driver who had apparently turned into the road just as the motorbike was coming along. A spokesman from Beiiing Tian Tan Hospital said shortly after the accident: 'The baby has had an MRI scan because he is suffering from hydrocephalus, water on the brain, which was caused by the accident. 'He will need to undergo more surgery although we do not think his condition is serious. 'He truly is a miracle baby.' Xiamen City Hospital Paediatrician Dr Fang Mei, who treated Pingan at the time, said on Saturday: 'When he first arrived he was covered in dirt with cuts to his head.' 'Weighing over 9lb the baby boy still had his umbilical cord and placenta attached to him when he arrived at the hospital.' Dr Fang said that as Pingan had hit the floor quite hard he had sustained some nerve damage to his fragile body. She said: 'None of the medical staff had seen how Pingan was pushed out of his mother's body and we wonder how it could have been possible - but the fact that he survived is something of a miracle.' Pingan's plight moved the nation and volunteers and charities flocked to offer their time and help with his recovery. Two branches of the Red Cross in Xiamen City set up a '3.18 Hai Cang Miracle Baby Fund' and were able to find 50 'Loving Mummies' to provide him with round the clock care and attention. The head of a local charity volunteer group, Ms Li, said they set up a call to action movement to help the miracle baby and were 'overwhelmed' by the response. Nappies, toys, as well as expertise and time were all donated to Pingan. The baby poses with some of the hospital staff and volunteers who helped care for him following the crash .

Nemtsov, 55, died on February 27 when he was gunned down as he walked near the Kremlin with his Ukrainian girlfriend Anna Duritskaya, 23. According to official sources inside Russia, he was shot by Chechen Islamic terrorists because of his support of Charlie Hebdo journalists that published cartoons of Mohammed. But many suspect the Kremlin was behind the killing because he reportedly had evidence showing Russian involvement in Ukraine.

"The idea of a device that constantly keeps an eye on your home and can tell you  which electrical devices are running at any one time, may sound appealing when it comes to saving energy and money. Now there’s a device called Neurio that claims to make any 'ordinary home smart’ and even tells you when you've accidently left lights on. The $250 (£168) device recognises the electronic signature of different devices - such as kettles and washing machines - allowing users to keep an eye on their energy consumption and even control appliances through their phone. Scroll down for video . One device to rule them all: A $250 (£168) device called Neurio (pictured) claims to make ‘an ordinary home smart’. It recognises the electronic signature of different devices, such as kettles and washing machines, allowing users to keep an eye on their energy consumption and even control appliances through their phone . ‘We are trying to create one sensor that can make every home smart,’ Ali Kashani, co-founder of Neurio told Fast Company. ‘It creates that intelligence for all of the dumb products that are already in your home and that you don't want to replace.’ Its website says: ‘Using a Wi-Fi power sensor and a cloud service with some smart pattern detection algorithms, Neurio monitors your home's electricity to figure out what your appliances are up to - without the need to install sensors on every device.’ Neurio feeds information about energy consumption of the devices it’s recognised back to an app, where users can make decisions about how to save power and money by turning gadgets off, for instance. These screenshots show the home screen (left), appliances recognised (centre) and usage for one day (right) The Neurio sensor is plugged into the house’s breaker panel, or circuit box. It measures both differential voltage and current signals every split second and these signals are used to calculate power and energy consumption. The measurements are sent to the Neurio Cloud where algorithms identify appliances and behaviours based on unique electronic signals. When the algorithms detect that a device has been turned on or off, or a user returning home, they notify the Neurio app and services such as IFTTT which allows devices to be controlled from smartphones. The app, which is available for iOS and Android phones and tablets, gives users real-time feedback about their home. It tells them which appliances are greedily consuming energy, for example. The device plugs into a breaker box, or circuit box in a house where it gradually learns to recognise the electric ‘signature’ of different gadgets and appliances. Users can train Neurio to recognise a light bulb for example, by flicking a light on and off to tell the accompanying app what to detect. Alternatively, an algorithm allows it to learn for itself based on crowdsourced information, to tell it what a microwave’s signature looks like, for example. Neurio feeds information about energy consumption of the devices it’s recognised back to an app, where users can make decisions about how to save power and money by turning gadgets off, for instance. ‘It you will even gently nag you if you forget to turn off the lights before going to bed,’ the website says. ‘…Some customers have saved as much as 44 per cent on their energy usage.’ Because it monitors the home around the clock, Neurio can give owners peace of mind if they think they have left their oven switched on, for example. The device monitors a home around the clock so it can tell users if they have left their oven on, if their washing is finished and if the water is cold (all illustrated). When used with another app, Neurio can be used to turn appliances and household devices on and off remotely . It can also be used to keep an eye on inhabitants, by showing if relatives are eating regularly or if children are spending too long watching television, for example. The device can send reminders to take washing out of the machine when the cycle is complete, for example. And it also allows users to control home appliances remotely by using apps such as IFTTT, to start a washing machine while they are out, for example. Neurio is open platform so it can work with smart devices such as the Nest thermostat too.","$250 (£168) Neurio device claims to make 'an ordinary home smart'

"A sign on a diner window in Oklahoma asking a homeless person who had been going through their rubbish to come for a free meal . The kindness of a diner owner who offered a free meal to a homeless person who had been searching through her rubbish has gone viral. Ashley Jiron, owner of P.B. Jams in Warr Acres, Oklahoma, noticed that someone had been looking for food in the bins behind her restaurant and decided try and get in contact with them. She taped a sign to her diner window appealing to the person to come forward, so that she could give them a proper meal - free of charge. The notice read: 'To the person going through our trash for their next meal, you're a human being and worth more than a meal from a dumpster. 'Please come in during operating hours for a classic Pb&j [peanut butter and jam sandwich], fresh veggies, and a cup of water at no charge. No questions asked.' A customer called Greg King noticed the message and posted a picture of it on his Instagram page with the hashtag #thatswhatlovelookslike - within a couple of days it had been shared thousands of times on social media. The owner told News Channel 4 that she hadn't expected it to receive such a huge response and was just trying to do the right thing. She said: 'Last week, I had noticed some bags, when I had taken out the trash, were torn open and some of the food was taken out,' 'That really, it hurt me that someone had to do that - I will not take down that sign until they come in. 'I think we've all been in that position where we needed someone's help and we just needed someone to extend that hand and if I can be that one person to extend that hand to another human being then I will definitely do it.' Thousands of people have since taken to social media to rave about Ashley's actions. Facebook user Lesley Jaquay wrote: 'Imagine if every restaurant did this. So much food goes to waste. Good job PB Jams! would love to donate a few meals.' Another called Brittany Hueter wrote: 'I wish there were more business owners like you. These places that have a heart are where I like to spend my money at.' Ashley Jiron, owner of P.B. Jams in Warr Acres, Oklahoma . Greg King noticed the message and posted a picture of it on his Instagram page, which was then picked up across the globe . After being impressed by the amount of people who got in touch to express their support, Ashley launched a pay-it-forward scheme at her diner, where customers can pay for other people's meals. She said: 'Patrons can pre-pay a meal for a person in need. 'For each donation, a sticky nut will be placed on our wall. 'Those who need to can come take a tag off the wall and use it to pay for their meal. 'Donations not used by the end of the month will go towards purchasing food for a local homeless shelter.' She has also launched a GoFundMe page for people who can't reach the diner but also want to be part of the project.

"Backlash: Virginia Roberts - pictured here with Prince Andrew - is being sued for defamation . The woman who claimed she slept with Prince Andrew whilst working as a sex slave is facing a legal backlash from two other men she claimed had relations with her, it emerged yesterday. Virginia Roberts is being sued for defamation by high profile US attorney Alan Dershowitz, who said that he wants to have her thrown in jail. Mr Dershowitz said that Miss Roberts would have to give evidence under oath and that if she repeated her claims she will have perjured herself. Miss Roberts has also been branded ‘despicable’ by model agency owner Jean Luc Brunel who said that he is considering legal action of his own. In a statement Mr Brunel said that he was ‘devastated by the unfounded accusations against him’ and wanted to take revenge. Earlier this week Florida Judge Kenneth Marra ordered Miss Roberts’ claims that she was a ‘sex slave’ to billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, a former friend of Andrew, be struck from the record. Amid the other ‘lurid’ allegations removed from the record were claims that she slept with the Duke of York, Mr Dershowitz and Mr Brunel. Mr Dershowitz, who used to represent Epstein, said there was ‘no way’ Miss Roberts could repeat any of the allegations in court ever again. He said: ‘If they try to bring it up in court we’re going to seek contempt proceedings against them. ‘The ultimate goal is for (Miss Roberts) to go to prison for perjury.’ Mr Dershowitz said that last week he tracked Miss Roberts down and served her with a subpoena that she will have to respond to under oath. He said: ‘If she repeats she had sex with me on Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico where I was at for one hour in the presence of five people, she will have committed perjury. ‘If she says I had sex with her on Jeffrey Epstein’s island where I was one day with my wife, my daughter, professor Michael Porter, his wife, and four members of his family, she will be committing perjury’. Defamation: Attorney Alan Dershowitz says he would like to see Ms Roberts in prison after her claims . Mr Brunel has not filed a claim against Miss Roberts yet but said that if she repeats her ‘lies’ again she will ‘end up in prison for perjury’. His lawyer said: ‘He’ll relentlessly sue those who persist in attributing to him any involvement in this sordid sexual scandal to which he is completely foreign’. Miss Roberts had attempted to join a lawsuit filed by two other women who seek to get Epstein’s 2008 plea deal overturned as they feel it was too lenient. In her filing she claimed that she was forced to take part in an orgy with the Duke when she was 17, under the legal age of consent in Florida, and that she slept with him in London, New York and on Epstein’s Caribbean island. Prince Andrew has always strongly denied the allegations against him. Buckingham Palace has confirmed that was informed of Judge Marra’s ruling.

"The Director of Public Prosecutions was under growing pressure to stand down last night over her failure to put Lord Janner on trial for serious child abuse offences. Alison Saunders’s position as the country’s top prosecutor looked bleak as she faced unprecedented criticism from the Home Secretary, police chiefs, crime tsars, prominent MPs – and even one of her predecessors. Mrs Saunders said her job as head of the Crown Prosecution Service was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases, not the most popular ones. But she was accused of ignoring the rights of victims and of perpetrating Establishment cover-ups by deciding that Labour peer Lord Janner should not be charged – despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims dating back to the 1960s. Birthday visit: Lord Janner, right with cake, took Michael Jackson - who was repeatedly accused of child abuse but cleared in court - on tour of Parliament in 2002, together with their mutual friend of Uri Gellar and US magician David Blaine (centre, left). It was the birthday of Labour MP Paul Boateng, alongside Janner . Theresa May became the first Cabinet Minister to question the DPP’s judgment in ruling that the 86-year-old should not be prosecuted on the grounds that his dementia is now too advanced for him to have a fair trial. The Home Secretary told the BBC: ‘I was very concerned when I heard about this decision. I have been very clear in everything I have said so far about the child sexual abuse issue… I expect to see justice done.’ Former DPP Lord Macdonald of River Glaven said it would have been better if Lord Janner had undergone a procedure whereby a jury can decide on the facts of a case without apportioning guilt and without a sentence being passed, if a suspect is unfit to plead. There have been a number of recent court cases in which defendants with dementia have been jailed, and Lord Janner himself has previously called for Nazi war criminals to be put on trial regardless of their age or frailty. Lord Macdonald added: ‘It might have been wiser for the Crown Prosecution Service to say, ‘‘We’re going to have this matter resolved in the full public glare of a courtroom rather than simply by the DPP.’’ ’ Adam Simmonds, Police and Crime Commissioner for Northamptonshire, said the decision not to charge Lord Janner on Thursday made it a ‘dark day for our justice system’. He added: ‘A substantial number of victims of child abuse, who have carried the weight of such heinous crimes with them for the best part of two decades, have been terribly let down in the worst possible way.’ He said the DPP’s ruling went against her previously stated commitment to seek justice for victims, no matter how old the allegations. Alison Saunders, right, said her job as head of the Crown Prosecution Service was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases, not the most popular ones, Lord Janner, left . Leicestershire Constabulary, which has investigated Lord Janner four times over the past 25 years, is considering an unprecedented legal challenge against the decision. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who exposed the late Cyril Smith as a paedophile, said that the weight of criticism against Mrs Saunders meant something had ‘clearly gone very badly wrong’. Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, below, he said: ‘Mrs Saunders is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it’s hard to see how her position remains tenable.’ Mrs Saunders has also come under fire over other high-profile cases – and has been involved in a number of disputes over the competing rights of suspects and alleged victims in sex assault cases. Her decision in the Lord Janner case could be overturned if the complainants use the ‘Right to Review’ scheme introduced two years ago. A CPS employee with no prior involvement in the case would consider if her decision was the right one. Alleged victims of Lord Janner will eventually be able to share their experiences with the long-delayed public inquiry into historic child abuse to be chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard. However, that investigation faces further setbacks as campaigners are seeking a judicial review of her decision to exclude child abuse survivors from the inquiry panel for being insufficiently objective. The CPS’s handling of previous investigations into Lord Janner is also being reviewed by retired High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques. Last night the CPS said: ‘The DPP is there to make the right legal decision. Her role is to make these very difficult decisions, not to make popular decisions.’ Roadblock to justice must be removed . by Simon Danczuk, MP who exposed the Cyril Smith scandal . MP Simon Danczuk who exposed the Cyril Smith Scandal . A few weeks ago, I met an experienced former Metropolitan Police officer to discuss investigations into high- profile child abusers active in the 1970s. ‘We’re making progress but putting Rolf Harris and Max Clifford behind bars isn’t going to trouble the Establishment,’ he remarked. ‘It’ll be 50 times harder to prosecute a politician. They’re able to call in a lot of favours.’ A year earlier, I’d met police officers from Leicestershire to discuss the case they were putting together against Lord Janner. I could tell they were determined to get a prosecution, but it was the question they put to me next that disturbed me almost as much as the allegations: ‘Do you think there will be any political interference?’ The fact that dedicated frontline officers investigating heinous crimes against vulnerable children should have to ask that in 21st Century Britain is a worrying sign. But it’s one we should come to expect given the continual revelations about previous failures to prosecute high-profile figures for abusing children. The decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions to use the public interest test to overrule the evidence when refusing to prosecute Lord Janner is a reminder that outdated attitudes still prevail. They throw our whole justice system into disrepute. Not just because the authorities continue to turn a tin ear to those who have been violated, disbelieved and treated as rubbish for decades. And not just because in admitting previous failures to prosecute Janner, Alison Saunders failed to apologise on behalf of the CPS. It’s appalling because it’s the wrong decision and one she didn’t have to make. For the DPP to shut down any prospect of justice in such a case sends out the worst possible message at the worst possible time, and her reputation is unravelling fast. When the Home Secretary says she’s ‘very concerned’, the former DPP Lord Macdonald is critical, and Leicestershire Police are talking about a legal challenge, then something has clearly gone very badly wrong. So wrong that Mrs Saunders is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it’s hard to see how her position remains tenable.","Alison Saunders position as the country's top prosecutor looks bleak .

"Former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson has decided against hosting BBC's Have I Got News For You later this month. The TV personality was due to record the show, which he has hosted in the past, on April 23 to be broadcast the following day. The recording would have marked his first appearance for the BBC since being dismissed for hitting Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon in a 'fracas' at a hotel over dinner. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson will not be hosting an episode of Have I Got News For You later this month, according to the show's producers, though they expect him to return to the show later in the year . Jimmy Mulville, managing director of Hat Trick Productions, said: 'On reflection, Jeremy Clarkson has decided not to host Have I Got News For You. 'We fully expect him to resume his hosting duties later in the year.' Clarkson had been a regular feature on BBC television since taking over Top Gear in 1988 from previous producer Noel Edmonds. He is credited with taking the show from being a niche motoring programme to the most watched series on BBC 2. The hosting slot would have marked Clarkson's first appearance on the BBC since he was dismissed from Top Gear for hitting producer Oisin Tymon . His brash presenting style and refusal to bow to PC culture earned him legions of admirers and critics, and controversy dogged his career. He was put on a 'final warning' after allegedly saying a racial slur on air while reciting a nursery rhyme, and drew more unwanted attention after the Top Gear team were kicked out of Argentina last year while filming a Christmas special. Clarkson's car had a numberplate which was thought to be a deliberate reference the Falklands war, though the BBC denied this. He was suspended by the broadcaster on March 10 when reported himself to the corporation following a row in which producer Oisin Tymon was punched, splitting his lip. Following a week-long investigation, director-general Tony Hall decided against renewing his contract saying at the time 'a line has been crossed'. Despite Clarkson's unruly behaviour, he received an outpouring of public support, including from his friend and Prime Minister, David Cameron, while a million people signed a petition asking for him to be reinstated. Despite Top Gear being taken off the air, Clarkson has not been banned from appearing on the BBC altogether, and so speculation fell on his Have I Got News For You appearance. The car enthusiast also has a controversial history on that programme, once throwing a pen at team captain and Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, cutting his cheek. Clarkson has vowed to keep working after being dismissed from the BBC, and will appear on stage for a series of live motoring shows with former colleagues Richard Hammond and James May. It emerged last week that he will appear on stage with his former Top Gear colleagues, Richard Hammond and James May, later this year to fulfil a series of shows planned before he left the BBC. Clarkson turned himself in to BBC bosses following the dust-up, and after an investigation director-general Tony Hall decided against renewing his contract . However, Clarkson is not banned from appearing on the BBC altogether, meaning he could have fulfilled his commitment to host the satirical news show, but has since withdrawn . The gigs will be stripped of all BBC branding and content, and billed as Clarkson, Hammond and May Live. That means the shows, which will take in venues in Australia, Norway, South Africa and the UK, will not be able to use clips from the show or feature The Stig. The move has sparked rumours that the three men intend to team up to continue their careers together after Clarkson's exit from the corporation, but sources close to the tour say it is just a matter of fulfilling commitments to the fans. The future of the show's other two presenters - Hammond and May - is unclear, with both men's Top Gear contracts also having run out. Since Clarkson's future was decided, May has been seen meeting with BBC head of content Alan Yentob, though the details of what were discussed have not been revealed.","Clarkson was due to host satirical news show at the end of this month .

"David Cameron will launch a multi-billion pound sale of Lloyds Bank shares if he wins the Election – in what would be the largest privatisation bonanza since the Thatcher era. The Prime Minister will today pledge that if he is returned to Downing Street he will offer the public £4 billion of Lloyds shares still held by the Government after Gordon Brown’s £20 billion panic bailout with taxpayers’ money during the 2008 economic crisis. Individuals will be allowed to buy up to £10,000 worth of Lloyds Banking Group shares, which were worth 78.7p when the stock market closed on Friday – comfortably above the 73.6p paid by Mr Brown’s government. Scroll down for video . David Cameron will launch a multi-billion pound sale of Lloyds Bank shares if he wins the Election . The shares will be offered at a discount of at least 5 per cent on the market rate at the time, with the proceeds used to help pay down the national debt. It is the latest ‘retro’ Conservative policy to hark back to the 1980s, following Mr Cameron’s revival in the manifesto of the Thatcherite ‘Right to Buy’ offer for housing association tenants. But while investors 30 years ago took overnight profits on their stakes in privatised companies such as British Gas and British Telecom – leading critics to claim that it encouraged ‘carpetbaggers’ – Lloyds shareholders will be encouraged to hang on to their holding. A loyalty bonus will be offered of one free share for every ten held for at least a year after the sale, up to a maximum bonus value of £200. The sale of Lloyds shares would be the biggest privatisation since the 1980s when Mrs Thatcher’s government sold £3.9 billion of BT shares and £5.6 billion of British Gas shares in the famous ‘Tell Sid’ campaign. Thirty-three major companies were privatised under Mrs Thatcher between 1984 and 1991, which supporters said led to a dramatic improvement in their efficiency and a boost to tax revenues for the Treasury. Like Right to Buy, it also helped to entrench Tory support among voters who benefited from the windfalls. No 10 strategists hope Mr Cameron’s pledge will remind voters of the economic problems that blighted the country under Mr Brown’s premiership. The recovery under Chancellor George Osborne has allowed him to sell £9 billion of shares in Lloyds to City investors for more than the price that former chancellor Alistair Darling paid in 2008. CLAIM: Jesse Norman and the chocolate cake he allegedly gave out while campaigning for re-election . Police are investigating a Tory MP over claims he attempted to bribe voters with chocolate cake. Jesse Norman allegedly gave out cake while campaigning for re-election at an Asda supermarket in his Hereford constituency. West Mercia Police last night said it was investigating reports of a breach of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which bans Election candidates from providing food, drink or entertainment in a bid to win votes. The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year. Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2. He described the allegations as ‘nonsense’, saying: ‘We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children, who are not even voters.’ There have been two sales to big pension funds and City institutions in 2013 and early in 2014. Late last year, UK Financial Investments, the Treasury body that manages the Government stake, hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to sell a few million Lloyds shares in the market every day over a six month period – a practice known as a ‘dribble-out’. The Government still owns £12.5 billion of Lloyds shares and experts expect £4 billion worth to be offered to the public, with the rest sold to City institutions. With the share price currently above 78p, the Tories will be able claim they have banked a profit running into billions for the taxpayer. However, while Lloyds has been a success story, the Government’s other big bank investment – Royal Bank of Scotland – has not. The Treasury under Mr Brown paid an average of 502p a share for RBS when it was rescued. They were changing hands on Friday for 349p. In Mr Cameron’s announcement today, he is expected to say: ‘The £20 billion bailout of Lloyds Bank by the last Labour government became a symbol of the crisis that engulfed the British economy under Labour. After the public bailed it out, people feared they wouldn’t see their money returned. Today they are. ‘Today’s announcement marks another step in the long journey we have been making repairing our banks, turning our economy around and reducing our national debt, only made possible by our long-term economic plan. ‘That’s why it is so important that we don’t put all that progress at risk, but instead build on what we’ve done so we can deliver a brighter, more secure future for our country.’ COUNTRY LIFE: A 'beater' at work and below,  a bottle of Sipsmith Dry Gin . The Prime Minister indulged his love of country sports by taking part in a secret country shoot near his Oxfordshire constituency home. And he celebrated with a nip of a specially prepared ‘Chipping Norton’ cocktail. But witnesses say that David Cameron did not himself use a gun – despite his reputation as a skilled marksman. Instead, he acted as a ‘beater’ to flush out the game. The event took place on New Year’s Eve but until now has been kept a closely guarded secret. It took place near Chipping Norton, the Oxfordshire town which has given its name to the ‘Chipping Norton set’ of high-profile local residents from the world of politics, media and showbusiness such as Mr Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson. Last night, the man who served Mr Cameron the cocktail said other people on what he described as a ‘country walk’ had no idea there would be a VIP guest. Jared Brown, master distiller at the West London ‘artisanal’ gin company Sipsmith, said: ‘No one but the landowner knew the Prime Minister would be joining us.’ He fought shy of describing the event as a shoot, but added: ‘I can say with utter certainty that Mr Cameron did not handle a gun.’ Mr Brown confirmed, though, that the PM did sample the cocktail, based on Sipsmith London Dry Gin. Last night, the drink, also containing manuka honey, raspberry tea and extract of echinacea, was being dubbed the ‘Chipping Norton cocktail’.","David Cameron will pledge to sell Lloyds shares if he wins the election .

"A teenage Welsh international has had her promising career halted by a dead shin bone. Hannah Bluck, 18, from Porthcawl, south Wales, had her dreams shattered after a rare condition ruled her out of the game for two years. The teen football prodigy was warned by doctors that her leg could collapse into her ankle after being diagnosed with avascular necrosis in her distal tibia. Wales' Hannah Bluck, 18,  has had her promising career halted after suffering a rare condition . The 18-year-old has played for the Wales youth national teams at U19, U17 and U16 level . Avascular necrosis is bone death due to poor blood supply. The flow of blood to a section of bone can be interrupted if the bone is fractured or the joint becomes dislocated. The condition can lead to the eventual collapse of the bone. It is most common in people between the ages of 30 and 60, though most suffer from it in the hip and shoulder. The ultra-rare condition has caused her weight-bearing shin bone to die from lack of oxygen. Doctors have been baffled by the condition, which has never been seen before on a leg bone and usually affects joints. Mum Kerstin said: 'The doctor told her ""Hannah, you have to listen to everything I say because even if you go jogging then your leg could collapse into your ankle and that would be the worst thing that could ever happen"". 'I think she's dealt with it better than we have as parents. She's been so brave. 'She has such a high pain threshold and her first words to me after her accident were ""where've you been and what took you so long?"" 'Hannah's a girl of few words but one of the most aggressive centre-backs you'll ever see.' The youngster set records at youth level for Wales - appearing for the under-16s, under-17s and under-19s sides in the space of just eight days - before she was struck down by a freak accident in March 2013. The promising centre-back suffered a sickening dislocation of her ankle and fractured her fibia and tibia after falling while running on astroturf during routine training. Despite the help of Football Association of Wales and Cardiff City physios, the talented star hit a brick road in her recovery and saw specialists in November 2013 when she discovered she had AVN. A scan of Bluck's shin bone, which has left doctors baffled by the rare condition . Hannah, who is also autistic, has not kicked a ball since and turned her hand to coaching, working with the girls' Under-8s, 10s and 14s at Swansea. Kerstin said: 'Hannah has always had a ball at her feet and played for her first club when she was seven. 'She used to play with the boys until she was 11 and she wasn't happy when she had to stop - she enjoys the rough and tumble.' 'Football is everything for her and she has missed out on the social side because all her friends are at football so she doesn't see them. 'She's had her bad days but we're getting more positive ones now.' Despite two years on the sidelines, Hannah is still dreaming of a senior appearance for the Wales national side and is being followed by Women's Super League side Bristol Academy. Bluck (centre) pictured with former Swansea City player Wilfried Bony in the gym last year . Manchester United supporter Hannah said: 'It would mean everything to get back out on the pitch after two years out - when I play that is when I am most happy in life. 'It's so frustrating having to sit and watch when I just want to be out there playing. 'It's my dream to get a full senior Wales cap and I'd love to go and be a professional player in America too.' The treatment Hannah had been receiving was discovered to have stopped working last month leaving the family with nowhere to turn. In desperation, mum-of-five Kerstin took to Facebook and was amazed when a school friend she had not spoke to for almost three decades got in touch. Bluck (left) poses for a photo with Wales manager Chris Coleman and the U16 cap she won in 2012 . The long-lost contact threw the family a lifeline as experts at the world's biggest orthopaedic conference in Las Vegas in the USA ended up analysing Hannah's MRI scan. As a result, Hannah, who lives with brothers Daniel, 23, Thomas, 20, Conor, 16, Ben, 10, and dad Jonathan, 42, as well as Kerstin, has secured an appointment with a leading specialist in London on April 20. Kerstin said: 'She is still training all the time at Swansea City and you should see her upper body now. 'She has a core that puts some of the men to shame when she is in the gym with all of them. 'Hannah's so humble but she can do so many things that even the men there would struggle to do. 'It's been a hard two years for her but she has never given up and she never will do. 'I'm proud of every single breath that girl takes.'","Hannah Bluck has not played football since a freak accident in March 2013 .

It is a conversion, a piece of paper. It is not an all-singing, all-dancing event but it is terribly important. ‘The next thing is to be able to say “married” and have people, businesses, ask what your husband or wife does without assuming you are straight or gay. ‘Alice and I are very, very happy and we go to a lot of things together.

The woman, who looks like she is in her late teens or early 20s, began operating under the name Rio Bravo. Cutting a slim physique and an almost innocent smile, she also donned a Kevlar jacket beneath a gold necklace. In the comments next to the striking image, people urged her to sell the gun and buy another TV while others prayed for her. A picture of her body laying next to a dead man and another woman was taken before another image was posted showing her dismembered body in the cooler. A tattoo saying 'Nino', the same as the one seen on her right forearm, is also seen in the cooler. Alongside the photo was a message warning people to 'keep sending theses f****** a*** holes', insisting they will meet the same fate. Her two predecessors also ran into bad luck during confrontations with law enforcement. The first of the three 'Skinny Girls' was Veronica Mireya Moreno.

"A little boy with autism has sent his toy bear on a round-the-world mission to help him raise awareness about the disability. In January 2013, Dorian Poe, from Burlington, Ontario, sent his favorite toy out on the global adventure, having been inspired by the story of a cancer-stricken girl who, unable to live her own dreams of world travel, sent her teddy bear in her place. Hoping to raise the same level of global awareness about his own condition, Dorian decided to send his Ganz Webkinz bear, called Tikko, out into the world, carrying with him a message of understanding and tolerance for those affected by autism. Scroll down for video . 'It's okay to be different': Dorian Poe, 11, with his beloved bear Tikko, whose travels have raised awareness for autism all over the world . With the help and support of his mother Christine, Dorian, who was then nine years old, sent Tikko off on the first leg of his adventure in back in January 2013. Now, the bear has circled the globe and then some, continuing to share his vital message, while inviting the world to join in with his journey online. 'When I first decided to support Dorian in his campaign, it was because I was happy to see him want to “pay it forward”' Christine tells DailyMail.com. 'I fundraise each year to pay the $24,500.00/year tuition it costs for Dorian to go to a special needs school. I was thrilled to support Tikko because Dorian had found a way to give back to our community; a community that has been wonderful at supporting our fundraising efforts.' Hello, my name is Dorian. I have autism, and so does my pet polar bear Tikko. Tikko is about to go traveling on an adventure; and I need you to take care of him. My polar bear wants to raise autism awareness. Just call him 'Tikko the Autism Bear' or 'Tikko'. Guess what, this guy is much more different than the other polar bears you know. Things you should look out for: . To accompany Tikko the autistic bear on his adventures, Dorian included a letter explaining the characteristics and challenges involved in having autism – using the toy to help other people understand what the various aspects of the condition can feel like. Each family who receivedTikko on his travels would take on the job of raising awareness in his or her community – helping to spread Dorian’s message across the globe, while he remained at home in Canada. But the mother and son could never have known what a phenomenon Tikko would become. 'In January when Tikko took his first trip to Jamaica, I connected with another mom there whose child had autism,' Christine explains. 'There was little to no support for autism in Jamaica.' Hearing such a story from so far away, Christine began to research autism in the other countries Tikko was visiting, and she shared what she learned on the campaign's Facebook page. And two weeks after the Tikko had begun his adventures, Christine became involved in coordinating them. After media attention grew, and demand for visits from Tikko increased, Christine received a donation of new Tikkos from toy company GANZ, who offered 600 bears to the cause in order to help the family cope with the overwhelming amount of interest. ‘For the first few months there was only one Tikko,’ Christine explained. ‘It wasn’t long before we realized we could reach people faster by having more Tikko’s available. So I wrote to GANZ (the maker of the Webkinz Polar Bear), and to date they have donated 600 polar bears to us!’ With so many Tikko bears in the mix, running the campaign became a full-time job for Christine. At the gate: Tikko made it to 24 countries in his first 10 months of traveling . A towering success: The little bear has made it to some of the world's most instantly-recognizable landmarks . She keeps supporters informed with daily updates on Tikko's location on Facebook and Twitter, receives new Tikko travel photos every day, and promotes the awareness campaign across autism networking sites. However, Christine says: 'No matter how busy I am, I always have time to listen and offer support to those dealing with the challenges of having a child on the spectrum.' Tikko's Facebook page documents every destination he has reached in dozens of photos. He's posed at some of the world's most famous landmarks, hobnobbed with A-list celebrities, and even scraped the skies in a daring aerial show, all the while broadcasting the important message splashed across his T-shirt: 'Autism…it’s okay to be different!' The campaign has affected children all over the world who have autism, not in the least the young boy who started it all. A message in motion: Tikko spreads awareness with his motto: 'Autism…it’s okay to be different!' Getting back to his roots: Tikko has even made it as far as the North Pole, which was a dream of owner Dorian . 'Dorian feels a sense of purpose,' says mom Christine. 'He feels he is not only helping the world, but also his school peers. He’s gained confidence, and he’s made & kept friends more easily. 'He’s matured a great deal since starting his campaign. It has also brought us closer together – we share a very special bond.' Today there are still 20 Tikkos on the go, and the work is far from over. 'Tikko is still travelling, and will be for many years to come!' says Christine. 'He is just back from Kuwait, Lithuania, Nice and Scotland. He’s currently in Germany. 'Another Tikko is on the set of the Dragon's Den. Another Tikko is packed and ready to visit Mount Fuji in Japan. The list goes on. Tikko is one busy bear!'","Dorian Poe, 11, from Burlington, Ontario, sends his stuffed polar bear Tikko to other children around the world .

"A student remains under police guard in hospital after being kidnapped, tortured with pliers and forced to drink bleach by masked men in an apparent revenge attack for 'accidentally scraping a man's car'. Motaz Zaid, who is currently studying economics at the University of Greenwich, was with a friend in St Marks Close in Parsons Green, south west London, in the early hours of Friday when the group of thugs targeted them. His friend, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the pair were sprayed with ammonia and assaulted with tools before Mr Zaid, 20, was bundled into a Mercedes C220 Estate and driven off. Motaz Zaid was with a friend in  Parsons Green, south west London, in the early hours of Friday when the group of thugs targeted them. Mr Zaid was apparently bundled into a Mercedes by masked men and attacked . The friend, 19, who was stabbed several times in the back and legs during the ordeal, was left for dead in the quiet residential street while Mr Zaid was found dumped a few miles away, close to the A3 on the border of New Malden and Parsons Green. Police became alerted to the incident after spotting the vehicle in Beverley Way, Kingston, at about 1am. Uniformed officers approached the stationary car, but it drove off and fled from the scene despite attempts by police to pursue it. Officers then discovered Mr Zaid dumped on the side of the road with life-threatening injuries. He was taken to a south London hospital, which cannot be named for security reasons, where he remains in a critical condition. His friend was also taken to hospital with stab wounds but was later discharged. The friend recalled the incident today and told the Evening Standard: 'They had been parked waiting for him to get back. As we both got out of the car, these five guys just jumped us. They sprayed something in our eyes and it blocked our vision. 'They weren't after me, they were beating him up. I tried to fight them off and to grab him but he was on the floor and not moving. I hit one of them in the face and three of them chased me into the main road and stabbed me. 'By the time I got back to my friend the car had left and I thought he had got away but after looking for him I realised they had taken him in the car.' Mr Zaid, 20, who is currently studying economics at the University of Greenwich, was found dumped at the side of the A3 in Beverley Way, Kingston, south west London (above). He remains in hospital with critical injuries . Mr Zaid's father Azz said his son's injuries were 'very serious', adding: 'My heart is broken when I see my son like that. I can't believe anyone could do that to another human being.' He said he believes the incident is in response to a minor altercation last week. He said his son was allegedly involved in an accident with another car, in which one of the vehicles became slightly damaged. He claims the other driver refused to negotiate a settlement and threatened violence if his son did not pay £400. Metropolitan Police said officers from the Trident Gang Crime Command are currently investigating the incident and trying to trace the suspects . Officers confirmed the car involved was a Mercedes C220 Estate but said it is not known how many suspects were in the vehicle.

"Darren Humphries, 37, was jailed for eight weeks for throwing chocolate mini eggs at his estranged wife . An angry husband who assaulted his estranged wife by pelting her in the face with chocolate mini eggs has been jailed for eight weeks. Darren Humphries, 37, began throwing Cadbury Mini Eggs at wife Claire, 31, after drunkenly losing his temper on March 3. Magistrates heard he flipped when his partner of 14 years refused to allow him into her home to see their two children. Humphries forced the door open and grabbed his wife by the jaw causing her to fall back into the house. He then picked up a packet of the chocolate treats - which had been bought for Easter - and began throwing individual eggs at her head. JPs were told Mrs Humphries managed to call police and her husband was arrested at the property in Windermere Drive, Worcester. On Monday he was jailed for eight weeks at Worcester Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to assault by beating and using violence to secure entry to a premise. Humphries, of no fixed abode, launched a tirade of abuse and expletives directed at magistrates when the sentence was announced. Sentencing, chair of the bench, Sue Dowty, said: 'There were lots of aggravating factors. 'The location of the offence, the fact it was domestic violence, you were in drink and it was carried out in front of your children.' The court heard in a separate incident Humphries damaged his estranged wife's car by throwing wheelie bins at the vehicle on February 23. Prosecutor Mark Soper said the defendant had launched the bins after Mrs Humphries had refused to let him sleep inside her Volkswagen Golf. He told the court: 'The couple have been separated since February 2014 after 14 years together - they have two children, a 10-year-old boy and an 8-year-old girl. 'It seems Mr Humphries became mentally unwell and his wife decided the relationship should end. 'He had become very difficult to live with, using drugs and alcohol to self-medicate. Worcester Magistrates Court heard Humphries flipped when his partner of 14 years refused to allow him into her home to see their two children and began throwing Cadbury Mini Eggs after drunkenly losing his temper . 'This led to abusive and violent behaviour towards her and left her in fear of him. 'During the first incident he went to the home address. He was in drink and asked to be allowed to sleep in her car, but she did not allow him. 'He threw wheelie bins at the car and was arrested and charged with that offence. 'In the next incident he forced the door open and grabbed his wife by the jawbone causing her to fall into the house.' Mr Soper added: 'He was shouting at her and eventually released her, causing her further distress because she was in fear of him. 'Then he started throwing Cadbury Mini Eggs at her. 'She managed to call the police and the matters were admitted in interview.' Rob Macrory, defending, said: 'This behaviour is born totally out of frustration. 'He was driven by the emotion of wanting to see his children and he is generally so fed up in life. 'There are mental health difficulties but he does not believe he has a problem with alcohol. 'I would ask the court to consider that there were not extensive injuries to the victim and he only has a very short record.' Magistrates also imposed a restraining order preventing Humphries from contacting his estranged wife either 'directly or indirectly.' He was ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £85.","Darren Humphries threw mini eggs after drunkenly losing his temper .

"Violent: But Samuel Tushingham has been spared jail for attacking his girlfriend . A thug who repeatedly attacked his girlfriend and dragged her by the hair has been spared jail after a judge told him he was 'almost too dangerous' for prison. Samuel Tushingham dragged his partner out of bed, slapped her around the head and threw a toaster at her, a court was told. District judge Bridget Knight described the 26-year-old as a 'caveman' - but despite this ordered him to go on a relationship course instead of sentencing him to jail. After a trial at Halton Magistrates' Court, she told him: 'You acted like a caveman, dragging the victim by her hair and assaulting her over a period of months between April and September. 'You are almost too dangerous for me to send you to prison because you need work done on you. 'You will be on the course with other men and I hope you find it quite repulsive the excuses people give for beating a woman because there is no excuse for acting like this.' Tushingham, an advertising salesman from Wigan, was given a 26-week sentence suspended for 12 months, and ordered to attend a course called 'improving relations supporting change'. He must also carry out 80 hours of unpaid work and pay more than £1,300 in costs and fines, and is banned from contacting his victim. The judge who spared him jail previously told footballer Carlos Tevez it would be 'overly punitive' for him to hand over his £55,000 Porsche after he was convicted of a driving offence, and fined him £3,000 instead. Ms Knight also made headlines when she criticised Coronation Street star Barbara Knox for wasting court time by pleading not guilty to drink-driving and then admitting the offence at the last minute. Tushingham pleaded guilty to one charge of assault by beating, which took place in April last year when he kicked his then-partner in the thigh, causing a large bruise and knocking her off her feet at her home in Warrington, Cheshire. He was found guilty of another three assault charges which took place later in 2014. In June, Tushingham punched the victim twice in the leg, grabbed her hair and slapped her, causing her to fall over on an upturned plug and resulting in her having difficulty walking and sitting for several weeks. Court: Tushingham was given a suspended sentence at Halton Magistrates' Court, pictured . He also grabbed her by the hair and threw a toaster which hit her on the hip in a separate incident in July. In September, they travelled to stay with Tushingham's sister in Cambridge when the pair argued and he repeatedly slapped her round the head then dragged her out of bed by her hair, hitting her head against a radiator. Wendy Newton, prosecuting, said: 'The victim said that the reason she had not reported the incidents earlier was because she didn't think they were serious enough to waste police time with. 'But after speaking to her mother, she realised that the violence was getting worse.' Rachel Andrews, defending, said that Tushingham had struggled with alcohol and mental health problems, but now has a full-time job at a local newspaper and is also the drummer in a band.","Samuel Tushingham, 26, pulled his girlfriend by the hair and kicked her .

"The first dramatic footage of the Hatton Garden jewellery heist shows how the gang returned twice in three days to continue their audacious robbery  - as it is revealed police may have to pay out millions in compensation for ignoring the alarm. The six-strong gang dressed in high-vis jackets were captured on CCTV working throughout Thursday night having successfully broken into the basement of the building in the heart of London’s jewellery district. Shockingly, the footage reveals they returned again on Saturday - spending another eight hours cleaning out the jewels and cash left there for safekeeping. Scroll down for video . The Mirror has obtained the first pictures of the six-strong gang which raided Hatton Gardens last week . Images obtained by the Daily Mirror reveal the precise timings of the raid for the first time - as well as the fact they used wheelie bins to remove millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables from the safe. Scotland Yard tonight refused to confirm to MailOnline whether they had seen the footage before it was handed to them by the Mirror, but it is likely to place even more pressure on police already under fire for not responding to the alarm. The footage begins at 9.23pm – just four minutes after staff at the safety deposit centre lock up for the Easter weekend – as the first thief appears on camera carrying a black bin bag. It was unclear exactly where the cameras were situated, but at least one is aimed outside the building and shows a white van thought to be the getaway vehicle. Over the following four nights, half a dozen raiders are seen lugging heavy-duty tools, including massive bolt cutters and a red monkey wrench down to the secure vault. Each member of the gang is wearing builder’s overalls and high-visibility vests. At least one has a balaclava over his face, while others wear dust masks – but each one is partially reconisable. The first raider to appear has been dubbed Mr Ginger after the colour of his hair. Another, wearing a builder’s hat, has been referred to as Mr Strong and is seen carrying steel supports that may have been used for the diamond-tipped drill that police say cut through into the vault. The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The Tall Man – who wears an Adidas tracksuit – carries two red tools up and down the stairs. Another, dubbed the Old Man because of his grey hair, later appears to struggle for breath in the footage as he lugs bags from the vault. Two other raiders have been nicknamed The Gent, for his smart brown shoes, and Mr Montana because he is wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the word. Reports say that he has a shaved head, and possibly an earring in his left ear. At about 9.40pm the gang disappear into the building. At 7.52am on Good Friday, according to the footage, members of the gang can be seen again. The street camera captures the white Transit pull up to the alley. On Sunday, at around 6am, the gem thieves can be seen dragging heavy wheelie bins and several black bags back up the stairs. It has been reported these contained potentially millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables. The last trace of the raiders is recorded at 6.44am on Easter Sunday, when a white van pulls up and the gang load it with all the remaining equipment and disappear. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad, speaks to journalists outside Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd today following last weekend's burglary in London . Another suspect, riding a moped, may also be connected to the gang. The raid was not discovered until the following Tuesday . The thieves apparently thought they had covered all their bases when covering their footsteps, but had failed to realise they had missed the cameras. A source told the Mirror: 'This was clearly the work of a professional gang who planned this job down to every last detail. 'But they may have made a mistake in leaving this footage behind.' The footage came to light as Scotland Yard was forced to admit it did not respond to a burglar alarm triggered during the raid - which could make it liable for million in compensation. That failure to investigate immediately left the gang free to work uninterrupted over Easter and escape with gems and cash worth ‘millions and millions’ from 70 deposit boxes - as can clearly be seen in the video. Officers were informed that the warning had been triggered shortly after midnight on Good Friday. But they decided that the possibility of a burglary did not need immediate investigation. Instead, a private security guard is understood to have made a cursory check of the building. Last night, jewellers who rent boxes with the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd security firm accused the police of incompetence and threatened to sue them and the owners of the deposit company. One jeweller, a 63-year-old named Michael, said: ‘As far as I’m concerned the police have got a lot to answer for. Suing anyone is a last resort but it’s something I would consider.’ A gang of criminals broke into the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend . Another jeweller called Ryan, who runs a business with his father in Hatton Garden, added: ‘It is just unbelievable that they could ignore a call from an alarm company.’ The deposit firm has also faced criticism over the building’s ‘antiquated’ alarm system. Security expert Seamus Fahy, 47, said: ‘It was a well-planned heist, but the lack of modern technology made it a lot less difficult than it should have been.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required. We are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call. ‘It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident.’","CCTV images reveal how the six-strong gang worked through the night .

"They could be depicting the froth off a latte or frosted sea-glass washed ashore, but these unique photographs are actually the surreal moment ocean foam explodes in the air. Ocean photographer Lloyd Meudell started taking images of the sea with a GoPro after being an avid surfer his entire life. He formed an obsession with photography and after purchasing all the high end equipment, he began to shoot ocean foam, calling the venture 'foam surrealism.' 'When the tide is high, the water comes in and it breaks in front of cliffs, explodes into the air and creeps over the sand,' Mr Meudell told Daily Mail Australia. An Ocean photographer has captured the unique and surreal moment ocean foam hits the sand . 'When the tide is high, the water comes in and it breaks in front of cliffs, explodes into the air and creeps over the sand,' he said . 'Taking these sort of images is all I do apart from go to work.' Mr Meudell grew up on the south coast of New South Wales and takes most of his shots on Kiama beach spanning to Gerrigong beach. After receiving emails from potential buyers asking how they can purchase one of his prints, Mr Meudell started a website and he admits the purchasers are not what you'd expect. 'They are for anyone, from any country and it's not just people who love ocean photography that buy these pieces,' he said. 'I surprisingly have a lot of elderly ladies purchase my foam images.' The 40-year-old chooses his time wisely, often waking up at the crack of dawn to get the ultimate shot. 'The best time is always the morning or the evening because that's when you get the beautiful colours,' he said.' Although he has only been taking ocean photos for two years, Mr Meudell's shots draw from works of surrealism such as Salvador Dali and appear very dream-like. Mr Meudell  takes most of his shots on Kiama beach spanning to Gerrigong beach on the south coast of NSW .

Mr Meudell uses an EOS 5D Mark III DSLR and numerous lenses to achieve the remarkable shots but admits, as an artist, he regrettably cannot reveal his secrets. 'Through my Instagram and website, I get so many people asking me what shutter speed, ISO and aperture I use,' he said. 'And it's cool they want to do the same thing, but I got out there and did it myself, so that's what I advise others to do.' Mr Meudell instead advises budding photographers to familiarise themselves with how the ocean works before getting behind a lens. 'Spending time in the water and knowing how a wave breaks really helps with this kind of photography,' he said. 'Someone who has never surfed in their life won't pick it up as quick as someone who has spent their whole life surfing.' He also said to start with a GoPro due to their simplicity and build up to a DSLR. 'But on top of everything, make sure you're having fun.'","An Ocean photographer has captured the unique and surreal moment ocean foam hits the sand .

"Deep in rural South Africa, a terrifying white supremacist movement is brainwashing teenagers to rise up in defiance of Nelson Mandela's hard-fought dream of a Rainbow Nation. The far-right Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB) is training thousands of youths in military-style bootcamps northwest of Johannesburg to fight for a separate white state. By day, they are pushed to their physical limits with assault courses and self-defence lessons, all the while being told of the danger from 'the millions of blacks trying to kill you'. Then by night, they are subjected to vile racist indoctrination which many hoped had disappeared from South Africa for good. Scroll down for video . Indoctrinated: Teenagers take part in a military-style bootcamp run by the far-right Afrikaner Resistance Movement which is training and brainwashing them into taking up thecause of creating a separate white state . 'I don't have black friends': Dion Bernard, a 15-year-old nicknamed Sparky, has a gun placed against his head during self-defence lessons at the Afrikaner Resistance Movement camp near Johannesburg . For Dion Bernard, a 15-year-old boy enrolled on the latest camp, the seeds of old hatred are already cemented in his mind. 'In the Bible it says black people must live with black people and white people must live with white people,' he says. 'You cannot mix nations.  I don't have black friends. If they come to my side and ask to speak to me, I will say no. Or I will turn my back on them and walk away.' Dion comes from a deeply religious family, part of a small but determined minority of Afrikaner people who still yearn for apartheid-era politics. He is one more than 2,000 teenagers who have attend Kommando core, an AWB 'endurance' camp for white youngsters, over the last two years. Filmmakers followed their story for a controversial documentary called Fatherland by TIA Productions.

'So you have to implement certain systems to survive and that's why we say the only system we can go now for is not apartheid. That's second prize. First prize is freedom.'

"Schoolgirl killer Zbigniew Huminski (pictured) did not offer a word of remorse as he was indicted for kidnapping, raping and murdering a nine-year-old . Calais schoolgirl killer Zbigniew Huminski did not offer a word of remorse as he was formally charged with a range of crimes which are likely to see him jailed for life, prosecutors said today. The 38-year-old appeared before a judge on Friday night and was indicted for kidnapping, raping and murdering the nine-year-old identified solely by her first name of Chloe. Despite being banned from France for earlier offences, Zbigniew was on his way to England on Wednesday from Calais when he struck. A statement released by Boulogne prosecutors said: 'The investigating judge conducted his indictment for the following reasons: rape of a minor, kidnapping and murder. 'During his interrogation, the person in custody had admitted his involvement in the alleged crimes, but failed to state the reasons for his action.' Confirming that Huminski had been 'placed in custody in a regional prison', his lawyer Antoine Deguines said: 'He did not speak to the judge, as his right. 'I have not been able to speak much with him, he does not talk much and, it seems, is in shock over what happened. It's hard for him to address the facts'. Asked if Zbigniew had offered any remorse, Mr Deguines said: 'No, he is saying very little about anything.' It came as thousands prepared to take to the streets of Calais on Saturday to take part in a second 'White March' to pay tribute to Chloe, whose funeral will take place in the port city's St Peter's Church on Wednesday. Mr Deguines confirmed Huminski had been on his way to see his sister in Southampton when he 'stopped for a beer' in Calais, and then attacked Chloe while drunk. Huminski was supposed to be in prison in Poland - but he exploited his home country's lax justice system to travel to France instead. This picture was the last taken of nine-year-old Chloe at 2.31pm - she is seated in front of her family home. Relatives have put this photograph at the scene where she was kidnapped . The career criminal was sentenced to a year behind bars in March, but under the rules in Poland, he was supposed to take himself to jail. But he hit the road for France and, under the EU's free movement rules, there was nothing to stop him driving across Europe. Nine-year-old Chloe, seen in a last haunting photo posing with a carefree grin in the playground outside her home, was snatched as her terror-stricken mother tried helplessly to reach her. Huminski has confessed to strangling his nine-year-old victim, identified by her first name of Chloe (pictured) Before Isabelle Hyart could do anything, Huminski bundled Chloe into his car and drove her to woodland where he sexually assaulted and strangled her. Huminski has a long criminal record in France and Poland, including once attacking a frail woman of 78 with a knife in her home. He was convicted in France in April 2010, when has jailed for six years for aggravated assault, before being released early in March 2014, when he was deported to Warsaw. Ms Hyart, a mother of two other young children, said: 'I'm appalled, disgusted. I don't understand why he was in France. And why did he come to Calais? I don't understand how anyone could do that to a child of nine.' Ms Hyart said the brazen abduction happened in broad daylight on Wednesday when she left her daughter in the playground to pop back inside the flat to change her four-year-old son's clothing. Huminski, who is single, originally moved to France in the early 2000s, and worked as an odd-job man before attempting to join the Foreign Legion as a soldier. He was rejected because of his long criminal record in France and Poland. Natacha Bouchart, the Calais mayor, said: 'How could a foreigner with many previous convictions be allowed to move freely around Calais? There is a clear dysfunction in the way we keep track of repeat offenders.' Last summer, Alice Gross, 14, was murdered by a Latvian builder who moved to the UK after serving a prison sentence for killing his wife. Arnis Zalkalns, 41, spent seven years in jail in Latvia but was still allowed in to Britain without having his record checked. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for a full investigation in to Huminski's past, saying Chloe's family deserved the 'whole truth'. Christine Taubira, the justice minister, also demanded a 'complete, precise and rapid' investigation.' The little girl's naked body was found in the woods near Calais 90 minutes after she was taken .

"The Mamma Mia ballad Our Last Summer will feel even more poignant in the coming months as the Broadway show is set to end its 14 year long run in September. But it seems fans need not worry as there will soon be a restaurant inspired by the successful show, opened by ABBA star Bjorn Ulvaeus. The Mamma Mia inspired eatery will open its doors a block away from the ABBA museum in Stockholm. Mamma Mia here we go again! Fans of the long-running Broadway show need not worry as a new inspired restaurant is opening in Sweden . Bjorn Ulvaeus, of Swedish pop group ABBA, has unveiled his new musical project, a Mamma Mia inspired restaurant performance, set to open in January 2016 . Bjorn aims to transport the party atmosphere from theatre aisles to inside a Greek taverna. The venue is scheduled to open in January 2016, and is a part restaurant, part stage show and part role play, focusing on audience interaction. Of course audiences will be able to sing and dance to the Swedish sensations' 1970s tunes, to their hearts' content. 'They will be part of a little story in real time, which will be played out during the evening,' said 69-year-old Bjorn. The model reveals there will be olive trees, fountains and scents of Mediterranean. The restaurant is situated near the ABBA-museum in central Stockholm . The musical will include all the ABBA classics from the show, and a couple of ones not featured . The Swedish singer sent fans into a frenzy after revealing on a new website he was creating a 'new entertainment experiment' Fans will recognise the Greek-island setting, but will experience a slightly different story which will change night to night depending how the audience react. The play focuses on the Greek taverna called Nicos' Taverna owned by a man in his 50s and his slightly younger Swedish wife. If the concept proves to be a success Ulvaeus didn't rule out transferring it to other countries. 'I see actually no reason why not,' he said. 'So maybe if we find a good place in London, Hamburg or wherever, there will be a Nicos' Taverna as well.' Bjorn will transform a restaurant to a Greek tavern for guests, staff, musicians and artists. He hopes to create a party in an environment like the one from the island of Skopelos, where the movie Mamma Mia was filmed . Worldwide fans will be keen to see if this follows in the footsteps of the beloved show, which has grossed more than $600 million and been seen by over seven million people. The show opened two years after it first hit the stage in London in 1999, and has since been made into a blockbuster film starring Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Piers Brosnan and Colin Firth, to name a few. For years the show took in nearly $1 million a week at the box office, however sales have declined in more recent years, averaging half that amount. Ulvaeus said the three other members of ABBA — Benny Andersson, Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad — are not part of the restaurant venture but know about it 'and wish it well.' The show was made into a successful film with a A-list cast including Dominic Cooper and Amanda Seyfried .","The Broadway show is finishing after 14 years on stage .

"A Vietnam War veteran in Utah has said he's surprised over the reason for the denial of his request for a personalized license plate commemorating the year he was wounded and awarded a Purple Heart. Arnold Breitenbach of St. George wanted to get 'CIB-69' put on a license plate, the Spectrum newspaper of St. George reported.

"Facing trial: Adam Deacon (pictured outside court in January), 32, allegedly sent abusive tweets including a death threat to the Kidulthood writer . A Bafta-winning Kidulthood actor sent abusive tweets including a death threat to the film’s writer because he thought he was trying to ruin his career, a court heard today. Adam Deacon, 32, of Bethnal Green, east London, appeared in court this morning over allegations of harassment against the 2006 movie’s writer Noel Clarke on Twitter.

Tom Gill, prosecuting, said: ‘He [Deacon] referred to Mr Clarke as a bully and blamed him for trying to ruin his career. Mr Clarke said that in 2010 he viewed Mr Deacon as a friend and after this point they fell out over work.’ Referring to the Twitter posts directed at Mr Clarke’s account, he added: ‘In some cases they amounted to some death threats.’ The court heard how ‘Mr Clarke provided screenshots of the posts to the police’. Mr Gill added: ‘On December 4 he was given an official formal harassment warning by police and this was delivered in person. Despite this he continued to post messages to Mr Clarke.’ Last month the actor was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after being charged with possession of a machete in public. Police were called on January 6 to reports of a man in Bethnal Green allegedly armed with a ‘machete’ style knife and threatening members of the public.

Towards the end of the hearing, Deacon asked magistrate Anne Elias if it was possible to move the date of the trial closer. He said: ‘When I do acting they won’t insure me until the trial is done. I’ve lost out on a lot of work because of it.’ After consulting with other members of the bench, she replied: ‘I’m afraid we’re stuck with that date, we do accept it’s not ideal for you.

I do need to warn you that if you fail to attend on that date at that time that there may be a further charge against you for which you can be imprisoned. In the mean time you are on conditional bail.’ The magistrate added that Deacon - who stood in the dock - was ‘not to contact Mr Clarke or incite any of his family or friends, not to put anything on social media that is related to him.’ She said that he is ‘not to enter Kensington and Chelsea and to continue to live and sleep at the address that you have given to the court’.

"Father Hamish Baillie (pictured) claims Lord Janner abused him during a game of hide-and-seek in 1983 . A father allegedly abused by Lord Janner has called for the top legal official who decided against prosecuting him to step down. Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, concluded dementia made the 86-year-old unfit to plead. Last night, one of the nine victims who had been lined up to give evidence against the former Leicester West MP waived his right to anonymity to say the decision ‘beggars belief’ – and claimed it points to an establishment cover-up. Hamish Baillie, 47, said he was unable to trust adults after being molested by Lord Janner during a game of hide-and-seek in a park, when he was a 15-year-old resident of a children’s home. But he added that the failure to prosecute the peer for a fourth time – three inquiries were curtailed by police or the Crown Prosecution Service – was a ‘complete travesty’. The father-of-three said he turned to drugs as a result of the abuse, which left him ‘questioning myself and everyone around me’. He believes Lord Janner was ‘steered’ in his direction by the care home’s manager, Frank Beck – a friend who would later be convicted of a string of child sex offences. He added: ‘I don’t think anybody other than the victims and the police involved in the Operation Enamel inquiry understand how perverted a man Lord Janner is. 'He has blighted my life … How can they [the CPS] publicise the fact that there was enough evidence to charge, yet then say it is not in the public interest to pursue it?’ Mr Baillie, of Hinckley, Leicestershire, added: ‘No disrespect to the public, but what about the interest of the victims? ‘As far as I’m concerned, her [Mrs Saunders’s] actions are barely any less perverse than the abuse inflicted upon me as a teenager. She should initiate an inquiry into her own conduct and then step down because Alison Saunders certainly hasn’t been doing her job properly.’ Mr Baillie said the decision not to prosecute Lord Janner (left),  who he claims abused him when he was aged 15,  for the fourth time was a 'complete travesty'. Alison Saunders (right) said her job as head of the Crown Prosecution Service was to make the correct legal decisions in difficult cases, not the most popular ones . He said the police involved in the inquiry were ‘blameless’ but added that ‘when one considers this is the fourth time Janner has been investigated, I honestly think there could be a cover-up at play’. Operation Enamel was set up two years ago and 25 victims accused the Labour peer. Most lived in Leicestershire children’s homes between 1969 and 1988. The CPS last week said the ‘core allegation’ was that Lord Janner befriended Beck to access children ‘to allow him to perpetrate serious sexual offences’ on them. The politician was first implicated during the 1991 trial of Beck, who ran The Beeches children’s home in Leicester. A victim told the court Janner regularly abused him. Beck was convicted of child abuse and rape charges. He died in jail in 1994. Following Beck’s conviction, Lord Janner, then an MP, stood up in the House of Commons to vehemently deny any abuse, and the CPS decided not to take further action. But Mr Baillie, who spent ten months at The Beeches – where he was twice groped by Beck – said he firmly believes the men were acting together to abuse children. He was placed in care aged 15 for ‘rebellious behaviour’ and said he met Lord Janner in 1983 while playing arcade games at Leicester Forest East service station. The peer called him by name, he said, even though ‘I didn’t know him’ and gave him some coins. Mr Baillie said over the next seven months Lord Janner came to the service station seven times, sometimes discussing a hotel where they could go for ‘steak and whisky’. It was amid a game of hide-and-seek in Bradgate Park, Leicestershire, organised by Beck later that year, that he claims he was abused by the peer. ‘I was just moving behind a gorse bush to hide when I saw Greville Janner walking towards me,’ he said. ‘He sat down beside me … Then he abused me. It was indecent touching but he wanted it to go further … It lasted no more than 30 minutes, but it felt like an eternity.’ Mr Baillie believes Beck ‘tipped Janner off about where to find me’. He did not report the abuse to police and only realised who Lord Janner was when he saw the MP’s picture in a newspaper five years later. He added: ‘The fact that Greville Janner has been able to stand up in Parliament and deny abusing children, then carry on with his gilded life is beyond comprehension.’ Legal chief facing growing calls to quit: Backlash against top prosecutor grows as she is accused of ignoring victims and claims of a establishment cover-up . The furious backlash against the UK’s top prosecutor intensified last night over her decision to spare Lord Janner from the dock. The position of Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders looked increasingly fragile as she faced growing calls to stand down. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs accused her of ignoring the rights of victims and failing to clear the stench of an Establishment cover-up that lingers over the case. And even her one of her predecessors said the horrific allegations should have been resolved in the ‘full public glare of a courtroom’ rather than her London office. Mrs Saunders fought back saying it is her job as the head of the Crown Prosecution Service to make ‘very difficult decisions’ which are not necessarily popular. Campaigners, police chiefs and MPs have accused Alison Saunders, the director of the CPS (above), of ignoring the rights of victims and failing to clear the stench of an Establishment cover-up that lingers overhead . But the row showed no sign of abating as further details of the claims levelled against the 86-year-old Labour life Peer were made public. The decision not to charge Lord Janner last week despite evidence of 22 offences against nine victims was justified because Mrs Saunders said experts agreed that the former Leicester West MP was in such poor health due to advanced Alzheimer’s Disease. But she also ruled that he should have been charged three times before in 1991, 2002 and 2007 but was left off the hook. The top QC blamed police and prosecutors and launched in independent review, but her comments stoked fears that Lord Janner is the beneficiary of a wholesale cover-up. Yesterday, calls were growing for a judicial review of her decision, something which Leicestershire Police has said it is already considering. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who exposed Cyril Smith, said the weight of criticism against Mrs Saunders suggested something has ‘clearly gone very badly wrong’. He said: ‘Mrs Saunders is now seen as a roadblock to justice and it’s hard to see how her position remains tenable.’ Criticism of Mrs Saunders began with comments from the Home Secretary, who has already been lobbied by senior police chiefs, when she said is ‘very concerned’. Theresa May said: ‘I have been very clear in everything I have said so far about the child sex abuse issue – I expect to see justice done.’ She was joined by former Director of Public Prosecutions Lord Macdonald who said a ‘trial of the facts’ should have been considered. This would have enabled a jury to decide the facts without apportioning guilt and without a sentence being passed – offering a chance for victims to be heard. Lord Macdonald said: ‘It might have been wiser for the CPS to say ‘we’re going to have this matter resolved in the full public glare of a courtroom rather than simply by the DPP.’ Further questions also emerged about the true state of Lord Janner’s health as it was revealed he wrote to the House of Lords just a fortnight ago to extend his role. The politician, who has claimed tens of thousands of pounds in expenses in recent years, took a formal leave of absence last October. When asked if he would consider retiring when the election was called, he responded in a personally signed letter received on April 9 asking to continue in office. Experts said victims may now be denied the opportunity to sue Lord Janner because none of the claims have been proven. Richard Kovalevsky QC said: ‘A finding that the acts took place may have consequences for the defendant, particularly one who has the benefit of an honour from the Queen.’ Mrs Saunders has also come under fire over other high-profile cases, including the first disastrous attempt for a conviction for female genital mutilation and the pursuit of journalists.","Hamish Baillie says Lord Janner abused him during hide-and-seek in 1983 .

"He's the mysterious young soldier who is referred to by WWI historians simply as the 'Handsome Man'. But the unknown digger has been drawn into the centre of an Anzac Day controversy after his image was used to front Woolworths' 'Fresh in our memories' ad campaign, which has been slammed for commercialising the centenary of Anzac and forcibly shut down by the government. Little is known about the man pictured wearing a uniform and slouch hat. He was a soldier of the First Australian Imperial Force, and his photograph was taken sometime between 1915 and 1918 in Sydney, before he embarked for service. Scroll down for video . A mysterious young soldier known as the 'Handsome Man' has been drawn into the centre of an Anzac Day controversy after his image was used to front Woolworths' 'Fresh in our memories' ad campaign . The studio portrait of the Handsome Man was featured in a 2008 Australian War Memorial (AWM) exhibition titled Icon and Archive, with the AWM appealing to the public to help identify him. Since then the AWM received a lot of responses from people with possible identifications but none have been correct. Last week, Woolworths launched its 'Fresh in our Memories' campaign and website, which attracted a barrage of criticism from customers accusing the company of trying to cash in on Anzac Day. The campaign invites Aussies to create a profile picture and cover photo for their Facebook page, in memory of the service men and women of World War I, complete with the Woolworths logo and a 'Fresh in our memories' slogan. In February this year, the advertising agency hired by Woolworths to create their Anzac campaign - Carrspace - contacted the AWM asking for images of soldiers. The AWM said it gave the company four image options, including three different soldiers and a nurse. But Carrspace chose instead to use the striking image of the Handsome Man, without seeking permission. A recent online campaign led by Woolworths has caused outrage among customers who have accused the supermarket giant for cashing in on Anzac Day . The campaign invites Aussies to create a profile picture and cover photo for their Facebook page, in memory of the service men and women of World War I, complete with the Woolworths logo . An AWM spokesman said: 'The terms and conditions provided to anyone using Memorial images specifies that images are not to be cropped, overprinted or altered in any way without the prior written approval of the Memorial. 'The agency has not provided the final images and product to the Memorial for its approval before publication which is in breach of these terms and conditions.' The AWM spokesman added that Carrspace claimed to be working on a campaign in conjunction with Camp Gallipoli and the Returned Services League. But RSL chief Sam Jackson told Daily Mail Australia the organisation was not consulted over the campaign, and Camp Gallipoli chief Chris Fox said he had never heard of Carrspace and had no association with them. Woolworths and Carrspace also failed to seek permission from the Department of Veterans' Affairs to use the word 'Anzac' for commercial purposes, as is required by law. The company could face fines of up to $50,000 for breaching this rule. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has slammed Woolworths for its unauthorised use of the word 'Anzac' A Carrspace spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that all inquiries must go through Woolworths. Earlier on Tuesday the company took down and then reactivated its Twitter account. It also deleted information about its partnership with Woolworths from the company website. A Woolworths spokesman said the company was standing by a statement released on Tuesday night when the 'Fresh in our memories' website was taken down. Minister for Veterans' Affairs Michael Ronaldson slammed Woolworths for its unauthorised use of the word 'Anzac' in an ad and said he forced the company to take the website down. 'The Australian community quite rightly expects that the word ""Anzac"" is not trivialised or used inappropriately and as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I am responsible for ensuring that any use of the word ""Anzac"" does not provide commercial benefit to an organisation,' Minister Ronaldson said. 'In this instance, permission was not sought by the campaign proponents, nor would it have been approved.' 'Fresh in our Memories' was launched last week in the lead up to the centenary marking the landing at Gallipoli . Those who are unimpressed by the campaign have branded it as 'disrespectful' and 'disgusting' while others also posted their own versions of the Woolworths generated images . Minister Ronaldson became aware of it when consumers branded the website 'disrespectful' and 'disgusting'. 'While I acknowledge that Woolworths moved quickly to address the situation, I hope this is a reminder to others that the regulations are in place for good reason and that they will be rigorously enforced,' he said. RSL chief Sam Jackman said the organisation was not consulted over the campaign by Woolworths or Carrspace, adding that she was concerned over the commercialisation of anything to do with Anzac Day. 'They made an error of judgement in using it in the first place and they recognised that pretty quickly,' Mrs Jackman said. She added that the supermarket had been a longstanding financial supporter of veterans' organisations. Camp Gallipoli chief Chris Fox said Woolworths is the principle sponsor of the RSL ANZAC Flame for Camp Gallipoli events this year, which will be held around Australia and New Zealand on April 24 and 25 and will see members of the public camp out to honour the 100th anniversary of Gallipoli. The supermarket's campaign backfired with customers taking to Facebook and Twitter to vent their anger . The supermarket has been inundated with comments like the one pictured on social media . Mr Fox said his not-for-profit organisation had no association with Carrspace, but would continue to work with Woolworths in the future. ‘We’re proud of anyone that stands up as a corporate and supports serving personnel and the RSL and initiatives like Camp Gallipoli,’ he said. ‘It’s just unfortunate that this piece of advertising has crossed the line, it’s quite a disappointing thing to see.’ A spokeswoman for Woolworths told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday night that 'Fresh in our Memories' was not a marketing strategy. 'It is a website designed in consultation with the RSL for people to share their photos, stories and memories,' she said. 'As one of Australia's largest employers, Woolworths has spent months collecting stories from our staff for the site. All profits from the sale of merchandise on the site goes to the RSL. Twitter was flooded with memes of the Woolworths campaign. Pictured is Prime Minister Tony Abbott . A photo of former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd has also been used in the Wooloworths Anzac Day campaign . 'We are proud to support the RSL and our diggers. Like all Australians, we pay our respects to service people past and present. 'Our small logo on the site is in line with other corporately sponsored Centenary of ANZAC activity.' The spokeswoman later confirmed the website had been taken down. 'The site was developed to give our staff and customers a place to put their stories to mark the Centenary of ANZAC,' she said. 'We regret that our branding on the picture generator has caused offense, this was clearly never our intention. Like many heritage Australian companies, we were marking our respect for ANZAC and our veterans. 'We continue to be proud supporters of the RSL and Camp Gallipoli in this important year and look forward to working with them into the future.' Mrs Jackson said the RSL was not consulted about the campaign. Woolworths refused to provide any comment in addition to its original statement. Other consumers got creative and posted their own versions of the Woolworths generated images .","The Woolworths 'Fresh in our Memories' campaign launched last week .

"Police in Western Australia  have come under fire after reports emerged that hundreds of officers unlawfully accessed information relating to the arrest of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins. Officers also reportedly accessed files containing information about Daniel Kerr, a fellow former West Coast Eagles player, according to The West Australian. The pair both made headlines in recent months, for different incidents, and according to the publication at least 300 police accessed the files. Acting Commissioner of West Australian Police, Stephen Brown confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an internal investigation is underway relating to access, but would not confirm or make comment about the people whose records had been accessed. Police in Western Australia have come under fire after reports emerged that hundreds of officers unlawfully accessed information relating to the arrests of fallen AFL star Ben Cousins (pictured on April 9) 'I can confirm that WA Police are currently investigating accesses, by a large number of police employees, to the records of high profile persons within our internal computer systems,' Commissioner Brown said in a statement. 'The focus of the investigation will be to determine if the accesses were justified having regard to the work role of each officer. This process will take some weeks, if not months, to complete. Allegations will be investigated under Section 440A of the Criminal Code, which states police officers face up to 12 months in prison or a $12,000 fine for unauthorised computer usage. 'The disappointing thing from my view is that the behaviour of these personnel has triggered a series of resource intensive internal investigations which will likely have criminal and/or internal disciplinary outcomes,' Mr Brown said. The disgraced football player (pictured during his career) was arrested three times in two weeks in March, and another warrant was issued for his arrest in April when he failed to front court . Cousins, pictured here in handcuffs arriving at court earlier in April, has a well-documented and public battle with methamphetamine . 'I suspect that the investigation will find that the majority of the accesses will have stemmed from mere curiosity, however this will not be known for sure until we undertake the investigation,' he added. In light of the incident the Acting Commissioner also assured West Australians that their information was safe. 'The community can rest assured that we hold their information in high regard and will conduct investigations into all suspected access breaches of our computer systems.' However the WA Police Union has reacted negatively to the news of an investigation, with president George Tilbury telling The West Australian officers had done nothing wrong. He said they exhibited 'professional curiosity' and added 'there is no suggestion in these cases of any corruption'. Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events . Cousins was spotted climbing onto the roof of a two-storey home in Perth earlier this month . Footage also emerged showing Cousins running through the streets away from police . Ben Cousins was arrested three times in two weeks at the end of March, following a slew of erratic events. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media. The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. On April 8 when Cousins failed to front court on the driving charges a warrant for his arrest was issued. The next day the Perth-based former AFL star surrendered himself at Fremantle Police Station.","WA Police have come under fire for allegedly accessing Ben Cousin's files .

"The pound has slipped to a five-year low against the dollar amid growing uncertainty about the outcome of the general election. But the pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 - just after the last election when no party secured a majority. Different polls have variously put the Tories and Labour narrowly ahead, with David Cameron and Ed Miliband both facing the prospect of having to rely on smaller parties to form a government. The pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 - just after the last election when no party secured a majority . Experts have warned of the impact on the economy of a badly hung parliament, with neither major party able to form a stable government. There are fears it could sent pound plummeting by another 10 per cent. Today’s fall in the value of the pound was also impacted by figures showing industrial production grew by just 0.1 per cent in February. Construction shrank by 0.9 per cent following a 2.5 per cent contraction in January. It was suggested that the figures pointed to overall growth slowing to 0.4 per cent for the first quarter, down from 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2014. That would be the weakest pace of growth since the end of 2013. Labour have made gains in a series of opinion polls, enjoying leads in three and cutting the Conservative lead in another. The latest survey also contains good news for the Liberal Democrats who gain three points to draw level with Ukip for the first time in more than 18 months. Based on the 2010 election result, David Cameron needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the Commons, while Ed Miliband needs at least  70. Nick Clegg is defending 56 seats, but is braced for heavy losses . ComRes research for ITV and the Daily Mail suggested the race was still too tight to call with the Tories on 34 per cent and Labour on 33 per cent, but that compared with a four-point deficit for Ed Miliband's Opposition at the start of the campaign. Other polls gave Labour leads of between three and six points and one suggested that for the first time voters thought Ed Miliband was doing a better job than David Cameron. The Opposition gained two points on last week in the Survation poll for the Mirror, while the Conservatives dipped one, to move ahead by 35 per cent to 31 per cent. The Labour leader - despite still trailing his Tory rival as the best to be prime minister by 37 per cent to 25 per cent - will be delighted at their latest personal approval ratings after lagging consistently behind throughout most of his leadership. A hard-hitting report by BlackRock, the largest fund manager in the world, said last week that ‘a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine’ given Labour’s anti-business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’ s membership of the European Union. ‘Labour would be tough on business – and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility,’ the US giant said in the report. ‘A Conservatives-dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK’s EU membership. ‘Whoever wins – and the result could take some time to emerge – will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered-down legislation.’ BlackRock, which invests in major British companies such as Tesco, said weeks of horse-trading to form a government would be ‘harrowing for the UK’.","Pound near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 .

"A teenager with a deadly brain tumour must raise $80,000 by Tuesday night in order to pay for his life-saving surgery. Jackson Byrnes from  Northern New South Wales was told by doctors that he had a stage four brain tumour that was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. The 18-year-old and his family then took matters into their own hands and found the only Australian neurosurgeon to perform the risky operation. After seven days of desperate campaigning through Facebook and the crowd funding page GoFundMe, the Casino teenager is over halfway to his goal with $47,000 being raised. A teenager with a deadly brain tumour must raise $80,000 by Tuesday night in order to pay for his surgery . After a week of campaigning online, the Casino teenager is over halfway to his goal with two days to go . According to the Gold Coast Bulletin, Mr Byrnes' girlfriend, Jahnae Jackson, noticed he had developed a limp a mere three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI. He was rushed to the Gold Coast for a biopsy which found a stage four tumour buried deep in the teenager's brain. Mr Byrnes was told they would not operate due to how deep the cancer was, but instead suggested chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Knowing that this was not enough, Mr Byrnes and his family searched for a specialist who would perform the dangerous procedure. They found neurosurgeon Charlie Teo who would operate on Wednesday as long as he received an upfront payment of $80,000 by Tuesday evening. The family then turned to social media and crowd sourcing in a desperate plea for donations. 'Most boys his age begin their journey into adulthood with hopes , dreams and anticipation of what lies ahead and excitement of the endless opportunities of what life will bring them,' Mr Byrne's fundraising page on GoFundMe reads. Messages of support and promotion of the cause have flooded social media for the Casino teenager . The donations have more than doubled since yesterday with over $47,000 being donated to GoFundMe .

"The mother of murdered schoolgirl April Jones has revealed she receives hate mail blaming her for the killing of her five-year-old. Coral Jones, 43, whose daughter was snatched from outside her home in Machynlleth, Powys, had letters demanding her other children be taken into care. She was branded a 'bad mother' for allowing April to play in the street past 7pm where she was abducted and killed by paedophile Mark Bridger. Scroll down for video . Coral Jones, pictured with her husband, Paul, 46, has revealed she has been sent hate mail blaming her for the murder of her five-year-old daughter April and demanding her other children are taken into care . Mrs Jones said: 'We had a letter with no name on it and no address to write to, saying I was a bad mother and it was my fault and I shouldn't have my other children with me. 'Yes, I blame myself every day for it but unless they live in my shoes they have no right to tell me I am a bad mother.' She admitted that she blames herself for letting April stay out on her bike 'for an extra 15 minutes' after getting a good school report that day in October 2012. Bridger, 49, who took her to his cottage nearby and killed her, was jailed for life in 2013 but despite the largest police search in British history her body has never been recovered. April Jones, left, was abducted from outside her home by Mark Bridger, right, who was jailed for life in 2013 . Mrs Jones and husband Paul, 46, told BBC Wales programme Week In Week Out they have battled to live a normal life for their two children Jazmin, 19, and Harley, 12, after the tragedy. Since the loss of her daughter, Mrs Jones has suffered from agroraphobia and will not leave the house on her own. Mr Jones said: 'It is not often she will go anywhere on her own. Even just to pop down the shops one of the kids will go with her or I will go with her or she will call a friend.' Mrs Jones added: 'I get frightened and feel unsafe that people come up to me. I know they mean no harm but when people come up to me and I am feeling frightened, I can't cope.' She admitted that the only place in her town she feels comfortable is April's favourite local sweet shop. 'He [Bridger] didn't just take April away from us - he took her away from the town,' she said. 'I shouldn't be like this because of him but I cannot help it.' April's older sister Jazmin explained her family were still struggling to come to terms with her murder. The family has said they have struggled to come to terms with April's death. Coral and Paul Jones are pictured with their eldest daughter, Jazmin, 19, (left) and 13-year-old Harley (second left) She said: 'One day I could be really happy and Dad could be really upset and we would argue, we would shout at each other. We would want to hit someone or something just to get the anger out.' The Jones' have launched a campaign to highlight the growing problem of internet abuse after their daughter's killer was found to have accessed child abuse images online hours before her death. Mr Jones told the BBC he thought part of preventing the issue rested with potential offenders, who should identify themselves to authorities to get support. He said: 'If you have got the notion that you like kids like that or anything like that, if you go and ask for help then you deserve a chance. But if you don't ask for help and you commit a crime then you are a paedophile.'

"Criticised: Rona Fairhead will stand down as director of HSBC while continuing role at BBC . The chairman of the BBC Trust will quit her role as a director at HSBC, it was reported last night. Rona Fairhead was last month accused of being either ‘incredibly naive or totally incompetent’ by Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, over her handling of a tax evasion scandal at the bank’s Swiss division. Now, the 53-year-old has told shareholders she will stay on for ‘a further one-year period’ before leaving the bank’s board entirely, according to The Times. She announced her departure in a letter to shareholders dated on March 20. It marks a change in position for the bank, which said in its annual report that Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She had been on the board since 2004. Last night, HSBC insisted that ‘no decision has been taken at this time’. In a bruising encounter, Labour MP Mrs Hodge had told the BBC chief: ‘You should think about resigning. If not, the Government should sack you.’ Mrs Fairhead chaired HSBC’s audit committee and then its risk committee while its Swiss clients are said to have dodged tax. The bank was subsequently fined £1.2 billion for breaching American money-laundering laws. Last year, Mrs Fairhead earned more than £500,000 last year as chairwoman of HSBC’s American business. Her decision marks a change from February, when HSBC’s annual report said that despite having been on the board since 2004, Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She was appionted to her role as chairwoman of the BBC Trust in October last year for a five-year term. Mrs Fairhead suggested that ‘frontline’ staff should bear responsibility for breaching the bank’s policies, during her grilling by the public accounts committee. She said: ‘We were horrified when we discovered (what happened). I can assure you absolutely no evidence of tax evasion was received. I could only respond to evidence that I had and I could only deal with that.’ But Mrs Hodge responded that to ‘simply take the evidence and not question. . . would mean she is not fit for purpose’. Under fire: Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee (left), called on Fairhead to quit or be sacked from BBC role over her HSBC role . Her likely departure from HSBC comes as the bank is planning for a wider clearout of non-executives who have been on the board for a long period of time.","Criticised over 'incompetent' handling of bank's tax evasion scandal .

"'The General': Mohammed Suleman Khan, 43, was sent to prison for four years last April but faces ten more years if he does not pay back £2.2m . A jailed tax fraudster who hid his wealth in the UK while building an estate  in Pakistan modelled on Buckingham Palace must pay back £2.2million within six months or face a  ten more years in jail. Mohammed Suleman Khan, 43, was sent to prison for  four years last April after defrauding the taxman of £450,000. His nine-year scam was exposed after police raided his Birmingham home and discovered plans for his own mansion in Pakistan, complete with library, cinema and servant quarters. Serving inmate Khan faced a proceeds of crime hearing at Liverpool Crown Court last week and was ordered to pay £2.2million within six months. If he fails to hand over the cash he faces a further ten years in prison. The tax fraudster had contested the order, brought by West Midlands Police and prosecuted at court by Andrew Smith QC. Judge Andrew Menary QC presided over the week-long case, which heard details of Khan's complicated financial affairs. The original tax fraud court case heard how he had lived in a gated £500,000 house in Moseley and drove a BMW, but had no obvious job. His family home belonged to relatives and only small amounts of money went through his bank accounts. Yet while he was careful to avoid showing trappings of wealth in the UK, detectives from West Midlands Police's Force CID discovered he had secretly paid for the £2.3million mansion to be built in Pakistan. In court his defence team portrayed him as a legitimate businessman who had earned around £400,000 over the nine-year period from debt collecting and other business interests in the UK and abroad. But police found no evidence of a legitimate debt collecting company and their investigation proved he had netted more than £1million during that period, without paying the required tax and National Insurance. Inspiration: Khan built himself a vast estate in Pakistan, left, inspired by Buckingham Palace, right . A search of Khan's Birmingham home after his arrest uncovered plans for the 'palace' in the Attock region of Pakistan. The outer shell and roof of the building had been completed by Khan at a cost of £893,000. Once finished, the property would have been valued at £2.3 million. Khan was known in criminal circles as 'The General' and his prosecution sent shockwaves around Birmingham's criminal fraternity, who had held him up to near 'mythical' status. One gangland source said: 'In recent years he was said to have turned religious but this man was still feared and his dealings and movements were shrouded in mystery. 'Not many people had even ever set eyes on him. He had this kind of mythical status where people only spoke his name in hushed tones. Most people referred to him simply as 'The General' which gave an indication of the kind of status he had in the community.' A police source close to the investigation into the unsolved murder of of Tony Yaqub in Birmingham in 2004 said: 'Khan was arrested after returning to Birmingham from Pakistan a few days after the murder and he was questioned at length'. Khan was later released without charge. An appeal was later made on the BBC’s Crimewatch programme but Mr Yaqub’s killers have continued to evade police and no motive for his murder has ever been revealed by police.","Mohammed Suleman Khan lived extravagant lifestyle without a job .

"A leading hospital has slashed cases of a deadly infection that can kill newborn babies – by defying national guidelines to offer all pregnant women a simple screening test. Government officials have repeatedly insisted there is no evidence to support universal screening for Group B Strep, known as GBS. This is despite the fact it is carried by one in four women and infects as many as 400 newborns in the UK every year. One in ten will die. Current guidelines only recommend testing women deemed to be 'at risk'. Scroll down for video . Belinda Bowman, 37, lost her daughter Lily after she contracted GBS during labour and developed meningitis and septicaemia. She was just three days old . But a programme which offered screening to all expectant women at Northwick Park NHS hospital in North-West London resulted in not a single case of the bacteria spreading to infants among those who were tested and subsequently treated with antibiotics. The only recorded cases during the 12-month programme affected babies of women who had not agreed to be tested. Crucially, clinicians noted that half of the women who tested positive for GBS would not have been classified as 'at risk' under the current guidelines – so their babies would not have been protected. The UK National Screening Committee carried out a review in 2012 in collaboration with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Midwives and NHS England. It concluded that not all women who test positive for GBS will go on to develop the infection or pass it on to their babies, so blanket screening would mean pregnant women would be unnecessarily given antibiotics, which carry their own risks to the foetus. Some studies link antibiotics used in pregnancy and labour to obesity and asthma. In premature babies an increased risk of cerebral palsy has been associated with use of some antibiotics in labour. Yet these results confound the decision, prompting calls for the Government to introduce universal testing for pregnant women during standard ante-natal appointments, as is the case in Germany, France and the US. A programme which offered screening to all expectant women at Northwick Park NHS hospital in North-West London resulted in not a single case of the bacteria spreading to infants among those who were tested . Jane Plumb, chief executive of the charity Group B Strep Support, said: 'The risk-based strategy has failed to reduce the rate of GBS infection, and these findings contradict the party line that the risks of screening every woman would outweigh the benefits.' The consultant microbiologist who introduced the screening programme at Northwick Park, Dr Guduru Gopal Rao, said: 'There was a substantial burden of infection in our local community which was not being prevented by the national guidelines. 'Our work shows that GBS screening of all expectant mothers can work and is likely to be more effective than the current risk based approach.' Dr Richard Nicholl, consultant neonatal paediatrician at London North West Healthcare NHS Trust, said he had seen more than 100 babies with GBS in 20 years. He said: 'It can lead to serious illness and high mortality rates so it is much better to prevent the infection, rather than attempt to treat it. 'Since we began our comprehensive screening programme, I have not seen a new case in the babies of the mothers we have screened.' The makers of a new style of leggings claim they will reduce the appearance of cellulite in just 30 days, thanks to the garment's 'dimple-destroying' crystal technology. The Crystal Smooth Anti-Cellulite leggings are made from a fibre woven with bio-active crystals, which absorb body heat to stimulate blood flow and lymphatic drainage. GBS is the most common cause of infection in newborn babies in the UK. Harmless when carried by women, it can prove fatal to babies who contract it when passing through the birth canal. Many develop meningitis and septicaemia and, if they survive, can be left with life-altering disabilities. Known as the enhanced culture method, the test simply involves taking a swab from the woman. It would cost the NHS approximately £11 per patient. Belinda Bowman, 37, lost her daughter Lily after she contracted GBS during labour and developed meningitis and septicaemia. She was just three days old. Belinda, who has three older children, had asked a midwife for a GBS test when she went to be induced at St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, in May 2013 after noticing some unusual discharge. But she was told it was 'not standard practice' and there was 'no reason' to give her test. Mrs Bowman said: 'What hurts most is that Lily's death was entirely preventable.' Mrs Bowman is now involved in a legal battle with the hospital over claims that staff repeatedly failed to spot how seriously ill Lily was after her birth. She is being represented by law firm Leigh Day. Bond girl Naomie's on a fitness mission . She's the British Bond girl with a body to die for.

"The inventor called it the Baird Televisor and, although most people scoffed, he believed it had potential. And, notwithstanding a few improvements to the original down the years, it seems Scotsman John Logie Baird was on to something. Now one of the earliest 'Televisors' – dating from a time when few could see any possible use for the machine – is expected to fetch up to £22,000 at auction. Early model: The picture appeared in the opening on the right - the TV is now being sold at an auction . It was manufactured in 1928 - two years after Logie Baird (pictured) first demonstrated a working TV system . This forerunner of the television was manufactured in 1928 – two years after Logie Baird first demonstrated a working TV system – and has the serial number 258. The wooden set has a spiral punched scanning disc which has been fully restored and still has its original tube. That is not to say it is capable of picking up Sky or BBC channels – even with a set-top box. However, the television, built as an item of furniture for well-to-do families with deep pockets, represents a key milestone in the birth of modern mass media. It is being auctioned off as part of a speciality telecommunications sale by Auction Team Breker in Cologne, Germany. The lot is one of the highlights of the Milestones of Telecommunication sale on Saturday – and, fittingly, it uses the type of technology pioneered by men like Logie Baird that will allow bidders to take part in the auction live from anywhere in the world. Smart TV: The Televisor has been restored - it was built as an item of furniture for well-to-do families . The Televisor was the first receiver sold in Britain. Around 1,000 were made by English company Plessey and cost about £26 – a four-figure sum today. The poor quality picture was tiny – little bigger than a postage stamp – and it was impossible for more than one person to see it at a time. A rotating aluminium disk with square pinholes 'scanned' light from a neon lamp, which varied in brightness depending on the information transmitted by the TV station. Also going under the hammer are the first fax machine and a prototype colour television set. In January 1926, Helensburgh-born Logie Baird demonstrated a viable television system before 50 scientists using mechanical picture scanning with electronic amplification at the transmitter and receiver. The image could be sent by radio or over ordinary telephone lines, leading to the historic transatlantic transmissions of television from London to New York in February 1928. That year he also achieved the first television transmission to a ship in mid-Atlantic. In 2011, a 1936 set by Logie Baird – bought for almost £100 three weeks after transmissions began – sold at Bonhams for £16,800. The machine had a 12-inch screen contained in a walnut and mahogany case, with the picture being reflected onto a mirror that opened from the top.","One of the earliest Televisors is expected to fetch up to £22k at auction .

"Crash: Today's catastrophic Bloomberg crash is rumoured to have been caused by a spilt can of Coke in the City of London office . It might just have been the most expensive can of Coke ever. For a massive computer glitch that halted trading in stock exchanges around the world yesterday is being blamed on a spilt fizzy drink. Dealing across Europe and Asia was thrown into chaos by the crash of the server at Bloomberg's offices in the City of London. Bloomberg's computer system is the world's largest dealing platform and is used by most banks and trading floors. More than 300,000 screens suddenly went offline for several hours just after the start of trading, leaving brokers unable to work. Trillions of pounds of trading had to be stopped or diverted and the Government's attempts to sell £3billion of bonds, known as gilts, on the debt markets had to be delayed for several hours until the problem was fixed. Bloomberg blamed a 'combination of hardware and software failures in the network' for the outage, which was first reported at around 8.20am and lasted into the afternoon. But reports from inside the company suggested that a spilled can of Coke in one of the server rooms had been responsible for knocking out systems across two continents. The UK's Debt Management Office had to delay the £3billion sale of Government bonds because the blackout meant potential investors did not have access to the information they needed to make a deal. A DMO spokesman said the delay was 'due to ongoing technical issues with the third party platform' but the sale eventually went ahead. Stock market sources said it was highly unusual for a sale of debt to be delayed by a technical issue. David Buik at broker Panmure Gordon said it was regrettable that the auction had been delayed but would not have any long term consequences for the Government. Essential to traders: Bloomberg's computer system is the world's largest dealing platform and is used by most banks and trading floors. Today's glitch (pictured above) caused chaos across Europe and Asia . The outage saw screens around the world display a message saying: '*** CONNECTION STATUS *** Connecting...' Bloomberg, founded by the US billionaire Michael Bloomberg, makes more than £6billion a year from leasing its hi-tech software to banks and trading floorsacross the world. Each machine costs £13,000 a year. The computers, which typically have two or more screens, provide real-time trading information of share prices and commodities such as crude oil or gold. But they are also used to buy and sell shares, bonds and other financial instruments – meaning that many of the traders were unable to work without them. An influential City boss has claimed today's Bloomberg crash was the worst he's seen in up to 15 years. Steve Collins, global head of dealing at asset management firm London & Capital, told the Guardian: 'I haven't seen it go down like this for 10 or 15 years. 'Bloomberg is usually the one stable thing; it's the thing that everyone can't live without.' He said traders at London & Capital were left 'twiddling their thumbs' after their terminals went down. He added: 'Big banks will pump thousands of orders across Bloomberg, so the outage had quite an effect on the market.' Presumably overwhelmed, Bloomberg's helpline was not answering calls during the catastrophic glitch. At first there were suggestions that the outage could have been caused by hackers. Cyber security expert Greg Sims from UK firm Glasswall said the glitch looked suspicious. He said: 'I can't say categorically that it was a cyber attack, but if you look at what's been going on recently, you know that large organisations like this are always targets. 'These guys who hack into these things are very very clever people and can get into large organisations and do some serious nasty damage.' A spokesman for Bloomberg said: 'Significant but not all parts of our network experienced a disruption. 'We experienced a combination of hardware and software failures in the network, which caused an excessive volume of network traffic. 'This led to customer disconnections as a result of the machines being overwhelmed. 'We discovered the root cause quickly, isolated the faulty hardware, and restarted the software. We are reviewing our multiple redundant systems, which failed to prevent this disruption. We apologise to our customers.' According to BBC journalist Joe Lynam, Bloomberg  has stressed that Coke was not to blame for the outage today, not was cyber crime. In a Twitter statement the company said: 'There is no indication at this point that this is anything other than an internal network issue.' Bloomberg terminals, known as Bloomberg Professional, are used by more than 315,000 finance professionals across the globe, and they are a crucial part of the daily flow of financial markets. The machines, which cost subscribers more than £13,000 a year, provide a vast share of the company's £6 billion in annual revenue. Many of the bigger banks and financial institutions have  backup systems as well as alternative data suppliers, with products from competitors such as Thomson Reuters in place to avoid a major disruption.

Some systems came back online shortly after 9am, but other users continued to report the glitch or slow performance throughout the morning. And in a message earlier, it said that it 'had restored service to most customers and are making progress in bringing all parts of the network back online. We apologize to our customers'. Commenting on the Coke can rumour, a Bloomberg spokesman told MailOnline: 'That didn't happen.' Some financial workers saw the funny side of today's crash while also pointing out that the last tweet sent my Bloomberg before the outage was an article on the dangers of hacking. Market analyst Dan Davis tweeting: 'Currently printing 5,000 'I survived the great global Bloomberg outage of 2015' T-shirts.' And another Twitter user, barnejek, offered a solution to Greece's financial problems, posting: 'Come on @yanisvaroufakis and @tsipras_eu !

"Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul smacked around Democratic rival Hillary Clinton at a campaign stop in New Hampshire this morning on the eve of the former Obama administration official's first visit to the Granite State as a proclaimed 2016 candidate. 'When Hillary Clinton travels there's going to need to be two planes, one for her and her entourage, one for her baggage,' Paul said during remarks at a New Hampshire GOP summit taking place in Nashua this weekend. 'I'm concerned that the plane with the baggage is really getting heavy and teetering' Paul said, predicting that she'd soon have new questions to answer about her family foundation's donations from foreign actors. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'When Hillary Clinton travels there's going to need to be two planes, one for her and her entourage, one for her baggage,' Rand Paul said during remarks at a New Hampshire GOP summit taking place in Nashua this weekend . Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is pictured here walking from her airplane on October 31, 2012 upon her arrival at Zagreb Airport in Croatia. Clinton is now running for president and will campaign in New Hampshire this week . Clinton embarked on a cross-country trip in an armored van she nicknamed 'Scooby' last weekend for the first leg of her presidential bid. She ditched the van within days and flew back to the East Coast, travelling coach. The wealthy Democrat was spotted at the Omaha, Nebraska, airport on the way back carting her own luggage. Paul has been suggesting since he announced his bid for the Oval Office in early April that Clinton, a former first lady, U.S. senator, secretary of state and board member of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation would 'soon' face a day of reckoning over the charity's fundraising practices. 'I think there is big news coming on the Clinton Foundation,' Paul told Fox News during a New Hampshire swing earlier this month. 'I think there are things that went on at the Clinton Foundation that are going to shock people.' 'I think they're going to make people question whether she ought to run for president,' he said, declining to go into more detail. He's issued the foreboding warning several times since, saying today, 'There's more coming, too.' Paul said that if Clinton wants 'to be the candidate of women's rights,' she after to answer for the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of gifts from Saudi Arabia, which disrespects women, as well as her use of a private email server while working at the State Department. Her knowledge of the security situation at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya before a September 11, 2012 terrorist attack is also a concern. Of all the Obama administration's numerous 'scandals,' Paul said Benghazi is the one that 'bothers' him the most and hit Clinton for claiming it was below her 'pay grade' to read the diplomatic cables that were sent to the State Department in the days preceding the assault. Event goers hold Stop Hillary signs during the First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit in Nashua, New Hampshire today. Paul warned today that Clinton's day of reckoning is coming over checks her family's foundation took from foreign actors . Rand Paul shook hands with prospective voters and posed with a baby, 17-month-old Michael Alukonis, at a dinner in Merrimack, New Hampshire, this morning before his speech at the summit.  The budding Paul supporter is held by his grandfather, also Michael Alukonis,  said a few words in favor of Paul's presidential bid at the campaign stop . Putting daylight between himself and the rest of the presidential field, Paul implied the Benghazi attack would never have happened if he had been president because he never would have allowed a U.S. presence in Libya in the first place. Of his probable GOP competitors, Paul charged that 'they would have just done the same thing, just ten times over' as President Barack Obama. 'They all look alike, all sound alike, they all dress alike and nothing ever changes,' he said of his colleagues, two of whom -  Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida - have already joined the race. Rubio and Cruz are also in town for the summit. Cruz will give remarks, answer questions and participate in an event for Young Republicans this afternoon. Rubio was the featured speaker at last night's dinner. There, he took a swipe at Clinton, too, over her recent visit to Chipotle, where she came and went without being recognized and did not tip. The Florida senator said he'd been talking to former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown backstage, and Brown told him that Clinton planned to raise 2.5 billion to support her 2016 run. 'That's a lot of Chipotle, my friends,' he quipped. Paul this morning stopped in a Merrimack restaurant, The D.W.

There are almost 50 types of garments to choose from featuring the film motifs . Swimwear and t-shirts have been very popular, the release of their new line caused the website to crash . Some of the men's items sold out in minutes when launched this week, including the rainmaker t-shirts pictured here . Living Dead Enterprises has begun producing Avengers character garments for women, from bodysuits to leggings and bikinis too. The small Brisbane based company beat some of the world's biggest names to snare the licence from Disney's Marvel range . 'The sheer popularity of the Marvels characters, particularly in the United States but also Asia and Europe, means they might be lucky to keep up with demand,' one envious competitor suggested on Thursday. And he would appear to be right on the money. There was an overwhelming response to the announcement of the Age Of Ultron collection,' Mr Lange added. 'Our loyal customers knew this was coming and with so much world-wide hype surrounding the movie, people were absolutely dying to get their hands on it. 'We thought there would be a lot of excitement around the collection but we were completely blown away by how much there actually was.' Fans of the film series are buying up big to wear the clothing at the early screenings. And the website warns: 'Please note any orders made after the 15th of April may not have their orders before the movie release'. The most popular items have been both the men's and women's rainmaker shirts and singlets, at $85 each and all but every design is all but sold out. The cheapest item on the page is the bikini - starting at $45, while, at the other end of the price range, the Iron Buster dress and Thunder God equivalent both sell for $100. Fans of the series are buying up big hoping to wear the outfits at early screenings . The most expensive items are the Iron Man and Thor themed dresses at $100. The leggings are $70 . The brains behind the operation. Wade Lange says he's been run off his feet ever since he started making the Marvel based clothing and it is paying huge dividends now . Living Dead Clothing last year beat a who's who of global clothing manufacturers last year, to ink a deal with Marvel Comics Superheroes. Initially they were selling women's only garments but have now released their men's range and the . Mr Lange and his team of 15, including girlfriend Kelly, have already developed a wide range of the hugely popular Captain America wear and Guardians of the Galaxy garments. But the impending release of the movie blockbuster, featuring an all star cast, including Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johannson, Mark Ruffalo, James Spader and Samuel L. Jackson, will take it to another level. 'This was always going to be a big collection for us but we had no idea just how popular the collection would be with existing customers,' Mr Lange added. 'And it's how many new customers who have found us because of it. Captain America, Thor, Hulk and Iron Man items have been widely sought-after by the women and men. 'Our loyal customers knew this was coming and with so much world-wide hype surrounding the movie, people were absolutely dying to get their hands on it' Wade Lange said . Avengers lines of clothing mean that the Living Dead Clothing team of two quickly grew to a staff of 15 inside a large all-encompassing warehouse and Mr Lange admitted that 'we've gone from working in a small garage to a million dollar company' Living Dead Clothing boasts about being a company 'without the excessive price tag and without the rules and 100% Made In Australia' and the men's line has been a huge success . 'In the hours after the collections release our websites server couldn’t handle the sheer amount of traffic we were getting and went down for a few minutes.' The growing team of 15 is working over-time. 'This will no doubt be our best selling collection to date with some styles selling out in minutes,' he added. 'The new men's line has been an absolutely huge hit and we will be definitely expanding upon this for future collections. 'There has been a huge amount of interest from the US, even more so than normal. 'We’ve had sales from countries all across the globe through and there is a great deal of new fans in Europe.' The pitch to Marvel pitted him against some of the biggest names in clothing, keen to get their hands on the lucrative contract with Disney. He is convinced it was dedication that got them over the line. 'I haven't had a day off for many months now and we are determined to be successful,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'His dedication certainly rubs off on all of us,' added Living Dead Clothing PR boss Taryn Watt. 'I started doing it (making leggings) on a bit of a whim, I already had a 9-to-5 job, so it was just a bit of extra work in my garage,' he said. Things began to move very quickly, within months the small side business had begun to grow and then the Disney deal was on the table. The team of two quickly grew to a staff of 15 inside a large all-encompassing warehouse. 'We've gone from working in a small garage to a million dollar company,' he admitted. ''We've secured this exclusive contract for the Marvel characters in stretch-wear and moved into new premises - we are all 100 per cent dedicated to be successful, like him and we work hard for it,' said Ms Watt. 'We stood out from the others because we could show we really cared about our customers and they are very loyal to us.' Mr Lange knew success was brewing and moved quickly to bring in PR Manager, Taryn Watt . 'Marvel, as we all know, brings with it such a massive cult following - some guys have been reading the comics since they were five years old, they will be a must-have item,' she said . And everything is developed and produced in-house. 'We do not bring anything in from overseas, not one thing,' Ms Watt added. 'It's 100 per cent Australian, from the ideas, to the designing, printing, packing and shipping, we do it all.'","Brisbane designer raking in millions on the back of Hollywood's blockbuster moving 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron'

"British exports to the rest of the world are surging ahead of those to the European Union, official figures showed yesterday. It is the first time since records began that such sales of UK goods have outstripped those to the EU for six months in a row. Previously they have beaten EU exports on a quarterly basis – or three months – but never for such a sustained period. The figures appear to vindicate David Cameron's 'mercantile' foreign policy, which has seen him lead trade missions all over the world in order to refocus trade away from the EU's struggling economies. They are also a major rebuff to Tony Blair, who claimed in a speech this week that quitting the EU would cause 'significant damage to our economy'. Meanwhile eurosceptics will seize on the figures as evidence that Britain could carve out a prosperous future outside the EU. The news that British sales to the rest of the world are surging ahead of those to Europe is a major blow to former Prime Minister Tony Blair's claim that leaving the EU would damage the economy . The figures appear to vindicate David Cameron's 'mercantile' foreign policy, which has seen him lead trade missions all over the world . But total sales of British goods overseas have fallen to the lowest level for nearly five years amid warnings that the strong pound and weak eurozone are acting like a 'straitjacket' on exporters. The slump will come as a setback for the Government ahead of the General Election next month. Britain has exported more goods to Europe than the rest of the world since the UK joined the Common Market in the 1970s. Exports to the Continent were worth £147.9billion in 2014 compared with £144.9billion to non-EU countries. But the gap has been closing in recent years as the crisis in the eurozone has hit demand for British-made goods and UK firms looked further afield for business. Exports to the EU in the three months to February were 7.4 per cent lower than a year earlier at £34.4billion. At the same time, sales of goods stamped 'Made in Britain' to the rest of the world were up 4.2 per cent to £37.9billion. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, said: 'These figures put the kibosh on the scaremongering from the pro-EU cabal that would have had us stuck in the euro today. 'The EU makes up a declining share of our trade yet its out-of-date rules make it harder for the UK to do business across the globe. 'With firms on the Continent so reliant on trade with the UK we are in a strong position to renegotiate our relationship inside the EU or secure a trade deal outside altogether.' British goods overseas have fallen to the lowest level for nearly five years amid warnings that the strong pound and weak eurozone are acting like a 'straitjacket' on exporters . In a ringing endorsement of Britain's EU membership this week, Mr Blair said: 'I believe passionately that leaving Europe would leave Britain diminished in the world, do significant damage to our economy and, less obviously but just as important to our future, would go against the very qualities that mark us out still as a great global nation.' He added the uncertainty of a referendum would cause 'chaos' for business, and if voters opted for exit there would be 'the most intense period of business anxiety' since the Second World War. However, Britain's trade deficit with the EU – the difference between exports and imports – widened to £21.1billion in the three months to February. The ONS said it was the biggest trade gap since records began in 1998 and 'mainly' reflected the slump in exports – with demand from the crisis-torn eurozone particularly weak. Allie Renison, head of trade policy at the Institute of Directors, said: 'Our trade deficit in goods with the EU continues to widen, reflecting weak demand caused by prolonged stagnation in the eurozone. This underlines the need to reorient our focus on key emerging markets, including Asia. The Government should be pushing the EU as hard as possible to secure trade deals with countries where tariffs on goods still matter for British manufacturing exporters.' Under the Coalition led by David Cameron, exports to the Continent were worth £147.9billion in 2014 compared with £144.9billion to non-EU countries . Meanwhile the pound has risen by nearly 20 per cent against the euro in the last two years – making it more expensive for buyers in the single currency bloc to buy goods made in British factories. During this time, British firms have sought to exploit faster-growing markets such as China, India, Mexico and Africa. Alasdair Cavalla, an economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: 'There has been a certain amount of conscious redirecting of exports through trade missions and trade deals with partners outside the EU.' But despite the shift to far-flung markets in Asia and Latin America, total exports have fallen to the lowest level since early in this Parliament. Sales of British-made goods overseas fell by £900million or 3.7 per cent in February alone to £23.2billion – the lowest monthly figure since September 2010. Chancellor George Osborne has promised to double exports to £1trillion by 2020 to strengthen the economy – but is on course to fall well short of that target. Exports of goods and services fell from nearly £515.9billion in 2013 to £507.7billion in 2014. Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) has promised to double exports to £1trillion by 2020 to strengthen the economy – but is on course to fall well short of that target . David Kern, chief economist of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'It is clear that the UK is not yet making adequate process to rebalance the economy towards net exports. Unless we see firm action to improve our export performance, it is not clear how we will sustain strong growth in the long-term.' Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the bleak figures 'will re-ignite fears that the strong pound and weakness in demand in the euro-zone is acting as a straightjacket on exporters'. Exports to China jumped 21 per cent between 2012 and 2014 sales of British goods to South Korea were up nearly 14 per cent. China is now Britain's sixth biggest export market behind the Irish Republic, France, the Netherlands, Germany and the US. Sales of British-made cars to China have increased seven-fold since 2009 amid booming demand for luxury brands such as Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce. China is now the biggest overseas market for British cars having overtaken the US in 2013.","Tony Blair said leaving EU would cause 'significant damage' to economy .

"For those in the throes of their first year of parenthood, one woman knows exactly how tired you feel. Illustrator Lucy Scott, from Edinburgh, had her first baby in 2012, and found that nothing could have prepared her for the roller coaster ride that ensued. She proceeded to capture every experience in a new book, Doodle Diary of a New Mom: An Illustrated Journey Through One Mommy's First Year, which chronicles this emotional, often fraught time in a new parent's life in a series of wry, honest illustrations. 'The Joy of Long Car Journeys': Lucy Scott's doodle book honestly chronicles the difficult realities of the first year of parenthood . 'Actual Torture': The book looks at tricky situations such as breastfeeding and not being able to reach your phone to keep yourself entertained . Edinburgh-born illustrator Lucy Scott created the book after she gave birth to her first child in 2012 . Scott created the book after looking back at her own experience of the entire first year of being a parent. The 'doodle diary' reassures all new parents that every hilarious, terrifying or disgusting occurrence is completely universal. The charming collection features 120 illustrations, capturing everything from a baby's first lunch out, to a spot-on depiction of the constant sleep deprivation experienced. The book's description explains that: 'Despite [Scott's] extensive pre-baby research, nothing prepared her for the momentous task of caring for this new little person.' One of Scott's hilarious doodles looks at the terrifying experience of having no choice but to breastfeed her baby in a public toilet . All of the doodles are captioned aptly and simply sum up the experience in a wry and relatable manner. One doodle describes the alarming experience of leaving the house and having to breastfeed in the only place available, which in this case, happens to be a grotty public toilet. Another doodle hilariously shows the mother giving her newborn a brand-new cuddly toy, only to have the baby violently eject it from their arms. One sequence of illustrations shows a mother attempting 'sleep training' by introducing a toy . The child reaches for the toy which encourages the mother, but once the mother gives it to him, he tosses it out of reach . One illustration shows a mother driving, with tears of panic streaming down her face. One hand is positioned on the steering wheel and another hand angles backwards, trying to comfort a wailing baby in a car seat. It is captioned: 'The Joy of Long Car Journeys.' 'Date Night': Another image depressingly shows a couple dressed to go out without their baby. However their exhaustion has led them to fall asleep on the sofa . Another image is simply captioned: 'Actual Torture'. The accompanying image shows a woman sat on a bed while she is breastfeeding, frustratingly attempting to reach her mobile phone to entertain herself. One hilarious doodle in the book simply shows the absolute exhaustion of parents in the first year after having their new baby. The image is captioned 'Date Night' and shows the pair dressed up for an evening out, but instead, end up sleeping soundly on the sofa, having succumbed to the effects of sleep deprivation.","Lucy Scott is an Edinburgh-born illustrator and mother-of-one .

"Sofia Vergara allegedly insisted her 44-year-old assistant be the surrogate for her and then fiancé Nick Loeb. The revelation comes just after reports that the former couple are embroiled in a legal fight over her frozen eggs, which they planned to have children with before their bitter split. According to a Thursday report by Page Six, Loeb claimed that Vergara demanded her friend and employee serve as the surrogate over his 'objections as well as the recommendations of the parties’ doctor'. Scroll down for video . New development: Sofia Vergara allegedly insisted her 44-year-old assistant be the surrogate for her and then fiancée Nick Loeb despite his reported objections . The New York Post column also reported that the American businessman said the actress paid her friend $200,000 in gifts and mortgage payments and that a embryo was implanted in the woman on two separate occasions in 2013 with neither surviving. A source for the publication added: 'Sofía insisted on it. She said the assistant was the only person she could trust.' The insider added that Loeb would like to keep the embryos in tact to have his own children: 'He told Sofía he would raise the children himself, they would be very well taken care of. He wouldn’t sue her for child support. She would have no parental responsibility. She refuses to allow him to take charge of the embryos.' On Wednesday it was reported Loeb has filed a lawsuit in California in a bid to prevent the Modern Family actress from destroying two cryopreserved female embryos created through IVF, according to InTouch. Legal fight: A magazine claims Nick Loeb has filed a lawsuit against his ex-fiancee Sofia in a bid to prevent her from destroying two cryopreserved female embryos created through IVF, pictured here in 2011 . Vergara’s representatives declined to comment on the allegations when contacted by DailyMail.com on Wednesday. Court documents, filed under pseudonyms Jane and John Doe, detail how the couple fertilized embryos using her eggs and his sperm six months before their split in November 2013. Loeb, 39, is seeking to ensure the female embryos are not destroyed, but Vergara has refused to 'agree to their preservation under all circumstances,' according to the legal papers. The lawsuit was first filed in August 2014 before it was refiled again on April 1 with updated information and after Loeb sought new legal representation. Another claim in the documents is that, previously, the pair twice had eggs implanted in a surrogate, but the procedure failed. Elsewhere in the lawsuit, it is claimed 42-year-old actress Vergara - who got engaged to True Blood hunk Joe Manganiello on Christmas Day after six months of dating - was 'physically and mentally abusive' to Loeb. Wrangle: The lawsuit has been filed under the pseudonyms John and Jane Doe . No directive: Ultimately, the outcome will be at the discretion of a judge, but it would be unlikely that Loeb would be able to use the embryos without Sofia's consent, according to a legal expert who spoke to InTouch . The documents state: 'She punched him in the face on two occasions, kicked him, and threw her phone at his head. She also routinely bullied him, calling him a ""loser,"" ""worthless"" and other degrading names.' In April 2013, Vergara - who has a 23-year-old son Manolo from her first marriage - spoke publicly about having frozen her eggs and her desire to have more children. She revealed that she and Loeb - who she dated on-off for almost four years - planned to use a surrogate on the account that she had thyroid cancer in 2000 and, as a result, had a lot of radiation. Complicated matter: In this page of the document it states Sofia and Nick were planning on using a gestational surrogate in 2012 to start a family and that Sofia had insisted on using a 44-year-old friend and emloyee . Arduous process: After the first two embryos failed to implant in the first surrogate the couple looked for another suitable candidate . Getting ugly: Page five of the document further details Sofia and Nick's disagreements over the usage and disposal of the embryos and also alleges Sofia was physically, emotionally and mentally abusive to him . InTouch has previously claimed that now Vergara and 38-year-old Manganiello have found a surrogate and plan to have children of their own. The actress recently told Vanity Fair magazine that while having another child would be 'weird', it something she might do if it made Joe happy. She told the magazine: 'My son, Manolo, is 23 years old, which is going to be really weird if I have another baby. But, you know, Joe wants babies and if it's going to make him super-happy, then...' The complicated legal wrangle with Loeb still stands, though. Moving on: The Modern Family actress is now engaged to Joe Manganiello and there are rumours the couple are planning to have children of their own via a surrogate . Other documentation obtained by InTouch which forms part of the lawsuit shows that Jane Doe (Vergara) asked that the embryos be destroyed in the event of her death, while Loeb refused to agree to this condition. No agreement was made between the couple about what would happen to any frozen eggs in the event they ended their relationship. Ultimately, the outcome will be at the discretion of a judge. However legal experts told InTouch that it would be unlikely that Loeb will be able to use the embryos without Sofia's consent.

"Boris Johnson last night urged Ukip voters to 'swing behind the Conservatives' to avoid the 'nightmare' of a 'backward-looking Labour government' propped up by an 'even more Left-wing' SNP. The London Mayor claimed Ukip supporters are in 'increasing psychological conflict' as they realise a vote for Nigel Farage's party is a 'vote for Ed Miliband'. 'A lot want to come home to the Tories. Any gain by Ukip is a gain by Miliband,' he told the Daily Mail as he campaigned in the Thanet South, the Kent seat where Mr Farage is standing. 'The risk is that would let in a Labour/SNP government which would be a catastrophe for the country'. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson receives a kiss on the cheek while campaigning in Finchley High Road and Edgware High Street . Mr Johnson poses for a photo with a group of locals while out on the Tory campaign trail . Two young women take a photo with Mr Johnson while he campaigned on the streets of London yesterday . Mr Johnson also visited Ramsgate, Kent, to support local candidate Craig McKinley . While in Kent, the Mayor of London warned that a vote for Ukip would be equal to a vote for Ed Miliband . Mr Johnson's intervention shows the Tories are determined to ramp up their warnings over a Labour government propped up by the SNP . He also urged Labour and Liberal Democrat voters to rally behind the Conservatives in Thanet and defeat the Ukip leader, an outcome he said would mean Ukip's 'puffball had exploded'. Mr Johnson's intervention signals that the Tories are determined to ramp up their warnings over a minority Labour government dependent on the votes of SNP MPs. Yesterday, former prime minister Sir John Major clashed with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon over the prospect of the surging Scottish Nationalists, on course to win 40 or more seats, holding the balance of power at Westminster. Miss Sturgeon has ruled out any deal with the Conservatives and said she would be prepared to put Mr Miliband in Number Ten even if Labour wins fewer seats in a hung Parliament. In an unusual intervention in contemporary politics, Sir John warned the SNP represents a 'real and present danger' to the future of the United Kingdom. A partnership between Labour and the SNP would mean Mr Miliband being subjected to 'a daily dose of political blackmail' from an SNP determined to 'create merry hell' in order to bring about the end of the Union, he said. His remarks drew a furious response from Miss Sturgeon, who said his remarks about her party being a threat were 'an affront to democracy'. Mr Johnson leaves a walkabout in Ramsgate, Kent, with lipstick on his cheek . 'These are the same politicians that during the referendum campaign urged Scotland to lead the UK not leave the UK. Now they appear to say Scotland's voice should only be heard if we say the things they want us to say and vote the way they want us to vote,' she said. 'My message to John Major is Scotland's voice deserves to be heard in whatever way the Scottish people choose, and voting SNP means Scotland's voice will be heard more loudly and strongly at Westminster than it has ever been heard before.' Former First Minister Alex Salmond insisted Sir John's position was 'fundamentally undemocratic'. He said he was 'the man who, let us remember, rather carelessly mislaid every single Tory seat in Scotland'. 'What these Westminster parties fear - and what many people in England would welcome - is not just the size of the SNP, but the majority for progressive politics that would come from it,' he said . Mr Miliband, who has repeatedly refused to rule out relying on the support of the SNP to get into Downing Street, also reacted angrily. 'David Cameron is setting one part of part of the UK against another. That is dangerous. He is talking up the SNP chances and not taking them on. That is dangerous,' the Labour leader said. 'I have to say to Conservatives, frankly, I think they should tell the prime minister to stop because he is demeaning his office, he is demeaning himself, he is demeaning those people he sends out on his behalf, and frankly, I think it is threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom.' Even one former Tory Cabinet minister expressed unease, claiming the party's campaign attacks on the SNP risk undermining the future of the United Kingdom. Former Scottish Secretary Lord Forsyth said talking up the threat posed by the Scottish nationalists was 'short-term and dangerous'. The Prime Minister was unrepentant last night, rejecting the suggestion he risks stoking SNP support in Scotland. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was mocked by ex-PM Sir John Major over her demand to play a role in propping up a Labour government . Mr Miliband yesterday claimed David Cameron was 'setting up one part of the UK against another' 'I am responsible for lots of things. Heck, I am the prime minister, I am responsible for everything. But I am not responsible for the fact that the Labour Party has failed to get its message across in Scotland. 'The rest of the country does have to wonder, what is the price that they will pay? I fear for our country if this were to happen.' Mr Cameron said the SNP would want voters across the UK to feel by the end of five years of chaotic administration that 'the country doesn't work, that the government does not work, that the country should break up'. Campaigning in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, he added: 'By raising this I am not only raising the issue and the fear that people have that money will be sucked out of areas like this. 'I am also raising the point that we care about our UK, I care passionately about it. Don't let the SNP into government of the UK because they would try to break it up.' Mr Johnson, campaigning in Thanet, said: 'Ukip voters can see the argument that we have got the plan for the economy, and I hope very much that they will think sensibly and carefully. 'There is an element of internal conflict in the minds of many Ukip voters. They are thinking they could end up with something – a backward-looking Labour government propped up by an even more Left-wing SNP – that would really set the country back.'

"Hillary Clinton is expected to officially declare her candidacy for president on 'Sunday afternoon,' according to a Democratic Party source in Iowa. The Clinton partisan spoke to Daily Mail Online on background, saying the former secretary of state will first put her name forward for the White House on Twitter, and then barnstorm the Hawkeye State in what the Associated Press calls a series of 'small' meetings with voters. Separately, an Iowa Republcian Party official said on-the-ground forces loyal to Hillary are rounding up Democrats via phone trees and emails in preparation of campaign appearances early in the coming week. A New Hampshire GOP political operative who works for a likely candidate who hasn't yet launched a campaign added that Clinton's efforts in the state are 'surprisingly slow, given her primary victory here in 2008.' Clinton will fly to New Hampshire after her Iowa swing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . READY FOR HILLARY? Clinton will announce her bid to become America's first female president this weekend . STARTING GUN: The former first lady faces no substantial competition – yet – for the Democratic nomination in 2016 . In a timely release just days before the start of her presidential campaign, Clinton reveals in a new epilogue to her book 'Hard Choices' why she decided to take the presidential leap. 'Becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on. Rather than make me want to slow down, it has spurred me to speed up. 'As Margaret Mead said, children keep our imaginations fresh and our hearts young, and they drive us to work for a better future. I've also returned again and again to this question of universality – how much we all have in common even if the circumstances of our lives may be different. 'As you've seen throughout this book, one of the defining themes of my time as Secretary of State was our increasing global interdependence. Despite all the division and discord in the world, which sometimes can seem overwhelming, the basic fact of the 21st century is that we're more connected than ever. 'If the United States continues to lead the world in the years ahead, as I believe it can and must, it will be because we have learned how to define the terms of our interdependence to promote more cooperation and shared prosperity and less conflict and inequality. 'As we've seen since the first edition of this book was published in June 2014, the negative side of interdependence remains potent – whether it was the spread of virulent new strands of extremism in the Middle East or old-style nationalism in Europe or a deadly epidemic in Africa. Our job is to build up the positive side. 'The United States and the other great democracies have to redouble our efforts to empower moderates and marginalize extremists everywhere, and to stand firmly and united in pursuit of a more just, free, and peaceful world. 'That's the world I want for Charlotte and for all our kids.' In the excerpt, released Friday to the Huffington Post, she describes how becoming a grandmother inspired her 'to see the world in new ways' and made her realize that 'there was so much more to do.' 'Becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on,' she writes. 'Rather than make me want to slow down, it has spurred me to speed up.' The maneuver of re-upping public attention on her poorly selling memoir, though, highlights one of Clinton's key liabilities: likeability. Her campaign has a steep hill to climb if she is to escape the 1990s-era image of a controlling and often temperamental politician, or the 2000s sequel – a scheming conniver bent on winning power. The Republican National Committee had been mum about Hillary's impending announcement, but the party took its gloves off Friday morning with a scathing video ad highlighting her scandals. 'From the East Wing to the State Department, Hillary Clinton has left a trail of secrecy, scandal and failed liberal policies that no image consultant can erase, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said Friday in a statement. 'Voters want to elect someone they can trust and Hillary's record proves that she cannot be trusted.' The Clinton campaign-in-waiting held a secret off-the-record dinner with a hand-picked group of journalists Thursday night in Washington, D.C., also according to the Huffington Post. The former first lady once faced no substantial competition for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination but a few challengers have emerged lately – most notably former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, who has also conducting private fundraisers meetings in New York City. Clinton also faces intense scrutiny over an email scandal involving a private home-brew server she maintained at her Chappaqua, New York home, a problem that will taint her claim to her party's top perch. Announcing a presidential campaign on social media has become ordinary this year, with Republicans Rand Paul and Ted Cruz preempting their own televised launches with Tweets and Facebook posts meant to appeal to young and low-attention-span voters. Clinton, too, will need to leverage the online space and will follow her tweets with email and video announcements. The Reuters news service predicted that the videos will go 'viral.' In her previous presidential run in 2008, Clinton lost to Barack Obama, in part because of the Obama campaign's intense use of digital and online strategies to draw attention to his candidacy and raise huge sums through small donations. By 2012 his team, led by veterans from Facebook and Google, were deploying sophisticated social media strategies. Clinton's 2016 campaign is expected to concentrate on making the 67-year-old former first lady relatable to ordinary Americans despite her age and longstanding connection to the Democratic Party's political machinery. After serving eight years as first lady, she won a U.S. Senate seat in New York and then spent four years jetting to foreign capitals as Obama's first-term secretary of state. Day-to-day contact with everyday Americans has been elusive and rare. SKELETONS: Clinton will face a new round of scrutiny over her time in the White House as first lady . TWEET TWEET: The 67-year-old Democrat will have to find ways to connect with the younger voters as she distances herself from past and present scandals . Kristina Schake (pictured) has been brought in to help transform Hillary Clinton's public image . But in a year when Republicans have a deep bench, Democrats have sat back and waited for Hillary to claim their brass ring. She remains the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination but has seen her poll numbers slip in recent days. On Thursday a Quinnipiac University poll revealed she has slipped against the leading 2016 Republican candidates in Colorado, Iowa and Virginia. Pollsters cited damage from what has become known as 'email-gate.' In a bid to recast her image she has brought in Kristina Schake, the former White House aide responsible for transforming  Michelle Obama's public image into that of an all-American 'everywoman' who shops at retail outlets, does 'mom dancing' on TV and even has a Twitter account. Schake, 45, will attempt to turn the 67-year-old politician from an aggressive and secretive figure into a softer, more accessible one. Thursday's swing state poll also showed Clinton in a close race with U.S. Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican who declared his candidacy on Tuesday. Clinton is in tight hypothetical races in Colorado and Iowa, where she previously led by commanding margins. STAND WITH RAND: The Quinnipiac University Swing State Poll showed Hillary Clinton in a close race with U.S. Senator Rand Paul (pictured), the Kentucky Republican who declared his candidacy on Tuesday . 'It isn't just one or two Republicans who are stepping up;it's virtually the entire GOP field that is running better against her' since the last swing state survey on February 18, pollster Peter Brown said in a statement. Brown attributed the drop to the controversy that erupted in March over Clinton's use of personal email for work when she was America's top diplomat. Republicans have raised the prospect of congressional hearings on the issue. Paul led Clinton by 44 per cent to 41 per cent in Colorado and 43 per cent to 42 per cent in Iowa, the Quinnipiac poll showed. In Virginia, Clinton led 47 per cent to 43 per cent. 'These numbers are a boost for U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky as he formally launches his campaign,' Brown said. Most earlier polls had shown Clinton with a substantial lead over the Republican field.","Former secretary of state is expected to announce candidacy Sunday afternoon and then hit the campaign trail .

"A man deliberately drove his car straight through the front doors of a police station - and then managed to escape the scene in the damaged vehicle. The 42-year-old man allegedly threw a wheel spanner at a night security patrol car before recklessly driving his dark blue Ford Falcon ute at full speed towards the Harts Range police station just before 10pm on Sunday. Fortunately the station, which is remotely located about 240km northeast of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, was vacant at the time of the incident before the culprit managed to escape in the smashed-up car. A man deliberately drove his dark blue Ford Falcon ute into the doors of the Harts Range police station . Territory Duty Superintendent Brendan Muldoon said police are looking for a 42-year-old male who was agitated and driving in a reckless manner. 'The man has allegedly thrown a wheel spanner at the Night Patrol vehicle and driven the car at speed towards the police station,' he said. 'The station, which was vacant at the time, has sustained damage to the front glass doors and rear roller doors.' The culprit managed to escape in the smashed-up car but wouldn't have got far without working headlights, a front number plate or a front bumper bar . Superintendent Muldoon said the alleged offender then drove off along the Plenty Highway. 'Police do not think he would have travelled far, as damage left behind suggests he would have no working headlights, no front number plate or a front bumper bar,' he said. 'The car may still have the rear number plate attached which is SA registered S145 AVI.' Police are urging anyone who has seen the dark blue Ford Falcon utility, with front and possible rear end damage, to contact police on 131 444 or call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

"The number of web pages containing child pornography has more than doubled over the past year. Researchers have also revealed the material features increasingly young children. Nine out of every ten images of child sexual abuse found online in 2014 showed children aged ten and under, according to the Internet Watch Foundation. Overall, experts from the regulator removed more than 31,000 web pages featuring vile images of sexual abuse in 2014, soaring 136 per cent from around 13,000 the previous year . That was a dramatic increase from the year before, when around two-thirds of the child porn it found featured children of such a young age. They were part of a worrying rise in the amount of child abuse the IWF discovered online. Overall, experts from the regulator removed more than 31,000 web pages featuring vile images of sexual abuse in 2014, soaring 136 per cent from around 13,000 the previous year. The jump came after the internet watchdog was told that it could proactively seek out abusive content online, in order to shut it down. The IWF won the extra powers last year in the wake of the 2012 murders of Tia Sharp, 12, and April Jones, five – girls who were both killed by men who watched child porn online. Emma Hardy, the IWF's director of external relations, said: 'The biggest change for us last year was our ability to proactively search for child sexual abuse imagery. Our analysts are able to actively search for the content, rather than merely wait for reports to come in from the public. 'That's made a huge difference. Last year we were able to process 74,000 reports and identify just over 31,000 child sexual abuse web pages. 'I think there's still a huge amount out there. We've got a long way to go until we see the peak of this problem.' In its annual report, the IWF said it alerts law enforcement agencies and hotlines in other countries when it discovers foreign-based web pages with child sexual abuse images and 'repeatedly chases' them until they are removed. Kevin Bollaert, 28, was sentenced to 18 years after he was convicted in February of 21 counts of identity theft and six counts of extortion  for running websites that capitalised on the internet as a forum for public shaming . Most of the photographs and videos of sexual abuse that the IWF found online were on websites hosted in North America. Just 0.3 per cent of the images – just over 90 pictures or videos – appeared on web pages hosted in Britain, down from 18 per cent in 1996, when IWF was founded. But although more child porn is now being removed from the web, the shocking figures also highlight the massive scale of the problem online. Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of IWF, said technology companies were 'stepping up' efforts to tackle the amount of images of sexual abuse online. But she added that many of them were still too slow to take images down, or failed to acknowledge they have a problem. 'This year will ensure they have nowhere to hide as we will be targeting them for the benefit of all internet users and victims of sexual abuse,' she said. IWF is funded by 117 technology companies around the world, including Google, Facebook and Twitter. Criminals are using many legitimate websites to distribute pictures and videos of child sexual abuse imagery, the IWF said. In particular, they targeted websites which are specifically designed to allow users to upload pictures, and make them available via a unique web page address, or 'URL'. Nearly 20,000 of the web pages removed last year were hosted by these sorts of sites. ÷ Paedophiles are using the digital currency bitcoin to buy child sexual abuse images online, the IWF found. It said a number of the most prolific commercial child sexual abuse websites started accepting the currency last year.","Worrying rise in the amount of child abuse discovered on the internet .

"A pair of friends who battered a married father of two to death with extreme 'Jackass-style' pranks and dumped his dismembered body in a lake have been jailed for life. Neill Buchel, 39, was kicked, punched and bludgeoned by Elvis Kwiatkowski and Chas Quye, both 36, before being cut into ten pieces and disposed of in a fishing lake in Dagenham, Essex. The men were obsessed with the extreme pranks from the hit TV show and videos found on their mobile phones showed Mr Buchel being made to rub scotch bonnet chilli pepper on his genitals. Killed: Neill Buchel, 39, was kicked, punched and bludgeoned to death on March 13, last year, by two 'friends' Blackfriars Crown Court was told the South African was subjected to 'degrading and humiliating violence' that had become 'casual' in the months before his death on March 13, last year. Mr Buchel emigrated to Britain in 2001 with his wife and daughter where they wanted to start a new life after hearing stories from his grandfather, a Spitfire pilot in the Battle of Britain. But he was thrown out of the family home in late 2013 after he spiralled into an alcohol addiction and moved in with Scott 'Gary' Hunt, 42, and other friends. Instead of providing a haven for him, the group were puerile hard-drinkers who entertained themselves with extreme pranks, which Mr Buchel was made to endure. Other videos discovered showed Quye setting fire to his own pubic hair while eating a chilli and taking shots from a BB gun. On the night of his murder Mr Buchel had been drinking in the park before returning to Quye's flat with Kwiatkowski, who he had just met, Hunt and a fellow drinker, Alan Quinn. Jailed: Chas Quye (left) and Elvis Kwiatkowski (right) were sentenced to life in prison at Blackfriars Crown Court today. The court heard they were obsessed with the hit U.S. television show Jackass . Mr Buchel moved in with Scott 'Gary' Hunt, 42, (left) who was jailed for five years for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Bradley Andison (right), 47, who transported the body in a 4x4 was jailed for four years . One witness described seeing Kwiatowski and Quye, brandishing a mallet, standing over Mr Buchel whose head was draped in a sheet. A post mortem found he suffered over 30 blunt force traumas that caused 35 fractures to bones around his body. The following morning the pair set about dismembering the body before enlisting the help of the apartment owner, Hunt, to help them shift the body parts. The court heard how with no means to transport of the corpse the men considered using public transport to. Ian Morley QC, defending, Quye said: 'They were contemplating at one point of using a bus to move the body. That suggests the desperation to which their minds had gone to.' Alan Quinn, 28, present at the time of the murder but not involved was also convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and jailed for 3 years . They resorted to using a 4x4 owned by Bradley Andison, 47, from Kent, who pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice before the trial began. The whereabouts of Mr Buchel's corpse remained unknown for weeks after his death, until a young angler mistook his thigh for a dead fish in White Hart Lakes, Dagenham. Judge, Mr Justice Spencer, said: 'Had the body parts all sunk to the bottom of the lake and remained there it may never have been know what you did. 'This was as bad a case of its kind as it is possible to imagine.' Jailing the pair today, the judge added: 'This was a brutal and callous murder, Neill Buchel was 39 years old when he died. 'He was a harmless and inoffensive man, he and his wife had come to this country from South Africa in 2001 with their daughter, their second daughter born here, they wanted to make a better life for themselves. 'His wife and his children never for a moment stopped loving and caring for him. 'The family's loss has been insufferable, the girls have been deprived their father and any chance that they might one day have got back together.' Prosecutor, Sally O'Neill QC, read a victim impact statement by his wife Sharon to the hearing. She said: 'Neill Buchel had a particular fondness for England as his grandfather had been a Spitfire pilot in the war and Neill had enjoyed the stories he used to tell. 'She described him as a loving, caring, funny person who was completely harmless and gentle.' She said despite his trouble with booze he was ""amiable"", he had never been a violent person and a was a peace-loving gentleman who loved his daughters. 'It was her dream as she put it that they would be able to get back together again if he got better.' The court also heard a statement from Patricia Kell, Mr Buchel's mother, which said: 'Not only did they kill my son but they ruthlessly took away someone who we loved and cherished. Mr Buchel (left) emigrated to the UK with his wife Sharon (right) in 2001 but he moved in with friends in late 2013 after he spiralled into an alcohol addiction . 'The awfulness of knowing that they ruthlessly chopped his body into pieces, this child who I have loved, watched grow from a baby into a man, whole in body and soul, the absolute horror of this is indescribable. 'What they saw, and watched and handled, what they desecrated so callously was a loving human being worthy of respect even after death.' Who struck the killer blow was unknown, but Justice Spence said the was was a 'classic joint enterprise' and both were handed the same life sentence. He added: 'Both of you must have realised straight away that Neill Buchel was badly injured and needed urgent medical treatment, but neither of you did anything to help him.' Quye's involvement was made 'even worse' as he had told Mr Buchel's 16-year-old daughter, who cannot be named, the night before that he would care for her inebriated father, the judge said. Quye, who appeared in the dock with a string of rosary beads, and Kwiatkowski showed no reaction as they were ordered to serve a minimum term of 21 years and will serve the rest of their lives on licence. The judge said: 'This was an attack of great brutality and ferocity against a man who was quite unable to defend himself. Although both of you were under the influence of drugs you showed him no mercy.' Hunt, who was represented in court by the Prime Minister's barrister brother, Alex Cameron, QC, was jailed for five years for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice but cleared of murder. A fifth man, Alan Quinn, 28, present at the time of Mr Buchel's murder but not involved was also convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and jailed for three years. Andison was jailed for four years and a sixth man, Colin Bushaway, 61, was cleared of the charge and an alternative of preventing a lawful burial.","Neill Buchel, 39, was beaten to death by Elvis Kwiatkowski and Chas Quye .

"The FBI have released an image of a man they are trying to trace in connection with a sex abuse probe . Police have released images of an unidentified man they are trying to trace to help them rescue a young girl who is believed to be being abused. The FBI confirmed it found images of a 'pre-pubescent blonde girl' that appear to show her being sexually abused, which could have been taken 'in America or elsewhere.' Officials said one picture, which does not show any abuse taking place, features the unidentified man posing with her. They said they are trying to trace the man - referred to as John Doe 29 - because they believe he may have 'critical information' to help them identify the victim and her whereabouts to rescue her. Investigators stressed the dark-haired man, believed to be between the ages of 30 and 45, is not suspected of carrying out abuse. Amanda Strickland, special investigator at the FBI, said: 'We are trying to stop further continued abuse of this child. We believe that it is still ongoing.' Police said the child was seen in one of the photographs wearing blue and white Nike velcro sneakers. They confirmed John Doe 29 has a tan complexion and was pictured wearing a silver ring on his left hand ring fingers. Other pictures appear to show a different hand with a ring on the right hand. Initial images of the unidentified adult male, John Doe 29, shown with a child were first recorded by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in January of 2008. The pictures have been recently re-enhanced to try and identify the mystery man. The FBI released the appeal, with images of John Doe 29, and distinguishing features in a bid to get information . He is being sought as part of the FBI’s Operation Rescue Me and Endangered Child Alert Program (ECAP) initiatives which aim to find abuse victims. The FBI has released a poster and blog appealing for any information about the man. People are asked to submit a tip online at tips.fbi.gov or call the FBI’s toll-free tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI.

"Children as young as four have been investigated for drug and sex offences - and toddlers aged just two suspected of assault, it was revealed today. Shocking figures from West Midlands Police also show a nine-year-old has been probed on suspicion of criminal damage and a four-year-old questioned over an assault. Between 2009 and 2014 a total of 617 youngsters aged under ten in the region either committed, of were suspected of committing, a crime. Investigated: Between 2009 and 2014 a total of 617 youngsters aged under ten in the West Midlands either committed, of were suspected of committing, a crime, according to figures (file picture posed by model) They include 41 nine-year-old boys investigated for crimes last year including five suspected of sexual offences, according to the details released after a Freedom of Information Act request. A nine-year-old girl was also linked to a case of criminal damage while a five-year-old girl was alleged to have committed sexual activity with a child. The legal age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is ten. But four-year-old children have also been investigated on suspicion of possessing cannabis, criminal damage, assault, theft and sexual activity with a child aged under 13. In both 2013 and 2014 two-year-old boys were believed to be behind assaults and in 2012 a three-year-old girl was suspected of being responsible for a theft. Publication: West Midlands Police (whose headquarters in Birmingham are pictured) released figures showing that in both 2013 and 2014 two-year-old boys were believed to be behind assaults . Police admitted some of the figures may be inaccurate - including statistics showing a rape suspect aged minus three, and a one-year-old breaching a non-molestation order. A boy of 13 became one of Britain's youngest murderers after he was jailed for at least 12 years for killing a woman he had just mugged by stamping on her face so hard it left a footprint on her cheek. CCTV footage showed the horrendous moment Petri Kurti murdered 47-year-old Glynis Bensley before he fled to a nearby park in Smethwick, West Midlands, and boasted about the savage attack. The schoolboy, who was named last Friday after a judge lifted a reporting restriction order, will be on licence for life. Sentencing, Judge John Warner said he had been 'running wild' in his home life. A force spokesman said: ‘The response features information collated in good faith from millions of pieces of data stored on force systems which, on reflection, contains some inaccuracies as a result of human inputting errors at the time of the crime being recorded.' He added that the FOI response was released with the following caveat: 'Although every effort is made to ensure the figures presented are accurate and complete, the data collected is subject to inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recorded system. ‘As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when interpreting those data. ‘Data on ages is calculated from date of birth, which is inputted manually. Therefore inaccuracies may result from human error.'","Nine-year-old probed over criminal damage & four-year-old over assault .

"Two British men have been fined $3,000 for threatening behaviour on board a Thomson Airways flight. One allegedly threw peanuts and a pound coin at cabin crew, with the other was accused of hitting himself on the head with clenched fists during the disturbance, which forced the flight from London to Mexico to divert to Bermuda. Jamie Richardson, 38, from Lancing, West Sussex and Daniel Taylor, 37, from Worthing, West Sussex, both pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour in a Bermuda court. Scroll down for video . Polcie were seen entering the grounded plane at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda . The two holidaymakers could also face a four-month jail term, with local sources claiming the pair are struggling to pay the fee as they have only $700 between them. The Royal Gazette reported that at the hearing the prosecutor reported the two men to be intoxicated at the point of boarding the the Boeing 787-8 at London Gatwick at around 9.40am on Sunday morning. The court heard how, despite being seated apart, Richardson and Taylor pestered the cabin crew for drinks and caused havoc in the cabin. Taylor is said to have stood on the foot of one member of staff, and both men were accused of shouting and swearing during the flight. After being told to stop, the two reportedly claimed 'we are drug dealers.' Taylor then threw his wallet to Richardson, who wanted to buy some peanuts. On throwing back the wallet, a fellow passenger was hit on the head. Bermuda Police confirmed two men were taken into custody after reports of unruly behviour on a plane . Richardson later the peanuts and a pound coin at staff, while Taylor continued to act in an aggressive manner. Taylor then refused a final written warning from cabin staff. The pilot was notified of the action in the cabin, and took the decision to make an unscheduled landing at LF Wade International Airport in Bermuda, seven-and-a-half hours into the flight. The plane, carrying 278 passengers, was met by six police cars on landing, with officers seen entering the aircraft and removing the passengers. In their defence, both men said they had taken sleeping pills, and that these, when mixed with alcohol, forced them to behave irrationally. Their attorney Alexandra Wheatley expressed the concern that the two men cannot afford their respective fines and asked for the amount to be revised. But magistrate Magistrate Khamisi Tokunbo dismissed this as a legitimate reason and believed the fine was fair. 'In these times it could be a lot harsher – you can’t mess around in the air these days,' he said. A statement on the Bermuda Police website read: 'Around 12:55pm on Sunday, April 12 police officers responded to a report of two disruptive passengers on a diverted Thomson Airways flight landing at LF Wade International Airport. 'The two male passengers involved were subsequently escorted off the plane and taken into police custody. 'The Thomson aircraft was apparently en route from London, U.K. to Cancun, Mexico.' It is not known at this time as to the nationality or the exact actions of the two passengers arrested . A spokesperson for Thomson Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson Airways would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced by passengers on board flight TOM022 from London Gatwick Airport to Cancun, which diverted to Bermuda yesterday due to a customer incident on board. 'We operate a zero tolerance policy in relation to any disruptive behaviour. The passengers in question were removed from the aircraft and met by police. 'The flight departed within two hours to ensure the other customers could get away on their holiday as soon as possible.

"Love the lighting in these photography shots? They become even more awe-inspiring at the realisation that they're paintings, and someone spent between 50 to 300 hours painstakingly creating them. Patrick Kramer is a 33-year-old artist hailing from Springville, Utah, who specialises in remarkably hyper-realistic paintings. Scroll down for video . Action shot: The artwork of 33-year-old Patrick Kramer is so realistic it's impossible to tell apart from a photo. In this image, he has painted a falling woman with a deeply intricate background . The US artist specialises in beautifully in-depth oil painted portraits, including this intricate black and white portrait of a man called Matt . The paintings, including this of a sleeping young girl called Anna, take the artist up to 50 to 300 hours to complete . It's almost impossible to tell that Kramer's flawless creations are in fact oil paintings due to their incredible pin-sharp detail and clarity. His portrayals vary between vivid city scenes, still-life objects, portraits and breathtaking motion-shots. As well as his portfolio of hyper-realistic paintings, he also constructs more surreal variations on still life, involving insects or inanimate objects in front of a background. One of his images is an imitation of the cover art for musician Drake's 2013 album, Nothing Was the Same. Kramer also paints highly-detailed urban shots, which are impossible to tell apart from a photo . His technique involves building layers of oil paint in order to achieve the intense level of detail . The US artist works from photos and builds up delicate layers of oil paint on a board or canvas. This allows him to add controlled detail and subtle shadowing, which appear almost three-dimensional in the pieces of artwork. Kramer has admitted that an oil painting can take anywhere between 50 to 300 hours (one to six weeks) to complete. The length of time taken depends entirely on the size of the painting and the level of detail. The 33-year-old artist has admitted that this type of artwork suits his precise preferences and personality. Kramer also constructs more surreal imagery of insects, which all still have the same high level of detail - including (left) a dragonfly on an intricate background, and (right) Kramer's painting of a butterfly resting on a wad of letters . Cracks in the surface: The artist, from Utah, specialises in creating exceptionally-realistic works of art. In this case, it is a paintbrush against a background of cracked paint . Kramer said: 'Being a perfectionist, I have always been considering art as an outlet for my slightly obsessive personality. The artist's background and education was also important in honing his interests. 'I studied painting in college, and experimented with hyper realism as a way of perfecting my craft. 'I never intended to pursue the style, but found it hard to give up, as it suited my nature.' Kramer's artwork - including this painting of half-filled glasses - is astounding in its level of clarity . Glass half full or half empty? This painting is incredibly detailed, from the fine fish fins to the bubble floating at the top of the glass . Kramer's paintings can vary between still-life of subjects such as paint-brushes (left) and detailed portrayals, such as this harbour (right) Nothing Was the Same: This painting imitates the album cover art for Drake's 2013 album, but swaps Drake for a female model .","Patrick Kramer, 33, is a hyper-realist artist from Springville, Utah .

"The future of AC/DC is again in doubt, after drummer Phil Rudd pleaded guilty in a New Zealand court, to charges of threatening to kill and of possessing drugs. Rudd, 60, was charged with two counts of threatening to kill and possession of methamphetamine and of cannabis, which stem from a police raid on his waterfront North Island mansion on November 6. The veteran rocker had originally pleaded not guilty to the charges. But with his judge-alone trial due to begin on Tuesday, in the Tauranga District Court, his lawyer changed his plea to guilty. Scroll down for video . Veteran AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd arrives at court ahead of changing his plea to guilty on charges of 'threatening to kill' and drug possession . AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd climbs out of his car as he arrives to face charges at the District Court in Tauranga, New Zealand. The 60-year-old Australian, who has lived in Tauranga for over 30 years, hit the headlines last November when he appeared in court accused of attempting to hire a hitman to kill two people. Phil Rudd arrives at court to change his plea to guilty but the maximum sentence for threatening to kill is seven years in jail. The case has been adjourned until June 26 when Rudd's lawyer will apply for a discharge without conviction . Phil Rudd, 60, appears in court on Tuesday on charges of threatening to kill and possession of meth and marijuana at Tauranga District Court. He changed his plea to guilty ahead of sentencing . One 'threatening to kill' charge has been dropped and he has been remanded Rudd on bail, with existing conditions, until sentencing on June 26. Rudd was also initially charged with ""attempting to procure murder"", but it was dropped after prosecutors decided there was insufficient evidence to proceed. The court had earlier heard that Rudd wanted a former security guard 'taken out'. The case has left Rudd's position with the top-selling band in doubt. Drummer Chris Slade replaced him for a performance at the Grammys in Los Angeles.

Brian Johnson and Angus Young caught in typical pose during AC/DC's performance on day one of Coachella, as the band gets used to life without Phil Rudd and Malcolm Young . While Slade suggested he would also play in the upcoming ""Rock or Bust"" world tour, Rudd said last year that he wanted to keep his job. A summary of facts released by prosecutors last year alleged that Rudd threatened to kill a man and his daughter in a phone call in September. He also allegedly called a business associate and detailed what he wanted done to the man. The document alleged that when police raided Rudd's home they found 0.71 grams (0.025 ounces) of methamphetamine and 130 grams (4.5 ounces) of cannabis. Threatening to kill charges carry a maximum jail term of seven years in New Zealand. Australian-born Rudd, has lived in the North Coast seaside town of Tauranga since 1983. AC/DC will bring their 'Rock or Bust' world tour home to Australian in November after kicking off proceedings at the Coachella festival in the US and moving onto Europe . The highly anticipated Rock Or Bust tour will head Down Under in November. The group, which began in 1973, kicked off the gigs at Coachella in California. From there it's onto Europe where they play Holland, Germany and Austria.

That sentiment came true this week when, after 73 years of marriage, William 'Wild Bill' Wilson and his wife Lillian Karr Wilson died just two minutes apart from each other. Both Lillian, 89, and Bill were Alzheimer's patients and for the last couple of years had to live in separate nursing homes. Lillian resided at Richmond Place in Lexington, while Bill stayed at the Thomson-Hood Veterans Center in Wilmore. After 73 years of marriage, high school sweethearts Doug Wilson, 93, and Lillian Kerr Wilson, 89, passed away just two minutes apart from each other this week . But on Tuesday their connection proved strong as ever when one of their sons, Doug, received a phone call at 3.52am to inform him that his father had passed away. Just five minutes later the phone rang again. Doug said it was his mother's nursing home, calling with the same sad news. 'We all look at it as a blessing,' Doug told the Lexington-Herald Leader, 'because we're going to have one funeral for both of them.' Doug, 66, believes it will also make it easier for the family to grieve. 'We’re looking at it as a celebration of life because they had a great life,' he told the Washington Post. The couple first met in Corbin, where they were both athletes and high school sweethearts. Doug told the Lexington-Herald Leader that his parents ran off to get married and that he doesn't believe 'either one of them had the blessings of their parents.' But that didn't stop the couple, who survived a war and a number of relocations through their long marriage. Bill enlisted in the Army when World War II began. After returning from Germany, he worked and managed various department and retail stores. Doug told the Washington Post that his mother, who he said 'had great taste', could be found working alongside her husband as she designed the showroom windows. The family, which also included Doug's brothers Mike and Terry, hopped around the state and country. There were setbacks along the way. The couple unsuccessfully tried to open a shopping center in Atlanta and then one of Bill's department stores burned down and couldn't reopen after they moved back to Kentucky. The couple first met in Corbin, Kentucky and, according to their son Doug, ran off and got married without either of their parents' blessing. They spent their lives supporting and working alongside each other . But Doug said his parents had a 'driving force' to make sure their three sons received the college education they never got to have. 'They stressed college so much,' Doug said. 'And they were so proud that they had three sons who had college degrees.' And there were successes. After managing a number of stores, Bill decided to open his own realty firm. It grew from an $800 investment into a $1million-dollar company. He would also flip foreclosures, remodeling the houses before putting them back on the market. Meanwhile Lillian would repaint, wallpaper and do the trim work on the homes while Doug did the carpentry work. 'We had a great time rehabbing houses together,' he said. Bill was also known for his long-running morning radio show, where he was known as 'Wild Bill' and would organize a number of promotions and contests, including a twist-dancing competition that was so popular the police had to be brought in. The nickname stuck with Bill long after his radio show ended. He was even called 'Wild Bill' at his nursing home, where he would sometimes reenact his show in the cafeteria. Doug said he regularly drove his mother to see her husband at the Veterans center. He said that, although the couple 'didn't have communication', he believes they were 'reading each other' just by having the chance to see each other. When Doug last saw his father the Sunday before his passing, he said Bill was wearing an oxygen mask and was 'barely hanging on'. To comfort him, Doug recited the opening that Bill used to say for every one of his radio shows. 'I just told him, ""This is Wild Bill Wilson, your red-headed, freckle-faced, snaggle-toothed, snuff-dipping buddy""'. 'And underneath the mask there, he grinned real big. He heard it. I was glad of that.' Friends and family will gather on Saturday evening for a 'Celebration of life' service in honor of the devoted couple.","William 'Wild Bill' Wilson, 93, and Lillian Karr Wilson, 89, were both Alzheimer's patients and had to live in separate nursing homes .

"The first signs of dark matter interacting with a force other than gravity may have been found. Until now it was thought that dark matter did not interact with anything other than gravity, earning it its ‘dark’ moniker and making its detection incredibly difficult. But the discovery of a ‘clump’ lagging behind a galaxy suggests that it may not be as oblivious to our universe as we thought. Durham University scientists studied a 'clump' of dark matter that appears to be lagging behind its galaxy - suggesting it interacts with itself. In this Hubble image, the lagging clump can be seen on the left of the central cluster. The distribution of dark matter in the cluster is shown with blue contour lines . Dark matter is confusing because it interacts with nothing - including itself. This is despite seeming to account for 85 per cent of the universe’s mass and having an observable effect on galaxies: without dark matter, our galaxies would ‘fall apart’ as they spin. Aside from gravity, though, dark matter seemed to just pass through the universe without interacting with any other mass, such as humans, planets or stars. Now an international team of researchers at Durham University has found a clump offset from a galaxy by 5,000 light-years, suggesting that is not the case. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up 85 per cent of the matter in the known universe. When it comes to the total energy in the universe, though, it's a different story. Astronomers have found that the total mass/energy content of the universe is split in the proportions 68 per cent dark energy, 27 per cent dark matter and 5 per cent 'normal' matter. Dark energy is an unknown force across the whole cosmos that seems to be accelerating the expansion of the universe. So the 85 per cent figure above relates only to the fraction of 'matter' that is dark. The discovery was made around one of the galaxies in the Abell 3827 cluster, 1.3 billion light-years away. Here, four galaxies are colliding around the centre of the cluster. The team used the European Southern Observatory’s (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, along with images from Hubble, to view Abell 3827. The offset is important because it is only possible if dark matter interacts with itself through forces other than gravity. If the particles collide with each other, the friction from the collisions would cause the dark matter to slow down, and fall behind the galaxy. The nature of that interaction is unknown; it could be caused by well-known effects or some unknown force. All that can be said at this point is that it is not gravity. But dark matter has never before been observed interacting in any way other than through the force of gravity - making the discovery of huge interest. ‘We used to think that dark matter just sits around, minding its own business, except for its gravitational pull,’ Dr Richard Massey from Durham University said. ‘But if dark matter were being slowed down during this collision, it could be the first evidence for rich physics in the dark sector - the hidden universe all around us.’ He added to MailOnline: 'This is the first time we've caught dark matter in the act of doing something interesting. 'Once the dark universe around us is allowed to interact at all, the possibilities for what it could get up to are rich and varied.' This image from the Nasa/Esa Hubble Space Telescope shows a zoomed out view of the galaxy cluster Abell 3827, 1.3 billion light-years away. The strange blue structures surrounding the central galaxies are gravitationally lensed views of a much more distant galaxy behind the cluster . Although dark matter cannot be seen, the team could deduce its location using a technique called gravitational lensing. The collision happened to take place directly in front of a much more distant, unrelated source. The mass of dark matter around the colliding galaxies severely distorted space-time, deviating the path of light rays coming from the distant background galaxy - and distorting its image into characteristic arc shapes. Our current understanding is that all galaxies exist inside clumps of dark matter, which is how they are able to survive without flinging themselves apart. The team used the European Southern Observatory’s (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, pictured, along with images from the Hubble Space Telescope, to make the discovery . 'We know that dark matter exists because of the way that it interacts gravitationally, helping to shape the universe, but we still know embarrassingly little about what dark matter actually is,' said team member Dr Liliya Williams of the University of Minnesota. 'Our observation suggests that dark matter might interact with forces other than gravity, meaning we could rule out some key theories about what dark matter might be.' The researchers note that more investigation will be needed into other effects that could also produce a lag. Similar observations of more galaxies, and computer simulations of galaxy collisions will need to be made. This result follows on from recent findings from the team which observed 72 collisions between galaxy clusters and found that dark matter interacts very little with itself. This latest study follows research by the same team last month that found dark matter interacts with itself very little - but the fact that it interacts at all is very exciting, said Dr Massey. Shown is the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1+2403 and its dark matter distribution, shown in blue, based on its gravitational interactions . The new work, however, concerns the motion of individual galaxies, rather than clusters of galaxies. Researchers said that the collision between these galaxies could have lasted longer than the collisions observed in the previous study - allowing the effects of even a tiny frictional force to build up over time and create a measurable lag. Taken together, the two results bracket the behaviour of dark matter for the first time. Dr Massey added: 'We are finally homing in on dark matter from above and below - squeezing our knowledge from two directions.'","Durham University scientists studied a 'clump' of dark matter .

"Still employed: Rolling Stone is not expected to take any action against Sabrina Rubin Erdely, whose reporting was roundly discredited . An independent review of Rolling Stone's story about an alleged violent gang rape at the University of Virginia said the story fell apart because of 'basic, even routine' failures of journalism. Professors at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism issued a 12,000-word autopsy of the discredited story Sunday night, going through its shortcomings step by step. Rolling Stone bosses commissioned the review after the story, by contributing editor Sabrina Rubin Erdely, was called into serious question. However, despite the uncompromising conclusions of the journalism experts, nobody will lose their job over the story. Jann Wenner, the publisher of Rolling Stone, confirmed to the New York Times that everybody would remain in their positions. He defended her reporting, and described the supposed rape victim as 'a really expert fabulist storyteller'. Erdely, who went to ground as the row over her article erupted, issued an apology in the wake of the review, admitting 'I did not go far enough'. Her piece credulously recounted the story of an anonymous student - referred to as Jackie - who said she was lured to the Phi Kappa Psi house and raped by a gang of seven men. It described the ordeal, during which Jackie said she was passed from man to man in an excruciating three hours of pain, during which she was also supposedly penetrated with a beer bottle upstairs during a pledging event. The article recounted the event in vivid, graphic detail based on Jackie's account. It said: 'There was a heavy person on top of her, spreading open her thighs, and another person kneeling on her hair, hands pinning down her arms, sharp shards digging into her back, and excited male voices rising all around her. 'When yet another hand clamped over her mouth, Jackie bit it, and the hand became a fist that punched her in the face. The men surrounding her began to laugh.' Scroll down for video . Report: The Columbia Journalism School is expected to release a review of the botched story Sunday night . Describing the moment she supposedly passed out from pain, it continued: 'Someone handed her classmate a beer bottle. Jackie stared at the young man, silently begging him not to go through with it. 'And as he shoved the bottle into her, Jackie fell into a stupor, mentally untethering from the brutal tableau, her mind leaving behind the bleeding body under assault on the floor.' The review spelled out extensive contact between Erdely and Jackie, spanning eight interviews. Erdely wrote 405 pages of notes about the story. Jackie also spent four hours speaking to a Rolling Stone fact-checker. Anonymous: Jackie has never been identified. Police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation . Erdely had asked repeatedly for the name of the supposed attacker, but Jackie said she was not 'comfortable' with the idea of him being contacted for the story. But they ultimately decided to rely on her for virtually all the information in the account, which led to inconsistencies not being discovered until after publication. Erdely asked Jackie again for the name once the public interrogation of her account began. This time she agreed - but it emerged she did not even know how to spell the surname of the man, referred to as 'Drew' in the story. Experts at Columbia concluded that Erdely, her editors, and the fact-checking department all failed to try hard enough to speak to the accused, and other people mentioned in the story. And, they said, when they did speak to organizations, including the fraternity and UVA, they provided so little information that there was no way for them to check the events themselves and flag any inconsistent information. They said that had they reached out to some people named - specifically friends whom Jackie spoke to immediately after the supposed rape - her credibility would have collapsed in time to ditch the story. Erdely asked to speak to one of the friends - fellow student Ryan Duffin - using Jackie as a go-between. Jackie told Erdely he refused and was 'incredulous' at the request, calling the Rolling Stone article a 's*** show'. Duffin later said that Jackie never spoke to him at all. Erdely admitted that if she had spoken to Duffin and realized the inconsistency, she would likely have dropped Jackie's story. Claims: The story published in November focused on a University of Virginia student named  Jackie who claimed to have been gang raped by seven men at the campus' Phi Kappa Psi fraternity two years ago. Above, the frat house on January 15, 2015 . Another possible way Erdely could have found out inconsistencies in the story would have been giving fuller details to the fraternity and UVA when asking them for comment, the review said. Stepehn Scipione, the chapter president of Phi Kappa, was asked to comment on the allegations without being given dates of the supposed attack or any details about who was involved. He told the review: 'It was complete bull***t. They weren't telling me what they were going to write about. They weren't telling me any dates or details.' When the full story was published, Phi Kappa Psi responded by pointing out there had been no party on the date Jackie gave. They also said that - despite claims of a pledging ritual taking place at the time - the fraternity house was then home to no pledges. The review concluded: 'Rolling Stone's repudiation of the main narrative in A Rape on Campus is a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable. 'The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking. 'The magazine set aside or rationalized as unnecessary essential practices of reporting that, if pursued, would likely have led the magazine's editors to reconsider publishing Jackie's narrative so prominently, if at all. 'The published story glossed over the gaps in the magazine's reporting by using pseudonyms and by failing to state where important information had come from.' It recommended that Rolling Stone tighten its procedures around fact-checking and offer more details when requesting comment from subjects. It also questioned the use of pseudonyms, and said the magazine should consider banning them. At the same time as publishing the review, Rolling Stone announced that it was 'officially retracting' the story, which has amassed more than 2.7million views online. The page where the story was hosted until Sunday night now redirected to the Columbia review, which has the subtitle 'An anatomy of a journalistic failure'. Sean Woods, one of Jackie's editors, described the scandal over the article as 'It's been an extraordinarily painful and humbling experience'. He later added: 'Ultimately, we were too deferential to our rape victim; we honored too many of her requests in our reporting. 'We should have been much tougher, and in not doing that, we maybe did her a disservice.' In a personal statement released online, Erdely said: 'Reading the Columbia account of the mistakes and misjudgements in my reporting was a brutal and humbling expereince. 'I want to offer my deepest apologies: to Rolling Stone's readers, to my Rolling Stone editors and colleagues, to the UVA community, and to any victims of sexual assault who may feel fearful as a resolut of my article. She said that as a reporter she must: 'weigh my compassion against my journalistic duty to find the truth. 'However, in the case of Jackie and her account of her traumatic rape, I did not go far enough to verify her story. 'I allowed my concern for Jackie's well-being, my fear of re-traumatizing her, and my confidence in her credibility to take the place of more questioning and more facts. These are mistakes I wlll not make again.'","Magazine published A Rape on Campus in November 2014 issue .

"Kitchens sell houses. They are the heart of the home, the hub of dinner parties and usually the ‘debrief of the day’ meeting room. So what makes a great kitchen? It’s a balance between a warm and inviting design combined with practical efficiency. After judging the kitchens on The Block last week and taking into account what buyers look for in a kitchen, property buyers expert Frank Valentic gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design. Activity based design: . The key to ensuring the practicality of your kitchen is to zone areas of the kitchen based on activities e.g. food preparation, cooking, clean-up etc. with storage for those activities within those zones. These areas need to be easily accessible to each other and flow well (e.g. food preparation near the cooking area etc.). There’s no use in a pretty kitchen when your preparation area is on the opposite end of the kitchen from your stovetop. Bench space: . This is one of the most common bugbears when buyers are looking at kitchens. Enough bench/counter space is crucial not only for food preparation but also for serving when entertaining. Scroll down for video . There was plenty of bench space in Dea and Darren’s kitchen on The Block . Storage space: . Plenty of storage space is essential and you need to find a good balance between design aesthetics and practicality. Take into account what’s most important for you in terms of storage, as I recommended a Walk-in pantry vs a Butler’s pantry, consider whether having extra space for preparation and a large area to hide your appliances is paramount to you or whether a larger area for food storage is more vital. Judge Neale Whitaker said Dea and Darren's kitchen 'didn't have their usual the flare, confidence or pizzazz' Sufficient lighting: . As the Buyer’s Advocate Jury discussed when viewing Josh and Charlotte’s kitchen, it’s not an area of the home that you can get away with the ‘bare bones’ when it comes to lighting. For the purpose of safety in food preparation and cooking, good lighting is paramount. Specifically in the preparation, cooking and cleaning areas, it’s essential to have good quality lighting. Josh and Charlotte’s kitchen lacked lighting above the benchtop according to Frank Valentic . Splash backs: . In the cooking and cleaning zones of the kitchen, splashbacks are important and while design is also important, it shouldn’t be at the expense of practicality. Try and find a good medium between something that looks great but is also low maintenance and easy to clean! The judges were shocked that Josh and Charlotte's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given Charlotte's food styling background . Ventilation: . Akin to the bathroom, the kitchen requires great ventilation so ensure you have a good quality range hood and windows that can be opened. Valentic says there was 'great ventilation' in Tim and Anastasia’s kitchen . Tim and Anastasia had a range of issues this week with their kitchen, mainly due to it not being their original design, the couple were shocked with the largely positive feedback from the judges . Flow on: . The overall design of your home really needs to come into play when designing a kitchen. The flow between the living areas, specifically dining areas and the kitchen are important. As we mentioned when judging Jess and Ayden’s and Tim and Anastasia’s kitchens, a kitchen with a flow on to an outdoor entertaining area is very much in demand at the moment and a huge plus for buyers. Jess and Ayden’s kitchen had a 'great flow' on from the living and dining areas . Ayden and Jess were able to edge ahead of their rival teams to pull off their second room reveal win and add $10,000 to their kitty . Valentic's example of a kitchen at 12 Kyarra Street in Hampton that would attract buyers' attention . Frank Valentic gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design . In the end, Dea and Darren’s kitchen for the Buyer’s Advocate Judges showed the best balance between design and a practical layout. While a kitchen is a very personal area of the home, make sure to take into account re-sale when renovating so that it doesn’t affect the value of your property when you re-sell it. However, if The Block: Triple Threat judges were the buyers this week, they would have walked away from each of the team's apartments without placing an offer. Judging trio Shaynna Blaze, Neale Whitaker and Darren Palmer were all left largely unimpressed by the kitchens delivered by the Blockheads on last Sunday night's episode. The lacklustre performance, in the eye of the judges, meant that Ayden and Jess were able to edge ahead of their rival teams to pull off their second room reveal win of the series and add $10,000 to their kitty. The judges were shocked that Josh and Charlotte's had overlooked lighting over the bench top given Charlotte's food styling background. Tim and Anastasia had a range of issues this week with their kitchen, mainly due to it not being their original design, the couple were shocked with the largely positive feedback from the judges. Meanwhile, Whitaker said Dea and Darren's kitchen 'didn't have their usual the flare, confidence or pizzazz'.

"A 32-year-old English teacher who admitted having sex with a 16-year-old student posted a celebratory selfie on Instagram just hours after discovering she had avoided a prison sentence. Shelley Dufresnein from St Charles Parish, Louisiana, took a plea deal on Thursday that gets her out of serving any time behind or having to register as a sex offender. When she returned home from court she uploaded an image of her grinning to the social media site alongside the message: 'My mood today,' followed by three smiley faces. Followers started congratulating her on the outcome below the picture, prompting her to respond: 'I'm so relieved.' However she is still facing charges over a threesome she had with the same student at Destrehan High School and another teacher. 'My mood today': Shelley Dufresnein from St Charles Parish, Louisiana, posted this selfie on Instagram after discovering she had avoided jail - despite admitting she had sex with a 16-year-old student . Reaction: Followers started congratulating her on the outcome below the picture, prompting her to respond: 'I'm so relieved'. However she still faces charges she had a threesome with the student and another teacher . 'Free' woman: The 32-year-old, confessed in court Thursday to having sex with a 16-year-old English student in exchange for a plea deal that gets her out of prison time. The married mother-of-three pictured above leaving the St Charles Parish Courthouse on Thursday . Double the trouble: Dufresne (right) and fellow teacher Rachel Respess, 24 (left), were arrested in September when a student at Destrehan High School started bragging that he was sleeping with both of them . How they met: The unidentified 16-year-old victim was a student in Dufresne's English class last year. Respess taught the same student English the year prior . She was arrested in September after the teen in question started bragging to friends that he had slept with two teachers. An investigation later revealed that the unidentified teen had sex with both his current English teacher at the time, Dufresne, and his English teacher from the prior year, 24-year-old Rachel Respess - including an alleged a threesome with both at Respess's house. Though she originally pleaded not guilty in November, married mother-of-three Dufresne changed course and confessed to the sordid act at a status conference in court on Thursday. Comfortable: As part of her plea deal, Dufresne will not have to serve any jail time. Instead she will undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment program, surrender her teacher's license and stay away from the victim and his family . In exchange for pleading guilty to a count of obscenity, the original charge of carnal knowledge of a juvenile will be held for the three years Dufresne is under probation for obscenity. Dufresne must also undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment, surrender her teacher's license, and stay away from the now 17-year-old victim and his family. If she complies with all of those terms, the carnal knowledge charge will be dropped after three years and she will not have to register as a sex offender. The carnal knowledge charge carries a maximum of ten years in prison and a fine for $5,000. Judge Anne Simon signed off on the plea deal, after three other judges - including Dufresne's father Judge Emile St Pierre - removed themselves from the case. District Attorney Joel Chaisson II heralded the deal as a success. 'I want to thank my special prosecutor, Julie Cullen, for her efforts to reach a fair resolution of the case and to secure a felony guilty plea, thereby sparing the juvenile victim in this matter from having to testify at a public trial,' the DA said in a statement. The parents of the victim were in court on Thursday, and according to media who attended the meeting, they were not happy with the settlement. However, Dufresne's legal battle is likely not over yet. When her relationship with the teen was exposed last fall, it was revealed that she had sex with the teen at a residence in Montz (Dufresne and her family live in Montz) and one in Kenner between August 22 and September 27. Dufresne still faces the possibility of jail time for allegedly having a threesome with the same student and Respess at Respess' residence in another Louisiana parish (pictured above). Neither woman has been formally arraigned on those charges yet . Above, Dufresne's home in Montz, Louisiana. The charges she settled Thursday had to do with sex acts she and the 16-year-old committed at a residence in that town . Both towns fall under different parishes, and Jefferson Parish has yet to formally arraign Dufresne on charges of carnal knowledge with a juvenile, indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a child. It was at Respess' home in Kenner that the teachers allegedly had a three-way with the student after a high school football game in September, and that is the incident they await arraignment on. Since her arrest on September 30, Dufresne has remained free on bond. While she has been under house arrest during this time, the rules of the sequester have been loosened so that she can attend therapy sessions, Jazzercize classes and help drive her 3, 5, and 7-year-old children to school and extracurricular activities. However, she had to spend 8pm to 7am inside her home during the weekdays. Both Dufresne and Respess were suspended from their jobs without pay following their arrests last fall.","Shelley Dufresnein of St Charles Parish, Louisiana, took a plea deal .

"Everyone has parts of their body they would like to change but how much would you pay - and how much pain would you be willing to go through - to be rid of your hang up? It's a question explored by BBC documentary Inside Harley Street which interviews some of the patients paying thousands for private cosmetic treatments. Harley Street is in an affluent part of London and it's famed for attracting business from those who don't have to consider the cost. Scroll down for video . Michael Pulman, 33, a care worker from Walsall,  spent £7,500 on a hair transplant to boost his self-esteem . But for some of the customers who show up at the clinics on the street, like Michael Pulman, 33, a care worker from Walsall, the money is a lot to spend in the hope it will turn their lives around. Michael, has spent £7,500 on a hair transplant which he believes will boost his self-esteem and happiness. His mother, Joy, who never spends money on herself and wears £5.99 shoes from Oxfam, is amazed her son is prepared to spend so much on changing his appearance. She points out that he could go on a luxury holiday for the next seven years for the same price. But Michael said of the treatment: 'It will make me feel more complete. It is a lot of money but this means a lot to me, good holidays come and go but this will last a lifetime and make me a happier more confident person.' Joy, however, is worried that her son, a divorced father of two, is pinning too much on the hair transplant changing his fortunes of her son. She said: 'I'm just worried he will be disappointed. He's pinned so much on this, he has looked forward it to, I think he feels his life will change dramatically.' Andrea Carter, 72, from Leighton Buzzard, has her baggy jowls removed . Another person keen to boost their self-esteem via a Harley Street surgeon is Emma Tallon, 27. She paid £3,100 for liposuction on her thighs, which she feels are too big. She's felt self conscious about them for ten years. She said: 'I just want to feel normal, to feel like a normal shape and do things without thinking about it all the time.' Of the price she is paying to have the body she wants, she said: 'It is expensive. I am pretty comfortable but it's a lot of money. I think it's a price worth paying.' Following the procedure, Emma said she had no regrets but the operation was 'a lot harder than I thought it was be'. She said: 'My legs were black and swollen for weeks, at first I felt like my legs were going to explode. 'I haven't had regrets but I didn't realise how much it takes a toll on your body.' Also featured on the show is Andrea Carter, 72, from Leighton Buzzard, who has had a number of cosmetic treatments over the years - and wasn't even put off going under the knife after a botched tummy tuck in Latvia which she admitted 'almost killed me'. Over the years, she's also had a boob job, face lift, liposuction and work on her eyes and nose. Now she wants another face lift costing thousands of pounds to rid herself of her baggy jowls. When asked by her surgeon if she understood the risk of surgery - and whether she thought it was worth taking for a cosmetic procedure - she said: 'It's an operation but what the heck, I just want that to go away (referring to the baggy skin below her neck). I want to have my chin back' Her husband Nick adds: If that's what she wants I'll support her.' But after the costly treatment, he admits that he can't tell the difference in his wife's profile. 'I'm not very observant, I can't see the change but if she can I'm happy,' he said.

"A bloody and wounded shop owner has been pictured just moments before he died from his injuries on another day of xenophobic attacks in South Africa. The man who is believed to be from Mozambique was taken to a hospital in Johannesburg where he tragically passed away. At least six people have been killed and many thousands displaced from their homes since the violence against immigrants erupted in the city of Durban several weeks ago. Despite making 30 arrests overnight, police are struggling to subdue the machete-wielding gangs who ransacked immigrant-owned shops in the slums of Johannesburg. Many families in the city who now fear for their lives have abandoned their homes and fled to a makeshift refugee camp which lies just east of Johannesburg. South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has called for an end to the 'shocking and unacceptable' attacks on immigrants from Africa and South Asia, saying: 'No amount of frustration and anger can ever justify the attacks on foreign nationals.' Scroll down for video . Victim: A shop owner believed to be from Mozambique (pictured) has died from his injuries amid the xenophobic violence that has gripped South Africa . Wounded: Bloodied and hurt, the man was taken to a hospital in Johannesburg where he eventually died . Help: A passer-by comes to the aid of the shop owner who was fatally attacked in poor area of Johannesburg and later died in hospital . Dying: He is one of at least six who have been killed in the country this week as armed gangs target foreigners in a spate of xenophobic attacks . Looted: A woman sifts through the remains of the ransacked store she was renting to foreign nationals who are now being targeted by violent groups in Johannesburg . Attacks: At least six people have been killed and many thousands displaced from their homes since the violence against immigrants erupted in the city of Durban several weeks ago . Violent: Gangs of anti-immigrant protesters armed with hammers, knives and machetes have been reeking havoc in South Africa . Scorched: 12 people were arrested overnight as anti-foreigner attacks in South Africa spread to parts of  Johannesburg where rioters torched tires (pictured) Dangerous: Despite making 30 arrests overnight, police have struggled to control the gangs who have torched cars and shops owned by foreign nationals . Refugee: This child who awaits much-needed hospital treatment is one of dozens whose family has been forced to abandon their homes in Johannesburg for a makeshift camp in the city . Protection: Foreign nationals who fear for their lives have gathered at a relief camp (pictured) set up in Primrose, East of Johannesburg . Innocence lost: One of the many refugees now seeking shelter in Johannesburg is two-year-old toddler Knowledge (pictured) Pain: One man needed emergency treatment for his injuries at the refugee camp set up for foreign nationals fleeing attacks from South Africans . Victims: South African President Jacob Zuma has said the majority foreign nationals (pictured) being targeted by angry, armed mobs are living in the country legally and contribute to its economy . Anger: Zuma has called for an end to the 'shocking and unacceptable' attacks on immigrants from Africa, some of whom now occupy a refugee camp east of Johannesburg (pictured) Homeless: Some South Africans blame immigrants coming to the country (pictured) of taking jobs and opportunities away from them . Justification: But South African President Zuma has said 'no amount of frustration and anger can ever justify the attacks on foreign nationals' There was a heavy police presence in the Alexandra township as armed rioters looted shops, burned tires and built street barricades overnight. And armed policeman fired rubber bullets at the groups who have torched shops and cars in the poor areas of Johannesburg in recent days. Police claim that attacks on immigrants - many of whom are from other African countries - have largely subsided in the country's east where the violence began. With unemployment and poverty levels high in the country, some South Africans have accused the immigrants of taking jobs and opportunities away from them. A police spokesman said the 30 people arrested in Johannesburg overnight will be charged for 'public violence, malicious damage to property, house breaking and theft'. Thousands of foreigners in the country have fled their homes and the country amid the violence, escaping to makeshift camps as well as neighbouring countries like Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique. The surge of violence against immigrants is widely blamed on a speech made by King Goodwill Zwelithini, a traditional Zulu leader who blamed the foreigners living South Africa for its high crime rate and said they must 'take their bags and go'. He has been accused of 'igniting' the Zulus who comprise one of South Africa's largest ethnic groups by saying 'we must deal with our own lice' in a speech broadcast by a local radio station. The King has since said his words were misinterpreted but for some, Zwelithini simply articulated what many were feeling. Protest: South African demonstrators have taken to the streets in Johannesburg in a bid to raise awareness of the xenophobic attacks taking place in its township . Furious: And in neighbouring Mozambique, hundreds have been protesting the violence being inflicted on their countrymen in South Africa . Safety: As people in Maputo, Mozambique (pictured) protest against the violence in South Africa, its government has offered to evacuate its citizens from the country . Rise up: Mozambique nationals (pictured) are furious at the violence against their citizens in Johannesburg were four people were killed in a week where shops owned by foreigners were looted back in January . Blame: Protesters in Mozambique (pictured) hold up signs blaming South African President Jacob Zuma for the violence befalling immigrants in the country . Demonstrators: Some South Africans (pictured) have tried to raise awareness for the xenophobic violence but some blame the immigrants for taking jobs in a time of severe unemployment . Armed: At least six people have died since South Africans wielding machetes and other weapons (pictured) began attacking and looting properties owned by fellow Africans . Brutal: The surge of violence against immigrants is widely blamed on a speech made by a traditional Zulu leader who blamed foreigners for a rise in hate crime . Response: Police in Johannesburg (pictured) have been firing rubber bullets to subdue the violent gangs in the city . Battle: A South African police officer trains his sights on Zulu protesters who were demonstrated in front of their hostel in the Jeppestown district of Johannesburg (pictured) Retaliation: But police also claim that attacks on immigrants - many of whom are from other African countries - have largely subsided . The violence has also been blamed on high unemployment and while recent figures put it at 25 per cent, economists believe it is much higher and crippling the country with widespread poverty and a glaring class divide. Meanwhile foreign nationals have condemned South Africa's police for failing to protect them and even stirring hostility. The government says it is addressing complaints about undocumented migrants but many foreign nationals are living legally in South Africa and contributing to economic development. But the situation has become so severe that the government of Malawi has hired buses to repatriate 500 of its nationals, according to the country's Information Minister. Kenya has also offered to evacuate any of their citizens who feel threatened and on just today, Mozambique has temporarily blocked a road leading to South Africa. 60 people died during similar unrest in the country in 2008 and in January this year, four people were killed in a week where shops owned by foreigners were looted in Soweto, Johannesburg. Furious: A terrifying woman covered in black soot (pictured) began screaming at a group of foreign nationals in Johannesburg . Savage: Rioters have armed themselves with sticks, knives and baseball bats as they attack immigrants in Johannesburg (pictured) Rioters: The violence in South Africa has also been blamed on high unemployment and a glaring class divide . Vicious: With a total population of about 50 million, South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million immigrants who are now being targeted by brutal gangs (pictured) Zimbabwe's Information Minster Jonathan Moyo tweeted that 'xenophobia today can easily mutate into genocide tomorrow' adding that  the Zulu king should 'extinguish what he ignited'. While in Somalia's capital of Mogadishu, some locals believed their countrymen would have been safer in their troubled native country than in South Africa. One resident of the city said: 'This must become a lesson for them to return home... Otherwise, they will be eliminated one by one."" It is also a major destination for asylum seekers and currently houses more than 300,000 of them according to projections by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. With a total population of about 50 million, South Africa is home to an estimated 5 million immigrants from countries including Somalia, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Malawi.","A shop owner from Mozambique has died from his injuries in a Johannesburg hospital amid xenophobic violence .

"Two teenage girls were savagely beaten by a crowd of people, including parents and other adults, in a New Jersey park as onlookers videotaped the riot and encouraged the violence to continue. Destiny Cooke, 16, and Lajahia Cooke, 17, were brutally kicked, punched, stomped and shoved around by the mob, who can be heard laughing during the five-minute video filmed in Trenton. Lajahia said one girl ripped out her earring out before the girl's mother threw a rock at her ear, leaving a gash that required 12 stitches. Scroll down for video . Sisters Destiny Cooke, 16, and Lajahia Cooke, 17, were brutally kicked, punched, stomped and shovedy a crowd of people, including grown adults and parents, in a park in Trenton, New Jersey . People can be heard laughing throughout the video and chanting 'they gettin' busy!' or 'let her get her!' And Destiny has been left with a bald spot after someone grabbed a chunk of her hair. Throughout the video various people hold the girls down so that others can punch them over and over again. One guy can be heard gleefully screaming 'they gettin' busy!' At one point, according to ABC 7, someone tries to break up the fight but an adult is determined to let it continue, screaming 'let her get her!' But perhaps the most disturbing part of the video is when, while Destiny is on the ground, her skirt rides up and men proceed to laugh and take pictures, one even exclaiming 'somebody smack that!' Destiny said she was play fighting with her friend at the park on a nice day during spring break last Monday before the riot broke out. She said people saw her and her friend and got the wrong idea. They came back with a crowd of people who, she said, were looking for a fight. When Lajahia tried to step in and help Destiny, all hell broke loose. 'It just escalated from there,' Destiny told NJ.com. 'Just like a riot broke out, they just started hitting us.' Destiny said she called her mother and asked her to pick the girls, telling her there were 'grown women' walking up to the sisters. That's when then the 16-year-old first got hit, causing her to drop her phone. 'I just had to defend myself,' she told MY 9 NJ. The girls said they saw multiple police cars at the park as they left. Destiny said no one got out to offer the girls any help, even as Destiny's nose was bleeding. Destiny (pictured) has been left with a bald spot after people pulled on her hair throughout the fight . Lajahia said one girl ripped an earring out of her ear, and then the girl's mother threw a rock at her ear, leaving a gash that required 12 stitches . 'They just stayed in their cars and just looked at us,' Destiny said. 'I just felt like we were out there by ourselves and there were people stomping us on our head,' she told NJ.com. 'Nobody was out there trying to help us - nobody.' According to police spokesman Lt. Stephen Varn, patrol officers received a 911 call for a reported street fight. Two patrol units arrived at the scene of the brawl and reported that no other police officers were needed. Trenton Mayor Eric Jackson released a statement saying he was angered 'by the lack of good Samaritans who should have stepped forward to come to the aid of these victims'. A park ranger has since been installed to monitor Greg Grant Park. Police Captain Eddie Gonzalez called the video 'sickening' and said the department had identified 'a number of individuals that were a part of this'. 'We will take swift action with them very, very shortly,' he said. 'Warrants will be issued in the very near future.' Destiny said police just 'stayed in their cars' and stared as she and her sister Lajahia (pictured) left the park after being brutally beaten .","Destiny Cooke, 16, and Lajahia Cooke, 17 were beaten by a mob in Trenton .

"Across the globe, more than 42 million children under the age of five are overweight or obese. And the rising tide of obesity extends into adulthood with 1.9 billion adults worldwide overweight, 600 million of which are classified as obese. But with experts desperately trying to find the answer, a poignant debate rages. Should fast food and sugary drink companies be allowed to advertise their junk food to children? Should TV ads promoting unhealthy food and drink be banned until the watershed, or wiped out altogether to save adults' waistlines too? A recent survey by the British Heart Foundation showed two fifths of parents are badgered by their children each week to buy food after seeing it advertised on TV, prompting the charity to deliver a 30,000 strong petition asking the Government to ban junk food adverts being shown before the 9pm watershed . A recent British Heart Foundation survey quizzed more than 2,000 parents with children under the age of 16. It showed two fifths of them are badgered by their children each week to buy food after seeing it advertised on TV, and feel that TV junk food adverts make it difficult to help their children eat a healthy diet. If you are a parent like me, you are probably nodding knowingly about now. There is plenty of scientific evidence to back up our frustrations too – showing that food commercials aimed at children focus on products high in fat, salt and sugar, and that youngsters develop positive attitudes towards the foods they see advertised. Despite regulation, children in the UK are still being exposed to more TV advertising for unhealthy than healthy food items, even at peak children's viewing times. What's more, regulation doesn't prevent the advertising of unhealthy products during programmes in the 'family entertainment' bracket, which include some of the most popular television programmes watched by children such as X-Factor and Britain's Got Talent. Seven in ten parents said they would like stricter regulation on the food industry's use of advertising. Good on them. The BHF has therefore just delivered a 30,000 strong petition, asking Government to ban junk food adverts from being shown before the 9pm watershed, to help protect our children from making unhealthy choices. Do you think the big food and drink manufacturers are unduly worried about this? Not when they can use one of our national icons to act as a giant advertising hoarding instead. Dr Sally Norton criticised Coca-Cola's sponsorship of the London Eye, noting it gives the company the chance to advertise to almost four million visitors a year . As someone at the forefront of managing obesity, I am furious that we are allowing blatant advertising to influence our children in other ways. Take Coca-Cola's sponsorship of the London Eye. With London Eye staff apparently wearing Coca-Cola branded uniforms to match the promotional material displayed around this family attraction, the company gets the chance to advertise to 3.75 million direct visitors a year. What's more, we will do plenty of advertising for them as we promote the 'Coca-Cola' London Eye, our top paid-for tourist attraction, around the world. As Coca-Cola knows all too well, linking its product to happy and exciting events such as visiting the London Eye is likely to forever link Coca-Cola to the idea of 'fun' in the minds of young, impressionable kids (and adults). Dr Norton backs the British Heart Foundation's bid to ban TV junk food ads before 9pm . Merlin Entertainments, who own the London Eye, said customers were able to make their own minds up about what to include in their diets. True – but the stark truth is that we aren't making the best choices, with two thirds of us overweight, a quarter of us obese and the NHS spending £6 billion pounds a year on obesity. That same 'failure of personal responsibility' meant the Government recognised that we needed extra help to tackle smoking – and widespread advertising bans and preventing smoking inside public buildings was implemented. In just the same way, we can't tackle obesity alone and need help – not giant Coca-Cola branded wheels reminding us of the sugar-laden temptations it promotes. Reducing TV advertising to children as the British Heart Foundation are suggesting, will, of course reduce the number of junk food advertisements children see. But, as the London Eye disgrace shows, junk food advertising isn't limited to TV. There are plenty of ways by which companies can market to kids or adults outside of TV advertising and the regulations for non-broadcast advertising are currently weak or non-existent. Our children seem to spend an increasing amount of time online, actively engaging in social media, and the junk food and drink manufacturers are busy providing games, social networking apps and other tools to promote their brands in cyberspace where the adults often fear to tread. A study by the Children's Food Campaign, of 100 websites featuring food likely to be bought or requested by children, found that more than 80 per cent of online adverts were associated with foods classed as less healthy and therefore not allowed to be advertised during children's TV programmes. Yet more than 75 per cent featured child-friendly characters, competitions, downloads and links to social media apps that directly engaged with kids. This is because the internet regulations don't prevent our kids being targeted and manipulated in this way. This 21st century method of targeting our teens is a sneaky way of tapping into a 'screen-obsessed' generation. She says: 'As Coca-Cola knows all too well, linking its product to happy and exciting events such as visiting the London Eye is likely to forever link Coca-Cola to the idea of 'fun' in the minds of impressionable kids' Sponsorship, whether of tourist attractions or sporting events like the Olympics, is another great way of ensuring that products trigger positive connections – harnessing the feel-good factor, which can last well into the future. Interestingly, research has also shown that companies seen to be involved in 'charitable' activities or corporate social responsibility can lead consumers to infer that their products are healthier and even lower in calories, leading them to consume more. Their good deeds create a 'health halo' effect, just in the same way labelling and packaging can persuade consumers that they are buying a healthy, 'natural' products for themselves or their children. Sneaky junk food advertising is invading all aspects of life – how can we resist? So, it's a big 'yes please' to banning junk food advertising before 9pm. But don't think for a minute that this will deter manufacturers of the high sugar, high fat, processed food that provides little, if any, nutritional benefit for our kids. Plenty of other advertising opportunities are open and they are busy working on how to manipulate us and our kids into buying more and more of the heavily processed rubbish that is damaging our health.

"George Osborne today brushed off Labour's class war attacks, mocking Harriet Harman on live television over the fact they both went to the same private school. Challenged about claims senior Tories are 'posh boys', Ms Harman, Labour's deputy leader, insisted they were only 'standing up for people at the top'. But sharing a breakfast TV sofa with her was Mr Osborne, who said that as they both went to St Paul's School in London, 'the posh boy attack always sounds a bit thin'. Scroll down for video . Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman and Tory Chancellor George Osborne, who both went to the same school, shared a sofa on the TV this morning . In the 1980s, Mr Osborne attended St Paul's School for boys, where a place for a pupil boarding costs now £10,800-a-year. Ms Harman went to St Paul's Girls School in the 1960s . In the 1980s, Mr Osborne attended St Paul's School for boys, where a place for a pupil boarding costs £10,800-a-year. Ms Harman, who went to St Paul's Girls School in the 1960s, has repeatedly accused the Tories of being 'completely out of touch'. She has previously faced the wrath of Labour backbenchers when she sent her son and daughter to selective grammar schools. Appearing on BBC One's Andrew Marr show, Ms Harman complained about Tory attacks on Ed Miliband that he 'stabbed his brother in the back' for the Labour leadership. Host Andrew Marr asked: 'Is that somehow worse than accusing George Osborne and David Cameron of being 'posh boys'? Is there any difference really?' Challenged about claims senior Tories are 'posh boys', Ms Harman, Labour's deputy leader, insisted they were only 'standing up for people at the top'. Ms Harman did not resile from the class-based attacks, and added: 'Well I think we're saying they're standing up for people at the top and everybody else has been suffering and the recovery hasn't reached people. 'But that is quite different from saying that as Prime Minister Ed Miliband would stab this country in the back.' But sitting barely three feet away on the couch, Mr Osborne shot back: 'Well Harriet and I went to the same school, so the posh boy attack always sounds a bit thin when coming from her. 'But the point I'd make is we've got a really positive vision for this country and actually I've found this campaign enormously energising and exciting. 'And I go round the country - people are switched on, people do care about this country's future.' Ms Harman attacked the Tories over their commitment to spend an extra £8billion on the NHS, insisting it was 'absolutely illusory' Earlier Ms Harman said Conservative plans for 'extreme' spending cuts would inevitably mean further cutbacks to health. 'The reality is that the spending programme that they have put forward is a threat to cut the NHS. It is absolutely illusory. 'I don't think that people will believe it anyway. People know that they find it harder to see their GP since the Tories came into government, they know that they wait longer in accident and emergency and that waiting lists are starting to grow.' Mr Osborne insisted, however, that the Conservatives had shown in government that they were able to make the savings necessary to deliver additional funding for the NHS. 'We have a balanced plan to grow our economy, to make savings in government including in welfare to fund our NHS each and every year,' he said. 'We have to make similar savings each year that we have made for five years of this parliament but for two years. 'We have a track record in this parliament where we found almost £8 billion extra in real terms for the National Health Service in very, very difficult economic circumstances so we have proved our mettle, we have proved our ability to stand behind the National Health Service in this parliament. We can do it in the next.'","Tory Chancellor mocks Labour's deputy leader as they share TV sofa .

"Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor-made for a power-sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband's puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon's manifesto overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP’s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called ‘modest’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total £180billion over five years. Scotland’s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a ‘progressive alliance’ for people ‘right across the UK’. ‘There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,’ she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Today’s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election, when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed, there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) lose their seats . The latest Scotland-wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent, up three, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent, down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures, including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s election campaign coordinator, Douglas Alexander, are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a ‘strong team’ of SNP MPs in Westminster would help ‘rebalance the UK - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the City of London, which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected’. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year’s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. ‘We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland’s voice really mattered. Indeed, we were told that Scotland shouldn’t leave the UK but lead the UK,’ she said. ‘So it is more than a bit rich, now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system, for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland’s voice shouldn’t be heard or that Scotland’s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.’ However, the First Minister will face tough questions at today’s launch over her plans for ‘full fiscal autonomy’ or effective ‘home rule’, which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies  has predicted that a ‘fiscally autonomous’ Scotland would have a £7.6billion black hole in its finances.","Nicola Sturgeon will today unveil SNP manifesto as a 'bid to lead the UK'

"It was the moment a man, hands open in peace, stood up to a swastika-tattooed neo-nazi with his fists clenched in rage. A striking picture, taken by photographer Kenji Wardenclyffe, captured the explosive moment during a Melbourne protest against the 'Islamisation' of Australia. The dramatic scenes occurred after Reclaim Australia, an anti-Islam group, organised protests at major cities across Australia, which were countered by anti-racism activists who held rallies in the same locations. The Reclaim Australia event in Melbourne was also crashed by neo-nazis, who spectacularly clashed with anti-racism groups. Scroll down for video . A number of men with shaved heads and tattoos of the swastika (left) appeared at the event and attempted to start a fight with anti-racism protesters (right) 'It was very intense,' Kenji Wardenclyffe told Daily Mail Australia. 'The neo-nazi definitely seemed to be instigating, trying to start a fight with the anti-racism group. The other man in the photo stepped in and was trying to keep the peace. 'He kept his hands open, he was trying to stop a fight from breaking out.' The violent intent of the bald man was proven elsewhere at the rally, when he was photographed with one fist gripping another protester's shirt and the other raised to punch the man in the face. Violent intent: At the rally, the man involved in the standoff was seen trying to throw a punch at another protester as the scene descended into violence . One man appeared to be knocked out cold in the melee and was left lying on the ground . Mr Wardenclyffe said he was pushed around by protesters throughout the day, and some of his camera equipment was broken by people attempting to stop him from taking photos. 'It was a very angry atmosphere - it definitely seemed some of the people on the Reclaim Australia side were there looking to start a fight,' he said. 'It was very tense.' In a video of the event, it also appears to show the moment a man throw a punch at the head of a female anti-racism protester. Despite Reclaim Australia's promise of a peaceful protest, a number of men with shaved heads and tattoos of the swastika appeared at the event and attempted to intimidate anti-racism protesters. Reclaim Australia describe themselves as 'patriotic Australians' who protest against Sharia Law, Halal tax and Islam. They say they want 'compulsory singing of our national anthem weekly in every school in Australia' and want the government to 'refuse entry to anyone who has fought overseas against our ADF or minimum 15 years jail term.' In these photos, taken by freelance photographer Kenji Wardenclyffe, a man with a swastika tattoo came head to head with one of the anti-racism protesters and attempted to intimidate them into backing off. Wearing a Harley Davidson sleeveless hoodie, which showed off his sleeve of tattoos, the bald man attempted to start a fight with the protesters against racism, who stood against him in defiance . Police were forced to separate the neo-Nazis and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country . Wearing a Harley Davidson sleeveless hoodie, which showed off his sleeve of tattoos, the bald man attempted to start a fight with the protesters against racism, who stood against him in defiance. Police were forced to separate  supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country. Crowd numbers continued to grow throughout the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics after the ugly clashes. Speaking to Buzzfeed, photographer Mr Wardenclyffe said one of the anti-racism protesters stood out in front of the rest to stop him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi appeared and pushed through the crowd and began to yell at the (left-wing protestors),' Mr Wardenclyffe said. Police were forced to separate Reclaim Australia supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country . 'The neo-Nazi then got in the face of the man in my photo with sunglasses who had moved into a position to prevent him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi yelled at him in a manner which seemed to be an attempt to start a fight, but the guy with sunglasses remained calm and didn’t engage.' A clash of anti-Islam and anti-racism groups turned dangerous and violent during protests in Melbourne . Melbourne police formed a barrier between the separate rallies to attempt to disperse the protesters . It comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups has mocked protests . There was never a violent exchange between the groups however the men with the swastika's moved through the crowd taunting the anti-racism protesters. The clash comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups mocked  protests being held around Australia last week. However, organisers behind the Sydney protest were quick to disassociate themselves with the account. Crowd numbers grew during the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics . Across Australia, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, but Sydney and Melbourne drew the biggest crowd . 'It's not us,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Ours is @reclaim_aus.' Across the country, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, with events in Sydney and Melbourne appearing to have drawn the biggest crowds. About 500 people attended the rally held in Martin Place, Sydney, which included speeches from former Australia Defence League member Shermon Burgess and Rise Up! Australia Party NSW President Norm Bishop. Two people were taken away by police officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally . More than 100 police officers, eleven mounted on horses were used to form the separation wall . Several were injured during the violent rally that saw hundreds of people protest for anti-racism . There was a strong police presence throughout the protest, which included riot police. Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally. One took the microphone and told the crowd they should be 'ashamed'. Several more were injured in the combative protests, according to reports.

"Dark tourism is on the rise, with perhaps the best example of such a phenomenon being the ever-increasing interest in Chernobyl as a holiday destination. April 26, 2016 marks the 30th anniversary of the explosion, which was one of the worst nuclear accidents that the world has ever seen. In recent years, visits to the nuclear explosion site have increased exponentially, with Kiev-based tour company, SoloEast, estimating that it takes approximately 10,000 tourists there each year. Scroll down for video . In recent years, the Chernobyl nuclear explosion site, and nearby ghost town of Pripyat, Ukraine, have seen an increase in tourist interest . In 1986, Reactor 4 in the Chernobyl power plant exploded, sending radioactive particles into the air above the city of Pripyat, north of Kiev. At the time, the area was part of the former Soviet Union, but is now Ukraine. The Exclusion Zone, a nearly 50kilometre (31-mile) radius of contamination, runs around the power plant, although levels have now returned to those which are safe for brief visits to the area. However, such visitations are highly regulated and permitted only as part of an organised private tour. However, visits to the 50-kilometre Exclusion Zone, a contamination radius guarded by security, are highly regulated . Several private tour companies offer packages to the Exclusion Zone, which in some cases even include overnight stays . Guests must provide documentation at several check points upon reaching the site via tour bus. Once there, visitors are banned from touching anything, eating or drinking any food or beverage that does not come from outside the zone, and are even warned against sitting on the ground. Needless to say, all discarded objects and property littered in and around the abandoned city must also remain. And exiting is likewise highly regulated, with several body scanners checking for high levels of radiation. Once inside, visitors are banned from touching any objects or digesting any food that does not come from outside the zone . However, day trips - and even overnight stays - are permitted, now that radiation levels have decreased in the years since the disaster, despite still being up to 10 times higher than normal levels. While the city of Pripyat, which was located just 3 km away from the reactor, remains empty to this day, some people do live in the nearby town of Chernobyl, which is about 15 km from the site. In fact, there's even an InterInform Agency Hotel in the zone, which caters to travellers interested in spending even more time in the area. And in the nearby village of Orane, SoloEast Travel offers accommodations for their overnight tours at the Countryside Cottage Chernobyl Hotel, a Western style dwelling located just 5 km from the Dityatky check point. SoloEast Travel, a Kiev-based tour operator, offers multi-day trips that include overnight stays at a cottage about 50 km from the site . 'There are no new hotels inside the Exclusion Zone,' SoloEast Travel director, Sergei Ivanchuk, tells MailOnline Travel. 'Although some old ones are cosmetically refurbished a bit. 'According to Ukrainian law, businesses, except ones that are necessary for the zone functioning, are not allowed to be there - there will be no new Radisson or Sheraton opening.' Despite the ban on all non-essential workers from living in the zone, wildlife in the area - including foxes - has been thriving . Dark tourism, a term first coined in 1996 at Glasgow Caledonian University, is defined as any visit to sites that are traditionally association with death and tragedy. However, it is hoped that the main draw is the historical value of such locations, and not their associations with suffering and destruction. While all non-essential workers may be banned from living in the zone - and those who do operate on a 15 days on, 15 days off schedule - wildlife in the area is thriving. Some scientists attribute the proliferation in animal, bird and plant life to the almost 100 per cent absence of humans. Indeed, in recent years, the area has experienced the reappearance of lynxes, great eagle owls and nesting swans, as well as increased number of deer, foxes and wolves. But some studies also claim that the radiation has caused biodiversity to decline and have had long-term health effects on animals in the zone, including the massive catfish that call the plant's cooling pond home. Chernobyl is one of the world's most famous 'dark tourism' sites and is especially popular among photographers . The once affluent town was also home to a funfair, which, following the evacuation, has since been overgrown with weeds . The town of Pripyat and its ruins are favoured by photographers because of the Soviet aesthetic and surrounding area's untouched nature . The Fukushima site, the scene of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, has also recently become a tourist attraction. Following the 2011 explosion, local Japanese tour guides have begun escorting buses of people through the area, given that contamination levels are said to be 'low.' Guides say that they hope by educating tourists and sharing their experiences, people will be inspired to help rebuild the community. While there are a number of abandoned villages in and around the zone, most popular site to visit is the ghost town of Pripyat, which offers a breathtaking snapshot of a Soviet city circa the 1980s. The area is of particular interest to photographers, who love capturing the untouched scenery and the stark contrast between the thriving wildlife and the devastating ruins. A relatively affluent town prior to the explosion, Pripyat was home to a newly-built amusement park, blocks of apartment complexes, and even a movie theatre. The amusement park is the most photographed area, in particular the iconic derelict Ferris wheel and bumper cars. Despite government orders to leave, almost 200 people still live within the Exclusion Zone. These inhabitants are known as 'self-settlers,' and according to many who have visited the region, it is customary for those who visit to bring them gifts or small donations. A private tour booking will cost anywhere between $100 (£67) to $400 (£268), depending on the duration of your stay and amount of people . But in order for visitors to legally enter, they must be granted a pass, which is only possible to get through booking a private tour, which will cost anywhere between $100 (£67) to $400 (£268), depending on the duration of your stay and the amount of people in your group. 'Last year, we ran 290 tours and served 1,980 visitors,' Ivanchuk adds. 'In 2014, there were 5,900 visitors to the zone in total - though usually there are at least 10,000. 'Our one day tour is the most popular because it's the most affordable, however there are more and more interest for two, three and four day tours. 'Many people who visit once with a group return to have an extended tour.'","April 26, 2016 marks the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl tragedy - and the site sees more visitors today than ever .

"An apprentice electrician fell off a ladder and died in front of his father after he was electrocuted while testing lights in a factory, an inquest has heard. Nathan Brown, 19, was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, when he apparently touched a set of exposed electrical bars powering a crane. The shock caused him to fall 12ft head first onto the roof of a toilet block below the crane. He was airlifted to hospital but later died from his injuries. Tragic: Apprentice electrician Nathan Brown died after being electrocuted while testing lights . Accident: Nathan fell 12ft from a ladder after being electrocuted, and later died of his injuries . The inquest in Oldham heard that Nathan - described by his family as a 'cheeky, happy boy' - trained to become an electrician so he could follow in his father's footsteps. The pair were both working at Eurofabs UK Ltd, a sheet metal manufacturer in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, when tragedy struck in September 2013. Nathan was told to climb up a ladder onto the walkway of a crane and test the lights in the building's roof, taking readings and shouting them down to his father - a task as easy as plugging in a television. But he accidentally touched a 400-volt busbar, a metal strip which conducts electricity within a switchboard, while he was trying to climb high enough to carry out the tests. Forensic pathologist Philip Lumb told the inquest he found burn marks consistent with electrocution on Nathan's arm. Family: The 19-year-old was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, at the time of his death . He said: 'I gather Nathan was an apprentice electrician who was working for his father and contracted by a company called Eurofabs to conduct a complete electrical inspection. 'One of his duties was to inspect one part of the roof. In order to gain access, Nathan had to get on top of a toilet block and place a ladder against an electrical crane to access the platform where the lights were located. 'His father was working in the premises at the time. A short time late his father saw Nathan fall head first into the roof of the toilet block, about 12ft. He did not note any sounds of attempts to break his fall. 'He went to attend to him but found him in a collapsed condition, although his father said he may be able to feel a pulse.' Dr Lumb told the inquest the cause of Nathan's death was electrocution and that he probably suffered cardiac arrest before falling to the ground. His mother Nicole, 47, said she learnt of the accident when she was called by her other son Gary, who worked at Eurofabs. She told the inquest: 'He said, ""Don't panic mum but Nathan has had a fall."" I remember saying, ""Why, what happened?"" He said, ""He has fallen from a ladder."" 'I asked if he was OK and he said he didn't know as he wasn't conscious. He said, ""You need to get here as soon as you can mum."" I just rushed out the house and got on the car and drove straight over. 'I remember running up the stairs to get to him. I just got more or less up the stairs and I saw the paramedics trying to save him.' Workplace: Nathan and his father were carrying out electrical tests at Eurofabs UK in Rochdale . In a statement Mr Brown, 50, who has been an electrician for 32 years, said that his son had joined him as an apprentice in September 2012 after embarking on a three-year training course, and had completed health and safety training a month before the fatal accident. He said: 'As an apprentice he was learning on the job and only ever allowed to complete basic tasks such as basic electrics, switches, sockets and lights. 'You would only ever allow Nathan to carry out work when safe for him to do so and work within capability, knowledge and competence.' Mr Brown said he had carried out work at the Eurofabs premises twice before, and on this occasion was carrying out a general electrical survey which he likened to an 'MOT.' He said he decided to put a ladder over the toilet block beneath a 10-tonne travelling crane and had not seen the busbar overhead. He told the inquest: 'As far as I am aware the busbar should have been marked up in a sleeve with the marking ""danger high voltage"". I have never come across a busbar not sleeved and marked with an appropriate sign. 'Had I been aware of the presence of the busbars in such unprotected conditions then I would not have continued to take this work. In all 32 years' experience with busbars I have seen them properly protected and never come across exposed busbars as present on the day of the accident. 'That was the worst and fastest day of my life. It's a blur but I can't get rid of some of those thoughts. The test he was doing would be as simple as plugging a TV into a wall. 'I'm completely devastated by the accident and life will never be the same again. He was the light of my life and my family and I will miss him so much. Time is a great healer and I hope that will be the case.' The inquest continues.","Nathan Brown, 19, was working with father David testing lights in a factory .

"The world's last surviving male northern white rhino - stripped of his horn for his own safety - is now under 24-hour armed guard in a desperate final bid to save the species. Sudan is guarded day and night by a group of rangers who risk their lives on a daily basis as they try to keep the rhino from poachers lured by the rising price of ivory. But even without his horn, keepers in the Kenyan reserve of Ol Pojeta in fear for his safety. Scroll down for video . Guard: The rangers keep an armed watch around Sudan at all times to deter poachers after his horn . Extreme measures: Rangers have even cut off the rhino's horn - but they fear it won't be enough . Hungry: Feeding time in Sudan's enclosure - he spent most of his life in a Czech zoo . Dangerous: The rangers are aware they are risking their lives to protect the enormous animal . The 43-year-old rhino - who could live until his 50s - is the last chance for any future northern white rhino calves. Sudan was moved, along with two female rhinos, from a zoo in the Czech Republic in December 2009. The reserve, which specialises in the conservation of rhinos, was chosen because of its successful breeding programme with black rhinos. It had been hoped the move would encourage them to breed, but all attempts have been unsuccessful. The project was dealt a further blow when Suni - the world's only other male, who also lived at Ol Pojeta - died last October. It left just five northern white rhinos in the world - and the three in Kenya are in particular danger. Hunted: Rhinos like Sudan have no predators in the wild because of their size - apart from humans . New home: It had been hoped moving Sudan to Kenya with two females would encourage them to breed . Simor Irungu, one of the rangers who guards Sudan, says the team regularly risk their lives to keep him safe. 'With the rising demand for rhino horn and ivory, we face many poaching attempts and while we manage to counter a large number of these, we often risk our lives in the line of duty.' It is a sad end for a species which used to roam across the heart of Africa - from southern Chad, across the Democratic Republic of Congo and up into Sudan. Just over half a century ago, there were 2,000 northern white rhinos; but 1984 there were only 15, all in the DRC, according to the World Wildlife Fund. But then conservationist managed to bring them back from the brink, and bought the population up to at least 30 animals less than a decade later. Failure: But attempts at breeding have been unsuccessful - and Sudan is now getting old . High value: The price of ivory is now said to be between £40,000 and £47,000 a kilo . But then poaching took its toll, and the entire park was emptied. The last northern white rhinos were spotted in 2006. Their extinction has been fueled by the growing demand for ivory, which comes in large part from the Far East, where it is believed to be a cure for several ailments. The price for ivory has risen from between £170 to £541 per kilo in the 1990s, to today's prices of £40,000 to £47,355 per kilo, according to a report by the International Fund for Animal Welfare. The rangers have taken steps to deter the poachers, but they still fear it may not be enough. Elodie Sampere explained: 'The only reason his horn has been cut off is to deter poachers. 'If the rhino has no horn, he is of no interest to them. 'This is purely to keep him safe.' Sad end: Sudan is one of five northern white rhinos left, and a number of them are his descedents . However, keeping them safe is a costly business: the team of 40 cost £75,000 for six months. It is usually paid for with money made from tourism, but recent instability in Kenya, and fear of Ebola - which is actually thousands of miles away - have kept people away. So the team at  Ol Pejeta is hoping to raise the money through crowd funding. 'Keeping the ranger team safe is expensive,' the appeal reads. 'They are given world-class training, and are kitted out with the latest in equipment and support, from night vision goggles to GPS tracking, to a team of tracking and support dogs.... 'Keeping the team funded and equipped is an ongoing challenge. 'We are aiming to raise enough to safeguard the wages for the forty strong team for the next six months. 'This is £75,000. Any which way, every single pound contributed will help secure the rangers, that secure the rhino, for us and for future generations.'

"It's the summer hang out of choice for Hiltons, Jenners, supermodels and many others with a money-is-no-object lifestyle, so it's no wonder Coachella hits the hip pocket hard. Those lucky enough to snag a ticket to the star-studded – on and off the stage - Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, which runs for its second weekend from April 17-19, are spending more than any other major festival goers. While checking out headliners such as AC/DC, Jack White, Florence and the Machine and Madonna, who bizarrely made out with rapper Drake on Sunday, Coachella visitors pay an average of £187 per day according to Travel money specialist No.1 Currency. Scroll down for video . Those who enjoy the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California pay more than other revellers . The likes of Alessandra Ambrosio (centre) take in the famous fest that costs an average £187 per day . The Californian A-list magnet is narrowly ahead of Belgium’s Tommorowland for per-day costs according to the company after it ranked the price of the world’s most popular summer festivals, not including the cost of getting there, with costs varying drastically depending on the destination. If they indeed are required to reach into their own wallets, the likes of Alessandra Ambrosio and Brooklyn Beckham pay the highest-priced admission (£252), beer (£5.73) and meal costs (£9) of any summer fest. Tomorrowland, which this year features club superstars Carl Cox, David Guetta and Avicii when it’s held on July 25, costs its visitors £186 per day. England’s Glastonbury, running June 24 to 28 and featuring Foo Fighters in 2015, is the third most expensive with a £113 per day cost calculated from the five-day £565 ticket and an estimated average of £68 per day for meals and drinks. The price is clearly no object for revellers though as the festival, which includes camping prices in admission, was sold out in just 25 minutes back in October. Doing it her way: Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie flaunted her fantastic legs as she performed on Sunday . Belgium's edition of the Tomorrowland festival pay one pound a day less than those in Coachella . Roskilde in Denmark (June 27-July 4) sets festival-goers back £641 for its eight days of action with acts including Paul McCartney, Muse and Pharrell Williams but for a bargain week-plus festival head to Sziget in Budapest (August 10-17), which is 25 per cent cheaper and will host Robbie Williams, Kasabian and Foals among their acts. Both festivals have Florence and the Machine on the bill. No1. Currency’s head of retail Simon Phillips said: “Coachella is America’s answer to Glastonbury but, not only are tickets nearly impossible to get your hands on, it could be just as difficult to cover the costs. “As the birth place of British festival culture, Glastonbury remains one of the most iconic and celebrated music events in our British calendar but, as our research shows, being a part of this tradition will cost you. England’s Glastonbury is the third most expensive with a £113 per day cost but has above average food . Coachella is listed as the most expensive festival, while Exit Serbia works out cheapest . 'Tickets are not far behind those of Coachella in terms of prices, and neither is the cost of food and drink when you’re there – unsurprising considering the festival is famous for having some of the best festival food around.’ Brits keen to get the best value festival experiences can look towards Serbia, where the Exit festival from July 9-12 is the cheapest with daily costs across its four days reaching just £54. There a beer costs just £1 while you'll watch Faithless, The Prodigy, Motorhead and more in the surrounds of the Petrovaradin Fortress in the city of Novi Sad, Serbia. Open’er in Poland from July 1-4 is close behind with a day rate while checking out a line-up also featuring The Prodigy costing just £57. Exit festival in the surrounds of the Petrovaradin Fortress in the city of Novi Sad, Serbia, is the best value . “It can actually work out much better value to travel to a festival in mainland Europe than to stay at home,’ Phillips said. ‘Not only does your cash go further in Central Europe, where food and drink in particular are relatively cheap compared to the UK, but Brits heading to festivals in the Eurozone this summer will enjoy the added bonus of a strengthening pound. For example, exchanging £300 for spending money this year you’ll get €414, compared to €361 this time last year.’ “It is worth ordering and picking up your spending money in the UK before you head off to your chosen festival, as cash machines are usually limited and you don’t want to waste hours queuing instead of catching your favourite bands perform,” Phillips said.","Coachella visitors pay an average of £187 per day for entry, food and drink .

"A schoolgirl killed herself by walking in front of a train just weeks after her mother was found murdered, it emerged last night. Friends of 16-year-old Rachelle Owen said the teenager ‘just wanted to be with her mum’ Kay Diamond, who was discovered dead in February. Miss Owen died after being struck by a train close to Hoylake Station, Wirral, on Friday night. Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious. Schoolgirl Rachelle Owen, 16, has died after being struck by a train - just two months after her mother Kay Diamond, 44, was allegedly murdered . In a statement, her family said they were suffering a double tragedy following the murder of 44-year-old Miss Diamond whose body was found in a flat in Toxteth, Liverpool, on February 28. A post-mortem examination revealed that she had suffered a severe head injury. A 52-year-old man has been charged with her murder and is awaiting trial. In their statement the family of Miss Owen said: ‘Rachelle was a beautiful, vibrant, loved daughter, granddaughter, sister and niece, who attended Hilbre High School Humanities College. She will be greatly missed forever by all of her family and friends. ‘This is a double tragedy to our family following the recent death and funeral of her mum, Kay Diamond.’ Last night Hilary Diamond, the mother of Miss Diamond, was too upset to comment on the loss of her granddaughter. A vigil was held in Miss Owen’s memory yesterday, with friends lighting a candle at 8pm. Floral bouquets and messages have also been laid close to the station where she died at around 9.40pm on Friday. Tributes have been paid to the schoolgirl after she died at a crossing near Hoylake station on Friday . A tribute site on Facebook described how Miss Owen, of West Kirby, Wirral, has left behind ‘many broken hearts’. It added: ‘We will all miss her beautiful smile.’ Her aunt, Stacey Owen, wrote: ‘Heaven gained the most beautiful angel. Rachelle Owen. Words can’t describe how much we will miss you! Sleep tight.’ Victoria Owen added: ‘Keep thinking it won’t be true and this is a crazy nightmare! ‘So beautiful inside and out, we have all lost a very special person, my gorgeous cousin. ‘Sweet dreams Rachelle Owen, you will be missed by so, so many.’ Molly Connor, a friend, wrote: ‘RIP my gorgeous girl, God only takes the best. Always and forever in my heart Rach, I love you so much sleep tight my angel.’ Heather Price added: ‘So very, very sad. Heartbreaking that she had so much pain.’ Another comment read: ‘She just wanted to be with her mum.’ Anthony Blye, of Toxteth, has been charged with Miss Diamond’s murder and is due to enter a plea at Liverpool Crown Court in June.","Rachelle Owen, 16, has died after being hit by a train at a crossing in Wirral .

"A British photographer has captured some adorable images of puppies posing for the camera. The picture-perfect photo shoot is the handiwork of John Daniels, 61, from Dunsfold in Surrey, who has decades of experience working with animals.

A 'model' poses in a makeshift hammock for a portrait by puppy photographer John Daniels . The photographer also experiments with some unusual animal pairings, making his charming snaps the perfect way to celebrate National Pet Day, which takes place tomorrow. John said: 'I use the studio because I can't rely on the British weather, I've had to cancel shoots in the past, so using the studio and building a set means its one less thing to worry about. 'Photographing any animal can be tricky and with shoots outside there is more chance of the animal escaping or being frightened by the big outdoors. 'I have very good animal handlers that I use, they have lots of contacts in the animal world and tell me what's available at any time. Some of his work is the stuff of dreams for greetings card makers, such as these four puppies in socks hung up on a washing line . Two tiny Shar Pei's sit back to pack for this adorable, very wrinkly photo . John applies the time tested 'baby in a bucket' pose to a little puppy (l) - the photographer is seen on a farm with his camera (r) 'The hardest part is timing, I have to get each animal at the right age, so hatching eggs to coincide with kittens or puppies takes a bit of planning. 'I've found that the older the animal is the harder it is to get it to sit with another, when they are very young they don't really know whats going on, and a ducking will happily snuggle up to a kitten or anything else that feels cosy. 'I never force an animal to do anything, so if they don't look happy it wont look good in the picture and we try something else, or give them time to settle. Some of John's 'barking mad' animal pairings include this puppy and duck saying hello to one another. He says 'A ducking will happily snuggle up to a kitten or anything else that feels cosy' Some are captured in a precious moment where they look tired or relaxed, sleepy or barely awake . 'Without giving away any trade secrets, I use sounds to attract them, they have to be soft for kittens but a little louder for puppies and others, or strange to get them to look at the camera. 'All the animals react in different ways, so its quite often trial and error. 'I love working with any animal, wild or domestic, its a privilege to be able to. 'I hope they enjoy working with me, many of the animals come back to the studio for several shoots and they do seem to remember what to do, little treats always help.'

"Scotland will definitely become independent one day, Nicola Sturgeon vowed today as she again refused to rule out a second referendum on breaking up the Union. The SNP leader said the 'direction of travel' was towards independence, as she set out her demands for her to support Ed Miliband if Labour falls short of a majority. But David Cameron warned of the 'frightening' prospect of the SNP holding Labour to ransom and demanding they ditch new roads and hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scroll down for video . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the 'direction of travel' was towards independence butPrime Minister David Cameron warned nationalists would use a Labour government to break up the Union and punish other nations . The Tories have unveiled a new poster showing Nicola Sturgeon pulling Ed Miliband's strings, which could mean more taxes and borrowing, while England, Wales and Northern ireland suffer . David Cameron has urged people to vote tactically, to keep a Labour-SNP government out of power. The Prime Minister issued a plea to Ukip and Lib Dem voters to lend their support to the Tories to prevent 'Ed Miliband, propped up by Nicola Sturgeon demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes'. Writing in the Sunday Times, the Tory leader said: 'A vote for any of the other parties makes it harder for Conservatives to get those 23 constituencies we need to form a majority government. 'Vote for Ukip or the Liberal Democrats and you take Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon a step closer to Downing Street — and our government, economy and country a step closer to chaos. 'So if you are considering voting Ukip or Lib Dem, I urge you to think of the chaos of a weak Ed Miliband, propped up by Nicola Sturgeon demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes. Only a Conservative vote in your local constituency will keep Ed Miliband and the SNP out and secure Britain's future.' Mr Cameron warned that with the SNP calling the shots, the rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Northern Ireland, 'wouldn't get a look-in'. Both Mr Miliband and Ms Sturgeon have ruled out a formal coalition, with SNP ministers sitting in a Labour Cabinet. But Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly offered to work with Labour to 'lock' the Tories out of power. In September's referendum, 55 per cent of people voted against independence, but since then support for the SNP has soared. Latest polls suggest more than half of Scots plan to vote for the SNP, robbing Labour of dozens of seats north of the border. On BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Sturgeon would only say: 'I have no plans for another referendum at this stage.' But she added: 'I think Scotland will become an independent country one day. I think that's the direction of travel. 'Whether there is another referendum, and whether Scotland becomes independent is not a matter for me to decide. It is a matter for the Scottish people to decide.' Ms Sturgeon tried to play down the idea that the SNP would attempt to cause disruption at Westminster to further its goal of independence. 'I've got to persuade people that the SNP in the House of Commons after the election will not be any kind of disruptive force. We want to be constructive, to get better politics coming out of the Westminster system. 'As long as Scotland remains part of the Westminster system, it matters to people that we get good decisions out of that system, and I want the SNP to play a positive part in improving politics at Westminster for people right across the UK.' But Mr Cameron warned that if Labour is forced to rely on the SNP to pass laws and budgets, England, Wales and Northern Ireland will pay the price. Ms Sturgeon tried to play down the idea that the SNP would attempt to cause disruption at Westminster to further its goal of independence . Mr Cameron warned that with the SNP calling ths shots, the rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Northern Ireland, wouldn't get a look-in . The Prime Minister, who described himself as a 'fundamental believer in the United Kingdom', told Andrew Marr: 'This would be the first time on our history that a group of nationalists from one part of our country would be involved in altering the direction of the government of our country. I think that is a frightening prospect. 'People thinking in their own constituencies, is that bypass going to be built, will my hospital get the money it needs? Frankly this is a group of people that wouldn't care about what happened in the rest of the country. 'The rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Northern Ireland, wouldn't get a look-in. 'That is the prospect we face if we don't get the majority Conservative government that is in our reach.' A recent TNS survey showed the SNP has almost doubled its lead over Labour in a month, with 52 per cent now backing Ms Sturgeon with only 24 per cent of Scots planning to vote for Mr Miliband . Last week Labour announced plans for a freeze in rail fares, paid for by scrapping road upgrades on the A27 along the south coast and the A358 in Somerset - both in Tory and Lib Dem seats. Mr Cameron said: 'The SNP is a party that doesn't want to come to Westminster to contribute to a government, it wants to come to Westminster to break up our country. 'You have to ask yourself, if you are in a voter in England, in Wales or in Northern Ireland, would these people care at all about what happens in my life or my constituency. And the answer is no.

"A San Diego man who operated a 'revenge porn' website and then charged victims to remove nude images and their personal information was sentenced Friday to 18 years in state prison, the attorney general's office said. Kevin Bollaert, 28, was convicted in February of 21 counts of identity theft and six counts of extortion in San Diego Superior Court for running a pair of websites that capitalized on the internet as a forum for public shaming. The landmark case was the first time a person had been tried for a running revenge porn ring in the United States. Jilted lovers and hackers could anonymously post nude photos of people without their consent, along with personal information about them, at a website Bollaert created and moderated, called ugotposted.com. More than 10,000 images, mainly of women, were posted between December 2012 and September 2013. Crying in court: Kevin Bollaert, 28, broke down in tears at his sentencing hearing in San Diego on Friday. He was facing a maximum of 20 years but was given 18, with the judge saying the sentence accurately reflected the amount of victims he hurt . Shameful: In a first-of-its-kind ruling, Bollaert was sentenced t 18 years for running a 'revenge porn' site, publishing nude and embarassing photos of women sent in anonymously by people wanting to hurt them . People who sought to have the explicit images taken down were directed to changemyreputation.com and charged $250 to $350 to remove the racy content. Victims included teachers, wives and professionals. The compromising photos cost people jobs, damaged relationships and led to one attempted suicide. Bollaert earned about $900 a month in website ad revenue and collected about $30,000 from victims. Bollaert's lawyer had claimed at trial that the business was gross and offensive, but he didn't break the law by allowing others to post the explicit material. 'It's gross, it's offensive, but it's not illegal,' Emily Rose-Weber said. Ruined: In spite of the thousands of emails he got begging to have photos taken down, Bollaert told investigators it was his life that had been ruined by the site . Terrorized: Some of the victims appeared in court, anonymously, to read victim impact statements. Many said their lives had been irrevocably ruined by Bollaert and his site . But the prosecution said Bollaert terrorized women and enjoyed doing it. Not only would he the photos, but the names, addresses and social media details of the people in them. Many victims were inundated with harassing messages from strangers. Investigators found that Bollaert received thousands of distressed emails from victims, one who said she was 'scared for my life' and another who said she'd been 'getting nonstop harassing messages.' The criminal complaint named more than two dozen people as victims, one of whom claimed she was thrown out of her home after her family found out nude photos had been posted of her. 'It ruined my life and I'm still going through it,' she testified. 'I lost my family. They think that I brought shame on them. My reputation is ruined.' Some of the women read victim impact statements in court, according to NBC San Diego. One victim said: 'It's just broken me on a level that's not describable. The only thing I have left is shame and anger.' Convicted: Kevin Bollaert, 28, was facing 20 years after being found guilty of extortion and identity theft for running a despicable scheme for victims to pay to have their images removed from his revenge porn site . Mashable reported that Bollaert, in an interview with agents from the California Department of Justice's eCrime Unit, explained the site was 'just, like, ruining my life.' 'Yeah, I realize like this is not a good situation,' Bollaert said according to the complaint. 'I feel bad about the whole thing and like I just don't want to do it anymore.' 'I mean I know a lot of people are getting screwed over like on the site. Like their lives are getting ruined,' he said. The trial of Hunter Moore, called 'the most hated man on the Internet' for running isanyoneup.com, is yet to go before court.","Kevin Bollaert was found guilty of 27 counts of identity theft and extortion .

"Harvey Weinstein's wife of eight years is furious and humiliated by the allegations that he groped a 22-year-old Italian model, according to a new report. Fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, said she does not want the accusations tied to Ambra Battilana and her husband to further embarrass their children or interrupt her business, a source told the New York Daily News. 'She's furious. She thinks it's embarrassing not only to her but to their kids,' said the socialite who worked with the couple. Weinstein, 63, has emphatically denied sexually assaulting Battilana during a March 27 business meeting at his Tribeca office. The source told the Daily News that Chapman, who has two children with Weinstein, wants to find a resolution to the allegations as soon as possible. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Forlorn: Harvey Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman, 38, stepped out on Friday looking forlorn amid allegations her husband apologized to a 22-year-old model for groping her. He has publicly denied the incident occurred . Downcast: Looking down, Chapman carried the couple's four-year-old daughter India to their car in New York . A second source claimed Chapman, founder of fashion line Marchesa, is humiliated by her husband she married in 2007, and is someone who has 'loved Harry through his charms and flaws,' according to the Daily News. The question remains how much Weinstein is willing to pay to make the situation go away, the source told the newspaper. 'They want her out of the country,' said the socialite source. 'The last thing they need is her popping up at parties and premieres.' But a spokesman for Chapman denied the marriage was in trouble and said they had spent the weekend together. Max Dundas, a long term representative for Chapman, told MailOnline: 'This story is absolutely nonsense. I spoke to Georgina yesterday, they have spent the entire weekend together as a family and their relationship is as strong as ever.' In the meantime, Weinstein is waiting to see if the Manhattan district attorney will decide to seek charges before making his next move, according to the source. Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse on Thursday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police that the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night . Max Dundas, a long term representative for Chapman, told MailOnline: ‘I spoke to Georgina this week, they spent the entire weekend together as a family and their relationship is as strong as ever.' A spokesman for Weinstein also told the Daily News that the idea the allegations were causing a strain on the couple's relationship was 'patently untrue' and that 'whomever is saying it, is lying'. On Saturday the couple were pictured at their Connecticut home. Weinsten was spotted outside the home. Chapman was seen rolling up to the compound in a silver Mercedes-Benz before she went inside. While he has denied the incident occurred, the source dismissed claims that the model had planned the encounter in an effort to land a movie role. As Weinstein fights to throw out the allegations, the New York Daily News reports that police overheard a phone call between Battilana and Weinstein, in which she confronted him - and he said: 'It won't happen again'. According to a Daily News' source, Weinstein appeared to confirm he groped Battilana during a phone call with the Italian national. 'She said something to the effect that she was uncomfortable with him doing that,' the source told the Daily News. 'And he said something to the effect, 'It won't happen again.'' 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her. The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' Battilana has claimed Weinstein asked her for a kiss and groped her during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night. DailyMail.com has reached out to his representatives for comment. Battilana also convinced Weinstein to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he knew he was being monitored but following the call and the meeting at the restaurant at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, Weinstein voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. Battilana's attorney, David Godosky, said Tuesday is the earliest he expects to hear a decision on whether Weinstein will face criminal charges, according to the New York Daily News. A legal expect told the Daily News that, if the DA decides to prosecute Weinstein, he will likely only face misdemeanor charges. The alleged incident unfolded at Weinstein's Tribeca office after he invited her there for a business meeting on Friday night, hours after meeting her at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday night. When she arrived at the office, the married father-of-five allegedly asked if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt, she told police. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. She clearly rejected him and he backed off, the New York Daily News reported, and she fled from the building. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she quickly left the building half an hour after arriving, the newspaper reported. Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . The model's lawyer said his client was 'creeped out' by her alleged encounter with Weinstein, who is behind hit movies including Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech and Gangs Of New York. 'When she was describing what happened, her face became contorted,' said Mark Heller. 'It was that look of someone who was creeped out. She's a very young woman who was relating her disgust that a much older man - an old man in view of someone her age - conducted himself like that.' Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted that the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Weinstein's camp have dismissed Miss Battilana as an opportunist with a sketchy past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . It also emerged that she told Italian police in 2010 that she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with €2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the €5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. The alleged groping took place on March 27 at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Harvey Weinstein to 'discuss business' After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer  Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004.","Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman, 38, is seeking to find a resolution to the allegations as soon as possible, according to one of the sources .

"Two Maryland parents whose hands-off 'free-range' parenting got their children picked up by police yet again on Sunday are now vowing to file a lawsuit. Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their son Rafi, 10, and daughter Dvora, 6, roam free in their suburban neighborhood. But the Meitivs, both of them scientists, say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up Rafi and Dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents. Picked up: Officials seized Dvora, 6, (far left) and 10-year-old Rafi (left, blue hat) on Sunday in a Maryland park. The parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv (right) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours . Attorney Matthew Dowd, of the firm Wiley Rein, is representing the Meitivs and on Tuesday sent a ointed letter regarding Sunday's events. Rein wrote: . 'The actions of Maryland CPS and Montgomery County Police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children. 'This fundamental, constitutional right of parents cannot be infringed simply because certain governmental employees disagree with a parent’s reasoned decision on how to raise his or her children.' The firm declined to say who the suit would be against, exactly, when asked by the Washington Post. However, the attorney has vowed to pursue 'all legal remedies' to protect the rights of the Maryland parents. The Meitivs made headlines just before Christmas when police found Rafi and Dvora walking the sidewalk on their own. Picked up AGAIN: The Meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by CPS workers after their children--who they raise with a so-called 'free-range' approach--were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone . 'Besides the policeman pulling up...no': Asked if he was scared during the hours-long ordeal Sunday, 10-year-old Rafi admitted he was, but not because he'd been left alone with his sister . Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. On Sunday, a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home. The children were picked up by police, who say they followed protocol by turning them over to CPS. Meanwhile, Mrs Meitiv tells Fox 5 DC that CPS workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe. What's more, the elder child, Rafi, insists the scariest part of the hours-long ordeal was being picked up by police. ‘They kept the kids for hours,’ a shaken Danielle Meitiv told Fox 5 after being reunited with them. ‘It’s 10:30 at night. They’ve been missing since 6 o’clock…Somebody called 911 and the police called CPS and they decided to bring the kids here and they didn’t call us.’ According to Mrs. Meitiv, the children were expected home no later than 6:30. When 6:30 came and went, they became frantic. They would not receive a call from CPS until 8pm. Even then, they say they weren't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours. in the interim, Rafi tells Fox 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift. Rafi said: . ‘The policeman said “We’ll give you a ride home” when we were like two blocks away. And two and a half hours later, after sitting in the car two and a half hours, he said “I’ll bring you home” and, instead, he brought us here.’ 'Here' was Child Protective Services, Rafi said. And as he and his sister sat waiting to go home, their parents say 'upper management' at CPS was involved in keeping that from happening. Only at 10:30pm did Mrs. Meitiv say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash. Parenting style: The Meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age . Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street . ‘They made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up, . 'And I’m not gonna risk my kids being snatched again like this by CPS.' When questioned, the Meitivs say they believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, which encourages independence from infancy. In March, the CPS found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone. It meant the agency would start a file on the family's activities and whereabouts for at least five years. The Meitivs hit back at the ruling, insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences. Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to such charges. It usually comes when the CPS has deemed parents to have neglected their children, but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action.","Police seized Rafi, 10, and Dvora, 6, in a Maryland park on Sunday and their parents say they weren't reunited by CPS for hours .

"As any parent will know, children's feet will often grow faster than it is possible to buy them new shoes to keep them shod. However, one charity has come up with an innovative new type of shoe that grows with a child's feet. The Shoe that Grows uses adjustable buckles and a strap on the toe to expand by five sizes. Scroll down for video . The Shoe that Grows (pictured) has adjustable points at the front, sides and the back of the sandal to help it expand. Kenton Lee, from Nampa, Idaho, came up with the idea while working in Nairobi in Kenya after seeing children running around barefoot and in shoes several sizes too small . Kenton Lee, from Nampa, Idaho, came up with the idea while working in Nairobi in Kenya after seeing children running around barefoot and in shoes several sizes too small. He said: 'It got me asking questions and finally all these questions led to an idea - what if there were a shoe that could adjust and expand? Self-tying shoelaces could become a reality after engineers designed a shoe that can automatically lace up, adjusting itself to the shape of your foot. Pressure sensors in the shoe tell it when your foot is in position, triggering a tiny motor in the heel that pulls the laces tight. When you want to take off the shoes, click your heels together twice and the motor will release a spring in the shoe’s tongue, loosening the laces so the footwear can be slipped off. The ingenious invention even runs on power generated by the swing of your foot as you walk. 'What if we had a pair of shoes where they could just adjust their shoes any time their feet grow. 'That way they will always have a pair of shoes that always fit. 'I really feel that we have created something incredible.' Children's feet grow incredibly quickly with those aged between two and six years old going up a size almost every few months. For those living in the wealthy developed countries, this can be a burden on their parent's wallets. However, for those living in developing countries where buying new shoes every few months is not an option, the risk of running around barefoot can be severe. Children can cut their feet and get infections while they can also pick up parasites like worms through their skin. The Shoe that Grows, which resembles a typical sandal, has a tough compressed rubber sole to protect the wearer's feet, with a soft leather upper. The shoe can expand five sizes by adjusting the straps at the front and back and the poppers on the sides (pictured). It currently comes in two different size ranges - small and large and a single pair costs $30 (£20) but buying 100 pairs reduces the cost to $12 (£8) The shoe has a tough rubber sole and a leather upper that is designed to last five years, the maker say. Poppers on the side allow the width to be adjusted as the child's feet expand while a strap on the toe can be moved to make the shoe longer.A buckle on the back also can be ajusted to help make the shoes fit better . Poppers on the size allow the width to be adjusted as the child's feet expand while a strap on the toe can be moved to make the shoe longer.

They currently come in two different size ranges - small, which is designed for children from Kindergarten age up to 4th grade - and large which is for children from 5th grade to 9th grade. A single pair costs $30 but buying 100 pairs reduces the cost to $12. Mr Lee is working with an organisation called Because International which aims to send the shoes to orphanages in Africa.

Mr Lee had been working with 140 Aids orphans at the Motherly Care Children's Home in Nairobi, Kenya, when he had the idea for the shoe. He said: 'I'll never forget it. One day I was walking down a road with a group of kids from an orphanage where I was staying. 'Next to me there was a girl in a white dress. As I looked down her shoes were so small and as I looked around there were so many other kids with shoes that were too small for them.'","Sandal uses adjustable buckles and a strap on the toe to expand in size .

"A. Alfred Taubman, the self-made Michigan billionaire whose philanthropy and business success — including weaving the enclosed shopping mall into American culture — was clouded by a criminal conviction late in his career, has died aged 91. Taubman,  who donated hundreds of millions of dollars to universities, hospitals and museums, died Friday night at his home of a heart attack, according to son Robert S. Taubman, president and CEO of Taubman Centers, Inc. 'This company and all that you stand for were among the greatest joys of his life,' Robert S. Taubman wrote in a message to the company's employees. Dead at 91: Real estate mogul and Michigan billionaire A. Alfred Taubman  died on Friday night   at his home after a heart attack . 'He was so proud of what this wonderful company he founded 65 years ago has accomplished.' Taubman's business success spanned from real estate and art houses to the hot dog-serving A&W restaurant chain, for which he traveled to Hungary to figure out why the country's sausage was so good. He also became a major backer of stem-cell research. But it was his rearrangement of how people shop — parking lot in front, several stores in one stop close to home — that left a mark on American culture. Taubman Centers, a subsidiary of his Taubman Co., founded in 1950, currently owns and manages 19 regional shopping centers nationwide. 'Everything that excited me that I got interested in, I did,' Taubman told The Associated Press in a 2007 interview. Born January 31, 1942, in Pontiac, Michigan, to German-Jewish immigrants, Taubman worked as a boy at a department store after school near his family's home, which was among the custom houses and commercial buildings developed in the area by his father. He was a freshman at the University of Michigan when he left to serve in World War II, around the time he stopped using his first name, Adolph. When he returned to Ann Arbor to study art and architecture, he created small on-campus businesses to cover expenses, then transferred to Lawrence Technological University near Detroit to take night classes while working at an architectural firm as a junior draftsman. Family business: Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield officially opened in 2013 in Chesterfield, Missouri a western suburb of St. Louis . Recognizing the booming post-war growth of the middle class, particularly in the Motor City, he launched his first real estate development company in 1950. His first project was a freestanding bridal shop in Detroit — but he had his eyes on something bigger. He'd noticed shoppers responding to the convenience of 'one-stop comparison shopping opportunity,' he wrote in his autobiography. So when a friend suggested a shopping plaza in Flint, Taubman's company did something radical for the time: stores were pushed to the back of the lot and parking spaces were put up front. It was a success, his young company took on larger-scale developments in Michigan, California and elsewhere in the 1950s and early '60s. A. Alfred Taubman is assisted as he leaves federal court in New York, on Monday, April 22, 2002 where Taubman was sentenced to a year in jail for fixing commissions at Sotheby's . Taubman served as chairman of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc., parent company of Sotheby's art auction house, from 1983 to 2000, and was a partner in international real estate firm The Athena Group before he was tangled in a price-fixing scheme. He was convicted in 2001 of conspiring with Anthony Tennant, former chairman of Christie's International, to fix the commissions the auction giants charged. Prosecutors alleged sellers were bilked of as much as $400 million in commissions. Taubman was fined $7.5 million and spent about a year in a low-security prison in Rochester, Minnesota, but long insisted he was innocent and expressed regret for not testifying in his own defense. 'I had lost a chunk of my life, my good name and around 27 pounds,' he recalled in his book, saying he was forced to take the fall for others. Mall man: A. Alfred, Robert and William Taubman, along with Randy Benderson and other dignitaries, cut the ribbon today to open The Mall at University Town Center in Sarasota, Florida in 2014 . The case cast a shadow over Taubman's accomplishments, but it diminished over the years — and his philanthropy continued unabated. He had pledged $100 million to the University of Michigan's A. Alfred Taubman Medical Research Institute and its stem-cell research by 2011. He also financed public-policy programs at Harvard, Brown University and the University of Michigan, which received several large donations. He donated millions and spoke passionately in support of the 2008 ballot initiative in Michigan that eased restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research and enabled his namesake institute to conduct major research for diseases — including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, which claimed the life of his good friend, New York Sen. Jacob Javits, in 1986. After turning over control of Taubman Centers to his two sons, Taubman made sustaining the Detroit Institute of Art a priority. His knowledge of how shoppers negotiated malls was tapped to help reconfigure the flow of the museum, and he helped guide the DIA as president of the Detroit Arts Commission through chronic financial problems.","A.

"An Oklahoma jury today convicted a 17-year-old of first-degree murder in the shooting death of an Australian college baseball player who was killed while out for a jog. The Stephens County jury found Chancey Allen Luna guilty in the August 16, 2013, death of Christopher Lane, who was shot in the back while running along a city street in Duncan. The jury recommended that Luna be sentenced to life in prison without parole. Defense attorneys acknowledged that Luna fired the fatal shot from a passing car that he was riding in, but contended that he meant only to scare Lane. Scroll down fro video .

'There was no motive, no plan to kill anyone,' defense attorney Jim Berry said during opening statements. 'This is a reckless action by a 16-year-old child.' The defense had asked that the jury be allowed to consider a second-degree murder conviction, a request that the judge denied earlier Friday. Second-degree murder would have carried a sentence of 10 years to life in prison. Luna did not testify and the defense called just one witness, Luna's mother, Jennifer Luna. In her brief testimony, Jennifer Luna said her son lived with her parents after he was born and that his father is in jail. 'I wasn't there half the time,' she said. She also insisted from the witness stand that her boy would never hurt anyone intentionally. 'If my son did it, it wasn't on purpose. It wasn't meant to be.

Lane's parents and sister, who had read heartbreaking victim impact statements before the verdict was announced, expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the trial. 'This naughty boy is never going to do this to any other family,' Donna Lane told the media, according to Sydney Morning News. A co-defendant in the case, James 'Bug' Edwards Jr., now 17, testified that he was a passenger in the car when it swerved toward Lane, and Luna fired the shot. Edwards testified as part of a plea agreement in which a first-degree murder charge against him was reduced to being an accessory after the fact. Parents: Donna Lane, pictured left in court Thursday wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Jennifer Luna (right) said her son lived with her parents and she was not there 'half the time' The car's driver, Michael Jones, now 19, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder as part of a plea bargain, but refused to testify for the prosecution. He is serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole. The doctor who performed the autopsy on Lane testified that even immediate medical attention would not have saved his life. 'Apart from a miracle, no,' said Dr. Inas Yacoub, a forensic pathologist with the state medical examiner's office. Yacoub testified that a .22-caliber bullet was recovered from Lane's body. Star-crossed lovers: Luna and his American girlfriend, Sarah Harper, had returned from a trip to Australia just two days before he was gunned down while out jogging . Torn apart: Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was visiting his girlfriend, Sarah Harper, and her family in Duncan when he was killed . 'Despite being small, it damaged vital structures and caused significant bleeding,' Yacoub told jurors, striking two major blood vessels, puncturing both lungs and breaking two ribs. The victim's mother, Donna Lane, wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Lane and family members also wept during testimony by witnesses who tried to comfort Lane as he lay dying. Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was in Oklahoma on a college baseball scholarship. He was a catcher and preparing for his senior year at East Central University in Ada and was visiting his girlfriend and her family in Duncan when he was shot.","Oklahoma jury convicted 17-year-old Chancey Allen Luna of first-degree murder in 2013 killing of Christopher Lane .

"Amid the horror of a Nazi concentration camp, liberated by the British Army 70 years ago this week, love blossomed against all the odds between an emaciated inmate and one of the soldiers sent to arrest her SS guards. But the love between British soldier, Sergeant Norman Turgel, 24 at the time, and teenage Polish girl Gena, 20, was only kindled because of the generosity and kindness of the camp's British commander Major Leonard Berney. This week survivors and liberators of the notorious Bergen-Belsen camp in northern Germany gathered to commemorate the day British soldiers entered its gates and began the task of saving as many of the 60,000 starving inmates as was possible. Gena and Norman were married two months short of their golden wedding anniversary of 50 years, pictured before his passing in 1995 . Norman Turgel pictured as a young soldier in the British Intelligence Corps in his early 20s (l) and Gena Turgel as a young girl (r) Gena, weighing only a few pounds was, like many others in the camp, a walking skeleton, for whom certain death was only days away. Among the recently dead was Dutch girl Anne Frank whose diaries while hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam became world renowned. But through the striped and filthy prison uniform, Sergeant Norman Turgel of the 53 Field Security section of British Intelligence Corps, spotted an eternal beauty and began talking to her. Before long Norman had fallen in love with the young Jewish girl who at last was being fed proper food and was being given clothes to wear again. Anne Frank, whose diaries of persecution at the hands of the Nazis became the defining account of the Holocaust, was just one of Bergen-Belsen's many victims. Frank was living in the Netherlands when the Nazis seized it in 1940, leaving them trapped. In 1942 they were forced into hiding in secret rooms hidden inside Otto Frank's office building. They spent two years there, but were anonymously betrayed and sent to the concentration camps. Anne, and her sister Margot, were taken to Bergen-Belsen, where they died of typhus in February 1945, just months before the Allies liberated it. Bergen-Belsen's SS commandant, the cruel and tyrannical Joseph Kramer, was among those Norman helped to round up and capture. Other soldiers helped hand out fresh bread and fruit. Norman became so besotted with Gena that he told her he was going to marry her one day. But here the story could have ended had it not been for Major Leonard Berney, the new commanding officer of what became Belsen Camp for Displaced Persons. With Norman posted away and other prisoners being repatriated to all parts of Europe, there was a danger of the young lovers being parted forever. Major Leonard Berney, who is now 95, was the commanding officer of liberated Belsen. He played cupid for soldier Norman  and Gena. Pictured in uniform (l) and more recently (r) Bergen Belsen was located in northern Germany, south-west of the town of Bergen itself. From 1941 ro 1945 almost 50,000 people were killed there along with 20,000 Soviet inmates . The Camp was liberated on 15 April 1945 by the British 11th Armoured Division and soldiers discovered roughly 60,000 starved, and ill prisoners inside. 13,000 unburied corpses littered the ground around the camp when they arrived . When the Allies arrived at Bergen-Belsen, it was in the grip of a terrible typhus outbreak, with prisoners dying at a rate of 500 a day. A sombre sign erected by the British Army, and photographed by Mr Parsons, documents at least part of that grisly death tool, revealing that 13,000 people perished even after troops came to their aid. Shortly after the camp was liberated by British and Canadian troops in 1945, it was torched, and at least part of that suffering was destroyed forever as the buildings, along with the Reichskriegs flag and Hitler portrait which adorned them, were consumed by flames. Major Berney, now 95 and living in retirement, took a personal interest in their unlikely romance, making sure messages to each other reached their destination in the chaos of the post-liberation activity. Major Berney wrote about his experiences in 'Liberating Belsen Concentration Camp' and gave evidence at the Belsen war crimes trials. His son, John Wood said: 'My father gave the young couple permission to hold an engagement party and they were grateful for ever for his personal interventions. Without him, they might well have lost touch.' Historic: As a crowd of people watch on, British troops burn the buildings to the ground . Horrific: Around 500 people were dying per day of typhus and starvation when the Allies arrived . The camp, which became the final resting place of 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and those with disabilities, is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 . Once Gena had been released from her living hell and been restored to health, Norman and she married and started lived in London. They went on to have three children, Hilary 68, Bernice, 63, and Harris 62, eight grandchildren and 12 great grand children. Norman died in 1995, two months short of their golden wedding anniversary. He passed away a few years ago but Gena was prominent this week in the anniversary of Belsen's liberation. Gena at a book launch with Major Berney's son, John Wood, who said: 'My father gave the young couple permission to hold an engagement party and they were grateful for ever for his personal interventions' She said: 'Today it is hard to imagine what it was like in the camp, people so thin and so defeated that it was hard to tell if they were men or women. 'I spent many days with Anne Frank. She was a beautiful, sweet girl but she got ill and I was with her to almost the last. She gazed into the distance as the days went by and I could tell she had gone. 'I was lucky and for that I can thank Major Berney. He was a wonderful man and made sure that Norman and I kept our romance alive in the most testing conditions. 'We had him to thank for a wonderful marriage and for coming together at a time when it would have been easy to have lost touch.'

"Lovingly tended gardens with their manicured lawns and neat flowerbeds were once the very essence of Englishness. But these days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers, according to researchers. As a result, only a handful of traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens, with the average one usually containing a mere four species – daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips. These days we are increasingly using outdoor space for the occasional barbecue or to relax in a hot tub rather than for tending flowers, according to researchers (file image) Almost 40 per cent of people, including 66 per cent of those aged 18-29, spend more time sunbathing and having barbecues in their garden than tending it, according to the survey of 1,000 adults by the garden furniture retailer Alfresia.co.uk. Sir Roy Strong, the landscape designer and former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, told the Sunday Times: ‘British people used to take pride in having neat gardens with lots of flowers. ‘Now they are watching lots of gardening shows on television but doing less gardening themselves.’ Typical of the trend is Chris Penn, a 31-year-old council officer from Newport, Gwent, who said: ‘The main purpose of our garden is as a space to unwind with a glass of wine on a warm evening after work.’ As a result, only a handful of traditional flowers still grow in English country gardens, with the average one usually containing a mere four species – daffodils, crocuses, roses and tulips (file image) It comes after another recent study found that more and more people are digging up their flower beds to make way for hot tubs and outdoor spas. Despite the unpredictable climate, one in ten households has a hot tub in the garden – and the British and Irish Spa and Hot Tub Association has said sales actually increase in years of cold weather. A survey of 2,000 homeowners carried out for Lloyds TSB Insurance found that 10 per cent of respondents owned a hot tub, with the equipment in the average UK garden now worth £1,928. And around 57 per cent of householders surveyed by Lloyds TSB said they use the garden as a place to relax, rather than to cultivate plants.","Now outdoor space is more commonly used to store hot tubs, say experts .

"As the anniversary of their daughter's suicide approaches, Michael and Jane Cleland have spoken of their battle to have the two teenage boys, who they say bullied their daughter to death, held accountable for their actions under cyber bullying laws. Jessica Cleland, from Wallan, Victoria, was 19 when she took her own life on Easter Saturday last year, after receiving Facebook messages from two teenage boys she considered friends saying that they hated her, and that she was a 'f***ing sook'. Her parents said that Jessica's social media accounts were flooded with horrible sentiments the night before she died, and are now desperate to see a change within Victoria’s Government and the state's police so that those found guilty of  cyber bullying face serious consequences. The parents of Jessica Cleland (pictured) are campaigning for anti-bullying laws to be taken more seriously . 'What we would like to see happen is that if someone is cyber bullying somebody and they cause something like this, then they should be held ­accountable for it,' said Jessica's father Michael. On Easter Saturday last year, Jessica told her her mother that she was going for a run. Her sister Amy became concerned after seeing an Instagram photo Jessica uploaded with the caption 'I love this place and I am never going to leave'. Jessica's father found her body on the Sunday in the same place where the photo had been taken. The Cleland's said that Jessica was a vibrant and and outgoing girl, who was looking forward to her gap year and had never exhibited symptoms of depression or mental illness before the two former friends began bullying her online. Coroner Jacqui Hawkins said in the report she released in October that Jessica's death highlighted the impact that social media could have on the lives on young people, and that both Facebook and text messaging was 'problematic' for the teenager. 'Easy access to the internet on her phone meant that she was exposed to potentially upsetting communications 24 hours a day; and she was able to return to, and re-read, the upsetting messages at a later time and therefore appears to have continued to ruminate about them,' the coroners report said. 'Although it is not possible to identify, with any degree of certainty, the factors contributing to a person's decision to take their own life, it is evident that messages received by Jessica online proximate to her death...were precipitating factors,' reported The ABC. Jessica (pictured right, with her sister Amy, left) committed suicide after she was bullied over Facebook . Following the release of the coroners report, the Cleland's are now campaigning to see cyber bullying taken more seriously in Victoria and around Australia. Victoria already has anti-bullying legislation known as Brodie's Law, which was introduced in 2011 after the death of Brodie Panlock, who committed suicide after being subject to relentless bullying in her workplace. The crime is punishable by ten years in jail, and applies to cyber bullying as well as physical, verbal and psychological bullying. Despite these laws, and the finding of the coroner who named the two teenage boys, there has been no charges and no inquest into Jessica's death, which the Cleland's labelled as a failure. Police also failed to produce a warrant to obtain communication between Jessica and her bullies from Facebook and Snapchat. The Cleland's said that they were disappointed with the Victorian police for failing to investigate and want to see the teenagers held accountable for their actions. 'If you accidentally hit someone in your car you can get manslaughter. What’s the difference if you bully someone and cause them to take their own life?', Jessica's mother Jane told The Herald-Sun. 'They keep saying they’re going to have a big push on cyber bullying and try to knock it on the head, but it seems like it’s too much hard work.' Jessica's grandmother wrote of the impact of the 19-year-old's death on the family, and called for harsher enforcement of the anti-bullying legislation. 'It seems there is a law in Victoria that criminalises cyber bullying, but it doesn't get enforced because of the police paperwork...Cyber bullying is a silent killer of too many of our young ones,' she wrote. 'We have the evidence ... but where's the justice?' If you or someone you know is struggling with mental illness or depression, please contact Lifeline on 13 11 14.","Jessica Cleland committed suicide last year after being cyber bullied .
