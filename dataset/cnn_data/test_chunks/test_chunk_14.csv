"Tom Ince scored two fantastic goals in front of his dad as Derby twice came from behind to share the points in a thrilling 4-4 draw at Huddersfield. Former England and Manchester United midfielder Paul was in the stands as the on-loan Hull player scored two long-range efforts for the visitors, one in each half. Play-off chasing Derby were 1-0 up, 3-1 down and 4-3 behind in an amazing game which also saw Huddersfield have three goals ruled out. Tom Ince (centre) is currently on loan at Derby from Premier League side Hull City and has been in fine form . Huddersfield (4-4-2): Smithies, Smith, Hudson, Lynch, Scannell, Gobern, Coady (Hogg 81), Butterfield, James, Wells (Bunn 88), Miller . Subs not used: Edgar, Murphy, Wallace, Lolley, Billing . Booked: James, Butterfield . Scorers: Gobern 38, Hudson 41, James 45, Wells 72 . Derby (4-4-2): Grant, Shotton, Keogh, Whitbread (Christie 27), Warnock, Hendrick, Hughes (Russell 79), Bryson (Dawkins 9), Ince, Bent, Lingard . Subs not used: Forsyth, Ward, Sammon, Roos . Booked: Dawkins . Scorers: Ince 16, 79, Dawkins 52, Lingard 61 . Referee: Dean Whitestone . Attendance: 15,889 . Ince crashed home a stunning 25-yard drive on 16 minutes seconds after seeing a free-kick from similar distance saved. Derby lost Craig Bryson to injury early on and then Zak Whitbread also went off on 27 minutes. After that Huddersfield, seeking back-to-back home wins against play-off contenders after beating Ipswich last time out, stepped up a gear. Nahki Wells and Ishmael Miller went close before three goals in seven minutes left Derby shell-shocked. There was controversy about Huddersfield's first on 38 minutes when Oscar Gobern appeared to handle Conor Coady's ball into the box. Everybody except Gobern seemed to stop for a flag or whistle but neither came and he hooked in from close range. Gobern, out of contract at the end of the season, last scored for Huddersfield in January 2012. A Mark Hudson header from a Reece James corner deflected into the net off a Derby defender on 41 minutes. Reece James, on-loan from Manchester United, then scored his first goal for the Terriers straight from a corner. He whipped in an effort from the right in first-half injury time and it went in after Derby keeper Lee Grant came for but missed the ball. Derby came out for the second half on fire and were quickly level when first Simon Dawkins and then Jesse Lingard scored. Substitute Dawkins fired in from a Stephen Warnock cross on 52 minutes while Lingard struck from outside the box after Dawkins initially tried to shoot. Midfielder Lingard, like James, is on loan from Manchester United but unlike the Town man has just signed new a two-year contract at Old Trafford. Huddersfield, pegged back at 3-3, would not give up and were in front again when Wells had a shot deflected in. He had already had a goal ruled on 57 minutes when he followed up with an effort off which looped into the net off a Derby defender after Ishmael Miller was denied. It was end-to-end action and Ince scored his second - again from distance - after good work by Darren Bent to make it 4-4 on 79 minutes. Miller had two goals ruled out, one for a foul on Grant and the other, in stoppage time, for offside. Also in injury time Hudson headed wide from a Jacob Butterfield cross while Johnny Russell nearly had the last word with a free-kick which just went over. A point will help cement Derby's play-off position. Huddersfield, who are already safe, are now unbeaten in five matches.","Derby's Tom Ince scored two long-range goals at Huddersfield in a 4-4 draw .

"Juventus moved ever closer to clinching a fourth straight Serie A title by beating nearest challengers Lazio 2-0 in Turin. First-half goals from Carlos Tevez - his 26th of the season in all competitions - and centre-back Leonardo Bonucci pushed Juve 15 points clear of second place with only seven games remaining. Lazio did mount a late rally at the Juventus Stadium but the dismissal of midfielder Danilo Cataldi for a heavy tackle on Tevez ended their challenge. Carlos Tevez opened the scoring for Juventus after 17 minutes as they beat Lazio on Saturday . Tevez jumps for joy after firing Juventus ahead with his 26th goal of the season . The result brought Lazio's run of six consecutive victories to an end and the Biancocelesti could be dragged back into third place should their city rivals Roma beat Atalanta in the capital on Sunday. Earlier on Saturday, ambitious Sampdoria were held to an unlikely goalless draw by Cesena but used the point to take a share of fourth place. The Genoa club dominated their relegation-threatened opponents from start to finish but found goalkeeper Federico Agliardi an immovable object when their radar was not malfunctioning. Samp are now level on Napoli with 50 points while 18th-placed Cesena are six points shy of Atalanta and safety with seven games still to play.","Juventus beat Lazio 2-0 on Saturday to move 15 points clear in Serie A .

"Ashley Young is willing to take a pay cut in his basic salary to prolong his stay at Manchester United. The 29-year-old has revived his career in recent months under Louis van Gaal after first filling in at wing-back and since reclaiming his place on United's left wing. Ashley Young scored in Sunday's 4-2 derby victory over Manchester United . Young has been instrumental in their six game winning run and is now being touted for a return to the England set-up. United beat Liverpool to sign Young from Aston Villa for £17m in 2011 and he signed a five year contract understood to be worth around £120,000 a week. He is hoping for a three year extension and is willing to restructure his salary. His representatives are poised to hold further talks with United chief executive Ed Woodward over the coming weeks.

"At the meeting in Paris between Pep Guardiola and Roman Abramovich in the summer of 2012, the former Barcelona coach made it clear that he craved stability. Abramovich’s track record with managers had not been good, dispensing with Claudio Ranieri, Jose Mourinho, Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Carlo Ancelotti and Andre Villas-Boas when he raged against results. Sensibly, Guardiola approached with caution. At Barcelona, his relationship with successive presidents, Joan Laporta and Sandro Rossell, had fluctuated wildly during Guardiola’s hugely successful spell as head coach. Pep Guardiola, the Bayern Munich coach, craves stability and chooses his clubs based on such assurances . Bayern's dominance of the German domestic scene means Guardiola may be tempted by a move this summer . Manuel Pellegrini's position at Manchester City is under threat as they fight for fourth place . Abramovich had been seduced by Barcelona’s football, the 14 titles that the club won during Guardiola’s four years in charge before he took off to New York with his family for a year-long sabbatical. Chelsea’s inner circle believed they had finally landed their man and Abramovich began recruiting players in anticipation of his arrival. Eden Hazard arrived from Lille for £32m and Oscar from Internacional for £25m. Marko Marin, a £7m capture from Werder Bremen, was another gamble. Then Abramovich blew the deal by firing his European Cup-winning coach the morning after a catastrophic 3-0 defeat in Turin against Antonio Conte’s Juventus. It turned out to be a painful lesson. Guardiola was spooked, pulling out of the deal to become Chelsea’s next manager the following day and decided instead to succeed Jupp Heynckes at Bayern Munich. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich believed he had landed Guardiola in the summer of 2012 - but the then-Barcelona coach was spooked by the Russian's habit of hiring and firing managers . Expecting Guardiola to arrive, Abramovich recruited the likes of Eden Hazard (right) for £32m . Guardiola opted to join Bayern Munich instead and has maintained their dominance in the Bundesliga . BARCELONA . La Liga 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11 . Copa del Rey 2008-09, 2011-12 . Supercopa de Espana 2009, 2010, 2011 . UEFA Champions League 2008-09, 2010-11 . UEFA Super Cup 2009, 2011 . FIFA Club World Cup 2009, 2011 . BAYERN MUNICH . Bundesliga 2013-14 . German Cup 2013-14 . UEFA Super Cup 2013 . FIFA Club World Cup 2013 . This is precisely the scenario that is facing Manchester City as they weigh up what on earth they are going to do with a coach who can no longer motivate his players. It is an open secret that City want Guardiola to become their next manager, but the indications are that he will not be ready to leave Bayern Munich until 2016, when his three-year contract expires, at the very earliest. To wait 12 months or more for a manager who will have the top clubs in the Barclays Premier League falling at his feet when he announces that he will leave the Allianz Arena is a dangerous position to be in. Timing, as ever, is everything. According to the inside story on Guardiola’s first season at Bayern, there is an anecdote in the book Pep Confidential that indicates that he could see himself one day managing Manchester United. In the same book Guardiola also discloses that Txiki Begiristain, the former Barcelona winger who now works at City as the sporting director, also approached him in the summer of 2012. To appeal to Guardiola, he demands stability because he knows the training facilities, the stadium, the support and the financial power, through television rights, commercial arrangements and ticketing, is already in place. To fire Pellegrini with six games left of the Barclays Premier League season would be an admission by City’s owners that anything other than the Premier League trophy or the Champions League warrants a dismissal. City's place in the Premier League top four is under threat from Liverpool and Southampton . City slipped to a 4-2 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, leaving them in fourth place . Pellegrini guided City to the Premier League trophy last season but they've fallen well short this time . That was Chelsea’s game before Mourinho returned, via spells at Inter Milan and Real Madrid, and they lost a lot of goodwill over it. City felt a mild tremor too when word got out that they were about to fire Roberto Mancini, the manager who led them to their first Premier League title, on the eve of the 2013 FA Cup final against Wigan. After that, City vowed to be different. After meekly surrendering their Premier League title and being given another chasing by Barcelona over two legs in the Champions League, it is clear that City have failed to make significant progress under Pellegrini. The concern now, especially after Liverpool’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle on Monday evening, is that the club could yet fall out of the top four. Even though City appear to have a favourable run-in against West Ham, Aston Villa, Tottenham, QPR and Swansea before the final game of the season against Southampton, there is a contingency plan open to them. Guardiola holds the European Cup after Barcelona's 3-1 win over Manchester United in the 2011 final . Guardiola is thrown in the air by his Barcelona players after their 2009 Champions League win . Patrick Vieira, currently in charge of City's Elite Development Squad, could take charge until May . Patrick Vieira, currently in charge of City’s Elite Development Squad, has the respect of the first-team players and could yet be parachuted in to see the season through. Fourth place is critical. The difficulty beyond that scenario is what to do beyond the end of the season because a club with City’s ambitions cannot limp on for another 12 months in the hope that Guardiola becomes available. He demands consistency, a stable environment to allow him to work with his players on the training ground, preparing for a match every three days. That is the cycle for Guardiola at Bayern, picking the bones out of their 3-0 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt at the weekend before moving on to the Champions League quarter-final against Porto in Estadio do Dragao. He is always looking ahead, much like the chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov after they became friends during Guardiola’s year in New York. For Manchester City, it is down to them to make the next move.","Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich believed he had Pep Guardiola in 2012 .

"Manchester City's faltering season has been hit by another blow after it emerged Vincent Kompany may miss the remainder of the campaign. The influential captain was substituted during Sunday's 4-2 derby defeat at Manchester United - a result that effectively ended their hopes of retaining their title and left them looking over their shoulders as they attempt to secure Champions League football. And the under-fire Chilean boss, speaking ahead of Sunday's visit of West Ham United, revealed Kompany may not be seen again this term. Vincent Kompany is not guaranteed to return this season after injuring himself in the Manchester derby . Kompany  could have been sent off for a challenge on Daley Blind before being substituted last weekend . 'He is injured,' said Pellegrini. 'It's very difficult to know. He has a muscle injury. We don't know how many weeks. We don't know if he will be fit from now until the end of the season.' Pellegrini claimed he did not feel under pressure despite speculation mounting that he may be sacked at the end of a disappointing year. Manuel Pellergini claims he is not concerned by the mounting pressure over his position at the Etihad . Bundesliga managers Jurgen Klopp (left) and Pep Guardiola have been linked with a move to City . 'My pressure is always the same,' he said. 'To try and win every game. Last year (there) was more pressure when we were fighting for the title. It's the worst moment but the pressure to recover is not same.' He added that he was not hurt when he heard other managers such as Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola and departing Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp linked with his own job. 'Every time you manage an important club, every big club, if you don't have results the club deserves everyone talks about changing manager. I trust a lot in the work I do. Nobody is happy with results. It's not logical to sack the manager. I don't think that's the right diagnosis.' The reigning champions have slipped from serious title challengers to fears over not finishing in the top four . Pellegrini added that he took the blame for a record that his seen City win just four of their last 15 matches. 'It's always my responsibility for the squad. I choose the players. I always trust my players and its always my responsibility.' Pellegrini is also expected to be without long-term injury victims Stevan Jovetic and Wilfried Bony for the visit of Sam Allardyce's Hammers. He added that James Milner (knee) and Gael Clichy (groin) would also miss out.","Vincent Kompany was injured in the Manchester derby defeat by United .

"Nico Rosberg feels he may have handed Lewis Hamilton a psychological advantage with his post-Chinese Grand Prix outburst. Rosberg, however, concedes he would not do anything differently under the circumstances that materialised at the Shanghai International Circuit on Sunday. To make a complaint about Hamilton's slow driving was understandable given the situation, but to turn on his Mercedes team-mate during the post-race media conference was a sign the Briton has got under Rosberg's skin. Nico Rosberg has claimed that team-mate Lewis Hamilton has the mental edge over him after his outburst . Damon Hill, the 1996 world champion, upon hearing Rosberg's comments remarked the German had shot himself in the foot by publicly airing his grievances. It was a sign of weakness from Rosberg, who on Thursday conceded he had probably provided Hamilton with additional psychological ammunition. 'Maybe, because I'm standing here and I have to answer all these questions,' said Rosberg in the middle of a barrage from the press ahead of this weekend's Bahrain Grand Prix. 'But other than that, I would do it again because I felt the need to state the facts as there was a need to discuss things after that race. Everybody said that. 'That's it, I wouldn't do anything different, and except from being stood here in this room discussing it with you, it's a long time since I last discussed it. 'It's a thing of the past. I'm in Bahrain now and I'm here just to attack in a race car again. 'That's the best answer I can give, on the race track. I'm looking forward to it and that opportunity.' The British driver won the Chinese GP but came under fire from Rosberg for allegedly slowing on purpose . The matter was resolved in a post-race debrief involving the drivers and the team's top brass in motorsport boss Toto Wolff and executive technical director Paddy Lowe. But as to what would transpire should the same scenario occur again in the future, Rosberg said: 'It's so difficult because it's not a thing that's black or white. 'That's what makes all these scenarios difficult. Eventually, once the facts are analysed, there are still different opinions and it's going to be different from one race to the next.' Such a situation could become even more fluid should Ferrari manage to exert further pressure on Mercedes as the title race unfolds. Asked as to what the solution could be moving forward, the 29-year-old replied: 'It's always the same and it will not change. Damon Hill believes that Rosberg shot himself in the foot following his outburst about his Mercedes team-mate . 'It's an agreement we have when the team's one-two is under threat from another team then some management will be used to ensure that, and that might be at the disadvantage of one over the other. 'It becomes a team effort because we want to finish one-two and score the most possible points. 'So the more annoying a Ferrari becomes, the more likely those measures will be used - just like in China when Lewis was told to speed up.' Hamilton was publicly exonerated of any wrongdoing by Wolff and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda as he was merely controlling his pace at a point in the race when he was required to nurse his tyres. For his part, Hamilton has remained unruffled by Rosberg's comments, and does not feel there is any lingering animosity. 'We're moving forwards and we will reunite as a team this weekend and try to do a great job,' said Hamilton. Rosberg is yet to better Hamilton this season but insists he's already forgotten about their recent spat . 'There's no issue between me and Nico. We saw each other this morning and everything is good. 'There are going to be times when people are unhappy about some things, but we're grown-ups and we move past it.' There is no doubt Hamilton has Rosberg rattled as the former has now beaten the latter in nine of the last 10 races stretching back into last year. Rosberg knows he has to stop the rot, adding: 'It was very important to do that in Malaysia, and that was two races back, so that doesn't change. 'Every race is important, and he's 17 points ahead, so I need to get points back as soon as possible. That's clear, and it's not more important here or wherever. 'Last year he had a run of four wins at the beginning of the season, and right after that I had my best part of the year for quite a long time, so there's also that reference from last year.'","Nico Rosberg reckons Lewis Hamilton has the psychological advantage .

"Gary Neville believes Louis van Gaal's greatest achievement as a football manager is the making of Jose Mourinho. Van Gaal and Mourinho come face-to-face on Saturday when the former's Manchester United travel to Premier League leaders Chelsea. The duo have been friends since they first worked together at Barcelona in 1997 where they enjoyed a successful relationship at the Camp Nou. Louis van Gaal's (right) greatest achievement in football is the making of Jose Mourinho, feels Gary Neville . Mourinho (left) and Van Gaal will come face to face again when Chelsea host Manchester United on Saturday . Mourinho (left) worked under Van Gaal as his assistant manager at Barcelona for three years in 1997 . With Mourinho as the Dutchman's assistant, they won the La Liga title twice in their first two years together in Catalonia. It was Van Gaal who entrusted and encouraged the Portuguese to go into management - with the 52-year-old having won titles in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain since as well as the Champions League twice. And in his column for the Telegraph, Neville says Van Gaal will be proud of his friend's achievements. 'A former Tory leader once said when asked what their greatest achievement was: ""New Labour,"" the former United and England defender wrote. 'I can imagine Louis van Gaal, when answering the same question from a group of journalists, peering back from his desk and responding: ""Mourinho"".' Ahead of Saturday's clash at Stamford Bridge United have been dealt a quadruple injury blow with the news that Phil Jones, Michael Carrick, Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo will all be unavailable. Van Gaal though will be able to call on the services of the in-form Marouane Fellaini. The Belgian midfielder has scored twice in United's last four league games - including a header in their 4-2 derby win over rivals Manchester City on April 12. Marcos Rojo (right) is one of four United players who will miss their league trip to Chelsea due to injury . The Red Devils have in-form midfielder Maraoune Fellaini (left) available for the trip to Stamford Bridge . Fellaini (right) scored United's second goal in their 4-2 win over Manchester City on April 12 . And Neville believes Mourinho may try to nulify the threat of the big Belgian midfielder by selecting John Obi Mikel or Kurt Zouma in midfield. Neville added: 'As for Mourinho, will he blink and deploy John Obi Mikel or Kurt Zouma in midfield alongside Nemanja Matic to deal with Marouane Fellaini in that dangerous United left channel? 'If he does, how will his team get hold of the ball without the rhythm of Cesc Fabregas in that deeper role and feed an attack already hit by the loss of Diego Costa? I could see United having 60 to 65% of the ball if Mourinho does opt for this solution. 'As a tactic, this wouldn't ordinarily worry the Chelsea manager, but the idea of Van Gaal going to Stamford Bridge and not only winning, but also dominating the ball, would maybe open up the wounds of his early encounters with Barcelona while coaching Real Madrid, when the Barca purists outplayed and beat his team well. I’m also pretty sure it would not be something that Roman Abramovich would enjoy. 'My hope is that they go for each other in a manner which suggests that both feel that they are superior in the football department.' John Obi Mikel (centre right) could start in midfield for Chelsea in a tactic to nullify the threat of Fellaini .","Chelsea entertain Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday .

Manuel Pellegrini has admitted he has been disappointed by the Ivory Coast midfielder's level . ‘I don’t think he’s happy with his performance this year — and nor am I,’ said Pellegrini. ‘He doesn’t need a break.’ Toure, who has two years left on a £220,000-a-week deal, has come in for criticism amid the collapse of City’s Premier League defence. But Pellegrini, who faces questions over his own future, said the 31-year-old would be backed. ‘He’s a very important player and he will have my support until the end of the season,’ he said.

With his manager in the firing line, City goalkeeper Joe Hart insisted the players should take responsibility. ‘People have been disappointed in their own performances,’ said the England No 1. ‘We’ve let the manager down a few times and we’ve baffled ourselves because we feel like we’ve got the quality to beat anyone and that’s not been the case.’ City boss Pellegrini has vowed to support Toure until at least the end of the season . Sportsmail revealed that Manchester City will listen to offers for Toure in the summer . Hart added that Pellegrini retained the backing of the dressing room. ‘He’s been great,’ Hart said. ‘He’s hard, he kind of says it how it is and you can’t ask for much more than that from a manager.’ Pellegrini, however, said: ‘The players have responsibility but I choose the players.’ Meanwhile Sam Allardyce has warned Aaron Cresswell not to make the same mistake as others amid interest from Chelsea and Manchester City.

Egg-traordinary: US YouTube user Elman511 cracked open an over-sized egg (shown on the left) that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’ In the video, Elman511 cracks the egg, which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. He then cracks the smaller egg, which also has a yolk and white inside. ‘That’s the end of the nesting dolls of egg…an egg inside of an egg… crazy man,’ he said, before noting that the yolks look rich. Egg-citing: In the video, ‘Elman511’ cracks the egg (pictured), which is double the size of a normal one, to find a standard-sized egg inside, along with yolk and white. The unusual occurrence is down to a counter-peristalsis contraction . This is when a second oocyte (yolk) is released by the hen's ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The unusual occurrence is called a counter-peristalsis contraction. A hen releases an oocyte from her left ovary into her oviduct every 18 to 26 hours, Back Yard Poultry Mag explained. Usually, the oocyte travels down the oviduct, adding layers of the egg until it’s laid through the hen’s vent. But in a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. When the second oocyte’s released, the first is in the eggshell-gland portion of the oviduct, were the shell is made. It’s thought that a shock, or stress causes a contraction, forcing first egg to reverse its course. This means that the first egg is added to the second oocyte, which then travels down the oviduct and is covered in a shell, creating a giant egg around the first one. The phenomenon has been mentioned as far back as 1250 AD by the Dominican friar and polymath Albertus Magnus in his book De Animalibus. Ask the egg-spert: In a counter-peristalsis contraction, a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completed its journey. This results in an egg with another made inside it, producing two yolks (pictured)","Unusual egg was captured on camera by US YouTube user Elman511 .

"This is the moment a man slipped onto a subway track - and another instinctively leaped down to help him. Surveillance footage from Philadelphia's 15th Street Station shows one passenger lose his balance as he tries to skirt past somebody on the platform at 6.40 on Wednesday night. He falls, and bystanders jump back in shock. But almost instantaneously, a man in an Eagles jacket runs over and throws himself onto the tracks to save him. Fallen: This man was walking close to the edge of Philadelphia's 15 Street Station platform on Wednesday at 6.40pm when he tumbled. His would-be rescuer is seen walking along the platform (center), initially unaware . Shock: Bystanders   rushed back in shock as the fallen man dropped from view. The rescuer is behind a pillar . Good Samaritan: But within a second, the man in an Eagles jacket ran back to the spot where the man fell . Pulling the man to his feet, the Good Samaritan pushes him up toward the platform edge, where other passengers have gathered to pull both men to safety. Within a minute, transport officials arrived to deliver first aid to the men, who are expected to survive any injuries. Thomas Nestal, police chief of Philadelhpia's transport department (SEPTA), hailed the unnamed Good Samaritan's quick response, and the help of his fellow passengers. 'This was a case where everybody almost in view jumped in and got involved,' Nestal told NBC. Nestel recommended that in future commuters should use the emergency phone to tell authorities to turn off the electricity on the line. Leaping in: He jumped off the side as other commuters ran to alert the authorities . Lifting him up: Surveillance footage shows the fallen man looking shocked and frantic . Pulled to safety: The Good Samaritan pushed the fallen man onto the platform then jumped up after him . Ordeal: The pair lay on the platform in shock for a minute after making it off the subway tracks . The platform is one of many slated to be renovated and modernized in a four-year development project starting next year. SEPTA plans to keep 15th Street Station open for Pope Francis's visit in the fall, despite acknowledging that the platforms are small and outdated. However, work is already under way to stem persistent leaks from the concrete ceilings.","CCTV shows a man fall while walking along Philadelphia platform .

"Two jaguar cubs were proudly unveiled to the public for the first time at a Russian zoo yesterday. The month-old cubs, born March 11, were captured on video sitting before press and public at Leningrad Zoo in Saint Petersburg while photographs were taken of the pair. From the same litter, the two cubs – one black, the other spotty – are the fifth brood of mother and father Agnes and Rock. The cubs were month-old when they were unveiled to press and public on Wednesday . According to the zoo, the two young cats have both reached an ideal weight of 3kg and their teeth have already started to grow. The jaguars are featured in the video away from their parents, and their father will not be involved in the upbringing of the cubs. Jaguars are solitary animals and only see each other while mating, so zoo keepers intend on keeping Rock in a separate enclosure.

The two young cats have both reached an ideal weight of 3kg and their teeth have already started to grow . Svetlana Shelgunova, Head of the Department of Predatory Mammals at Leningrad Zoo, features in the video. She says: ‘Now they manifested their playful behaviour.

"Police say the parents of a 3-year-old boy have been charged with endangering his welfare after they overdosed on heroin while giving him a bath in New Hampshire. Eric Carter and Stephanie McCassin, both of Manchester, were arrested on warrants Thursday, four months after the child's grandmother and primary caretaker, Mary MacDonald, reported finding the child in the tub, with the parents passed out on Dec. 4. Overdose: Eric Carter, 21 (right), and Stephanie McCassin, 24 (left), of New Hampshire, have been charged with endangering the welfare of a child after allegedly overdosing on heroin while giving their 3-year-old son a bath .

"Gareth Bale pulled up with a calf strain after just two minutes of Real Madrid’s league game on Saturday and will almost certainly miss the second leg of the Champions League against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. One year and two days, after one of his greatest moments at Real Madrid when he ran half the length of the pitch to score the winner in the Copa del Rey final, Bale broke down with a muscle pull against Malaga. He will have further tests on the left calf muscle in the next 24 hours but the concern shown when he went down at the start of Real’s crucial league game suggested his chances of recovering inside three days are non-existent and that he could also face a race to be fit for the Champions League semi-final on May 5-6. Gareth Bale went down injured after less than five minutes at the Bernabeu on Saturday evening . The Welsh forward was forced off and faces a race to be fit for Real's Champions League quarter-final . Cristiano Ronaldo was the first player to go across to Bale as he sat waiting for treatment and the Welshman’s expression spoke volumes – he knew he would not be able to carry on and could now miss out on Real’s most important game of the season. Bale has not been injured since October of last year when a hip problem kept him out for three weeks. The team won all their games without him with a four-man midfield of Luka Modric, James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Isco with Ronaldo and Karim Benzema up front. That will be Carlo Ancelotti’s selection for the game on Wednesday if Benzema recovers from the knee knock that kept him out of Saturday’s meeting with Malaga. Bale’s absence will be a massive blow for Ancelotti however. He said in midweek: ‘Bale was fantastic last season and has been very good this year. He scored goals in the finals last season and he will be important for us as this season reaches its climax.’ Cristiano Ronaldo was the first Madrid player to go over to Bale, and they eventually beat Malaga 3-1 .","Gareth Bale suffered a calf strain on Saturday evening at the Bernabeu .

"Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer’s passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation. At the same time, managers at the passport agency, which made a £42 million profit during the chaos, received up to £3,500 in bonuses. Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through, and even to some who missed out on trips. Scroll down for video . The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer . Keith Vaz, who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation, said last night: ‘I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office, especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds.’ The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents. By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system. Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service, but thousands had already paid the extra £30 per passport for this. Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time. Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office. In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year, scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year. The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved . This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back. Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades. HM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year. In 2013-14, the most recent figures available, managers were handed a total of £1.8 million in bonuses, with the average reward £499 and the highest £3,500.","HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6million Britons applications .

"England midfielders Jordan Henderson and Jack Wilshere are the surprise names on Manchester City’s summer shopping list. The struggling Barclays Premier League champions know they need more English players in their starting line-up — goalkeeper Joe Hart has often been the only one this season — and Liverpool’s Henderson and Arsenal’s Wilshere are deemed to be realistic targets. City also maintain an interest in Liverpool’s unsettled England forward Raheem Sterling, with 36-year-old veteran Frank Lampard set to leave and 29-year-old James Milner likely to follow him out of the Etihad Stadium. England midfielder Jack Wilshere (right) is a surprise target on Manchester City’s summer shopping list . Wilshere tries to cut inside during his appearance for Arsenal's Under 21 side on Tuesday night . Liverpool's Jordan Henderson is another surprise name among targets of Manchester City for this summer . Manchester City also maintain an interest in Liverpool's unsettled forward Raheem Sterling . Henderson, 24, has come to City’s attention because he has only one year left on his Liverpool contract. Their concern about Wilshere, 23, who has over two years left on his Arsenal deal, is his injury record. He has yet to return to Arsene Wenger’s side since having surgery on his troublesome left ankle in November. There is a well-trodden path between Arsenal and City over the past five years. The Manchester club, who offer far bigger salaries, have spent £80million on Samir Nasri, Bacary Sagna, Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure and Gael Clichy. Frank Lampard was among the few English representatives for Manchester City at Selhurst Park . Joe Hart (centre) was the only England player that started while James Milner (right) came on as a sub . Wilshere played 90 minutes for Arsenal as he stepped up in his return from injury at the Emirates . Henderson clears the ball during Liverpool's defeat by Arsenal at the Emirates in the Premier League . And City will certainly need to make bids in excess of £30m to tempt Arsenal or Liverpool to sell. Not all of City’s targets will be English, though, with the club willing to use France star Nasri and Bosnia forward Edin Dzeko as bait in a deal to sign Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba. Pogba, a 22-year-old France international, was on Manchester United’s books before moving to Italy. City see him as the long-term successor to the fading Yaya Toure, although Pogba could cost as much as £60m. Nasri and Dzeko have had poor seasons and are expected to be part of a summer cull.

"Barcelona forward Pedro's decision to consider his Camp Nou future at the end of the season could see him end up at Anfield if Liverpool sell Raheem Sterling. The 27-year-old World Cup winner would command £90,000-a-week wages – £10,000 less than Liverpool have offered their 20-year-old winger. Pedro would also cost considerably less than Sterling – understood to be available for £50million - would sell for. Barcelona forward Pedro could join Liverpool this summer if Raheem Sterling leaves Anfield . Sterling, pictured in action against Arsenal, has rejected a new £100,000-a-week deal with Liverpool . Pedro, pictured celebrating a goal against Elche, would command wages of £90,000-a-week . If that price does not deter Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal or Real Madrid then Pedro, who has been looked at before by Brendan Rodgers, would become a realistic target for Liverpool. The two-times Champions League winner is set to start for Barcelona on Wednesday night against Almeria but only so that Neymar or Luis Suarez can be rested ahead of a vital away trip to Sevilla at the weekend. Pedro is believed to be tired of being the fourth man in Barcelona's all-star three-man attack and Inter Milan and Bayern Munich have also shown an interest in him. Joining his former manager Pep Guardiola at Bayern would leave Pedro with the same difficulty when it came to getting into the first team that he encounters at Barcelona, while Inter would not be able to match Liverpool in terms of wages. Sterling has attracted interest from Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich . Pedro has spent much of the season on the bench with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez starting games . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has scouted Pedro and could make a move for the Spain international . Rodgers admitted at the weekend that finishing outside the Champions League creates a problem when trying to sign top players but a regular starting place in Liverpool's XI could be just as important for Pedro. Barcelona cannot sign players until January 2016 but that will not stop them selling this summer if the price is right. Alex Song will also be allowed to leave the club. Two men the Catalans want to keep are Xavi Hernandez and Dani Alves. Xavi looks set to move to Qatar where he was pictured recently meeting representatives of Al Saad and touring the Aspire Academy. He does however want to delay a formal announcement until the end of the season. Alves has offers from several big European clubs but has not ruled out staying at Barcelona if they improve on the one-year contract extension they have so far offered him.

"BMW is recalling 91,800 Mini Coopers to fix a defect that may prevent the air bag on the front passenger side of the cars from deploying in a crash. The problem affects the 2005 to 2008 models of the Mini Cooper and Cooper S. BMW says the air bag may not work properly because of a error that might prevent the vehicles' mat detection system from sensing a passenger sitting in the front seat during a severe crash. BMW has announced that  2005 to 2008 models of the Mini Cooper and Cooper S will need to be recalled due to problems with the passenger detection system that could leave those in the car without an airbad . BMW told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it has been notified of one minor injury linked to the defect. To repair the problem, BMW will replace the detection mats in the affected models for free. The recall of the mats, which are manufactured in Germany, will begin May 1. There are 59,270 Mini Cooper and Cooper S models made between 2005 and 2006 affected by the issue along with 32,530  convertibles made between 2005 and July 2008, according to Bloomberg. Only one person has been injured so far as a result of the passenger seat (right) defect.

"Juventus and Inter Milan are among clubs showing interest in Robin van Persie's situation at Old Trafford. The Manchester United striker has been out of the picture during the club's rise up the table with an ankle ligament injury ruling him out for the past six weeks. He has still managed 10 goals this season but his performances have been under par. United want to liven up their strikeforce in the summer and are looking to bring in two new forwards with Radamel Falcao expected to return to Monaco and Van Persie in danger of becoming a more peripheral figure.

The Dutchman scores United's opening goal in their win against Leicester City at Old Trafford in January . The Holland international turns 32 in August and will have one year left on his contract at the end of this season. United will talk to him in the summer but would listen to what other clubs have to offer. Juventus and Inter are admirers and know he could give them a short-term quality option.

"Inter Milan are prepared to offer Yaya Toure a five-year contract to lure him away from Manchester City this summer. Despite the fact Toure turns 32 next month, Roberto Mancini is so desperate to sign the powerful midfielder that he's ready to give the Ivory Coast midfielder a deal that will see him play beyond his 37th birthday. Mancini, who signed Toure for Manchester City in 2010, is working hard behind the scenes to bring Toure to Serie A next season. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure remains a top target for Serie A giants Inter Milan . Toure, pictured with Vincent Kompany, will be offered a new deal by Manchester City in the summer . Former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini is keen on bringing Toure to the San Siro . The Italian believes Toure has the capacity to dominate games in Serie A well into his mid-30s, like Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo has. The midfielder's representatives are fully aware of Inter's interest and are keeping their options open going into the summer. City want to keep Toure, who currently earns £220,000-per-week, and will offer him a new contract at the end of the season, which will also include the opportunity to take up an ambassadorial role at the club when his playing days are over. But Inter will test City's resolve to keep Toure this summer and hope the prospect of a long-term deal will be enough to persuade the former Barcelona to leave England.

"Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels is leaving his options open amid speculation he may leave the club in the summer as he admits he is contemplating leaving the club. The German centre-back gave an interview in Kicker magazine last week in which he demanded a stronger Dortmund team for next season, otherwise he may consider his own future. The Westphalians seem certain to miss out on a place in the Champions League next season while they may not even qualify for the Europa League, and Hummels has admitted again he may not be sticking with the club for much longer. Mats Hummels has admitted he is considering his future at Borussia Dortmund . The Germany defender has consistently been linked with a big-money move to Manchester United . 'That doesn't mean that I am leaving, it just means I'm reflecting,' he told Sky television following a 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich at the weekend. 'There's no particular tendency one way or the other. It's just thoughts going through my mind. It will all become clearer in the coming weeks.' In 2007, when he moved to Dortmund from Bayern, he turned down an approach from Hoffenheim and said that was a 'gut feeling'. Hummels closes down Mario Gotze during Dortmund's 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich on Saturday . 'It's going to be the same again this time,' added the 26-year-old, who still has two years left to run on his contract with Dortmund, but has already attracted attention from several other clubs around Europe. Manchester United were reportedly willing to offer up to £30million for his services - an amount Dortmund may struggle to reject if they cannot count on earning that sort of money from the Champions League next season.","Mats Hummels has been linked with a move to Manchester United .

"Arsenal are close to signing Argentine wonderkid Maxi Romero - who has been dubbed the next Lionel Messi. The Gunners are in advanced talks with Velez Sarsfield over a £4.5million swoop for the teenage sensation. Arsenal are confident of completing a deal for the 16-year-old in the coming days. Arsenal are close to signing 16-year-old Maxi Romero from Velez Sarsfield for £4.5million . 'Arsenal have made a big offer for Maxi Romero.

'Maxi has huge potential but he is going to complete apprenticeship at a great club like Velez.' The Argentine wonderkid has been dubbed the next Lionel Messi and would stay at Velez on loan . Romero is expected to remain with Velez, on loan, for at least two more seasons before coming to England to begin his career with Arsenal.

"Shay Given has revealed the pain still lingers from Ruud Gullit’s decision to snub him for the 1999 FA Cup final between Newcastle and Manchester United. The Republic of Ireland goalkeeper played every round of Newcastle’s run but was dropped in favour of Steve Harper for the Wembley showpiece, won 2-0 by Sir Alex Ferguson’s side. Given has yet to experience a truly fulfilling visit to the national stadium. He played in the 1998 FA Cup final loss to Arsenal, as well as the semi-final defeat to Chelsea in 2000 . Shay Given will start for Aston Villa against Liverpool in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . He has an FA Cup winners’ medal from 2011 but was an unusued substitute for the final against Stoke with Joe Hart in net. He is out to make amends against Liverpool. ‘It was nice to be part of winning it with Man City but when you don’t play it doesn’t have the same value,’ he said. ‘I don’t know where my medal is to be honest. ‘1999 was a bit of a slap in the face. Do you ever get over it, I suppose? It’s not an easy one. Ruud Gullit didn’t even tell me, he got the goalkeeping coach Terry Gennoe to tell me I wasn’t playing. ‘But you can’t look back in football, you’ve just got to look forward. I’d love to win a trophy and make a bit of history at Aston Villa.’ The 38-year-old has played in all four of Villa's FA Cup matches this season and has kept two clean-sheets . Villa manager Tim Sherwood confirmed Given will start on Sunday, a day before the Irishman turns 39 . Manager Tim Sherwood has confirmed Given, who turns 39 tomorrow, will keep his Cup place rather than be replaced by No 1 Brad Guzan. Given has played every round of the competition, beginning under Paul Lambert, and make key saves along the way. Given admitted he felt matches of this magnitude had passed him by when he was out on loan at Middlesbrough last season, as Lambert jettisoned players he needed to remove off the wage bill. Last April, he was in the dugout assisting Villa’s former manager as coach when Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa were suspended. ‘I am employed by Aston Villa and I felt I could help out,’ said Given. ‘Life is too short to have grudges.’ Sherwood watched his Villa side in training as they prepare for the Sunday's crunch clash . Sherwood, his former Blackburn teammate, has provided a ‘new lease of life’. ‘Tim is a very ambitious guy, he wants to keep the club in the Premier League and win the FA Cup. There have been occasions this season where people have seen the angry side. But ten minutes later he is putting his arm around the same player. One of his best skills is man management. He knows how to get the best out of people.’ Given has regained his place in the Ireland team and is wants to play at Euro 2016 should his country qualify. He would also like to take the goalkeeping shirt off Brad Guzan in the Premier League. He has a year left on his contract this summer and will discuss his prospects with Sherwood. ‘This run has shown I’m still capable and hopefully it gives a seed of doubt into the manager’s head as well that if he wants to mix it up in the Premier League.’ Aston Villa defeated rivals West Brom 2-0 in the last round to book their semi-final appearance at Wembley .","Shay Given to start against Liverpool in FA Cup a day before he turns 39 .

"Steven Gerrard is set to get the nod to start at Wembley today as Liverpool bid to reach the FA Cup final against Aston Villa. The 34-year-old has flitted in and out of Brendan Rodgers’ side this term and will end his long association with the club at the end of this season. Gerrard is set to embark on a new chapter with LA Galaxy, and wants his glittering career in England to finish with a trophy at the national stadium. Steven Gerrard is set to start the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Aston Villa on Sunday . Gerrard has been missing all month after serving his three-match ban for seeing red against Man United . Midfield player Gerrard lifted Liverpool's last trophy at Wembley, the League Cup, in 2012 . Gerrard last lifted the FA Cup in 2006 at the Millennium Stadium, when Liverpool beat West Ham on penalties . That destiny is in his own hands after Rodgers’ decision to start the skipper at Wembley on Sunday afternoon. Gerrard will patrol the middle of midfield to mark his 36th - and potentially final - game at Wembley . He is straight back into the side after serving a three-match suspension for seeing red just 38 seconds after coming on a substitute against Manchester United last month.

Rodgers (left) praised Gerrard, describing him as 'a special player' who has 'produced big goals' Gerrard's first taste of FA Cup glory came in 2001 when Liverpool beat Arsenal 2-1 . 'He's definitely ready,' Rodgers said. 'We played a behind closed doors game on Monday which he and a few of the other players that have been out played in. Steven is fine. 'He's a special player.

"Burnley boss Sean Dyche insists his team will not resort to diving and cheating in their battle against relegation. Dyche says he has been shocked by the amount of simulation he has witnessed during Burnley's first season back in the Barclays Premier League. He claims another manager has urged him to 'move with the times' and instruct his players to seek out decisions. Sean Dyche is insistent that his Burnley players won't ever dive or cheat to prosper under him . But while Dyche accepts his players are naive on such matters, he insists that is the way he likes it and will not be asking them to follow suit, regardless of their situation. Burnley are second from bottom with just six games remaining but are only two points from a safe position and have earned many plaudits for their battling displays. Dyche said: 'There is a certain way of playing. I believe the team play in the correct manner. There's been minimal, if any, simulation from our players. I see it constantly in this league, more so than I ever thought I would. The Clarets have established themselves as one of the hardest working teams in the Premier League . 'At this level we have been naive at times, in the right way. I think that's sad that players just can't go out and play and get decisions that they should get. 'One prominent manager I am not going to name said to me, 'You are being naive, you should get your players to move with the times'. It's not my belief. You should play the game properly. 'If someone touches you in the box and you go down, that's always been there - that's not cheating, that's just gamesmanship. That's part of the game. There is a difference. 'I'm on about absolute simulation where there is no contact and people go to the floor.' With relegation a real possibility, Burnley are fighting for their lives at the bottom of the division . Dyche feels while football gets into a moral tangle over certain high-profile, one-off incidents, this issue of repeated cheating is all too often overlooked. In terms of policing it, he sympathises with referees and wants the system of retrospective punishment extended to cover blatant acts of simulation. He said: 'It would evaporate out of the game within two, three or four weeks because managers who have some amazing players will say, 'We can't be losing you for three games'. 'I'd like to know the reason it hasn't been brought in, and if it is getting really looked at in depth. Dyche was told by another manager to 'get with the times' and that his team was too naive . 'It's only because I think morally we talk to our kids about fairness and playing the right way, and yet, in one of the most powerful leagues in the world, there are people dropping everywhere. 'Weirdly, you'll open a debate about Raheem Sterling, put him all over the papers saying he's doing this, that and the other, but yet something that is there for all to see all of the time every week, is sort of accepted. Strange isn't it? 'If that was my centre-half and someone is through and he pulls the shirt, he gets banned. It's cheating. It's the same difference isn't it?'","Sean Dyche says his Burnley players won't cheat or dive to win .

"Paul Scholes believes the turning point of Manchester United’s season came when Angel di Maria was sent off against Arsenal in FA Cup as it allowed Louis van Gaal to turn to his fringe players. Di Maria was sent off in the Cup tie at Old Trafford after picking up two yellow cards – one for simulation and one for decent – and forced the United boss to change his starting line-up. The £60million signing missed Manchester United’s impressive 3-0 win over Tottenham in which Marouane Fellaini was one of the stand out players and a result that sparked United’s impressive run of form which has seen them go on and beat Liverpool and Manchester City in recent weeks. Marouane Fellaini celebrates scoring against Manchester City as United continue their good run of form . Angel di Maria was sent off against Arsenal in the FA Cup back in March . Writing in his Independent column, Scholes said: ‘When I look back on the key changes, I still feel that Angel Di Maria’s red card against Arsenal was critical in allowing Van Gaal to build this new-look team. Looking at the side it seems to me to be a triumph of the underdog – Juan Mata, Marouane Fellaini, Ashley Young. All of whom looked like they could be out the picture at the start of the season and are now having a big impact.’ Despite United’s impressive run of form which has seen them pick up 25 points from their last 10 games – Scholes says they are still some way off challenging for the title and putting a good run a form together towards the end of the season is not what makes a great team. Juan Mata has been in good form for United in recent games scoring three in his last three games . Paul Scholes says United's good run of form has come at a time when they have nothing to play for . Scholes says United needed to be consistent throughout the season and build up towards the end of the campaign – and not just turn on the style when they have nothing to play for. He added: ‘Amidst all this revival spirit I should point one thing out. United are putting the results together now with the pressure off, to a large extent. They are too far off in the title race – barring a total collapse from Chelsea – and the only thing to play for is a Champions League place. How many times over the years have we seen Arsenal turn on the form to get their top four spot at the end of the season when they have no chance of winning the title? ‘It is all well and good being strong in the last three months. The really serious teams are in there from the start and they get stronger before Christmas and then into the run-in. There is a big difference between title form and a late surge for a Champions League place.’","Angel di Maria's red card forced Louis van Gaal to look at other players .

"Arsenal defender Calum Chambers has enjoyed a promising start to his career in North London, with his versatility proving a key asset in the Gunners backline and is adamant he will play a central part in their future success. During a fine debut season Chambers, who signed from Southampton last July for £16million, has established himself as a first team regular having already made 36 appearances for Arsenal. There was a point before Christmas when Wenger admitted to overplaying Chambers with only Santi Cazorla (45), Alexis Sanchez (44) and Per Mertesacker (40) having appeared more times for the Gunners this campaign. Arsenal defender Calum Chambers has enjoyed a fine first season with the North London club . Having signed last summer, Wenger told the 20-year-old he will utilise him at centre back, with World Cup winner Per Mertesacker returning late from the German triumph in Brazil: . ‘We went to Austria during pre-season and had a training session. The manager told me, “You’re going to be training as a centre-half here because you may have an opportunity to play there at the start of the season”,’ Chambers told the Sun. ‘So I trained at centre-half a few times and it went from there. I made my debut in the Community Shield at Wembley and started a lot of games, Premier League and Champions League in that position.’ Chambers (centre) celebrates as Arsenal continue a recent run of form to go second in the Premier League . Arsenal's defender has gone from strength to strength following £16million move from Southampton in 2014 . Chambers caught the eye during his start to life at the Emirates and was also deployed at right back and in a central holding midfield role. However Chambers is determined to see his future in central defence for club and country. ‘I don’t want to be known as a utility player who just slots in here, there and everywhere as I want my own secured position. But it’s good for me because it’s giving me more opportunities to get game time under my belt. ‘Long-term, I think I’ll end up as a central defender. It’s my favourite position.’ Chambers works hard in training (left) as the Gunners prepare to face Reading in the FA Cup semi-final .

"Tim Sherwood wants to wipe any smile from Raheem Sterling’s face by causing an FA Cup shock at Wembley on Sunday. Footage this week emerged showing the Liverpool forward inhaling nitrous oxide, a legal high commonly known as laughing gas because it creates feelings of euphoria . But Sherwood said: ‘Let's hope he's not laughing after Sunday.’ Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood is hoping they can cause a FA Cup semi-final shock vs Liverpool on Sunday . Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season . The Aston Villa manager knows his ambitions to beat Liverpool and reach the FA Cup final may rest on taming Sterling, a player he tried to sign for Tottenham Hotpur’s academy as a schoolboy. The 20-year-old is enduring a tough time off the pitch, in a contract stand-off with Liverpool and coming under question for his recreational activities. Sterling has been pictured smoking shisha pipes as well as taking so-called ‘hippy crack’ through a balloon. Sherwood said that was wrong but added: ‘I have a wee bit of sympathy. I am not condoning it, but he is a young man, isn’t he? He obviously has fortunes but is growing up like everyone else. It is tough in the public eye.’ Sherwood can remember being wowed by a 14-year-old Sterling on the books at Queens Park Rangers, but was unable to convince Spurs to commit the money required to sign him. Instead, Sterling headed to Anfield for £600,000 in 2010. ‘A lot of academies pick players on size because the bigger kids normally push the little kids over and their teams can win the games,’ said Sherwood. ‘He wouldn’t be much different from what he is now but you wouldn’t want to fight him would you?’ Sherwood has been a fan of Liverpool starlet Sterling (left) ever since he was 14 and on the books at QPR . Another Liverpool player Sherwood discussed on Friday was Steven Gerrard, whose birthday falls on the FA Cup final on May 30. Those associated with the Merseyside club feel an ideal silverware send-off is brewing before Gerrard heads to LA Galaxy. ‘Believe it or not it’s not about spoiling the party for Steven Gerrard,’ insisted Sherwood. ‘It’s about what we can do. To be honest we’re hoping he’s on his holiday in May.’ Sherwood played against a teenage Gerrard in his latter days and hailed the 34-year-old’s clear talent from the off. He added: ‘I’m sure Steven could still do a job for a Premier League side but I’m not sure he can go and play for anyone other than Liverpool. He can earn £1 a week or £200,000, he’ll still play the same way. That’s a dying breed – there aren’t many of them about.’ Sherwood has led a Villa resurgence since taking over in February, steering the club away from relegation danger and into this Wembley showpiece. They are on a run of four wins in seven. Liverpool have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for the FA Cup semi after serving a three-match ban . The match could be Gerrard's (left) last in the competition before his move to LA Galaxy in the summer . Sherwood believes Villa can upset favourites Liverpool. ‘It’s a very exciting game, a great opportunity for this club to get to an FA Cup final,’ he said. ‘I’ve lost a few semi-finals myself, not a great feeling. ‘We’re going in with a positive state of mind. This club’s relegation is not at stake, it is about us maybe getting some glory for the football club. ‘We have the mindset to win the game, impose ourselves on a very good Liverpool side, that’s what we intend to do. ‘We think we’re capable, we have a good blend of players who can play and maybe go direct at time. We’re prepared to mix it up, we have a plan.’ Despite the possible return of Gerrard, Sherwood is confident his Villa side can cause a shock at Wembley .","Aston Villa play Liverpool in their FA Cup semi-final on Sunday at Wembley .

"Jose Mourinho claims it is easier to manage Manchester United than Chelsea within the modern confines of UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. United, as one of the biggest earners in world football, have the financial scope to fund a massive squad, while Chelsea are forced to sell players such as Juan Mata to balance the books. Jose Mourinho claims it's 'hard but more fun' being Chelsea manager in new fair play era . Mourinho has been forced to sell players to balance the books at Chelsea . 'Yes, it's easier,' said Mourinho. 'It was easier before at Chelsea, but it's more fun like this. More difficult of course. We sold a lot of players, not just Juan.' United boss Louis van Gaal will be without Michael Carrick, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind for the Barclays Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge today. But Mourinho said: 'Their squad is amazing in terms of numbers, players, experience, solutions. 'I have on the big screen in my office, not the team I'm going to play against but the squad and all the options. 'This week, when I arrived in the room, for the first time, I realised what they have. I'm not saying it's the best squad. It's a very good squad. I went to QPR with Didier Drogba and no strikers on the bench and, for a long time we were in trouble. You have to cope.'

The Premier League leaders, who play Manchester United on Saturday, have been criticised for hounding match officials this season and official figures report the Blues to be serial offenders.

Mourinho was fined by the Football Association after complaining of a 'clear campaign' against Chelsea in December and has had reason for his discontent to heighten this season. Nemanja Matic was sent off against Burnley following his reaction to an Ashley Barnes challenge and subsequently banned - rather than reprieved - and Mourinho suggested the match delegate was enjoying Chelsea's hospitality.

Champagne of high quality. Cristal. Everything.' Mourinho again defended his players' conduct. 'It's not true,' he said. 'I know that a lie repeated and repeated, there is a risk for it to become true in people's eyes. But I always disagree with that. 'I think a lie is a lie. No problem.'

"A newly-released film about Manny Pacquiao offers a look into the Philippine boxer's childhood ahead of his much anticipated fight against Floyd Mayweather Jnr next month. 'Kid Kulafu', named after a brand of wine whose bottles Pacquiao collected as a child, charts his rise from humble beginnings to his first step into the boxing ring. 'He's just like every one of us,' director Paul Soriano said at the film's Manila premiere on Tuesday night. 'He was born with nothing but because of God, because of hard work and faith, he became something.' Scroll down to watch the trailer . Film director Paul Soriano (left) with actors Buboy Villar and Alessandra De Ross at the premiere of Kid Kulafu . Villar (right) plays the part of a young Pacquiao as he rises from humble beginnings to a boxing career . Soriano spent two years researching the film, much of it based on conversations with 36-year-old Pacquiao. 'Everyone can mimic his moves, but you can't easily copy his courage,' said Buboy Villar, who plays the young boxer. 'Pacquiao always faces people who are bigger than him and, as you can see, he's scrawny as a kid, so I think all the rough experiences he had growing up helped to make him strong.' The film opened in Philippine cinemas on Wednesday and will be shown in selected cinemas in the US and Canada later this month.

"Rafa Nadal got his clay court season off to a perfect, confidence-boosting start with a 6-2, 6-1 win over Frenchman Lucas Pouille in the Monte Carlo Masters. It was a businesslike display from the world No 5. He didn’t unleash the full power of his forehand but played sensible, measured tennis and made only five unforced errors in the match. His talented 21-year-old opponent showed flashes of attacking flair, including one outrageous half-volley forehand winner, but was never able to put enough balls in court to trouble the great Spaniard. Rafael Nadal safely made his way into third round of the Monte Carlo Masters with win against Lucas Pouille . Nadal got his clay court season off to the perfect start with a straight sets victory 6-2, 6-1 . Nadal broke in the sixth game of the match to go 4-2 up, and a shanked backhand from the world No 108 handed him another break and the first set. The nine-time French Open winner began the second set in the same steady form and broke Pouille twice to serve for the match at 5-1. He arrowed a vintage forehand down the line to seal a place in the third round, where he will face either John Isner or Viktor Troicki. The Spaniard is an eight-time champion in Monte Carlo, but has not won here since 2012 and said last week that he is ‘not the favourite for anything’ at the moment. Frenchman Pouille showed glimpses of his talent but was unable to trouble Nadal . Nadal is an eight-time champion at Monte Carlo but hasn't won the tournament since 2012 . This victory was the first step in rebuilding his self-belief after disappointing losses in the quarter-finals of the Indian Wells Masters and the third round in Miami last month. It is too early to say that the king of clay is back to his best, and he will face sterner tests later in the week, but he could not have asked for a better opening display.","Rafa Nadal beat Lucas Pouille 6-2, 6-1 in the second round on Wednesday .

"Jordan Spieth admitted he would probably sleep in the green jacket after claiming his first major title in record-breaking fashion in the 79th Masters. Spieth became the first player ever to reach 19 under par at Augusta and only a bogey on the 18th prevented him from adding the 72-hole scoring record to the 36 and 54-hole records he set on Friday and Saturday. The 21-year-old also became the second youngest champion behind Tiger Woods - whose 18-under total he equalled - after a closing 70 left him four shots ahead of Justin Rose and Phil Mickelson.

Spieth became the first player to reach 19 under par at Augusta and eventually won with an 18-under total . Spieth poses in his green jacket having held his nerve in Sunday's final round in a start-to-finish victory . 1 Depending on which part of the internet you believe, the name Spieth comes from Middle High German and means either 'successful' and 'speedy' or 'late'. 2 Recently started the Jordan Spieth Charitable Trust, which focuses on special needs youth, military families and junior golf. It is inspired by his younger sister Ellie, who has autism. 3 Even world No 1 Rory McIlroy was impressed by the course-record 63 Spieth produced to win the Australian Open in December. 'You could give me another 100 rounds today at the Australian and I wouldn't sniff 63,' McIlroy wrote on Twitter. 4 Spieth is an occasional member of the 'money games' organised by Phil Mickelson in practice rounds before tournaments. 5 Won the John Deere Classic two weeks before his 20th birthday in 2013, thereby becoming the first teenage winner on the PGA Tour since 1931. 6 Is only the second player after Tiger Woods to have won the US junior amateur championship more than once. 7 Spieth rented two houses at the Masters, one to sleep in and the other to hang out with friends and family. 8 He won two and a half points from his four matches at the Ryder Cup in Gleneagles last year, losing to Graeme McDowell in the singles after being three up with nine holes to play. 9 One of his mentors is fellow Texan Ben Crenshaw, who played his final round after 44 consecutive Masters appearances on Friday after Spieth had set a new 36-hole scoring record at Augusta National. 10 As a four-year-old Texas Rangers fan, Spieth attempted to catch a stray ball at a game, lost it in the lights and had his two front teeth knocked out. 'I plan on not taking it off for a while,' Spieth said after being presented with the green jacket by 2014 winner Bubba Watson. 'I'll probably sleep in it for a few nights. 'It's the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in our sport. It's a dream come true for me. I did not break 70 last year even having a chance to win so to shoot some low scores and hear those roars is very special. 'To join the club that is the green jackets and to join Masters history and put my name on that trophy and to have this jacket forever, it's something that I can't fathom right now. 'I saw my friends and family behind the green and knew it was a done deal. It did not kick in there and it still has not kicked in. I am still in shock a little bit.

Rose got within three shots of Spieth three times on the front nine, but was left to rue mistakes on the eighth and ninth and a bogey on the 18th which cost him outright second. 'It was a great start for Jordan and myself with two birdies in the first three holes but the key moment for me was not getting up and down from right of the eighth and three-putting the ninth,' the former US Open champion said. Rose has led after the first round at Augusta three times and also finished fifth in 2007, and asked what he needed to do to win, added: 'Just shoot 14 under again. Normally that gets it done. Only thing I had not done was put four good rounds together and I did that so let's continue that trend.' Spieth had finished first, second and second in his previous three events and Rose added: 'Phenomenal, what a month of golf he's had.

"Felipe Massa believes he has finally silenced his critics following his storming start to the new Formula One season. Williams head of vehicle performance Rob Smedley claimed earlier this week he was seeing the best of the Brazilian in their nine years working together.

'It's fantastic because the driver cannot do anything alone. You need the whole group working for the best of the driver, and that's really counting a lot for me. 'Maybe also, when many of you wrote after my accident that it changed completely my driving, maybe that's not correct.' Suggested to Massa he had been too easily written off, he said: 'It's much easier to write than drive.'

"The podium girl is the centre of a 'sexism storm' after Lewis Hamilton sprayed champagne in her face said she wasn't offended by his stunt - and was just doing her job. The British Formula 1 racer drew criticism from around the world when he aimed the fizz directly as the face of 23-year-old grid girl Liu Siying, who was pictured looking less than impressed. But the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art graduate, who was a 'podium girl' at the Chinese Grand Prix, said she didn't think much about the incident and wasn't annoyed. Scroll down for video . Liu Siying was pictured grimacing as Lewis Hamilton sprayed champagne at her face after winning the race . Sexism campaigners called Hamilton's behaviour 'selfish' but Siying said she did not think too much about it . The hostess said: 'I was told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that's what I did' 'It lasted for only one or two seconds, and I did not think too much about it at all,' Miss Siying told the Shanghai Daily. 'I think some foreign media are more sensitive about the topic compared to local media. 'I was just told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that’s what I did.' Miss Siying had asked to work as a podium model on the stage of the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai because she was a fan of Finnish driver Kimi Raikkonen. After the incident on Sunday, Object, a campaign group against sexism, condemned the behaviour of the driver as 'selfish and inconsiderate' and called on Hamilton to apologise to the graduate. Others have called the driving ace an 'embarrassment to the UK', while another said his actions showed that he was an 'ignorant clown'. Scroll down for video . It's not the first time racing ace Lewis Hamilton has sprayed a grid girl with bubbly - he's also done it after winning the Spanish Grand Prix and even at the Austrian Grand Prix, where he lost out on the top spot . After seeing the pictures the chief executive of campaign group Object asked for Hamilton to apologise . Speaking on Monday, Roz Hardie, chief executive of Object said Miss Siying would have had ittle choice but to 'stand there and take it'. She said: 'The photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed, but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face, which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part. 'If this if the case we think Lewis Hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future. For most people, it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it. 'It is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it. That is something of which he should be aware. But instead, he appears to have abused her position. 'It's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour.' Ms Hardie added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world. Hamilton also sprayed a hostess at Montmelo after winning the Spanish Grand Prix at Circuit de Catalunya . She said: 'Motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves. We would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women. On Twitter, Hamilton was described as a 'bully' and 'disgusting'. Another user simply said: 'Man please stop spraying Champagne on the Podium Ladies. They don't like it', while one outraged user said he was a 'scumbag - an embarrassment to UK'. Another wrote: 'Have a bit more respect for the ladies please. Spraying Champagne in her face was out of order #child #idiot.' And one tweeted: 'Shame on you F1 and Lewis Hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration#sexism.' It is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move. He celebrated in a similar fashion after winning Spanish Grand Prix last year, which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and the one that finally put him on top of the World Championship table. And although he lost the Austrian Grand Prix to teammate Nico Rosberg, he didn't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess. The 30-year-old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on Graham Norton's talk show in 2013. But not everyone was offended by his behaviour. Many found his actions amusing, while another said: 'I can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @LewisHamilton.. Lighten up people!' Hamilton controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the Formula One world championship yesterday. But it wasn't all smiles at yesterday's race after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg, following a press conference. It wasn't all smiles after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg . The Mercedes driver poses with his trophy and champagne bottle on the podium after winning on Sunday . His Mercedes partner accused him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. With the top three drivers covered by only 3.5 seconds ahead of the final round of pit-stops, Rosberg reported on the radio that ‘Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up.’ Hamilton, seemingly protecting his tyres, was given the hurry-up by Mercedes and both he and Rosberg eventually emerged from their final pit-stop first and second with Vettel third. The world champion, sitting beside his teammate, told the press conference yesterday: 'I wasn't controlling his race, I was controlling my own race. 'My goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico throughout the whole race.' A visibly angry Rosberg replied: 'It's just now interesting to hear from you Lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race. Nico Rosberg (left) accused Hamilton of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under pressure . 'Driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant Sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then I had to cover him. 'It was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time because I had to cover him. Then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer, so I'm unhappy about that.' The spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre, and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded. It culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the Belgian Grand Prix, resulting in Rosberg being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team. This proved to be a turning point in the championship as Hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown.","Lewis Hamilton showered her with champagne after winning Grand Prix .

"AP McCoy has urged the nation to follow his Aintree dream as he chases the fairytale end to his extraordinary career. Retirement beckons for McCoy, champion jockey every year since he first won the title in 1997, and he will stop riding immediately if his mount Shutthefrontdoor wins the £1million Crabbie’s Grand National on Saturday. AP McCoy celebrates Grand National victory on Don’t Push It in 2010 . Shutthefrontdoor, trained by Jonjo O’Neill, will be the subject of an avalanche of emotional support and many once-a-year punters will pin their hopes on McCoy delivering a result like he did in 2010 when he won this famous race on Don’t Push It. In a perfect world, the National will finish with McCoy standing high in his irons celebrating but he, more than anyone, knows nothing is guaranteed in a sport as unpredictable as jump racing. It won’t, however, stop the 40-year-old hoping his script has a glorious finale. ‘I’m a dreamer,’ said McCoy, who announced his plans to retire in February. ‘I’m a believer – I always have been. McCoy seeks to end record-breaking career with victory on Shutthefrontdoor in the Grand National . 'If everyone has gone to bed thinking the dream will happen, I can promise you nobody has been dreaming more than me. In some ways, I regret making the announcement to retire when I did. I’ve thought to myself I should have just kept quiet. But in other ways I think it has been good. ‘If it’s created publicity for racing and helped get interest in the sport, so much the better. ‘Racing has been good to me and if this has been me giving something back, great. If people are putting money on Shutthefrontdoor in the hope I win for the fairytale, let me assure them nobody will be wanting me to win more than I do. People talk about me having ridden more winners than anyone else but I’ve also ridden more losers than anyone else. A thank you message board to retiring jockey McCoy on display at Aintree . ‘I’ve had 19 goes at this race and won once, so that gives you an idea of what it is going to be like.’ The last time a horse carried such goodwill was when Frankel, trained by the late Sir Henry Cecil, won the Champions Stakes at Ascot in October 2012. Mention of that brought a wry smile from McCoy. ‘I wish it was as straightforward as running around a couple of bends at Ascot!’ he said. ‘I’ve got 30 fences and 38 other horses in my way! But, listen, I’m a positive person and that is never going to change. Let’s hope the dream can happen.’ McCoy has vowed to end his career immediately should he land the £1million race for a second time .","AP McCoy will retire immediately if he wins the Grand National .

"Alex Hales claims he is still waiting for a 'proper crack' at one-day international cricket. The big-hitting top-order batsman has nine England caps to date, since his debut against India last August. But after opening alongside Alastair Cook four times in that series defeat, Hales has played in only five of England's subsequent 18 matches - including at the World Cup - and has batted instead at number three on three occasions. Alex Hales is hoping for a 'proper crack' at one-day international cricket with England . The 26-year-old is hoping for more continuity when England resume their ODI schedule this summer. Asked if he thinks he has had little of that so far, he told The Guardian: 'Honestly, yes I do. 'I don't feel like I've had a proper crack at it yet. 'I played the back-end of last summer against India, did okay without setting the world alight - and since then, it has been the odd game, coming in, dropping out again.' Hales was his own critic, after making an encouraging 40 on debut in Cardiff. Since the series against India last August, Hales has played in only five of England's subsequent 18 matches . He admitted back then, before his second innings, that India's seamers had limited his strokeplay, claiming: 'They were just very cunning. Once I got past 30, they were one step ahead of me. 'So it's up to me to put that right, and have that game smartness.' Nonetheless, he takes issue with the theory that he has been 'worked out' already at ODI level. He added: 'I read the press and saw the stuff about 'bringing the ball back in' and that I had been worked out - I got bowled once by Bhuvneshwar Kumar with an inswinger. 'That's not being worked out - that's a good delivery.' Nottinghamshire big-hitter Hales was run out last Sunday as his county battled to draw against Middlesex . Moeen Ali was preferred at the top of the order, alongside Cook in the series defeat in Sri Lanka and then with Ian Bell at the World Cup. 'Getting the news at the start of that Sri Lanka tour that I wasn't going to get first crack dented my confidence quite a bit,' said Hales. 'Maybe I let it affect me in a negative way. 'I am still learning my game, but I would definitely not say I have been ""worked out"".'","Alex Hales has nine England caps since his debut against India last August .

"Edinburgh’s European Challenge Cup hopes have been dealt a huge blow after Scotland international centre Matt Scott was ruled out until at least the end of the season. The 25-times-capped centre is now also a doubt for September’s World Cup after undergoing an operation on his left shoulder for the second time in a year. He had played a major role in Edinburgh’s run to the European Challenge Cup semi-final where they play Newport Gwent Dragons at BT Murrayfield on Friday. Scott hasn’t played since picking up his latest injury on Scotland duty against Ireland in the final game of the Six Nations last month. With Glasgow’s Alex Dunbar also a major fitness doubt for the World Cup, Scott’s injury could leave Scotland coach Vern Cotter with a big gap to fill at centre. Mark Bennett of Glasgow will be first choice for outside-centre but it could be a fight between Peter Horne of Warriors and Duncan Taylor of Saracens, who missed the Six Nations through injury, for the inside-centre jersey. Scotland player Matt Scott in action during the RBS Six Nations match between against Ireland at Murrayfield . The Edinburgh medical staff had hoped that Scott’s shoulder would heal naturally but have decided further surgery is required as there has been no improvement over the last three weeks. A club spokeswoman said: ‘It had been hoped that Matt would be able to manage his injury but, following consultation with specialists at Spire Murrayfield Hospital, the decision to perform an investigative arthroscopy was taken. ‘This resulted in him requiring a further surgical procedure to help deal with his shoulder complaints. ‘Matt will continue his rehabilitation programme with the Edinburgh Rugby medical team and won’t play again this season.’ Scott was putting a brave face on having his season cut short by this latest injury blow. In a tweet, the Scotland and Edinburgh centre said: ‘Gutted that my season is over already after getting surgery. ‘Brings an end to a frustrating year for me but positive about next few months.’ Edinburgh are short of cover in the centre positions and will now rely on New Zealander Phil Burleigh and South African Andries Strauss — who both started in the quarter-final away win over London Irish in the absence of Scott — from now until the end of the season. Scott went under the knife last week but he has now been told he will have to be operated on again . Kiwi Sam Beard is the only other experienced centre at the club. To add to their woes, Edinburgh also have a major doubt over David Denton, who was forced off with a head knock in the 34-3 Pro12 loss to Munster on Saturday. Denton is following return-to-play protocols and a late decision on the back-row forward’s fitness will be taken. Without Scott and possibly Denton, Edinburgh will be less confident of overcoming the Dragons on Friday and reaching the Challenge Cup Final, where they would play Gloucester or Exeter. Like Edinburgh, the Dragons may be in the lower half of the table, but they are in a rich vein of form and have won three matches in a row. Their latest and biggest scalp was taken last weekend when they overcame Leinster 25-22 in the Pro12. Hooker Ross Ford is desperate to defeat the Welsh and keep alive his dream of being part of the first Scottish professional club side to lift silverware. The Scotland international has managed just 14 games for club and country in the past year . Ford is one of seven survivors from the Edinburgh team that lost 22-19 in the Heineken Cup semi-final against Ulster three years ago. But the hooker insists reaching the European Challenge Cup Final at Twickenham Stoop on May 1 would overtake even that 2012 highlight. ‘I have been at Edinburgh through many ups and downs, so to win the Challenge Cup would be my biggest achievement,’ said 85-times-capped Ford. ‘It would also be a massive boost and something the club could take confidence from and build on in future seasons. It wouldn’t just be good for us, but also for Scottish rugby. ‘We didn’t have a good Six Nations in terms of results and it would be a great boost to the game in Scotland if we manage to get to the final and win it.’ Ford insists Edinburgh have already forgotten that embarrassing home defeat to Munster and believes confidence remains high ahead of Friday’s match. ‘This is a European Challenge Cup semi-final and we will all be up for it,’ said the 30-year-old former Scotland captain. ‘We weren’t at our best against Munster but we will be fixing what went wrong in training this week. ‘What we have in our favour is home advantage and we can expect a big crowd who will give is us a lot of backing. ‘I have detected an excitement among our fans about the European game and our whole Challenge Cup campaign.’","Centre Matt Scott will miss the rest of the season because of injury .

"Renault managing director Cyril Abiteboul has boldly declared to Red Bull team principal Christian Horner his aim that come late May there will be no further power-unit issues. Last week Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz warned Renault to solve their problems otherwise he would consider pulling his teams out of Formula One. A few days later Renault endured a Chinese Grand Prix to forget as Daniil Kvyat's Red Bull and the Toro Rosso of Max Verstappen both suffered a power-unit failure. Remarkably, Abiteboul has now confirmed of being aware of the fact the system had a fault, one he is confident will be fixed come the Monaco Grand Prix next month. Renault's Cyril Abiteboul (left) has promised Red Bull that the engine problems will be resolved . 'We knew there was a weakness, so there was a plan in place,' said Abiteboul. 'We need to make sure the plan is good enough for the size of the issues we have had, and whether it can be addressed fairly quickly. 'I'm not quite sure, from a logistical perspective, it could be addressed for this weekend's race in Bahrain. 'But certainly our aim has been to have absolutely no reliability issues by Monaco. 'We knew the first engine we built had some reliability weaknesses, and unfortunately we saw that in China. Unhappy Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz threatened to pull out of Formula One . 'The plan is to make sure the future engine we will be building has absolutely no reliability issues.' That is of little comfort to Horner who goes into the fourth race of the season with one of his drivers having used two engines when only four are allowed per season otherwise penalties start to be applied. 'I don't think anybody expected us to be on engine three after race three in any of our scenarios,' said an unhappy Horner. 'We accept sometimes to find performance you've got to take some risks. Calculated risks are what Red Bull has always bought into. Daniil Kvyat's Red Bull and the Toro Rosso of Max Verstappen both suffered a power-unit failure in China . 'But the frustrating thing for both parties is we're in this situation with three of our allotted four engines in use going into race four. 'It isn't where we wanted to be, but we've got to work our way out of it.' Asked as to how he would manage this weekend given the fear of yet another engine failure, Horner replied: 'You've just got to go for it and hope for the best.'","Renault have promised Red Bull that they will resolve power-unit problems .

"Gary Ballance hit a chanceless hundred for England on Thursday - his fourth century in nine Tests - that further closes the door on the banished Kevin Pietersen returning to the side whatever the ballyhoo. Ballance's 122 was the mainstay of England's 333 for seven declared leaving West Indies needing an unlikely 438 to win the first Test. They finished the fourth day on 98 for two after another superb Chris Jordan slip catch made the breakthrough. Gary Ballance scored 122 as England took firm control of the first Test against the West Indies in Antigua . Ballance plays a sweep shot during his impressive innings at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium . Ballance celebrates bringing up his century following his superb batting display in Antigua . Ballance, who had a poor World Cup , said: 'It's been a tough winter but four bad innings don't make you a bad cricketer. I would like to think I was settled at number three after last summer. Scoring a hundred in a Test match is a great feeling. You have to enjoy doing well,' as his joyous century celebration indicated. Even with the ever-present Pietersen factor Ballance added: 'That's international sport, I haven't doubted my place. I knew I had done well before. I didn't come here thinking that I was going to get dropped. I was focused on scoring runs and to get a hundred is huge.' There needs to be an opening for KP to make a sensational England comeback. But there looks to be no room in the line-up for Pietersen. Ballance at number three followed by Ian Bell and Joe Root seems a rock solid middle order for the Ashes this summer, by when KP will be 35. Joe Root formed a solid partnership with Ballance and made big inroads against the home side . Root salutes the stands after he brought up his half century earlier in the day . Jordan's stunning one-handed catch off part-time bowler Joe Root to dismiss Darren Bravo was a critical moment . Ballance said: 'It was brilliant by CJ but he does it all the time. He's got unbelievable hands.' Ballance summed it up as a 'very good day, pretty much perfect' adding: 'It would have been nice to get one or two more wickets but we're happy with that, to get two this evening puts a lot of pressure on them.' West Indies coach Phil Simmons said: 'We're still looking to win the game. The first hour is vital for both sides. We wanted to be around 100 for one at the close.","Gary Ballance hit 122 on day four of the first Test in Antigua on Thursday .

"HISTORY'S WARNING . England ended the day in a strong position, but it’s worth bearing in mind what happened in Antigua in 2009. Like Thursday, England declared just before tea, leaving West Indies a hefty target (503). But the home side’s lower order hung on — with Sulieman Benn batting as high as nine — and forced an unlikely draw. Stuart Broad celebrates with his England team-mates after taking the wicket of Kraigg Brathwaite . BRUISER BUTTLER . With Gary Ballance knocking the ball around the park, his partner Jos Buttler thought he’d get in on the act — but instead smashed a loopy ball from Marlon Samuels straight into his team-mate’s arm. The Yorkshire batsman was left with a nasty bruise but was fine to carry on. England's Gary Ballance receives treatment on the field after he was struck by a shot from Jos Buttler . ROOT IS SECURE . After Ballance and Ian Bell made centuries in the first Test, Joe Root’s 142-run contribution has been largely overlooked. The Yorkshireman has emerged as a consistent performer for England, passing 50 runs seven times in his last six Tests. Joe Root plays a shot during his 142-run total on day four at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium . UMPIRE DAVIS STUMPED . Umpire Steve Davis dropped a bit of a clanger in the afternoon. Jason Holder bowled at Buttler’s leg stump and hit the batsman on the bottom of his left pad, earning an lbw call from Davis. Buttler reviewed the decision and to no-one’s surprise, DRS showed the ball was missing leg stump by so much it didn’t even pitch in line. Umpire Steve Davis dropped a bit of a clanger in the afternoon with his lbw call on Buttler . A BISHOO BLUNDER? Thursday's free-scoring was assisted greatly by a toiling West Indies spin attack, prompting many — including Sir Viv Richards — to question the absence of leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo, who ran out Bell as a sub fielder on Wednesday. England fans may remember his excellent three-wicket haul against Bell and Co at the 2011 World Cup. Leg spinner Devendra Bishoo was conspicuous in his absence for West Indies against England . MORGAN'S RUM DO . Elsewhere, Eoin Morgan and Ravi Bopara — both overlooked for this Test — were in action for Sunrisers Hyderabad as they lost to Rajasthan Royals. Morgan laboured to 27 from 30 balls, but Bopara helped himself to 23 off 19 and two wickets.

"Ryan Bertrand believes he deserves to be higher up the England pecking order and has pledged to prove his worth to manager Roy Hodgson. The 25-year-old has been one of the standout performers for Southampton, where the left-back moved permanently earlier in the year having impressed on loan from Chelsea. Bertrand has attracted plenty of plaudits for his displays at St Mary's, yet struggled to gain the international recognition many of his colleagues have received. Ryan Bertrand was the fifth left back to be called in to Roy Hodgson's England squad last month . A call-up had been predicted for England's internationals against Lithuania and Italy last month, yet Hodgson plumped for Leighton Baines, Kieran Gibbs and Luke Shaw. Danny Rose was then preferred when Shaw pulled out, only for Bertrand to get the nod once the Tottenham full-back and then Baines dropped out. It meant the Saints left-back travelled to Italy and eventually played the final few minutes of the 1-1 draw in Turin, with his third England cap a peculiar end to the international break. 'It was different,' he said, smiling. 'The international break changed from one extreme to the next, but it was good to get back in the frame and get back in the door. 'It was good to get on the pitch, even though it was very brief. 'When you actually sit there, it hits you that all them years you spent as a kid watching football games, the England games were always the biggest. Bertrand slides in to challenge Everton midfielder James McCarthy earlier this month . 'To finally sit there and be part of it and wear the actual kit and everything, knowing the whole country is cheering you on is fantastic.' England are, in fairness, blessed with strength impressive depth at left-back, with West Ham's Aaron Cresswell another arguably worthy of a call-up. Bertrand appreciates that breadth of options, but hopes to prove to Hodgson that he deserves to be further up the pecking order. 'You know, it's down to (the manager),' he said. 'Whoever he wants to pick, it is his decision. 'I'll just concentrate on my game. I'm confident enough to know that I should be in there, but I don't pick the team so I'll just keep playing.' Bertrand was one of three Southampton players in action that night in Turin, with Nathaniel Clyne starting at right-back for England and Graziano Pelle leading the line for Italy. Bertrand made his move to Southampton from Chelsea permanent in January after impressing on loan . The 29-year-old striker showed no ill-effects of the scoring drought at club level, glancing the Azzurri ahead at the Juventus Stadium - a goal the striker followed up with a first Premier League strike since December 20 in Saturday's 2-0 defeat of Hull. 'I was just thinking it is typical - anyone, anyone but him,' Bertrand said, laughing. 'It was good for him to get a goal. 'The fans have been very supportive, I think. Every week, even when we're warming up, you can hear them cheering him on. 'There's never been any criticism and he has finally broke his duck and got his goal, so hopefully that just continues now.'","Ryan Bertrand was fifth left back to be called up by England last month .

"Ronald Koeman believes Southampton will have to win their six remaining games to stand any chance of reaching the Champions League. This has been a remarkable season at St Mary's, with the club already having levelled the record Premier League points tally of 56 set last year. That record will no doubt be broken in the coming weeks and things could get better still, with Manchester City's sudden drop-off opening up the potential for a top-four finish. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman believes his side must win their last six games to finish inside top four . Saints remained in the hunt for a place in next season's Champions League by beating Hull at St Mary's . Southampton are five points behind Man City . Saints have five points to claw back on the reigning champions but Koeman believes it is possible if they win all their remaining games. 'Normally yes,' the Dutchman said. 'The distance is five points. We need to win I think all. 'They (City) don't lose three games, no. They have the next two at home. Normally, with the players that they have, the qualities. 'You never know, but it's all about to win the last six to have really a good chance to be one of the top four teams.' Saints travel to the Etihad Stadium on the final day of the season and, by contrast to the other sides chasing a top-four berth, have a kind set of fixtures before that. Tottenham and Aston Villa come to St Mary's, while trips to Sunderland, Leicester and City follow Saturday's match at Stoke. Southampton striker Graziano Pelle scored in his side's 2-0 Premier League win over Hull . Stoke vs Southampton - April 18 . Southampton vs Tottenham - April 25 . Sunderland vs Southampton - May 2 . Leicester vs Southampton - May 9 . Southampton vs Aston Villa - May 16 . Manchester City vs Southampton - May 24 . 'Yeah, but in the last part of the season, OK, what's the best to play against?' Koeman asked. 'A team who's fighting for no relegation or two teams who are fighting for the title? I don't know. 'Every game is difficult. You have to be on your level to win a game. All are difficult. 'We play Sunderland away, we play Leicester away and they're fighting for not going down and that's even difficult.' Koeman is certainly not taking the run-in lightly and the trip to the Britannia Stadium will be an interesting test for Southampton's players at this stage. 'It is a difficult one,' the Dutchman said. 'We have that experience this season two times we play Stoke, one time at home and one time away for the League Cup. 'Both games we won but in both it was difficult because we know the qualities of them. 'We know the manager was always with the high spirit, the high intention in the game, physical players, direct game. 'Maybe we are lucky to play this weekend there, with the temperature and weather but I know it's always windy and that makes it still more difficult. 'The weather will be good this weekend and circumstances good for the weekend.'","Southampton are currently five points behind fourth-placed Man City .

"Stoke are set to complete their third signing from Barcelona in less than two years, according to the agent of Moroccan winger Moha El Ouriachi. Potters manager Mark Hughes, the former Barcelona striker, has already snapped up Bojan Krkic and Marc Muniesa from the Nou Camp and teenager El Ouriachi now looks to be on his way to the Britannia Stadium this summer. The 19-year-old Barcelona B player is apparently keen to seek first-team action rather than extend his contract with the Spanish giants. Barcelona B winger Moha El Ouriachi is set to sign for Stoke City, according to the player's agent . El Ouriachi is turning down a new deal with the Catalans to take up an irresistible offer by Stoke . 'We thank Barca for the deal they offered the player and the efforts they have gone to try to renew his contract,' El Ouriachi's agent, Raul Verdu, told Catalan newspaper Sport. 'But another proposal was really interesting on both a professional and economic level. 'Moha has the option of joining the first team squad at Stoke and that was irresistible.' Stoke have already signed Bojan Krkic and Marc Muniesa from Barcelona in the last two years . El Ouriachi has represented Spain at youth level and Sport reported that Stoke have agreed to pay the necessary training compensation to bring the pacey left winger to the Barclays Premier League. Both Bojan and Muniesa have settled well at Stoke, although the former - who had scored five goals in 18 appearances following his shock move last summer - was ruled out for the rest of the season after damaging cruciate knee ligaments in an FA Cup tie at Rochdale in January. Defender Muniesa has made nearly 40 appearances since joining from Barcelona in the summer of 2013 but has not featured since tearing a hamstring in the FA Cup defeat at Blackburn in February.","Barcelona B winger Moha El Ouriachi set to reject a new deal at club .

"Alan Pardew has warned Crystal Palace's Barclays Premier League admirers that if they want to sign Yannick Bolasie this summer then the bidding will have to start at £20million. It has been suggested that a £10m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week. Yannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Alan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at £20m for his star to leave Selhurst Park . Responding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away. 'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) £10m price on Bolasie. Blimey. 'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.' That form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started. Bolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home . Pardew is demanding more than £20m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer . But Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.' Pardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.'

"Mauricio Pochettino believes Harry Kane deserves to pip Eden Hazard to the player of the year award. That two forwards are the leading contenders to scoop the PFA accolade after their nominations this week. Hazard is the red hot favourite to land the prize after his excellent season with Chelsea. Harry Kane has been nominated for PFA Player of the Year after a standout season for Tottneham . Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino says Kane deserves to win the award for his impact on English football . But Pochettino says Kane, who could become the first Spurs player to score 30 goals in a season since Gary Lineker achieved the feat 27 years ago, should take the award. 'I think that Hazard is a very good player, he's fantastic, a great player. But the impact that Harry has had on English football is massive. 'Maybe the impact is bigger than Hazard and his performances. 'Everyone knew that Hazard is a brilliant player. 'But I think not too many people expected that Harry Kane would show the performances that he has this season. Kane will have to beat off competition from Eden Hazard if he is to claim individual gong . Kane's scintillating form in front of goal this season has earned him international recognition . Eden Hazard - Chelsea . Diego Costa - Chelsea . Harry Kane - Tottenham Hotspur . Alexis Sanchez - Arsenal . David de Gea - Manchester United . Philippe Coutinho - Liverpool . This is the difference I believe.' Meanwhile, Pochettino has defended the club's decision to play a one off pre-season game against the MLS All Stars in Colorado on July 29. In the past, the Argentine has spoken out against the idea of summer tours in long haul destinations. But Pochettino, who are also travelling to Malaysia and Australia for a post-season tour, said: 'It's only one game. We go there and back. 'It's nine hours. It's very important for us because it's a very important game because it's against the All-Star with the biggest stars, it's only one game, it's after three weeks training here. Kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions for Tottenham this season . 'I think it's a good possibility to go on Monday and come back after the game on Wednesday. 'We only spend three days. It's not a pre-season tour where you spend maybe 14-15 days away. 'On a pre-season, you need good pitches for training. You have a problem with traffic like happened on the last pre-season tour. It's not proper to prepare. 'It's a good possibility because it's a prestigious match.

"To hear Leigh Griffiths tell it, the intervention staged by Celtic boss Ronny Deila and assistant John Collins was definitely closer to a kick in the what-nots than it was a pat on the back. Whatever the detail of the conversation, and however lasting the effects may be, the short-term impact on the 24-year-old force of nature — often as unruly and unpredictable as a whirlwind — has been nothing short of remarkable. As the kid himself puts it: ‘Being top scorer now means that, since I have had a talk with the manager, I have knuckled down and proved him wrong, proved JC wrong and shown that I deserve to be here.’ Hat-trick hero Leigh Griffiths with signed match ball and man of the match award . Rather revealing, isn’t it? Clearly demanding Deila and original gym rat Collins did not hold back in dealing with the gifted but wild natural talent, wielding a big stick in a bid to persuade Griffiths that the carrot wasn’t such a bad alternative to chips and tea cakes. ‘I had to improve,’ admits the former Hibs star. ‘I wasn’t playing at the start of the season. I had a talk with the manager and John Collins about everything and about what they wanted me to do. ‘Thankfully, in the two months since the turn of the year, I have knuckled down and they are seeing the rewards now. ‘What did they say to me? I had to be working hard in the gym and working hard to get my fitness levels up. I did that and I have been bang on form since the turn of the year. ‘When I was at Hibs, I would have been the first name on the team sheet given the goals I scored. ‘But coming here, it’s a massive club and, with the new manager coming into the club, he wanted to impose his own philosophy. ‘Playing one up front, you have to work hard and my fitness levels were not up to his standards. Since January, though, my fitness levels have been good and I have been scoring goals. ‘I was brought to Celtic to score goals and I’ve started to do that since the turn of the year. I haven’t set any new targets — but I do want a good run of games. ‘I want to be starting every game from now until the end of the season and score as many goals as I possibly can. Celtic's Leigh Griffiths (right) completes his hat-trick against Kilmarnock . ‘The manager selects the team he thinks is best to win the game and we have boys in the squad and coming on from the bench. ‘Myself, Anthony Stokes, Stuart Armstrong, Gary Mackay-Steven were all on the bench against Kilmarnock.’ Griffiths is making a stronger case than most by banging in the goals, his hat-trick in Wednesday night’s 4-1 home win over Kilmarnock definitely ranking among the better substitute performances the Scottish game has seen this season. His second treble haul in Celtic colours took his total for the season to 15 goals, the majority of those coming in 2015, as he has contended more frequently with John Guidetti, Stefan Scepovic and Anthony Stokes for the lone striker’s role favoured — for now, at least — by Deila. Watching Guidetti amble around aimlessly until Griffiths arrived to partner the big Swede on Wednesday night, it definitely seems as though Deila has only two options for Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness. Either he plays both in a traditional front-pairing. Or he lets Griffiths, scorer of an early opener against Caley Thistle in the Highlands last weekend, loose on his own at Hampden. If his midweek goals explosion makes it impossible to omit the former Livingston, Dundee and Wolves striker from the starting XI, his record in major semi-finals at the national stadium also counts in his favour. Substitute Griffiths came off the bench to spark Celtic into life after lacklustre first-half . The extra-time hero as he scored his second of the game to ease Hibs past Falkirk 4-3 at this stage of the Scottish Cup two years ago, Griffiths also opened the scoring for Celtic against Rangers in the League Cup semi earlier this season. ‘I’ve played in two semi-finals at Hampden and I have won two,’ he points out. ‘Hopefully, I can continue that. ‘I’ll be looking to score again. But the most important thing is for the team to win the game and reach the Scottish Cup Final. ‘Inverness will come down and make it difficult for us. They proved last weekend they are a hard team to beat. ‘Every game against them this season has been tight and I expect the same again on Sunday.’ If Griffiths starts and plays as he did against Killie, even Caley Thistle at their most obdurate will struggle to cope. His hat-trick — one perfectly placed header, one absolute screamer from distance and a driven low finish — was a timely reminder of what he can do, when the mood is upon him. Celtic manager Ronny Deila (left) congratulates Griffiths after the final whistle . ‘It wasn’t a bad night’s work,’ he says with a smile. ‘It was just good to get the win because we were disappointed not to win at Inverness last weekend. And we had suffered a setback, going 1-0 down to Kilmarnock, although the boys fought back in the right way. ‘All of the goals were my favourites. The first one was a great ball into the box by Kris Commons and I managed to head it down into the net. ‘The second one went in off the post and I was just waiting for the whistle to go for being offside for the third. Thankfully, it didn’t come and I fired it back across the goalkeeper. ‘It’s only my third hat-trick in senior football, so it’s decent. My second one came for Celtic against Inverness last year.’ Cute move, dropping that into conversation. Take note, gaffer? Not only am I bang in form, not only do I have a great record at Hampden, but I’ve shown I can do the business against Inverness. Celtic start as favourites on Sunday and, with Hibs also edging the odds in their semi against Falkirk, Griffiths could spend May 30 torn between professional pride and genuine love for his hometown team. Asked outright if he would like to face Hibernian, balancing up the desire to become a Treble winner against the need to condemn his boyhood heroes to at least one more year of Scottish Cup taunts, Griffiths admitted: ‘Honest answer, no! ‘If they get there, it will be great for the club, but I’m just concentrating on doing my job for Celtic. We are eight points clear in the league and in a good position and, obviously, we want to go for the Treble. ‘There is still a long way to go and we have difficult games coming up. At the moment, Inverness are standing in our way of having a potentially great season.’","Leigh Griffiths revealed that Ronny Deila and John Collins warned him .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is not bothered by how Manchester City will react to their slump, only that his own players produce the goods at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. A terrible run of form has seen City slip down into fourth place, their 4-2 loss to rivals Manchester United leaving Manuel Pellegrini's side well adrift of leaders Chelsea and now in a battle to stay ahead of Liverpool in the race for Champions League qualification. However, West Ham are also in need of some consistency, with a stoppage-time goal conceded at home to Stoke denying them what would have been only a third league win of 2015. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce will hope for a strong end to the season, but it has threatened to tail off . Allardyce  reacts on the touchline during the Hammers' match with Stoke City at Upton Park last weekend . 'I am more concerned about getting the best out of my team,' said Allardyce, whose side are now in 10th place, having once looked set for a European qualification challenge themselves. 'Maybe City are a wounded animal and they might come out all guns blazing or they might be tentative. We won't know until the match starts. 'We are expecting them to put in a determined performance in front of their own fans.' Allardyce added: 'The motivation for our players should be that they have let themselves down by not achieving the results that they should have done from the positions we have been in. 'We want to get the feel-good factor back by winning a few games and getting the confidence back up.' Allardyce believes the Irons can yet go on to secure their best finish since winning promotion back to the top flight.

Whether that gets us the result or not we will have to wait and see based on the quality of the opposition we are against, because when you play Manchester City all of your players have to be on top form in all areas.

"Stuart McCall admits he will become a Livingston fan for the day on Wednesday as he prays the Scottish Championship strugglers can do his side's play-off bid a favour. Livingston gave Rangers a headache last week when they held them to a 1-1 draw at the Energy Assets Arena and they now take on Hibernian in midweek. The Easter Road outfit slipped four points behind McCall's side on Saturday while they were busy getting knocked out of the William Hill Scottish Cup by Falkirk as Rangers were winning 3-1 at Dumbarton in league action. Stuart McCall has revealed he will be cheering on Livingston during their match against Hibernian . McCall believes his side's main promotion rivals could drop points against Livingston on Wednesday . Rangers dropped points against Livingston by drawing 1-1 with the Scottish Championship strugglers . Rangers are four points ahead of Hibernian . However, Hibs can close back to within a point of second place if they win their game in hand with Mark Burchill's Livingston. With both teams desperate to finish as runners-up to new champions Hearts and spare themselves two extra hazardous games in the play-offs, McCall is now praying Livi give Hibs as hard a time as they did his side. He said: 'I'll be there on Wednesday with my Livingston scarf on. We played them and know what a tough game it will be. Hibs will be disappointed with what happened at Hampden but they'll now focus on promotion and we've got to focus on ourselves - we've got two big games left and want to win both.' Rangers clinched the points at the weekend after 18-year-old striker Ryan Hardie claimed a dream double on his full debut. Former Celtic striker Mark Wilson put the Sons ahead after just two minutes with his first goal since netting an Old Firm winner against Gers back in March 2011, but Hardie saved the day with his brace before Haris Vuckic swept home a 25-yeard beauty to put the seal on the Glasgow side's victory. McCall was delighted for his young frontman Hardie - but was cautious when asked if the teenager could be the man to fire Rangers back to the Premiership. 'We only told Ryan at lunchtime that he was playing, we showed him the areas of the park we wanted him to get into and that's where his first goal came from,' said the Gers boss. 'The kid is a goalscorer and he's got great energy and good pace. He's very raw naturally because he's only young but you can't do much more than score two on your debut. 'I'm delighted for the kid and hopefully that's him on his way to a lot of goals for Rangers. I'm a horses for courses manager and we'll change things but Ryan did what we hoped he would do and his confidence is high so it's a nice problem for next week.' On-loan Newcastle playmaker Vuckic's goal was a sublime strike but McCall admits he had to give the Slovenian a half-time talking to after he went missing for Wilson's opener.

"Lucas Leiva would like to remind people it is not just Steven Gerrard playing out his own emotional journey in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley. The Brazilian has been at Anfield for eight years and holds the unwanted record of playing more games for Liverpool without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years. He missed the 2012 League Cup final and two other Wembley appearances that year with a serious knee injury sustained against Chelsea the previous November. His story might not have the celebrity appeal of Gerrard saying goodbye in an FA Cup final on his 35th birthday, but the desire to win the Cup is just as strong.

He has won many trophies here but a lot of people here have been working for many years and not won as much as him. We want to win like him.’ When Lucas was signed by Rafa Benitez in 2007, Liverpool had just been in their second Champions League final in three seasons. But he has had to endure turbulent times since then; four managers and a change of ownership that dragged Liverpool into virtual civil war. Not surprisingly, the cup finals and trophies dried up. ‘I didn’t think I was going to stay this long. I felt after the first season I was gone,’ said Lucas with a laugh, having been pilloried by the Kop during his early days. ‘There have been big changes in the club during my time here and at some point you pay a price for that. Sunday will mark Steven Gerrard’s 36th, and possibly last, appearance at Wembley. Thirty-two of his games have been there for England (including one at the old Wembley) and three for Liverpool.

Having lifted the League Cup earlier in the season, Gerrard returned to Wembley for a sweet FA Cup semi-final victory against their Merseyside rivals, with Andy Carroll heading a late winner. ‘There was discussion about ownership, the court and all that. It didn’t help. We saw a lot of senior players leaving. This is a chance for our new team to win their first trophy.’ Lucas has gone from an impressionable youngster learning from Gerrard, Pepe Reina and Xabi Alonso to one of the senior voices in the dressing room. He has seen youngsters Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe criticised for being photographed with a shisha pipe and said: ‘It is hard to give advice because there are so many people always around players. I just think young players shouldn’t get carried away. I had real role models in the dressing room like Pepe and Stevie. You saw they had success because of the way they do things, not just their talent. ‘Ten years ago, players would have more space. Today we go to a restaurant and everyone is filming, recording or taking pictures. You need to have extra care. If you are having a glass of wine, then people say you are drunk.’ Lucas tries to win a tackle during Liverpool's 2-0 victory at home to Newcastle on Monday night . Lucas celebrates Joe Allen's (right) second goal for Liverpool against Newcastle . Lucas is desperate to win the FA Cup and end his 270-game barren spell at Anfield. The last player to have played more times for Liverpool without winning a major trophy was Alan O’Court who played for the club 345 times between 1952 and 1964, collecting just a Second Division championship medal. Liverpool felt so sorry for Lucas, who was injured for the 2012 League Cup final win, they asked the Football League to send him a medal in the post. Liverpool’s improvements under Rodgers have not so far translated into silverware. They finished second to Manchester City in a thrilling Premier League title race last season and were beaten by eventual winners Chelsea in this year’s Capital One Cup semi-finals. Brendan Rodgers knows, with a far stronger squad than he inherited in 2012, they now have to take the cup competitions seriously. ‘For me, the objective in the first couple of years was getting into the Champions League,’ he said. ‘If you look at how we did in the cups we weren’t so good. I felt we didn’t have the squad to challenge. This year we’d arrived into the Champions League and could focus on winning a trophy. We have got to one semi-final already in the Capital One Cup and now we’ve got another chance. Our vision is to win trophies.’ Gerrard has returned to the squad after a three-match ban from being sent off against Manchester United . Gerrard (right) made his Wembley debut for England in 2000 in a friendly against Ukraine . The return of Gerrard into the squad after a three-match ban for stamping on Manchester United’s Ander Herrera is vital to calm any nerves. In contrast to Lucas and others in the Liverpool team, he has played at Wembley 35 times in his career — and been on the winning side in 25 of them. Rodgers smiles that he will be ‘heartless’ in deciding whether to name his captain in the starting XI but is adamant Gerrard will make a big contribution. ‘I’ve had a meal with him, talking over things,’ said the manager. ‘I am disappointed I didn’t have the chance to work with him for longer. At 24, I would have built a team around him like I did with Luis Suarez. ‘Wembley is like his second home. He knows what it takes to win there. He’s calm anyway before the games and that is important for us as a team. Everyone respects that I want to do what is best for the team. Status and star quality have never bothered me, really.’","Lucas holds record of playing more Liverpool games without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years .

"A Labour government would take action to enforce a Premier League commitment to invest five per cent of the proceeds from lucrative TV rights deals in grassroots sport, the party has said. Shadow health secretary and keen football fan Andy Burnham said the move could unlock £400 million to nurture the talents of the next generation of stars over the course of the next parliament. And he said Labour was ready to legislate if necessary to ensure elite clubs lived up to their 1999 promise to support struggling community facilities and projects. Andy Burnham (left) and Ed Miliband promise that Labour will make the Premier League invest in grassroots . Mr Burnham accused Prime Minister David Cameron of failing to get tough on the Premier League despite a massive increase in its TV revenues during his time in power. Although the league puts £168million into grassroots sport, this represents only a fraction of the £5billion it has taken in from TV deals between 2013 and 2016, said Labour. Mr Burnham said: 'The last Labour government secured a commitment from the Premier League that five per cent of all TV income should be invested in the grassroots. 'Since then, TV rights have soared by over 160 per cent, but David Cameron has failed to make sure that the game's elite honours its obligations to the next generation coming through. David Cameron is accused of not keeping his promises and getting tough on the Premier League . 'Football at grassroots is struggling and, in many cities, Premier League stadia loom over run-down changing rooms and overgrown pitches. The gap between top and bottom in our national sport has never been wider. 'Premier League clubs only have permission to sell their rights collectively if they can demonstrate that it is in the wider public interest. That is why a Labour government will take action to ensure that every penny the Premier League owes is paid in full, unlocking an estimated £400 million for the grassroots in the next parliament.' Labour sports spokesman Clive Efford added: 'We will get tough and under Labour's better plan we will make sure the Premier League lives up to its commitment to invest in the grassroots. This will have a profoundly positive impact on football and many other sports.' BT Sport and Sky Sports were part of the lucrative TV deal estimated around £5billion starting in 2016 . A Premier League spokesman said: 'The success of the Premier League benefits the development of the English game outside of the top flight. Significant investment has flowed through all levels of the game from the grassroots upwards, and well in excess of the five per cent of domestic live broadcast revenues agreed in 2005. 'Only last month Premier League clubs committed to investing at least £1bn outside of the league from 2016-2019. That will mean even more investment in grass-roots football. 'Currently we invest £56m per season in this important work and Premier League football will generate over £1.2bn in tax revenue for the Treasury this year alone. 'This investment has seen over 50 new artificial pitches built in local communities and our club's coaches delivering thousands of PE lessons in primary schools across the country during the 2014/15 season.' Grassroot football is crucial to the development of young players and good facilities like this are needed .","Andy Burnham says Labour would enforce the Premier League to invest an estimtated £400million into grassroots football with the new TV deal .

"Jonny Howson made a triumphant return to Elland Road to nudge Norwich one step closer to the Premier League. An academy product and Leeds’ youngest captain since Billy Bremner before moving to Carrow Road for £2million in January 2012, Howson marked his first game back at his old club by making the breakthrough in the 57th minute to keep Alex Neil’s side in the automatic promotion places. The 26-year-old had already endured taunts of ‘cheat’ from the home fans after winning a first-half penalty when he was bundled over by current Leeds skipper Liam Cooper. Jonny Howson (8) refuses to celebrate after putting Norwich ahead early in the second half . The midfielder smashed home to put his side in control and continue their automatic promotion charge . Graham Dorrans hammered his spot-kick against the underside of the ball and then wasted another opportunity moments later, although he made amends with Norwich’s second goal in injury-time. Howson struck when Nathan Redmond poked the ball across to him just inside the box, guiding it with the outside of his right foot beyond a despairing Marco Silvestri and inside the far post. If his celebration was a little muted, the same could not be said for Neil and his staff on the touchline as they sensed a fifth straight win. Graham Dorrans (right) sealed the tie with a late goal and made up for his late penalty miss . Leeds XI: Silvestri 6; Wootton 6, Bamba 6.5, Cooper 5.5, Byram 6 (Montenegro 85); Ngoyi 6; Taylor 5 (Antenucci 71, 6), Murphy 6, Mowatt 7, Berardi 6; Sharp 7. Subs: Taylor, Bellusci, Morison, Sloth, Phillips. Norwich XI: Ruddy 7; Olsson 6.5, Bassong 6.5, Martin 6, Whittaker 6; Tettey 6; Redmond 7 (Hooper 86), Howson 8, Dorrans 6, Hoolahan 6 (E Bennett 80); Jerome 6.5. Subs: Rudd, Grabban, R Bennett, O’Neil, Odjidja-Ofoe. Scorers: Howson 57, Dorrans 90+1 . Booked: Olsson, Tettey, Whittaker, Dorrans . Referee: Michael Jones 6 . Star man: Jonny Howson . ‘I think every passing game now is a massive moment,’ said the Norwich boss. ‘I told the players at half-time that we had three-and-a-half games left. The next 45 minutes could be the turning point of the season to get us over the line or it could cost us. ‘Jonny is a model professional. I know Leeds mean a lot to him but ultimately he’s done his job tonight (Tuesday).’ It still needed a magnificent block by Russell Martin to deny Scott Wootton and John Ruddy’s flying save from Alex Mowatt to preserve Norwich’s lead before Dorrans made sure of victory, burying his shot from 15 yards after a fine run and cutback from Cameron Jerome. Leeds head coach Neil Redfearn said: ‘The ball was a yard out of play so it’s a bit harsh on us.’ With Norwich, Bournemouth and Middlesbrough all winning, the pressure is now on Watford to do the same when they visit Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night. It also raises the stakes even higher when Norwich entertain Middlesbrough at Carrow Road on Friday battling for a £120m ticket to the top-flight. Dorrans (centre) smashed a first half penalty against the crossbar but later spared his blushes . Luke Murphy (left) attempts to tackle Nathan Redmond during the first half in the Championship clash . ‘Each game gets bigger and bigger, and for us and Middlesbrough, it won’t get much bigger than this game on Friday night,’ said Neil, who kept his players in the north to prepare for this game after they snatched an injury-time winner at Bolton on Saturday. ‘My mindset before the game is that we do our job, we don’t pay attention to others. With all three of us winning tonight, Watford have got a job to do tomorrow but that’s for them to worry about. ‘We’ve worked so hard to get here. It’s not easy. The games are coming thick and fast, and mentally it’s tough. But we’re well up for the challenge, this is what you’re in football for. ‘Looking at Bolton and Leeds, on paper, they were two extremely difficult games and the fact we’ve managed to pick up six points says a huge amount about the character in the squad.’ Murphy fires a free-kick into the Norwich wall as Leeds lost their fourth game in five in the Championship .","Jonny Howson scored against his old club but refused to celebrate .

"Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet insists choosing between an FA Cup victory and finishing in the top four would be like preferring one of his parents over the other. With the Reds in semi-final action against Aston Villa on Sunday Brendan Rodgers' side could see the gap between themselves and fourth place - currently occupied by Manchester City - grow. It has been suggested the cup competition can save their season, in-form playmaker Philippe Coutinho even suggested as much ahead of their quarter-final replay at Blackburn last week, but Mignolet does not see any reason why they should prioritise one over the other at the moment.

'The next game is the FA Cup semi-final so the focus is on that but you don't really choose between your mum and dad so we still have two things to play for and we will try to do that from now until the end of the season,' said the Belgium international. 'We want to do both - let's hope we can do both. We have the FA Cup and league still to play for and we want to do well in every single game.' Mignolet has enjoyed a renaissance in his form which mirrored that of the team's results since returning to the starting line-up on Boxing Day after being dropped for a short spell. Keeper Simon Mignolet (centre) insists he cannot choose between winning the FA Cup and a top four finish . The Belgium stopper has forced his way back into the team by cutting a more commanding figure . He accepts his time out of the team gave him chance to make changes to his game, which involved being more dominant in his area and certainly more vocal with his team-mates. 'It is something we spoke about when I was out the team: to be more aggressive and be more dominant with defenders and be more commanding and demanding,' he added. 'Last week I had family over and they asked me straight after the game if my voice had not gone because they do not normally hear me on the pitch. 'I have always been one who tries to give information to the defenders and for me to organise at set-pieces but it is maybe more the body language and the commanding voice to get the message over to the players which has changed a bit. Philippe Coutinho celebrates scoring the winner against Blackburn in their quarter-final replay . 'It is something to do with my character as well which is a bit laid back so I had to make sure when I gave a signal it was commanding enough.' Mignolet is likely to be tested by Belgium team-mate Christian Benteke, who is enjoying his own return to form with eight goals in his last seven games. 'I've not spoken to Benteke this week but we spoke about it when we last met for internationals,' said the goalkeeper. 'We still had Blackburn to play at that stage but he knew if we were to progress it would be me and him. Mignolet will be tasked with stopping his in-form international team-mate Christian Benteke . 'We know Aston Villa have aerial ability with two strikers up front and so it is something we have to deal with on Sunday. 'He (Benteke) has been scoring a couple of goals lately, together with (Gabriel) Agbonlahor they have a lot of pace up front. 'But we have to look at ourselves to perform.

"Straight after Easter on planet football comes squeaky bum time, but the only squeaking at Chelsea came from Jose Mourinho, trying to contain his mirth when told West Ham had the most positive tactics in England. Mourinho was having no truck with the Barclays Premier League's Fair Play table, which lauded the Hammers for their attacking style and frowned upon Chelsea's lack of respect. He dismissed it as a joke. He was relaxed ahead of a visit from Manchester United. He even offered support to Manuel Pellegrini, claiming the Manchester City boss had been treated like a 'criminal' after losing six of eight games. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has spoken out in defence of under pressure colleague Manuel Pellegrini .

United defender Chris Smalling scores his side's fourth goal as they beat City 4-2 at Old Trafford last week . Pellegrini poses with Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany (left) after winning the league last season . No love is lost between Mourinho and Pellegrini, but the Chelsea manager said: 'I'm surprised a team that won two titles in three years and are still champions can be brought to hell. 'It looks like they don't deserve respect, that they are bad players, that the manager is a bad manager, that they are a disaster. But they are the champions. 'You want lots of teams fighting for the title. 'So how can you be so negative with a team that's won two titles in three years? Some managers cannot win and life goes on, but the guys at Man City... it looks like they're criminals.' Victory on Saturday will extend Chelsea's lead over United to 11 points and inch Mourinho closer to his first Premier League title since 2006, having led from the start. 'We are boring, top of the league since day one,' said the Portuguese. 'Everyone would love the Premier League to be like the Championship, with four teams separated by a couple of points. 'I know this would be the ideal scenario, but since day one we are there. We are trying not to allow that to happen. We have big determination to be champions.' As for the Fair Play table, well, he couldn't care less. It is compiled using data from Premier League delegates who mark teams in six categories. The conduct of Chelsea's players towards match officials is rated the worst in the league and only Sunderland score worse when it comes to the behaviour of staff. 'I'm not surprised,' chuckled Mourinho. 'These delegates are the same delegates who do the evaluation of the referees' performances and I read them every week. 'I think it depends on the food and drink. We have to change the catering because we have the best and many times they don't see the games. Next season, bread and water.'

"Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho would welcome Jurgen Klopp to the Barclays Premier League - after being assured he is not coming to take his job. The 47-year-old German has been tipped to make the move to England next season after confirming earlier this week that he will leave current club Borussia Dortmund after seven years at the end of the season. That news has sparked a frenzy of speculation over possible destinations with Manchester City having already indicated he is not in their sights with pressure mounting on Manuel Pellegrini. Mourinho admits he has no idea where Klopp will end up - but knows it will not be at Stamford Bridge. Jose Mourinho insists that Jurgen Klopp is not coming to Stamford Bridge to take his job . The Portuguese displayed his usual range of emotions ahead of Chelsea's game with Manchester United . CLICK HERE to read 10 key questions ahead of the crunch clash between Chelsea and United . He said: 'He's a very good coach, but I have no idea if he comes to the Premier League. He's a very good coach, he's a good friend, I like him very much. 'If he comes, welcome. But I don't want to get into that story, 'where is he going?' 'The only thing I know is that he told me he's not coming to Chelsea, for sure - and he told me that personally, so, I'm calm.' Stoke boss Mark Hughes forecast that Klopp's pedigree in European competition would work in his favour for clubs looking to compete on the biggest stage. He said: 'A lot of foreign coaches want to come to the Premier League - it is very attractive to them. He is a big character and personality it seems. 'I don't know the guy personally as I haven't met him, but he has had a good record apart from this year, where he has had a real struggle. 'Maybe that suggests the way he works works for a certain period. But he has had to obviously handle the loss of key players in his time, because that is what happens in Germany invariably - Bayern Munich come and take your better players, strengthening themselves and weakening you as an opponent - so he has had to manage through that.

'That seems to be a pre-requisite before they even start discussing who might come and go.' However, West Ham manager Sam Allardyce admitted the arrival of big-name coaches in the Premier League simply increases the challenge for home-grown bosses. Jurgen Klopp has announced that he will leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season . The highly rated coach has been linked with several Premier League jobs, including Manchester City . He said: 'It's like being a player - we have the best league in the world and the biggest brand in the world, so that attracts the biggest coaches and the biggest players. 'We have to live with that, we have to be so good. Not only as a player today, but also as a manager and a coach, you have to embrace that challenge. We are faced with that challenge and have to meet it head on. 'I'm not surprised if there is a lot of interest around him, if that is what he said, but he has not had quite as good a season [at Dortmund] as a couple of seasons ago, so perhaps that is why he is jumping ship and going somewhere else, as he sees he cannot go any further where he is, where he has done a fantastic job.' Sam Allardyce has complained the the arrival of foreign coaches limits homegrown opportunities . Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker has backed Klopp to be a success in the Premier League . Meanwhile, Klopp's compatriot and Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker admitted surprise at his decision to leave Dortmund, but backed him to be a success in England. Mertesacker said: 'I've got some nice experiences in the Premier League and of course it would be nice if a German coach would take the challenge of working in the Premier League. 'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving, but I still wish him all the best and hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting.

"Ronny Deila hailed ultimate impact sub Leigh Griffiths for his hat-trick performance in Celtic’s comeback Premiership win over Kilmarnock. And then Parkhead manager said the striker’s desire to prove him wrong should serve as an example to any player left out of his starting XI. Griffiths took just 19 minutes to score a treble that takes Celtic ever closer to a clean sweep of domestic honours, staking an obvious claim to start in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness at Hampden. Deila, asked if he thought the forward was trying to prove a point, said: ‘It looks like that - and that’s how you’re going to do it. That’s what I expect from the other subs as well. You can be angry but the way to get back into the team is to prove you deserve to play - like Leigh did today. Ronny Deila celebrates after Celtic came from behind to beat Kilmarnock at Parkhead on Wednesday . ‘He was fabulous. You can’t do any better than three goals. His contribution was excellent. And his left foot? He could be a kicker in American football – he’d be very good, I think. ‘He’s improved a lot in my time here. He’s training well and as a 24-hour athlete he’s been getting better and better, even though he eats cakes on the bench sometimes. But it’s just a start – he needs to keep working on small things and he’ll get even more goals. ‘He and John Guidetti played well together today and that’s something to think about when we play with two strikers.’ Asked if Griffiths is now a certain starter for Sunday, Deila said: ‘He played very well today so we’ll see.’ Deila shakes hands with Leigh Griffiths, who collects the match ball after his hat-trick . Celtic came back from the loss of a goal early in the second half to crush Killie, Deila saying: ‘Defensively we were very good for the first 60 minutes, we had the ball all the time and they didn’t have a shot on target. ‘Our attacking play was too slow, too many square passes and we didn’t create anything. We said at the break we needed to take more risk and get behind them. With Leigh coming on we had a lot more movement and we opened them up and got our goals.’ Celtic could now win the title against closest rivals Aberdeen on May 10 – if both teams win all their games beforehand. But Deila hopes his team won’t even need to beat the Dons in their own back yard to be crowned champions. Griffiths completes his hat-trick against Kilmarnock on Wednesday at Parkhead to move eight points clear . Wednesday’s win took Celtic eight points clear with six games remaining. Should both teams win their remaining league games, an away win at Pittodrie would finish the race. Yet Deila said: ‘We could win it before Pittodrie. Hopefully we will. It’s possible – if they lose a game and we win we can do that. ‘We want to win the title as early as possible and today was a very important win and we’re in to a very important week. If you can get into the last five games eight points ahead we have a very good chance. ‘ . The Parkhead side have two Friday night fixtures against Dundee and St Johnstone – and won’t play another game on Saturday at 3pm this season. Substitute Griffiths came off the bench to spark Celtic into life after lacklustre first-half . If Celtic wrap up the league flag they will be presented with the trophy before their final home game against Inverness Caledonian Thistle on May 24, the final day of the season. Aberdeen will play St Johnstone in their final game, with the top six completed by a Dundee derby. The final round of bottom six ties could be held on the night of Friday, May 22. The team which finishes 11th will be consigned to a two-leg play-off against the winners of the Championship play-off. With St Mirren 10 points adrift at the foot of the table with just 15 points left to play for, Motherwell will begin their quest to leapfrog Ross County out of the play-off spot with a local Friday night derby against Hamilton. The Fir Park side face Partick Thistle on the final day of the season, while St Mirren face Hamilton.","Leigh Griffiths came off the bench to score a hat-trick at Parkhead .

"Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola blamed his team's Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat by Porto on injuries. Porto take a two-goal advantage to Munich next Tuesday for the return leg of the last-eight clash after punishing a sloppy Bayern with two early goals from Ricardo Quaresma and a second-half effort from Jackson Martinez. Guardiola said: 'We have players who were out a long time with injuries ... their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.' Pep Guardiola says his side suffered with the injuries they are currently contending with in the squad . Porto manager Julen Lopetegui said his side can now dream of reaching the semi-finals, but they will need to be 'perfect' in the second leg. 'Now we have produced a situation for ourselves where we can dream, knowing that we will need to give everything we have got to get through,' Lopetegui, a former Barcelona team mate of Guardiola, told reporters. 'We will need to produce a perfect performance in Germany next week to progress.' Julen Lopetegui says reaching the Champions League semi-final would be a dream come true . Ricardo Quaresma (7) gave Porto an early lead from the spot but Manuel Neuer was lucky to be on the pitch . Lopetegui said the return from injury of goalscorer Martinez, who had been out since early March with a hamstring problem, was one of the reasons for Wednesday's victory. 'With him back in the attack, we were able to press Bayern with some force and give them real problems,' he said. Martinez, who capitalised on an error by Jerome Boateng in the 65th minute to round Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer for Porto's third goal after Thiago Alcantara had reduced the arrears, said he was not yet 100 percent fit. The striker was a constant menace for Bayern's defenders and his tenacious harrying was rewarded after three minutes when he robbed Xabi Alonso before being brought down by Neuer for a penalty that Quaresma converted. Jackson Martinez (right) rounds Neuer to slot home Porto's third goal and put them in control . Martinez troubled Bayern throughout and tackled Xabi Alonso (right) in the build up to the penalty . It was a similar story for Porto's second goal when Quaresma picked the pocket of Dante before beating Neuer with a clever finish on 10 minutes. 'It was fundamental that we tried our best to impose ourselves on Bayern and not give them a chance to settle,' Martinez said. Quaresma also sought to heap praise on Porto's team ethic, saying hard work had proved the difference between the two teams. 'There are no stars here. We all work hard for our results,' the forward said. 'The win is more important to us than the display. We have all worked extremely hard to get this win to give ourselves something to defend in the second leg.'

"Manchester United's thumping 4-2 derby victory over City is the latest vindication for the methods of manager Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman spent long periods of the season under fire for the disjointed performances of his misfiring team but is now basking in the glory of a dramatic upturn in fortunes. Convincing victories over Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool and City have fans believing in Van Gaal's fabled philosophy. With a place in the top four all but assured and local bragging rights restored, here are five things the manager changed to transform United. Manchester United players celebrate Chris Smalling's goal during their 4-2 victory ove Manchester City . Here comes the Belgian . Who is this marauding midfield menace? Marouane Fellaini was public enemy No 1 last season, appearing to epitomise everything that was wrong with United under David Moyes. The scapegoat with the funny hair found it no laughing matter and this season has thrived under a manager who is utilising his strengths. Van Gaal is brave enough and bold enough to throw the big man into the action and give him licence to attack, regardless of aesthetics. If his unplayable form continues, expect sales of those daft wigs outside Old Trafford to rocket. Marouane Fellaini celebrates after the influential Belgian gave the Red Devils a 2-1 lead on Sunday . Fellaini leaps to meet Ashley Young's cross with a header to send Old Trafford into a state of euphoria . Last season, Fellaini struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford and was heavily criticised by fans . Ander-nother one comes good . Some United fans will tell you that they always knew Ander Herrera would do the business, he just needed the opportunity. Van Gaal however, will say that the box-to-box Basque boy is now thriving because he has taken on board his advice. The manager bemoaned a lack of composure from Herrera which saw him start just one Premier League match from October to mid-February. Since his return he has provided a cutting edge that United lacked until their spring rising. Van Gaal will no doubt claim similar credit for the resurgence of a reborn Ashley Young. Spanish midfielder Ander Herrera has been in impressive form for Louis van Gaal's side . The United boss congratulated Herrera after another good performance as United defeated rivals City . Figuring out what's the Mata . Juan Mata failed to live up to big expectations last season and looked like another who would prove to be a big-money flop. In fairness, it was a tall order to perform in a sinking side and some wondered if, given an apparent lack of pace, he would ever fit in. The man who arrived in a helicopter, however, finally has lift-off. Surrounded by willing runners he is now a key cog in a well-oiled machine. Loved by Chelsea fans, he is now close to being adored in Manchester. The Special Juan. Juan Mata slots the ball past goalkeeper Joe Hart to give his side a commanding 3-1 lead against City . Mata celebrates in front of the United supporters after firing his side into a two-goal lead . Reputation counts for nothing . Van Gaal has been dropping hints about his philosophy all season. The message came loud and clear when he was asked why he had preferred unproven teenager James Wilson to £280,000-a-week loan man Radamel Falcao. 'If a player cost £95m or £5,000 it’s not any different for me,’ Van Gaal told us. ‘You have to prove yourself.’ It is that mantra that has seen the likes of Falcao, £60m Angel di Maria and old pal Robin van Persie spend large parts of the season checking their backsides for splinters and has paved the way for the re-emergance of the likes of Mata, Herrera, Fellaini and Young. Radamel Falcao (right) has had to settle for a place on the bench after failing to impress Van Gaal . Record £60million signing Angel di Maria has also been made to sit on the bench by the United boss . Stumbling across a system . Despite snatching unlikely victories, United had laboured for long chunks of the campaign with the atmosphere at Old Trafford often flatter than a (Dutch) pancake. Not now. The three at the back is long gone and while it might not be the 4-4-2 the frustrated fans chanted for at QPR, the 4-1-4-1 (with a special mention for Michael Carrick) some would say the boss was forced into thanks to injury is not far off. By luck or design it is working. The Theatre of Dreams is rocking again and the nightmare of last season seems a million miles away.

"Emmanuel Adebayor is sometimes branded 'eccentric' by pundits, writers and fans alike. After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The bizarre post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe . The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account . He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for £5million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements. Adebayor has only one year left to run on his current contract at Tottenham and could leave this summer .

"Dead fish have continued to wash up on the banks of a Rio de Janeiro lake that is scheduled to hold Olympic rowing competitions during the 2016 games. Fish die-offs are a frequent occurrence in Rio's waterways, which are choked with raw sewage and rubbish. The latest incident, affecting thousands of small silvery fish called twaite shad, began several days ago at the Rodrigo de Freitas lake, where the Olympic canoeing and rowing events are to be held. The Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon will hold the Brazil 2016 Olympics rowing and canoe competitions . Currently, the lake is littered with thousands of dead fish due to the raw sewage and rubbish within it . With neighbors complaining about the stench, employees of the city's waste management company have been working to clear away the dead fish. 'Every year there are these die-offs, sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller,' said photographer Alex Moutinho, who has lived near the lake for over three decades. 'It's one more Brazilian shame.' In a statement, the city's environmental secretariat said the latest incident was the result of recent rains and high sea levels, which caused the lake's water temperature to plummet. The statement stressed that twaite shad are sensitive to variations in temperature, adding that oxygen levels in the lake were normal. Officials say the recent problems are the result of rain, which caused the lake's temperature to plummet . The city's waste management company have been brought in to clear the lake of the dead fish . Vultures feed on the dead fish on the shore of the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon in Rio de Janeiro on Monday . Previous fish die-offs in the lake have been blamed on pollution-related drops in oxygen levels. The cause of February die-off of twaite shad in the Guanabara Bay, where the Olympic sailing events are to be held, were not known. Rio's water quality has become a contentious topic ahead of the 2016 Olympics. Authorities had pledged to clean up some of the waterways including the Guanabara Bay ahead of the games but now admit those promises won't be met, sparking sailors to voice worries about possible health and safety threats posed by competing in the sewage and garbage-filled waters. Residents concerned about the water quality of a canal in the Rio neighborhood of Recreio staged a protest on Sunday. Hundreds of demonstrators linked arms along the Canal das Taxas, which is filled with raw sewage from nearby condominiums. The canal flows into a lagoon where the Olympic Park is being built.","The Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon will hold the 2016 Olympic rowing races .

"Rampant Lazio carry an eight-game winning streak in Serie A into Saturday's match at league leaders Juventus. The Biancoceleste, who have scored 18 goals and conceded just one in their last six Italian league games, will attempt to solidify their grip on second place. A victory would leave them nine points behind Juve with seven games remaining. Lazio, lead by Miroslav Klose and Felipe Anderson, have won eight games in a row in Serie A . Head coach Stefano Pioli says his side will go 'all out for victory' against Juventus on Saturday . Juventus are unbeaten at home this season but they did slip to just their second defeat of the campaign last weekend in a major upset at bottom-side Parma. 'I'm satisfied with what we have done,' Lazio coach Stefano Pioli said to the Italian press. However, he stressed: 'We have not achieved anything yet. 'We need to continue to work with focus. 'There are many games left to play before we can celebrate. 'Against Juve we will try to go all out for victory. 'We don't want to have any regrets after the game.' The clash with Lazio comes at the start of a challenging week for Juve. Massimiliano Allegri's team travels to Montecarlo on Tuesday for the return leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Monaco holding a 1-0 advantage. The Bianconeri will then take on Torino four days later in the Turin derby. Felipe Andrson celebrates after scoring during the 4-0 rout against Empoli last Sunday . Lazio face Massimiliano Allegri's (pictured) Juventus, and will cut the gap to nine points with victory . Roma have won just two of their last eight league games to fall to third in the standings, one point adrift of Lazio. The Giallorossi hold the last Champions League qualifying spot and host Atalanta on Sunday. At the other end of the table, bottom-side Parma go into Sunday's match at Empoli following another major blow. The club was docked four points on Thursday as punishment related to their financial troubles. Parma had already been hit with a three-point deduction earlier this season for failing to pay players. The latest setback has left Parma 18 points adrift of safety with 24 points still up for grabs. Napoli, seven points behind Roma, take on relegation-threatened Cagliari in Sardinia. Rafael Benitez's side won 4-1 triumph at Wolfsburg in the first leg of its Europa League quarter-final tie Thursday. Fiorentina are one place and one point behind Napoli and host Hellas Verona on Monday.

Torino have clinched seven points of a possible nine in their last three games to remain in contention for European football next season . The Granata are in eighth place and play at Sassuolo on Sunday. A win over Genoa on Sunday would be enough for Palermo to defend their Serie A status. The Sicilian club have collected 38 points so far to move 16 points clear of the drop zone.

"Chris Smalling says Manchester United have Arsenal and Chelsea in their sights following their resounding victory over champions Manchester City. United are third, eight points behind leaders Chelsea, who they face on Saturday and play second placed Arsenal in their penultimate league game. Smalling scored United's fourth goal in their 4-2 derby demolition. It means he has now scored the same amount of Premier League goals this season as former teammate Danny Welbeck at Arsenal with four. Chris Smalling showed his hunger to beat a lethargic City defence to Ashley Young's free-kick . Smalling is greeted by Juan Mata following his goal in Manchester United's impressive win over their rivals . He said: 'It’s massive [to win six in a row]. I think a lot of people probably saw our fixtures as the hardest of the lot, but if you play teams like Tottenham and Liverpool and win, they’re real six-pointers. It makes a massive difference, and I think confidence comes from beating these top teams. 'We weren’t ourselves in the first 15 minutes, but we dominated from there on. 'We came in at half-time and Giggsy said it was a good show of character to come back from a goal down, but in the second half we needed to get the ball down and take a few more risks. Mata once again showed his value to the side and pointed the way with a display full of energy and poise . 'We were a bit cautious and didn’t try to play out [from the back] too much, but in the second half we really kicked on and made a print on the game. Smalling ghosted into the area unmarked to head Ashley Young's free-kick past Joe Hart on 73 minutes.

"Suddenly an opportunity. From looking as if a door had been slammed shut on them, Liverpool, unexpectedly, have a chance to kick it back open and capitalise. When Liverpool’s players trudged from the Emirates Stadium pitch, having been pummelled into submission by Arsenal, all hope of a top-four finish looked to have evaporated. Brendan Rodgers, subdued and disconsolate, admitted as much in his post-match debrief. The Rodgers who left London nine days ago is very different, though, to the Rodgers who will step into Anfield’s technical area on Monday, feeling optimistic and satisfied with his lot. He knows Liverpool have been let off the hook and now he wants to see a response. Liverpool's first-team players will be all smiles if they can finish inside the top four and win the FA Cup . Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling arrives at Anfield eight hours ahead of Monday night's match at Anfield . Dejan Lovren will be hoping to keep his place after appearing in Liverpool's win over Blackburn . Jordon Ibe removes a suit from the boot of his car as he begins to prepare for his side's league match . Liverpool are seven points behind fourth-placed Manchester City but have a game in hand on their rivals . Had Manchester City won their games against Crystal Palace and Manchester United, talk of Liverpool being Champions League contenders would have been risible but the implosion at the Etihad Stadium has thrown things wide open. At present, the gap between Liverpool and City is seven points – and, just like last year when the two teams were duelling, Manuel Pellegrini’s side have a significantly better goal difference – but Rodgers will be telling his squad that it is not insurmountable. Given the way City are playing, there are a number of games that could cause them issues on the climb to the line – will Aston Villa and QPR be straightforward? How about Tottenham away? Does Pellegrini retain his squad’s belief? – and now is the moment Liverpool must pounce. In the next seven days, the way Liverpool’s campaign is viewed could be completely transformed. Beat Newcastle and they will believe they can hunt City down; see off Villa at Wembley and they will have a fine chance of winning the FA Cup. Rickie Lambert, pictured making his way into Anfield, has failed to hit the back of the net in his last six games . Reds boss Brendan Rodgers will be hoping his side can get back to winning ways in the Premier League . Sterling and his Liverpool team-mates were left dejected after their 4-1 defeat by Arsenal . So now the question will be asked of Rodgers’ squad: can they ramp up the pressure? There have been occasions this season when they have faltered at crucial moments – think home games against Basle (Champions League), Manchester United (Premier League) – and there can be no repeat. Here lies an opportunity for Raheem Sterling to dispel the furore around his contract saga with some jet-propelled performances, for Daniel Sturridge to remind a wider audience of his goalscoring ability and for Philippe Coutinho to sparkle and shine. Coutinho has won John Terry’s vote to be the player of the year. It was quite a statement from the Chelsea captain but there is little doubt that the Brazilian has the ability to be one of the top draws in the Premier League. These two games should be made for him. If Coutinho starts pulling the strings against Newcastle, Liverpool will get the result that will ensure Manchester City feel their breath on their necks and you would think the wide open spaces of Wembley would be tailor-made for his passing game. Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho helped his side progress to the semi-finals of the FA Cup . Rodgers talks tactics with his coaching staff ahead of his side's Premier League showdown with Newcastle . ‘He is a young player that's come into this country and adapted incredibly well to the style of football in the Premier League,’ said Rodgers. ‘People initially maybe thought he might be a bit slight. But he is very strong in his mind and he’s got an incredible technique, up there with world's best. 'With him it's about the consistency. He played in a different position the other night against Blackburn, we asked him tactically to operate different and he carried that out very, very well. So great tactical discipline and obviously a wonderful goal. ‘His best years are way ahead of him. He's such a humble boy, he wants to train and loves his football every day. John's probably looking at his performance level; since he's been here it has been outstanding and is only going to get better which is the pleasing thing for everyone.’ Rodgers’ ambition all year has been to win a trophy. If he was also to steer Liverpool into a top-four spot, it would arguably represent an even better campaign than last year when they came within two points of ending their 25-year quest to become champions of England. To realise that ambition, however, Rodgers needs two wins. A door has been left ajar and Coutinho is the man to lead Liverpool through it.","Liverpool got back to winning ways with FA Cup victory over Blackburn .

"The French state railway company on Monday demanded police action against 'irresponsible' Paris-Roubaix cycle race riders who breached a safety barrier seconds before a high speed train hurtled by. The SNCF company made an official complaint to French prosecutors saying the action in Sunday's prestigious race had risked a deadly tragedy. The last of the riders went through the barrier in northern France about eight seconds before the TGV train arrived at the Waller crossing, 87 kilometers (54 miles) from the end of the so called 'Hell of the North' race. SNCF have spoken of their fury at the riders who breached a safety barrier as a train approached . SNCF slammed the riders for an 'extremely grave an irresponsible action' One rider was even clipped by the barrier as it came down, as the racers hurry through with the train near . Another cyclist made his way over the track after police tried to stop anymore competitors getting across . A number of riders wait safely for the train to pass through while others risked crossing . The train hurtled through at high speed shortly after a group of riders went through the barrier . One rider from the Belgian Lotto team was clipped by a barrier as it came down. John Degenkolb, winner of the race famed for its 26 sections of bone-jarring cobbled roads, was among the group who went through the barrier as it closed. Race organisers said it had not been possible for the leaders to stop in time. 'Several riders deliberately, and against all safety rules, crossed a closed safety barrier,' said a SNCF statement announcing the complaint to French prosecutors. 'Millions of television viewers saw live this extremely grave and irresponsible action which could have been tragic,' the company added. 'A few seconds later, a TGV ran on this line and could have hit the peloton.' When the last rider had gone through the crossing, a police motorcycle was in place to stop more riders going through. The riders are held at a level crossing in the Paris-Roubaix race as a train approaches . A number of cyclists breached the barrier to cross the track before the train sped through . The last cyclist appeared to cross the track around eight seconds before the train went through . Normally riders who go through a closed safety crossing are disqualified. But Guy Dobbelaere, president of the jury of race commissioners, defended the action of the riders on Sunday. 'It wasn't possible for the leading riders to stop sufficiently safely,' said Dobbelaere. 'The peloton was 10 metres away when the barrier started to close.' Race director Thierry Gouvenou added: 'By neutralising the race for a few moments to not penalise those who stopped, we respected the spirit of the rule. 'In theory, those who pass when the barrier is down are thrown out of the race. 'This time, that would have been unjust in respect of those riders who weren't identified,' said Gouvenou. German John Degenkolb won the race and was one of the riders who went through the closed barrier . Degenkolb celebrates his win alongside Zdenek Stybar (left) and Greg van Avermaet (right) Race officials slowed the leading riders so that those held up by the barrier could catch up. In 2006, three riders were disqualified for going through a closed railway crossing. The three - Leif Hoste and Peter van Petegem of Belgium and Russian Vladimir Guseve - were less than 10 kilometers (six miles) from the finish and had been disputing top places.","Railway company condemns the cyclists 'grave and irresponsible action'

"Jordon Ibe is on the verge of signing a new long-term contract as Brendan Rodgers prepares to re-launch the exciting teenager’s season. Liverpool offered Ibe fresh terms in February after he had a deep impression in a sequence of games, particularly against Everton and Tottenham, that coincided with an improvement in the club’s fortunes. A deal has now been agreed and it is simply a case of the highly-regarded Ibe, who has been absent since damaging knee ligaments against Besiktas on February 26, putting pen to paper. Jordon Ibe in training for Liverpool at Melwood as he prepares to make a return from injury . Ibe is set to sign a new long-term deal at Liverpool after breaking into the first team this season . Rodgers says Ibe, 19, has looked ‘absolutely sensational’ after stepping up his rehabilitation work in the last couple of weeks and he could come straight back into the starting line-up against Newcastle on Monday night. The issue Rodgers must address is whether to stick with the 4-3-3 formation he used at Blackburn in the FA Cup last Wednesday or revert to the 3-4-3 system that had been the catalyst for an improvement in results. One thing Liverpool’s manager has conceded, though, is that Daniel Sturridge is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season, given all the injuries he has suffered. Ibe, pictured in action against Tottenham, damaged his knee ligaments while playing against Besiktas . Sturridge, who has only scored four goals in his last 15 games, admitted last week that he felt it would have to wait until the new campaign to show last year’s sparkle and his manager agrees, following 12 months in which he has suffered thigh, calf and hip issues. ‘It’s a long time out,’ said Rodgers. ‘When you’re out for that length of time it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again. ‘The key for him was to get back and be fit but he needs a good pre-season under his belt, a total run at pre-season and hopefully he’ll be fine for next season. Until that point we have to maximise what we can get out of him.’ Brendan Rodgers prepares his Liverpool team for the visit of Newcastle to Anfield on Monday . Daniel Sturridge is yet to rediscover his best form since returning from a lengthy injury lay off . Rodgers added: ‘Every player is different. With Daniel there’s been a number of injuries that he’s had and that’s before he came here. He had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well but this season has been difficult. ‘He just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can but sometimes that isn’t all down to you — sometimes it’s about luck as well.’","Jordon Ibe to put pen to paper on a new long-term deal at Liverpool .

"A resurgent Kimi Raikkonen sees no reason why Ferrari cannot win this year's Formula One world title race. Following a torrid campaign with the team in 2014, Raikkonen finally has a car to his liking at Ferrari this season, with the Finn looking far more like his old competitive self. Only qualifying issues have denied Raikkonen better results so far this term, with the 35-year-old knocking on the door of his first podium place for 19 months after finishing fourth in the last two races. Kimi Raikkonen finished fourth at the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai on Sunday . Ferrari have proved more competitive in the first three races of this season than they were last year . At the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday, Raikkonen was reeling in team-mate Sebastian Vettel and may well have claimed third but for a late safety car. Although Vettel and Raikkonen were comfortably adrift of Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at that stage, the Finn is confident Ferrari can catch and regularly beat their German rivals. 'I don't see a reason why not,' said Raikkonen. 'We have made big gains and we will continue to make big gains during this year. 'Obviously everybody will improve, so it depends what the rest are doing, but we are definitely going the right way and doing the right things. 'It is about being patient. We need time, we cannot make miracles overnight. Sebastian Vettel finished on the podium for the third time this season at the Chinese Grand Prix . 'Sebastian showed we can win (in Malaysia last month), but it depends as one circuit may be better for one team and the next could be a different story. 'We just need to be up there when something happens to them, or the conditions change, but I really feel on speed we will get there to regularly beat them.' Raikkonen recognises, though, he needs to do better in qualifying on Saturday if he is to thrust himself into the hunt for the title. An error at the Shanghai International Circuit resulted in Raikkonen starting sixth, and although he passed Williams duo Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa on lap one, he could do no more. Raikkonen sees no reason why Ferrari cannot challenge for the title this season . 'After my mistake fourth was more or less maximum,' added Raikkonen. 'I probably could have tried (to pass Vettel) at least, but there was a safety car at the end. It is what it is. 'After what happened on Saturday we at least gained some positions and we had a pretty good car. 'But we are not happy. We have to make Saturdays more correct as it gives you bigger chances and an easier life in the race.

"Manchester United have become favourites to sign Danny Ings after holding talks with Burnley about a summer deal. Liverpool maintain an interest in the player and were prepared to exploit a Premier League loophole to guarantee a transfer in the summer. But Louis van Gaal is attempting to use the same method to trump their rivals and secure the services of the 22-year-old. Ings has scored nine goals in his first season in the Premier League and United consider him to be a future England international. Manchester United are favourites to sign Burnley striker Danny Ings this summer . Ings jokes with Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck during Burnley's 1-0 defeat at Turf Moor on Saturday . Van Gaal was particularly impressed by Ings’ performance against United at Old Trafford in February when he scored in Burnley’s 3-1 defeat. Ings has become one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe and United are keen to ensure that they win the race for his signature. Real Sociedad, Tottenham and Manchester City are all interested in the player, but Sportsmail understands that United have opened dialogue with Burnley to hurry through a move. The player is out of contract in the summer and due to his age Burnley would be set to receive around £5million in compensation if he moved to a domestic rival. Ings impressed Louis van Gaal when he scored against United at Old Trafford in February . Ings has scored nine goals for Burnley in his first season in the Premier League . But, under Premier League Rule U8, an English team can agree a fee and sign a pre-contract with Ings and the club which guarantees a transfer in the summer. Liverpool wanted to sign Ings in the January transfer window and loan him back to Burnley, but were prevented doing so by Premier League regulations. Burnley were adamant they wanted to hold on to the forward until the end of the season in the hope he would help keep them up and the club are still in with a chance of staying in the top flight.","Danny Ings' contract atBurnley expires at the end of the season .

"Louis van Gaal celebrated his derby demolition in style on Sunday night as he was snapped with Manchester City women's players Toni Duggan and Isobel Christiansen in a restaurant. Duggan uploaded a photograph on Instagram of her, Christiansen and Everton's Michelle Hinnigan at Wing's Chinese restaurant following United's 4-2 win against their great rivals City, and wrote: 'Heyyy Louis van G!!!! Nice to share a wings with you...... [sic].' Duggan later deleted the post. Duggan has since removed the photo from Instagram and issued an apology on Facebook. Her apology read: 'I would like to apologise to all MCFC fans for the error of judgement I made last night. 'I now appreciate the significance of my actions and can assure everyone connected with Manchester City that I am proud to represent the Club and wear the shirt.' Wing's is the go-to place for  footballers in Manchester, with England and United captain Wayne Rooney among its regulars, but the only City stars in sight were Duggan and Christiansen.

The red half of Manchester were given reason to celebrate as they moved four points clear of their noisy neighbours in the Barclays Premier League, and Van Gaal decided to let his hair down. Asked how he planned to celebrate at his post-match press conference, Van Gaal said: 'I can go to Mr Wing's because when you win you can go. 'When you lose then the fans are saying, ""what is Mr Louis van Gaal doing? Losing and he goes to the best restaurant of Manchester?"" Now I can go. Maybe I shall go.'

Van Gaal described humiliating City as the 'best feeling' he had since moving to Old Trafford, and added: 'This week they [the players and supporters] can go on the streets, heads up and say: ""We are the better team because goal average (over the two derbies) is in our favour.""' It seems United's players followed his advice as Ander Herrera, Mata and Daley Blind were spotted painting the town red, too. They won't be able to celebrate for too long, however, as United must prepare to visit the Premier League's runaway leaders Chelsea. Van Gaal goes up against Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge this Saturday, and will try to throw a spanner in the works as Chelsea aim to seal the title. Duggan of City (centre) tries to fend off two Sunderland markers during a match earlier this month . City's 23-year-old forward Christiansen pictured playing for the Etihad outfit previously . Wing's is the go-to place for footballers but the only City stars in sight were Duggan and Christiansen (above) Hinnigan (left) of Everton passes the ball during a match between the Merseyside club and Notts County . Wing's restaurant is located in Manchester city centre. It attracts a certain type of clientele... with owner Mr Wing never afraid to push for as much publicity as possible. So, who goes there? The Class of '92 have eaten there, and Wayne Rooney is a regular. The England and United captain celebrated his last two birthdays there, and held a Q&A session at the restaurant. Rooney was helping Wing's gain publicity after starring in an educational video in the build-up to the Chinese New Year on February 19. Radamel Falcao – the day he signed for Manchester United – tweeted a picture with agent Jorge Mendes and his lawyers, Paulo Rendeiro and Carlos Osorio, enjoying a glass of wine, some prawn crackers and a meal at Wing's. Radamel Falcao celebrated his loan move to Manchester by visiting the restaurant with his posse . Who is the owner? Wing Shing Chu owns the restaurant. He used to worked in Manchester's Chinatown before moving to Cheadle Hulme, near Stockport, and opening a Wing's restaurant there. He was so successful, however, that he left his wife in charge of that establishment and opened his flagship restaurant in the city centre.

But I couldn't afford it, could I? You could actually! There is an extensive a la carte menu, but there are also two set banquet options coming in at £30.90 or £44.90 per person. Banquet B at £44.90 per person offers: . Starter - Steamed scallop in shell with garlic and glass vermicelli. Second course - Baked lobster with ginger and spring onions. Main courses - Crispy chilli shredded fillet steak, steamed sea bass with ginger and spring onions in soya sauce, quick-fried sea treasures (monkfish fillet, scallops and king prawns), stir-fried king prawns and Chinese greens, as well as pak far roasted duck, all served with mixed seafood fried rice. Dessert - Fresh fruit platter. Rooney pictured leaving Wing's previously after having lunch with his manager and brother-in-law .

"New York City FC striker David Villa has taken another bite out of the Big Apple scene as he was invited to ring the opening bell for the New York Stock Exchange. The 33-year-old, who made the move to the newly formed MLS outfit this season, has really thrown himself into his surroundings; and his bell ringing comes just weeks after a photo shoot at the top of the Empire State Building. The NYSE's opening and closing bells mark the start and end of each trading day. The opening bell is rung at 9.30am, while the closing bell is struck at 4pm.

"Stuart Pearce believes Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini deserves more time to turnaround the club’s dwindling fortunes. City’s challenge for the title has capitulated in recent weeks and Pellegrini’s men now face a battle to even finish in the top four. A derby day thumping at the hands of rivals Manchester United only compounded their misery, but Pearce believes City should stick with the 61-year-old. Stuart Pearce believes Manuel Pellegrini should be given more time to turn Manchester City around . The look of dejection on the faces of the Manchester City players has been a familiar sign this season . Pearce told talkSPORT: ‘The club is at a stature now where they look to continually be in the Champions League and win Premier Leagues. The club will have a good look at themselves in the summer, but I’m not a big favour of turning managers over quickly. “I hope the manager stays in place. He has been around the block long enough to realise the squad needs freshening up drastically this summer.” Yaya Toure has had a largely ineffective season for current champions Manchester City this season . Toure and Fernandinho  look dejected during the Premier League defeat to Manchester United  at Old Trafford . Pearce, who spent time at the club as both a manager and a player, blamed City’s poor run of form on the fading influence of Ivorian Yaya Toure. ‘Where City have suffered historically is when Toure has either lost form or been away on African Nations tours,"" said Pearce.

"Ben Flower does not believe he deserved the standing ovation which greeted his return from suspension on Thursday night. As his Wigan side beat Warrington 30-20, the Wales forward made his first appearance since he punched St Helens' Lance Hohaia in the opening moments of last season's Grand Final, earning a six-month ban. The 27-year-old, who came on as a substitute in the 23rd minute of Thursday's match, told the Daily Star Sunday: 'I was surprised how calm I was, with everything going through my head about doing the right things. Ben Flower does not believe he deserved the standing ovation which greeted his return from suspension . 'But I didn't expect such a big loud roar and a standing ovation. For the fans to stick by me like that is a credit to them. 'It was lovely for them to do that but at the end of the day I do not deserve that because I let the club down massively.' Ahead of Flower's return, coach Shaun Wane had said he wanted to see him come back an even more aggressive player, but Flower said he needed to learn how to manage his emotions. 'I will get back to being a more aggressive player as I get fitter but aggressive does not mean that I am going to be a dirty player,' he said.

"Rafa Benitez is what he is; an excellent cup manager. He proved this yet again on Thursday, when his Napoli side blitzed past Europa League favourites Wolfsburg by four goals to one on the Germans' home turf. But despite managing some of the continent's most established clubs since leaving Valencia just over a decade ago - Liverpool, Inter, Chelsea (albeit on an interim basis) and Napoli - he has amassed a grand total of zero league titles. Benitez famously guided Liverpool to the Champions League in 2005 as he enjoyed cup successes . Benitez remains popular at Anfield, but when he left there were few regrets over his departure . Donovan Chandler is a Liverpool fan writer on 90min.com . At Anfield, we will be eternally grateful for the Champions League trophy he delivered in 2005, in spite of possessing what was, on paper at least, our worst accumulation of players in recent history. Djimi Traore, Antonio Nunez, Milan Baros and Igor Biscan - cult hero that he was - were all part of that unfathomably successful squad. All four were dispensed of either that summer or the one that followed. Two years after Instanbul, Benitez was (almost) at it again with a side that better resembled the one he would have wanted, though it wasn't quite good enough to overcome an improved AC Milan side on this occasion. For all the Spaniard's successes, he also brought in the hapless Djimi Traore and Czech forward Milan Baros . And although we ran Manchester United a close second two seasons after that, we actually ended up further away from the Premier League title than we had been in a number of years during his final campaign (2009-10) - a failure that signalled the end to an Anfield tenure that also yielded our last FA Cup. In between, he lumbered us with the Josemi's, Albert Riera's and Phillipp Degen's of this world; none of us had many regrets over his departure - except, of course, that it was the catalyst for our introduction to Roy Hodgson. Benitez won the FA Cup with Liverpool in 2006 on penalties against West Ham . With Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard playing well together, Benitez got close to the title, but never won it . And for all his moments, I fully believe we are on the right track again under Brendan Rodgers, even if we can't quite clutch that final Champions League spot this season - or miss out on the FA Cup. That's why, if Rafa returns to England again in the summer - as is being speculated due to Napoli's Serie A shortcomings this season - it will receive little more than a shrug from large sections of the Kop. His league failings mean he is unlikely to be sworn in at any of our top-four rivals, unless Manchester City need someone to keep the seat warm for their dream conquest Pep Guardiola. Liverpool's failure in the Premier League means that Benitez will always be remembered as a cup specialist . As far as my uneducated eyes can see, someone like West Ham would be the best place for your money, if you're that way inclined. A sudden influx of largely Spanish-based signings would bring (mostly temporary) excitement and they'd probably do well in the cups - enough to banish memories of the Big Sam years at least. That's where Rafa excels; Europa League success at Stamford Bridge and triumph in the Coppa Italia last term are further testament to this. But a threat to us and where we want to be? It would only be a result of our own self-destruction. Good luck, Rafa. And thanks for the memories.","Rafa Benitez won the Champions League and FA Cup with Liverpool .

"Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville has laid into referee Lee Mason after he failed to award Newcastle a penalty during their 2-0 defeat at Liverpool on Monday night. An incident in the 38th minute of the game, saw Ayoze Perez felled by a reckless challenge from Dejan Lovren. Although replays clearly showed the defender scything Perez down and not making contact with the ball, Mason did not point to the spot. Neville said during his analysis, 'It was an absolute stonewall penalty. The gasp in the ground, Lovren just kicks him right in the knee.' Ayoze Perez drives into the Liverpool box on 38 minutes only to be brought down by Dejan Lovren . Lovren makes a rash challenge and does not make any contact with the ball, sending the Spaniard tumbling . Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville could not believe that a spot kick was not awarded to the Magpies at Anfield . He added that Mason's perfect positioning should have led him to make the correct call. 'I think we said it last week, in the game, we always look at the ref's position. But you look at Lee Mason's view of it and he's got no excuse, he's staring right at it there, he's so close, within five or six yards. It's just a poor decision.' Before Lovren's foul, Raheem Sterling had put Liverpool in front with a curling effort just inside the box on 9 minutes; and Joe Allen wrapped up the three points for the home side with a rifled shot into the roof of the net late on following a failed clearance from Mike Williamson. The misery was only to be compounded for Newcastle, as stand-in captain Moussa Sissoko saw red for a second bookable offence. With Newcastle trailing 1-0, a penalty could have offered them a way back into the game, but nothing was given .

"Peter Houston goaded his vanquished rival Alan Stubbs after Falkirk stunned Hibernian to steal a 1-0 Scottish Cup semi-final triumph at Hampden. Houston claimed that Stubbs should be examining tactical failings that led to the downfall of Hibs rather than highlighting Falkirk’s fortune on the day. The broadside was in response to Stubbs insisting it’s Hibs who fully deserve to be waiting for Inverness Caledonian Thistle or Celtic in next month’s showpiece at the national stadium after bossing the match . Craig Sibbald finally breaks the deadlock for Falkirk with a stooping header that left Hibernian hearts broken .

However, the Easter Road side failed to convert dominance into a goal and Craig Sibbald’s 75th-minute header settled the tie. Houston pinpointed that all six of his team’s goals against Hibs this season — in three wins and a draw — had come from crosses. He said: ‘After every game we’ve played against Hibs this season, they have deserved to win according to Alan. ‘What he should maybe think about is where we are getting our goals from — crosses into their box. Deal with it. ‘As a coach, I’d be concerning myself with losing goals the way Hibs lose them to us. ‘Look at the videos. They can’t deal with crosses into the box, so that’s his problem, not mine. ‘Of course, Hibs were unfortunate not to win. I’m straight up on that. They hit the crossbar and the post. ‘But rather than say only one team deserved to win, he should think about how the team beat you. Then look back at the other times.

The Hibernian supporters can't quite believe their luck as Fraser Fyvie and Scott Allan both hit the woodwork . Lewis Stevenson misses from close range for Hibernian on one of those afternoon's for Alan Stubbs' side . There wasn't much too cheer about for Hibernian fans in a sparse Hampden Park crowd on Saturday . ‘They were the better football side today but don’t disrespect us by saying we didn’t deserve to win — we put a lot into the match defensively. ‘The most important thing is that we scored the goal to win the match.’ Houston’ s blast will add extra spice to the fifth meeting of the season — on May 2 when the race for the Championship play-off places goes down to the wire. And Stubbs has implored his players to overcome the agony of yesterday’s smash-and-grab defeat by winning a spot in the top flight. ‘This will make us stronger, it has to. We have to get over it. It’s my job to pick the players up and they need to pick themselves up because there is still plenty to play for. ‘My reaction is one of disbelief that we haven’t come through that game. We can’ t create the amount of chances we created and not score. ‘We controlled the entire game and that makes it worse. But that’s semi-finals and that can happen. I just wish we had some of the luck the opposition had.’","Craig Sibbald's 74th-minute header is enough to send Falkirk through .

"Teenager Ben Gibson had just seen his Middlesbrough side knocked out in the Champions League group stage when the email landed from club chairman – Uncle Steve – that he had been fired. That, of course, was the virtual world of Football Manager. On Friday, Boro defender Gibson – now 22 - can help steer his uncle's club back towards the big time for real. The England Under 21 star was a kid in the playground when his dad's brother was splashing the cash on Juninho, Alen Boksic and Gaizka Mendieta, before that there had been the likes of Fabrizio Ravanelli, Emerson and Paul Gascoigne. Middlesbrough defender Ben Gibson, 22, is dreaming of a return to the Premier League for his boyhood club . His uncle, Boro chairman Steve Gibson, has overseen some of the most significant times in the club's history . Midfielder Juninho (right) is widely considered to be one of Middlesbrough's greatest-ever players, and starred in Gibson's foray into computerised football management during his teenage years . Steve Gibson helped save the Teessiders from liquidation in 1986 and eight years later took control, his investment seeing them win the Carling Cup in 2004 and reach the final of the UEFA Cup in 2006. But six consecutive seasons outside of the Premier League has proved a financial strain. That is why Gibson readily labels the televised clash at Norwich City – one point above them and second in the Championship - as the biggest match in the club's history. 'The way the Premier League is and the gap financially makes this our biggest game ever,' said the centre-back. 'If we get back in the Premier League it's different to the last time we were there. It has more of an impact, financially, than what the cup finals did. 'It's £100m for going up, that is irreplaceable. It will have a bigger effect on the club and the town than winning the Carling Cup.' Nunthorpe-born Gibson is a lifelong Boro fan. He was there when they beat Bolton at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium to lift the first trophy in the club's history and again in Eindhoven two years later when Sevilla ran out 4-0 winners. He eclipsed all of that, however, in his bedroom at home. 'I was always Middlesbrough boss on Football Manager – and I was pretty good,' he recalled. Middlesbrough captain Gareth Southgate (left) leads the club's celebrations after winning the 2004 Carling Cup . Sevilla's Adriano Correia (left) shoots during the 2006 UEFA Cup final, in which his side beat Boro 4-0 . 'My uncle always gave me loads to spend! The best I got was the group stage of the Champions League. We got knocked out without making the second round and he gave me the bullet! 'But in the real world I leave all that business to him. And if we do go up then I'll be hoping that he keeps hold of me!' There is no danger of that not happening. Gibson has been a rock at the heart of the division's best defence – they have conceded 10 fewer than any rival – and will be part of Gareth Southgate's England squad for this summer's Euros in the Czech Republic. Perhaps, then, promotion and an impressive showing for his country will silence all accusations of nepotism. 'I don't mind people saying that I'm only here because of my uncle, it motivates me,' he said. 'You would think playing for England kills that talk anyway – because I don't think my uncle picks the England squad. 'But I'm used to it. I've had it all my life and it drives me on.' Were Gibson ever to let up, then his Boro-supporting pals would be onto him long before his uncle. They are even more anxious than he is as the tightest promotion race in Championship history nears its conclusion. 'My mates are stressing out more than me,' said Gibson. 'It's better for me because it's in my hands. After every game I come in and it' s like heart-attack material in our whatsapp group – it's incredible. 'But they believe in us and that's massive. They feel we deserve that promotion. 'And I think my uncle deserves it too. He's been amazing. His loyalty and what he has put in deserves reward with promotion back to the Premier League.' Given the ambition of his uncle, perhaps then Ben can aim to right the wrongs of his previous adventure in the Champions League.

"It's that time of year when football managers double as mathematicians. With points running out and prizes at a premium, they're praying the calculator tells them the dream is still alive. But for those at the top of a claustrophobic Championship, the maths is simple — win every game or risk missing out on a potential £120million payday. Two points separate four teams, with four games remaining. To drop points would almost certainly mean to drop out of the race for the two automatic slots to the Barclays Premier League.

Lee Tomlin (centre) fires Middlesbrough 1-0 ahead against Rotherham United in the Championship match . Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka (right) is targeting wins from all of his side's remaining fixtures this season . 'We have to win our games,' said the Spaniard. 'I think by winning four games we will get promotion, but it is very difficult. We have to forget the other teams and just concentrate on our games.' Wolves are seven points behind Boro but only outside the play-offs on goal difference after Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Midlands rivals Birmingham. And head coach Kenny Jackett admits they have played must-win games for a while. He said: 'It seems to have been that way for about three months, where we have been chasing. 'We have been working hard to make sure the sides at the top don't get away. It's good we're in this position. We want to be a Premier League club.'

Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe insists that his side are not getting carried away at the top of the table . The Championship leaders Bournemouth travel to Reading. And the message from Eddie Howe to his team is very much: 'Don't get ahead of yourselves'. 'With every win, we take it away from some of the teams that have been challenging all season, but I still think it is anyone's,' said Howe. 'We have to focus on every game, not get complacent, and remember that this league has a habit of throwing up surprises. We want to make sure that we stay strong until the end.' Norwich are the division's form team having won four on the spin and, ahead of their trip to Leeds, manager Alex Neil said: 'My job is simple. I said it before (Saturday's 2-1 win at Bolton) we had five left and we had to win every one. Now we have four it's the same.' Bolton Wanderers' Josh Vela (left) and Norwich City's Nathan Redmond (right) battle for the ball . Watford are the team sandwiched in third and they have the benefit of seeing how their rivals perform before they take on Nottingham Forest at the City Ground on Wednesday. The leading quartet could all guarantee their place in the play-offs at least with midweek victories. But for the chasing pack, four must go into two. Derby, Ipswich, Brentford and Wolves are within just one point of each other and must produce title-winning form between now and May 2 to be sure of post-season participation. Meanwhile, matters at the bottom of the table have been complicated after Rotherham were charged yesterday with fielding an ineligible player. Derby loanee Farrend Rawson played in their 1-0 win over Brighton on Easter Monday but there is confusion as to whether the defender had already been recalled. Rotherham are seven points above the drop zone and will nervously await the outcome of their FA hearing, especially if Millwall — with a game in hand — narrow that gap to four with victory over fellow strugglers Wigan. Elsewhere in the Football League this week, Bristol City will be Championship-bound with a win at Bradford City, while Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's Burton Albion side and Shrewsbury could leave League Two behind them if they triumph against Carlisle and Bury respectively — and other results go their way.

"Craig Gardner hailed a 'massive' win for West Brom at Crystal Palace on Saturday as the Baggies eased their relegation fears. The midfielder scored a spectacular strike as former Palace boss Tony Pulis enjoyed a 2-0 win on his first return to Selhurst Park. The Welshman left Palace on the eve of the new season and has since taken over at the Hawthorns - with three points in south London crucial having seen his side lose their last three in the Premier League. West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner celebrates having scored the second for Tony Pulis' side . But Gardner, whose trademark second-half goal added to James Morrison's early header, knows the job is still not yet complete even if West Brom now sit eight points clear of the bottom three. 'Yes, it's massive,' he said when asked about the importance of the victory. 'The gaffer has given us the target of 40 points and we will be disappointed if we don't hit that. 'We had two or three bad results on the spin and it's nice to get a win over the line after those. We were expecting what they brought with us and we dealt really well with it.' Gardner revealed the set-piece which led to Morrison heading home in the second minute came straight from the training ground as he now looks to add to his own tally for the season. 'It was a start that we worked on all week in training and it has worked perfectly,' he added. Gardner lets fly with this long range strike, which ended up doubling West Brom's lead at the Selhurst Park . Before two minutes on the clock, James Morrison (right) headed West Brom ahead following a corner . On the goal he scored, Gardner added: 'It was nice to catch one like that, over the years I've caught a couple of sweet ones and I usually get a couple in a season so I'm waiting for another one now.' For Palace, their fine run of form may have come to an abrupt end but Scott Dann, who was signed by Pulis in January 2014, insists the squad will dust themselves down and look to go again at home to relegation-threatened Hull next weekend. 'We've been on a great run,' he told Palace's official website. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher (right) celebrates with goalscorer James Morrison at Crystal Palace . 'We've come into the game high on confidence and we felt we were going to get the three points today. 'We conceded the early goal which was a big setback for us and we couldn't get back into the game but these things happen in the Premier League.

"When defenders who have not scored for two years find the net, Watford might begin to think this can be the year they return to the Premier League. Matthew Connolly has only been at the club for a month but struck a goal that proved key at a stadium that has humbled all three of their nearest promotion rivals.

Attendance: 20,723 . An automatic return to the top-flight for the first time since 2007 remains on. Watford entered this match knowing only a victory would do in their pursuit of automatic promotion. Bournemouth, Norwich and Middlesbrough all won on Tuesday night to maintain the pace at the head of this increasingly intriguing race for Premier League gold. Aware of the circumstances, Heurelho Gomes was alert from the off. Just 56 seconds were on the clock when the Brazilian goalkeeper stopped a certain goal. Chris Burke, found by Michail Antonio, drove a shot from close range but Gomes saved with his legs. Three minutes later, the visitors went ahead. Craig Cathcart flicked on Almen Adbi’s corner allowing Odion Ighalo to nod in at the far post. It was the Nigerian’s 20th Championship goal in a stellar debut season. The noise from the packed away section of 1,942 gave an impression of its significance. But this was never going to be one-way traffic. Forest have beaten Bournemouth and Boro here under Dougie Freedman, as well as Norwich when Stuart Pearce was in charge, and threatened repeatedly. In the 15th minute Antonio drew a fine save from Gomes with a strike from range, then Ben Osborn hit one that required all of the Watford No 1’s 6ft 3in frame to palm wide. By the end of the first half Gomes had made seven saves of varying quality. His most eye-catching stop came in the 39th minute when left-back Eric Lichaj caught a falling ball ever so sweetly on the volley.

Golascorer Connolly gets rid of any danger with an acrobatic clearance for the away side during the first half . Watford's remaining  fixtures: Birmingham (H), Brighton (A), Sheffield Wednesday (H) Watford’s attacking threat is pronounced, of course. Troy Deeney, who had 20 Championship goals before kick-off, partnered Ighalo up front. Slavisa Jokanovic was able to leave Matej Vydra on the bench. The Watford manager would have preferred any of that trio to have the chance that came Abdi’s way in the 23rd minute. Ighalo threaded a pass to set the Swiss international clean through but he almost had too much time to deliberate and only succeeded in poking his finish wide. The crowd let out a groan of disbelief. Abdi did better with a curling free-kick in the 34th minute but Karl Darlow was equal to it. The Forest goalkeeper did not do as well seven minutes later however, when Watford doubled their lead. Connolly strode forward from central defence and played in Ighalo, who was able to fire a shot to sting the palms of Darlow. As the ball fell loose Jack Hobbs’ presence seemed to make Darlow hesitate and Connolly snuck in to prod home his first goal since March 2013.

After the break, each side had a clear chance before Kelvin Wilson was sent off. In the 47th minute Darlow dived to claw round the post Ikechi Anya’s shot from Marco Motta’s cross. Three minutes later Burke should have done better than slice high and wide when found in the area by Antonio’s smart pull back from the byline. Wilson was sent for an early bath that he can stay in till next season by referee Paul Tierney on the hour mark. The Forest centre-back became embroiled in a row with Ighalo and appeared to kick out, sending the Watford striker to the floor. The three-match ban for violent conduct will end Wilson’s campaign.

Despite the deficit, Forest struck back 18 minute from time when Gary Gardner bent an expert free-kick from 25 yards in off the bar. Forest rallied further. Antonio was guilty of an astonishing miss five minutes from time, skewing wide from six yards after Gomes had saved from Gardner to leave the net unguarded. Two minutes later Watford made the win safe. Adlene Guedioura’s 30-yard screamer was punched out by Darlow but collected by Abdi, who rifled in to the bottom corner from the edge of the box.","Watford took the lead after just four minutes through Odion Ighalo .

"Manchester United took another step closer to securing a Champions League spot as they thumped rivals Manchester City at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon. Louis van Gaal's side now sit four points ahead of their neighbours and just one point adrift of Arsenal who currently occupy second place in the division. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... Manchester United (4-1-4-1) DAVID DE GEA 6.5 – More effective with his feet than his hands, coming out of his box time and again to clear. Will be disappointed to let in Aguero’s second. ANTONIO VALENCIA 6.5 – Kept City’s threat at bay down the right and even switched to the left at one point to stop Aguero setting up an almost certain goal. PHIL JONES 6 – Caught ball watching for the first goal and looked ponderous at times, but also made some crucial interception tackles . David De Gea  celebrates during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Manchester City . Phil Jones  in action with Jesus Navas  during the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday . CHRIS SMALLING 6.5 – Selected ahead of Marcos Rojo, made up for his needless red card in the Etihad derby earlier this season by scoring United’s fourth . DALEY BLIND 6 – Got forward well and was involved in two of United’s three goals but looked susceptible to the pace of Navas on defence . MICHAEL CARRICK 7 – His calming influence in midfield was so important for United again, and also produced several timely interceptions. Marouane Fellaini helps Manchester United take the lead at Old Trafford as Joe Hart looks on in anguish . JUAN MATA 7.5 – Two goals against Liverpool and now one against City, Mata finally looks as though he is settled as a United player and deserved his standing ovation. ANDER HERRERA 6 – More solid than the eye-catching performances of late, but played his part in maintaining United’s midfield dominance. MAROUANE FELLAINI 7.5 – A familiar story for United’s unlikely hero. City never really got to grips with his awkward presence and took his goal well. Wayne Rooney jumps on top of the Belgian goalkeeper as Manchester United celebrate at Old Trafford . ASHLEY YOUNG 8 – Quick reaction to score United’s first goal and provided the deliveries for another two for Fellaini and Smalling. Young’s remarkable renaissance under Louis van Gaal continues. WAYNE ROONEY 6.5 – Had less impact in a 4-1 win than you might have expected but still played a key role for the team and set up the third for Mata. Subs: Rafael, Rojo (for Jones 75, 6), Di Maria (for Mata 81, 5.5), Falcao (for Fellaini 83, 6), Januzaj, Valdes, McNair. Scorers: Young, Fellaini, Mata, Smalling . Booked: none . Spanish midfielder Juan Mata takes on fellow countryman Jesus Navas at Old Trafford on Sunday . Manchester City (4-4-1-1) JOE HART 5.5 – Will be unhappy that he allowed Fellaini’s header to creep past him at the near post but had little chance with the others. PABLO ZABALETA 5 – Caught out for United’s first goal and struggled to get forward as much as usual but set up Aguero’s second. VINCENT KOMPANY 5 – Cleared to play despite a hamstring problem but seemed to aggravate it in a rash lunge on Blind that could have been a red card. Subbed at half-time. Martin Demichelis and Joe Hart  celebrate as Sergio Aguero scores at Old Trafford . MARTIN DEMICHELIS 6 – Solid enough despite losing his centre-back partner at half-time and getting an arm in the face from Fellaini. GAEL CLICHY 5 – The Frenchman’s break from deep helped set up City’s opener, but it was his man who scored on both occasions as United surged into the lead. JESUS NAVAS 5 – Failed to beat De Gea with a great early opportunity and continues to lack a cutting edge despite his searing pace. Former Arsenal defender Gael Clichy slides in for the ball against Manchester United's Ashley Young . YAYA TOURE 6 – Great vision with some of his passing but the big Ivorian is still not imposing himself on games as much as he used to. FERNANDINHO 5.5 – Fantastic early challenge on Herrera but faded after that as United came back to take control of the game. JAMES MILNER 5.5 – Skied one attempt into the Stretford End like he was kicking at Twickenham. A frustrated figure when he was subbed after being fouled by Jones. DAVID SILVA 6 – Got the assist for City’s first goal but outshone by Mata and was booked for fouling his Spanish compatriot out of frustration. Manchester City defender Vincent was booked and subbed as they crashed to defeat at Old Trafford . SERGIO AGUERO 7 – Can’t argue with two goals in a derby game away from home but United were home and dry by the time the second went in. Subs: Fernando, Nasri (for Milner 63, 6), Dzeko, Kolarov, Caballero, Lampard (for Navas 74, 5.5), Mangala (for Kompany 46, 6). Scorer: Aguero 2 . Booked: Milner, Silva, Kompany .

"Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka declared that his players deserve to be in the Premier League after a surprise victory against Norwich moved them top of the Championship. Alex Tettey’s early own goal handed the Carrow Road visitors a slim victory and threw the title race wide open with just two points separating the top four after last night’s match. They could be overtaken on Saturday when Bournemouth, who relinquished first place, play their game in hand against Sheffield Wednesday and Watford, the fourth team with a strong chance, host Birmingham this afternoon.

Subs not used: Ripley, Whitehead, Reach, Nsue. Goal: Tettey 8 (OG) Booked: Clayton, Adomah . Referee: Robert Madley (West Yorkshire) Attendance: 26,993 . But Karanka insisted: ‘This last week for us has been amazing. We have won three games in six days, especially against Norwich when everyone thought they would beat us. ‘I’m proud of my players. Once again they showed when they play their best they can beat everyone. I told them after the game if there is a team who deserve to be in Premier League it’s them. ‘The last game on May 2 we’ll see which team will get promotion but I think it’ ll go to the last second.’ Tettey’s mistake could prove costly in one of the most exciting end-of-season run-ins after it ended a run of eight games unbeaten for his side. Karanka admitted before the match that if his side lost they would have been cut too far adrift from the front runners, but all remains to play for now. The strong away contingent had settled easily in Norwich’s Riverside entertainment park ahead of kick-off and their team comfortably matched them on the pitch, in unfamiliar surroundings away from their Riverside Stadium, in the opening exchanges. Twenty minutes after the game had started and the home side had barely got out of their own half while Middlesbrough carved out chance after chance. One of those, in the ninth minute, produced the opener. Middlesbrough had lost back-to-back away matches - against promotion rivals Bournemouth and Watford - for the first time this season before the match, so their lead was a surprise. So, too, was the look on Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy’s face when Adam Clayton sent in a corner from the left and his own midfielder Tettey headed the ball at the near post over him and into the far right of goal. It had been coming. Four minutes in and full-back Tomas Kalas burst on the overlap down the right to cross for Jelle Vossen whose header was deflected wide. Two minutes later Albert Adomah, again on their right flank, feinted a cross and turned back on himself before playing the ball to Patrick Bamford. His flick-on found Vossen again and his half-volley arrowed towards the top right corner but went just over. ‘The first 15 minutes cost us the game,’ Norwich manager Alex Neil admitted. ‘After that, we didn’t do enough to win the game. At this stage of the season it is about making a difference and we didn’t do that. ‘In terms of effort and endeavour I couldn't question them – they gave everything they had. It looks more likely that we are going to be involved in the play-offs so what we need to do now is dust ourselves off.’ Norwich midfielder Wes Hoolahan (left) tries to run past Boro's Adam Clayton during Friday's encounter .

Norwich striker Cameron Jerome (left) failed to add to his impressive goal tally during the match for the hosts . Tempers flared in the dying embers of the match as both sets of players got to grips with one another . Middlesbrough continued to dominate but with Norwich’s first chance of the game on 20 minutes they really should have been level. The foray forward saw Bradley Johnson head a ball into the box back across goal and Jonny Howson had a free header six yards out but failed to find the target. It was, however, the catalyst for the home side to get a foothold in the game and their pressure mounted from then on until the final whistle went after seven minutes of stoppage time. A fierce intensity gripped proceedings with the home side unable to capitalise on their growing possession. The sold-out stadium roared their team on and they even threw Ruddy up at the end for a series of corners. It peaked in the final few moments when, from one of those corners, Middlesbrough defender Ben Gibson threw himself in front of Russell Martin’s volley to prevent what would have been a certain goal. That block could be worth millions.

"Former Manchester City manager Sven Goran Eriksson delivered a damning verdict on his old club, claiming they should be winning the Premier League rather than battling to stay in the top four. City, whose current squad cost a total of £368million, host West Ham on Sunday but a Champions League spot next year is still in doubt with just four points separating them and fifth place Liverpool with six games to play. Eriksson, who was the last manager at City before the club was taken over by Abu Dhabi billionaire Sheikh Mansour and his family, said they have underperformed given their financial clout. Yaya Toure wore a snood in training on Thursday despite it being the hottest week of the year . City were beaten 4-2 by fierce rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford last weekend . ‘With the squad City have they should do better,’ he said, ‘I think they have the best players in the Premier League, so they should be the best team, but they are not. They are out of the Champions League again and it looks like they will not win the Premier League this year. Now they have to concentrate to finish in the top four. I don't know what is going wrong but with the money they have spent they have to do better. I suppose it is not good enough.’ Almost £1billion has been spent in an attempt to turn City into a major force in Europe since the Mansour family took over in 2008. They have twice won the Premier League title since then and are current champions. But they are out of Europe, lost in the FA Cup to Middlesborough and have lost their last two league games, a painful 4-2 derby defeat to Manchester United and a 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace. Eriksson, who is currently managing one of China’s top teams Shanghai SIPG, said the owners will expect silverware every season. Former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson (centre) managed City in the 2007-08 season . ‘For these rich clubs whose owners invest a huge amount of money, they expect to win every year, but only one team can win the title. It is difficult to tell whether the players or manager is at fault because they won the league last year with the same players. It is hard to know what has made the difference this year. But City have come a long way in the last ten years. The year before I was there they were almost relegated. Now they have success and the fans should be happy. But expectations are high, and it is the same at Chelsea. They want their team to win all the time.’","Ex-Manchester City manager Sven Goran Eriksson criticises former club .

"Spring. The season that brings with it 'the sweet smell of different flowers in odor and in hue'. William Shakespeare once wrote. Try telling that to apparent cold-blooded Manchester City stars Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero, Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala, who chose to pull on their woolies for April's blockbuster Manchester derby in front of an unforgiving Old Trafford crowd; unusually late for this time of year. Admittedly temperatures in the north west on Sunday afternoon were not exactly soaring - hitting between six and eight degrees Celsius by the time of the 4pm kick off - but was it enough to wear gloves while competing as a top athlete for 90 minutes? Probably not. Yaya Toure (left) was one of four players in the Manchester derby who chose to wear gloves at Old Trafford . After another below-par game Toure was described by Gary Neville as a 'weed' in Manchester City's garden . Glove-wearing Sergio Aguero opened the scoring on derby day . It was a far from blossoming performance for the visitors as well, and like autumn leaves City fell embarrassingly to their local rivals. After a less-than-warm welcome and despite springing first at Old Trafford following an early strike from Sergio Aguero, City lacked the killer edge to overcome their adversaries. This time of year is notorious for exposing a plague of unwanted weeds in the garden, and Gary Neville knew this all too well after the clash saw his former enemies lose for the fourth time in six Premier League matches. Eliaquim Mangala looked shaky again in the Manchester City defence but at least his hands stayed warm .

'You cannot carry passengers.' Goals from Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling made sure under-fire boss Manuel Pellegrini would be thinking about preparing his weed killer by the end of the night.

"Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make the midfielder available this summer. Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the Barclays Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian as they look to reshape their squad after a disappointing season. But Toure will fight for his City career this summer despite the club pondering his future. Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make him available this summer . Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the  Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian . He is said to be content with life at the Etihad Stadium despite the difficulties and is in no rush to leave. The Ivorian has played a major role during City's recent trophy-laden period, helping the club to two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and League Cup since joining from Barcelona in 2010. And the powerhouse midfielder still believes he can have a major impact for City in the future and remains fully committed to the cause. Another stumbling block towards a potential move is the four-time African Player of the Year winner's wages. Inter Milan, managed by Roberto Mancini, are interested but given his huge wages there are some doubts . Toure has more than two years left on his current £220,000-a-week deal and is unlikely to move for anything less. A number of clubs, such as Inter Milan, are interested in the 31-year-old, but given his huge salary there must be doubts over whether they would be able to afford it. Inter are prepared to offer Toure a five-year deal to compensate for the pay-cut he would be required to take if he moved to Italy — although, it remains to be seen whether he'd agree to such a compromise. There have been preliminary talks about a contract extension for Toure at City — which included the possibility of an ambassadorial role when he hangs up his boots. But it seems the club are now happy for him to leave. City, meanwhile, will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo to fund a move for Radamel Falcao, currently on loan at Manchester United. City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo this summer . Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a clause involving a permanent move to the Mestalla. Reports in Spain  suggested that Valencia are having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season, but City are adamant that the deal will go through as planned. The 29-year-old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the Etihad following a £20.6m move from Sevilla, but he has only found the net five times for Valencia. When he scored in Monday’s 3-0 win over Levante, the Spain striker refused to celebrate, fuelling speculation over his future at the club. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer but reports in Spain say they are looking at Radamel Falcao . Victory kept Valencia in fourth place in La Liga and on course to qualify for the Champions League, but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender Nicolas Otamendi. It has, however, not stopped Valencia being linked with a summer move for Falcao, who is set to leave United at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco. Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes has been acting as an advisor to Valencia owner Peter Lim and offloading Negredo is seen as one way of affording the Colombia star. City had scouts at Porto, watching their 3-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, with the home team’s Brazilian left-back Alex Sandro said to be the main focus of interest.

"Jurgen Klopp would be ideally suited for the Manchester City manager's job, according to former Germany international Dietmar Hamann. The 47-year-old announced on Wednesday he will be leaving Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season after seven successful years at the Bundesliga club. And there will undoubtedly be a number of leading European clubs interested in securing his services, including the defending Premier League champions. Jurgen Klopp announced his departure from Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday after seven years . Former Manchester City midfielder Dietmar Hamann believes Klopp would be the ideal fit as manager there . Manuel Pellegrini could be on his way out at Manchester City following a poor season . City are set to end the season trophyless and Manuel Pellegrini could be on his way out. Former City midfielder Hamann believes that Klopp has 'more right to take over the job than Pellegrini ever had.' He told talkSPORT: 'What Klopp has done at Dortmund is second to none. If there is a shortlist at City, he should be up there. 'He is very well respected, he is articulate, and he speaks very good English. He doesn't hold back - he says what he thinks. 'There are no guarantees with anyone but he deserves a shot at a top club in any country. 'He has got the fire, because he is a bit younger than Pellegrini, to make him aware of what is at stake every weekend. An emotional Klopp said he believed Dortmund needed a change of manager . Klopp has already been linked with a number of leading clubs around Europe, including City and Real Madrid . Klopp won the Bundesliga title twice during his seven years as Dortmund manager .

'He will be very good at getting players and people on board and that is why I think he would be a success. 'As I said, there are no guarantees anywhere, but I thnk he has got more right to take over Manchester City than Pellegrini ever had.' Klopp won two Bundesliga titles and the German Cup during his seven years at the Westfalenstadion, as well as taking them to the final of the Champions League in 2013. But he will step down in late June and seek a new challenge following a testing campaign in which Dortmund have flirted with relegation. They are currently 10th in the table having recovered their form but are 37 points behind rivals Bayern Munich. Klopp has also been touted as Carlo Ancelotti's replacement at Real Madrid, but Hamann, who also played for Bayern Munich, Newcastle United, Liverpool and Bolton, believes there is only one place he should go. He said: 'His style of management and his style of play would suit England a lot better than it would Italy and Spain. The emotion was clear to see as Klopp announced he was leaving the club at a Wednesday press conference . 'I don't think he is a manager for Real Madrid because most weekends he likes to wear his tracksuit, and I can't see a Real Madrid manager standing on the touchline wearing a tracksuit. 'Most big jobs in England are taken, so Man City might be the obvious move. I'd like to see him here.'","Klopp announced on Wednesday he will leave Dortmund in the summer .

"There is not a British manager working in the Premier League who is capable of guiding a team into the latter stages of the Champions League, according to Paul Scholes. There are no British teams in the quarter finals of the Champions League and Scholes does not believe there is a British manager who can turn those fortunes around. Scholes does however believe that his friend and former team-mate Ryan Giggs could lead Manchester United into the latter stages of Europe’s premier club competition if he is given the chance to succeed Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford further down the line. Paul Scholes hopes Ryan Giggs will go on and be one of the best manager's in the world once he has done his apprenticeship under Louis van Gaal . Writing in his Independent column, Scholes said: ‘I don’t think there is a British manager who is currently capable of restoring English clubs to the final stages of the Champions League, and winning the competition again. I hope that it will change in the future and I have high hopes that my friend Ryan Giggs will be handed the reins at Manchester United at some point having served an apprenticeship under Louis van Gaal.’ Scholes believes outgoing Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp would be a welcome addition to the Premier League – but does not believe he will replace Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City. Scholes believes outgoing Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp could end up in the Premier League . Bayern Munich's head coach Pep Guardiola could be heading Manchester City when his contract expires . The former Manchester United midfielder believes that Pep Guardiola will head to Etihad Stadium once his contract at Bayern Munich expires at the end of next season. He added: ‘There is no doubt in my mind that he [Klopp] would be a success in English football, the only question is at which club. Manchester City is the destination that has been mentioned more than once but all the information that comes back to me in Manchester is that Pep Guardiola will take that job when his contract at Bayern Munich expires in one year’s time. ‘While City have many good players, they have never gone beyond the second round of the Champions League, much less won it. Making them the best side in Europe would be a far more difficult task than doing the same at Barcelona or Bayern Munich, the latter of whom Guardiola took over after they won the Treble.’","Paul Scholes hopes Ryan Giggs will become the next top British manager after working with Louis van Gaal .

"A Craig Cathcart goal was enough to put Watford top of the Championship with just two games of the season remaining following a 1-0 win over Birmingham. The Hornets went into the game knowing a win would take them back into the automatic promotion places following Middlesbrough's victory at Norwich on Friday. They looked as though they would have to settle for second after Matt Ritchie put Bournemouth ahead against Sheffield Wednesday and on course for top spot, but Chris Maguire's stoppage-time penalty at the Goldsands Stadium denied the Cherries and left Watford on top of the pile. Craig Cathcart fired Watford into the lead with a stunning strike in the 56th minute . Birmingham goalkeeper Darren Randolph. is powerless to stop Cathcart's sublime effort . The decisive goal at Vicarage Road came in the 56th minute when substitute Ikechi Anya crossed from the left and Cathcart sent a fine volleyed finish into the top corner past goalkeeper Darren Randolph. Despite looking good in possession going forward, it took the Hornets almost 20 minutes to begin to open up the Birmingham defence. They were unfortunate not to take the lead, though, when a fine pass from Adlene Guedioura created the opportunity for Troy Deeney who was denied by a good save with his legs by Randolph. The ball then broke for Matej Vydra, whose follow-up was deflected up and onto the crossbar. Vydra and Guedioura threatened before the home side went close again when the ball was played into Almen Abdi and he spun superbly away from his man to shift the ball onto his left foot before curling a shot narrowly wide of the far post. Cathcart races away to celebrate his decisive goal for the Hornets . Watford continued to press for the breakthrough in the remainder of the first half but they were unable to seriously threaten again before the interval. But it was a double change from manager Slavisa Jokanovic in the 54th minute that was to prove the catalyst for his side taking the lead as he brought on Anya and Odion Ighalo for Miguel Layun and Vydra. Within two minutes, Anya had been released down the left by Deeney and the Scotland international's first-time cross into the near post was met by a superb effort over his right shoulder by Cathcart. Scotland forward Ikechi Anya made a huge contribution when he was introduced in the 54th minute . Having gone in front, Watford missed a great chance to double their lead a couple of minutes later when Almen Abdi's floated free-kick picked out the unmarked Gabriele Angella, but he headed over the top. Angella had another chance and on this occasion he did nothing wrong, meeting an Abdi corner with a downward header only to see it cleared off the goal-line. There was little else in the way of goalmouth action, with the drama instead coming on the south coast as Jokanovic's men were left with their destiny in their own hands.","Craig Cathcart stuck the only goal of the game in the 56th minute .

"It proved too much too soon for Paris Saint-Germain's David Luiz as the Brazilian was prematurely brought back from injury to replace countryman and captain Thiago Silva in the first half against Barcelona. What ensued was a night to forget for the former Chelsea man as he encountered ex-Liverpool ace Luis Suarez in an especially audacious mood for the Catalans, who take a 3-1 lead to the Nou Camp after the Uruguayan's deadly double. With his side already 1-0 down through the imposing combination of Lionel Messi and Neymar, the night went from bad to worse when Luiz pulled up his socks to take the pitch after 21 minutes.

"Manuel Pellegrini should be given the chance to turn things around at Manchester City next season, according to Gary Neville. The former Manchester United defender has been critical of Pellegrini's side in recent weeks as the reigning Premier League champions have seen their chances of retaining the crown slip following a dismal run of form and results. But, despite the Chilean being the favourite with many bookmakers to be the next managerial casualty and Jurgen Klopp available in the summer after announcing he is to leave Borussia Dortmund, it is understood City chiefs are not entertaining the idea of replacing Pellegrini at present. Manuel Pellegrini should be 'able to correct the things that have gone wrong', according to Gary Neville . And Neville, talking at a Budweiser Dream Goal event in Regent's Park, believes keeping faith in Pellegrini would bring some much-needed stability to the Etihad Stadium. 'I hope they don't change manager,' Neville said. 'I hope that Manuel Pellegrini stays at Man City and I hope he is able to correct the things that have gone wrong in the last four months. 'He used the term ""garbage"" in recent weeks when discussing City's form and four wins in 15 games for a club like Man City is not right and I hope he stays to correct the performances and can complete the job.' Manchester City were humiliated by rivals United on Sunday as they lost 4-2 at Old Trafford . A 4-2 derby defeat to United last weekend leaves City fourth in the table, with qualification for next season's Champions League not yet assured. Just six wins since the turn of the year has seen the club drop out of the FA Cup to Middlesbrough and come up short against Barcelona in Europe for the second season in succession. Neville feels some work on the side in the summer is required but reckons the type of wholesale changes being suggested may not be the way to go. 'I don't rule anything out - in football you don't make wild predictions,' he said when asked if the current City team will struggle to get back to their best. But Sky Sports pundit Neville  has backed Pellegrini and says only minor changes need to happen this summer . 'These players aren't finished, this team aren't finished. There needs to be some renovation to their house - the people there know that, they don't need me to tell them. 'I have spoken a lot about City over the past months. I have praised them over the last three or four years and rightly so. Some of the football I have seen them play in that time has been the best and their players have been outstanding. 'They have come to a time now where they have dropped below the standard they have set. They have set a standard I have watched, commentated on and been asked to speak about. I have enjoyed when I have watched them. But now, I'm not enjoying watching them.'

"Huddersfield coach Paul Anderson is hoping to kick-start his side's misfiring attack to match the efficiency of their defence as they look to start climbing back up the Super League ladder. The Giants have plummeted from third to ninth after losing all three games over the Easter holiday period but they go into Sunday's home game against Catalans Dragons with the best defensive record in the league. 'There's no hiding away from the fact we are a very good defensive team, we've just got to get our juices flowing offensively more than anything and we've put some things in place to try and make that happen,' said Anderson.

The Giants have plummeted from third to ninth after losing all three games over the Easter holiday period . 'We know what we're capable of and we know we can quite easily go on a decent run. We had a poor start and a poor week because the games have come thick and fast. 'We've had some issues with our offence all year and I've got to take responsibility for that, because that's my role at the club, it's my job to try and fix it. 'If we were getting beaten by 30 or 40 points we'd have some serious issues. We just need to make sure we find our groove with the ball as well as we have without it. 'If you look at the last three games we've lost, if we'd have got one more score in every game we'd probably have come out winners - those are the fine margins that we're dealing with at the minute.' A first win in four would enable Huddersfield to leapfrog their French visitors, who have won just one of five away games so far this year. Widnes are the only team yet to take a point from their travels but they will be aiming to capitalise on their impressive record at the Select Security Stadium against Castleford in Sunday's other league game. Anderson says there is no hiding when facing Catalans Dragons, who have the league's best defensive record . The Yorkshiremen can climb to a season-high fourth if they make it three wins in a row and Vikings coach Denis Betts is expecting a stern test from Daryl Powell's improving side. 'Castleford have a solid squad who all know their jobs,' Betts said. 'They work really hard for each other in defence and that allows them freedom to express themselves in attack.

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez has not ruled out the prospect of Antolin Alcaraz or Sylvain Distin earning new contracts but stressed they need to prove they can still be important figures in the club's future. Both centre-backs' current deals expire this summer and it seems highly unlikely Distin, who is 38 in December and has played more for the under-21s in the last month than he has the first team, will be retained. Alcaraz, 33 in July, has more of a chance of securing a short-term extension as Martinez looks to strengthen and restructure his defence in the summer. Roberto Martinez insists 37-year-old defender Sylvain Distin still has time to prove he deserves a new deal . Antolin Alcaraz, who joined Everton from Wigan where he played under Martinez, could get a new deal . While the Toffees boss is keen to advance the talents of younger players - Tyias Browning and Brendan Galloway the two most likely to benefit - he has not ruled out retaining existing senior players. 'There are only two players out of contract and we have two loan players (Aaron Lennon and Christian Atsu) and those decisions will be made when we have finished the season,' said Martinez. 'The next six games could have a massive bearing on that. Ninety minutes is a big opportunity to change people's views. 'All individuals will be judged over that period. In football it does not matter if you have a contract or not, you always need to improve and show the right attitude and show you are ready to be part of the future of the club. 'But when you get players at the end of their contract there are decisions to be made and it is not just the club, it is the player as well.' Roberto Martinez says his club's recruitment team have been searching for targets for six months . Distin has played more for Everton's youth team than the first XI in the past month, and could be on his way . Martinez said they have established a list of transfer targets for the summer and, while he would not confirm publicly, Aston Villa's on-loan Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley, out of contract at the end of the season, is believed to be one of them. 'The recruitment department has been working really hard over the last six months and we need to assemble a really strong squad,' Martinez said. 'First and foremost it is an opportunity for young players to show they are ready for big important roles for next campaign and everyone else providing strong competition to be important figures for the future. Tom Cleverley, who is on loan at Aston Villa, is a target, with Martinez having worked with him before . 'The dressing room is very strong as it is now, so we need to make sure whatever we do in the summer is to get us in a better place. 'We know the situation with Tom. He is a player that I know well having worked with him (in a previous loan spell at Wigan) - and that's it. 'Tom is a player that is at the moment fighting for something very important for his club and that deserves respect.

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits he would not be able to ease striker Romelu Lukaku through the remainder of the season even if he wanted to. The Belgium international is set to return from a four-week absence with a hamstring injury this weekend at home to Burnley. Considering the workload the 21-year-old has had over the last 10 months, taking in the World Cup in Brazil and then heading straight into a Premier League and European campaign, there may have been a temptation to let their top scorer have a more restful end to the season with the Toffees having nothing to play for. Roberto Martinez admits he would not be able to ease Romelu Lukaku (pictured) back in even if he wanted to . Everton striker Lukaku is set to return from a four-week absence with a hamstring injury this weekend . However, Martinez believes he would have a difficult time trying to convince him to take it easy, even if he was inclined to protect his striker from more injuries before the end of the campaign. 'I think it would be near-enough impossible to keep Rom away from the football pitch at this stage. It's not in his nature,' said the Spaniard. 'Someone like Rom needs to be on the football pitch. He is only 21 and I don't think there is any need for that at all. 'If I am completely honest I think he has been suffering a lot in the last seven to 10 days that he has been injured and away from the team. 'Rom belongs on the pitch, working for the team and scoring goals and becoming important and I don't think there is a strong case to rest him now. 'What we have to make sure is when he gets involved with Belgium in June he gets a proper break and he can recover and regenerate and get ready for next season.' Lukaku struggled to find his form in the first half of the season after the World Cup and he had only two goals to his name by mid-October. In 26 appearances up to and including January 1 he scored just seven times, but Martinez believes once he regained full sharpness there was a significant change. That is backed up by his statistics since January 1 as he has scored 11 in 16 matches. Martinez believes he would have a difficult time trying to convince striker Lukaku to take it easy . Everton manager Martinez pictured at the Liberty Stadium where his side drew 1-1 with Swansea City . 'I think there have been two clear different periods,' added Martinez. 'Coming back from the World Cup was a really tough moment from a physical point of view to get back to his best level. 'We worked really hard to get him back to the level and from the last week of December there was a real change for someone like him who relies on his physical capability. 'I thought he hit the best level and from that point on we have seen a completely different Romelu: someone who was in control of his movements and then the power and pace was very effective. 'He has always been a clinical goalscorer and I think his level has generally been quite impressive.' In four Europa League ties in the knockout stage Lukaku scored seven times, including a hat-trick against Young Boys in Switzerland. With 18 goals in total this season he is Everton's leading scorer by some considerable margin (Steven Naismith and Kevin Mirallas have nine apiece). Martinez believes Lukaku has shown he can shoulder the burden which comes with his £28million price tag.

'Last season he managed to play 20 full games, I expect him to play more than that this season and that will be an incredible step forward to grow and develop. 'Since January we have been delighted with his performances but I must admit since the start of the season I have been delighted with his attitude as he has taken responsibility and grown so quickly.

"Unbeaten Championship leaders Leigh delivered a stunning knockout blow as Super League club Salford crashed out of the Ladbrokes Challenge Cup. The Centurions twice came from behind in thrilling fashion to beat the Red Devils 22-18 in front of a 6,358 crowd at Leigh Sports Village and stretch their winning run to 21 matches. The build-up to the fifth-round tie was dominated by the selection by Leigh of former England forward Gareth Hock despite an agreement not to play against his old club, but he played little part in their downfall. Unbeaten Championship leaders Leigh delivered a stunning knockout blow as Super League club Salford crashed out of the Ladbrokes Challenge Cup . Hock, one of five ex-Salford players in the home line-up, spent just 25 minutes on the field in two spells and looked well short of match fitness. Instead it was left to former Wigan hooker Bob Beswick to orchestrate a magnificent display by Paul Rowley's men, who trailed 6-0 and 18-12 to their Super League visitors, who were badly hit by injuries and indebted to a superb performance from French half-back Theo Fages for keeping them in contention right to the end. The match was played amid a wonderful atmosphere and the ferocity was in evidence inside the first minute when Salford forward Cory Paterson was placed on report for a high and late tackle on Leigh full-back Gregg McNally. Fages opened the scoring after seven minutes when he dummied his way over for the first try and his half-back partner Michael Dobson kicked the conversion before hurting his knee in a collision four minutes later. Dobson attempted to play on but eventually succumbed to his injury and the Red Devils also lost centre Junior Sa'u with a wrist injury before half-time. With Paterson also limping, the visitors were rocked by the flair and determination of their Championship opponents, who scored two tries in four minutes to go 12-6 ahead. Beswick was the provider each time, a short pass getting veteran forward Tommy Goulden over from close range while McNally finished off his break from halfway, and Martyn Ridyard kicked both conversions. That was the signal for Hock to enter the fray but Salford turned the tables with two tries either side of the break from Niall Evalds to retake the lead. They drew level on 34 minutes when Fages broke clear to get the full-back over for his first try and got his over again three minutes into the second half courtesy of a neat reverse pass. Paterson kicked both goals to make it 18-12 and Leigh missed a glorious chance to level matters when centre Tom Armstrong got winger Liam Kay haring for the corner only for him to lose the ball in Fages' last-ditch tackle. Just when Salford seemed to be in control, the game took a new twist as Leigh stormed back in front. They were thrown a lifeline on 63 minutes when Salford winger Ben Jones-Bishop's careless pass was snapped up by Leigh half-back Ryan Brierley for a gift of a try. Ridyard's third goal tied the scores and the Centurions regained the lead three minutes later McNally fashioned a try for winger Johnathan Pownall. There was no shortage of action right to the end but Leigh, who pushed Leeds all the way in last year's quarter-final, hung on and just about deserved their famous victory.","Unbeaten Championship leaders Leigh beat Super League side Salford .

"Louis van Gaal said that is is a great time to be a Manchester United supporter after they crushed Manchester City 4-2 at Old Trafford on Sunday. United moved four points clear of their cross-city rivals in third place in the Premier League and now look set for a return to the Champions League. Van Gaal''s side had looked out of position all season with a string of unconvincing displays, but in recent weeks they have blown away Tottenham, Liverpool and now Manchester City. Louis van Gaal thanked Manchester United supporters for their patience after Sunday's derby win . United thrashed Manchester City 4-2 at Old Trafford to move four points clear of them in third place . The Dutch manager thanked supporters for their patience when results were going against the team at the start of the season. He said: 'I was very pleased because the fans are pleased and we are playing for them. The fans have not always had a good time because it started very bad. 'But still they were supporting, and now the results are coming back. It's great to be a supporter of Manchester United right now. 'We are four points ahead of the fourth place in the table and I am very happy for the fans because I have seen what it meant to them when the results were not so good.' The Dutch manager said that it is a great time to be a Manchester United supporter right now . Van Gaal was looking forward to toasting the biggest victory of his United career at his favourite Chinese restaurant in Manchester. 'I can go to Mr Wing's (restaurant) tonight, because you can do that when you win,' Van Gaal said. 'When you lose, the fans say what is Mr Louis doing because he loses and goes out to the best restaurant. This afternoon is maybe the best feeling (since coming to United). 'It was not the best performance, because we started very badly, but we regained our confidence, scored the goals and the second half was fantastic. 'At the start of the season it was not fantastic to be a United man and the fans still have supported us. Marouane Fellaini heads Manchester United in front during the first half having initially trailed . 'This week they can go on the streets, heads up and say: 'We are the better team because goal average (over the two derbies) is in our favour'.' Van Gaal called the victory a 'fantastic result' but criticised himself for leaving his side with 10 men following Michael Carrick's late injury. 'It is a fantastic result and I must bring Carrick off the pitch at 4-1 because he was injured. 'It was a little bit stupid of me because I want to give all my players minutes who are working very hard. 'Some of my players did not know we had 10 men because the crowd was yelling. 'Wayne (Rooney) did know because he was the holding midfielder as did Ashley Young, but the rest was difficult.' Van Gaal's side have now won their last four league matches - against Tottenham, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Manchester City - since being knocked out of the FA Cup to Arsenal and a top-four spot and Champions League qualification now looks within their grasp. Michael Carrick hobbles off late in the game on Sunday at Old Trafford after picking up an injury . 'We have made big steps in the last six games but the defeat to Arsenal was very difficult for my team to stand up and maintain our confidence in the philosophy,' Van Gaal said. 'But all credit to the players because they have to do it under the expectation of the fans. 'We started very badly and we were not the Manchester United we have seen in the last matches. 'I don't know why we were nervous but we could not get pressure on the ball in the beginning, but then we scored and from that moment there was more confidence in my team. 'We started to develop our pace and game plan and the second half was much better than the first half, and until the moment Michael goes off the pitch we were fantastic.'

"Manchester United thumped Manchester City 4-2 at Old Trafford on Sunday to move four points clear of their cross-town rivals. Louis van Gaal's men continued their excellent run of form and a Champions League spot looks all but assured now for them after their Manchester derby victory. Manchester City, meanwhile, have gone from joint top on New Year's Day to 12 points off the leaders and looking over their shoulders at the likes of Liverpool, Tottenham and Southampton. Here are five things we learned from the Manchester derby. UNITED NOW ON COURSE FOR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE . For much of the season United seemed to be in false position, with their performances hardly giving the impression they belonged in the top four. But now - whether by luck or design - something seems to have clicked for Louis van Gaal and United are now playing with a cutting edge and with confidence. A Champions League return now looks likely. Manchester United celebrated a 4-2 win over their closest rivals at Old Trafford on Sunday . CRISIS FOR CITY AND PELLEGRINI . City's results since going joint top of the Barclays Premier League on New Year's Day make abysmal reading for a side of their quality. Their run of four league wins in 12 games - during a period in which they also went out of two cup competitions - surely constitutes a crisis for a club with their expectations. The already considerable scrutiny on manager Manuel Pellegrini will increase another notch. Manuel Pellegrini is under increasing pressure after a woeful second half of the season for his team . FELLAINI CONTINUES TO HIT BACK . For much of his first season at United, Marouane Fellaini looked out of touch and possibly out of his depth. That has all changed in the last few months as he has become increasingly important to Van Gaal. The midfielder uses his strength to great effect as United continue to loft the ball forward to him and teams find him difficult to dispossess. Marouane Fellaini celebrates after heading Manchester United into the lead in the first half . Fellaini has been key in United's recent run of form to lift them into third place in the Premier League . CITY TEAM COMING TO END OF LINE . There can be little doubt that the City team, the core of which has won two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and a League Cup, is coming to the end of its lifespan. Reinvestment is clearly needed in the summer and, on this evidence, the back four would be a priority. Yaya Toure looks on dejected during Manchester City's thrashing at Old Trafford on Sunday . UNITED NEED TO IMPROVE DEFENSIVELY TOO . For all that United went on to dominate the game, City started superbly, reminding everyone of the quality they do still possess. They troubled United repeatedly at the back, where the central defensive partnership of Chris Smalling and Phil Jones again looked vulnerable.

"International stars like Brendon McCullum will visit to play T20 cricket this summer, but talk among homegrown players is of how it might save England from further embarrassment in global competitions. Alex Hales and Chris Woakes, two foot soldiers in the recent World Cup fiasco, both called for some rethinking of the domestic structure to avoid a repeat of what happened in Australia and New Zealand. At the launch of next month's opening of the Natwest T20 Blast Nottinghamshire's Hales admitted: 'As a team we're not hiding behind the fact that we're embarrassed about what happened. With the quality of the squad that we had there's no excuse not to make it out of the group stages.' Alex Hales believes England's players aren't competing in enough Twenty20 competitions . Hales was at Edgbaston on Thursday at the launch of this season's T20 domestic competition . Both he and Woakes feel that a way of improving England's one day cricket would be to adopt more the model of countries like Australia and India with their franchise systems. 'The Big Bash is fantastic, I've played in it for three years and really enjoyed it,' said Hales. 'I'm a big fan of the block system for T20, you dedicate three weeks to a month to hone your skills, all your focus if on T20. In the last couple of years in England I haven't had much of a chance to develop. 'Over here you play something different Sunday to Wednesday, then T20 on Friday so you don't get a huge chance to practice your skills. Over there they have less teams so the standard is fantastic. 'I think that's maybe where we got found out a bit in the World Cup, not many guys get exposed to T20. There's such a heavy schedule of Test matches guys don't get a chance to play domestic T20. Look at guys like Broady and Jimmy (Anderson), they don't get a chance to play for their counties. 'It doesn't help that a lot of our guys don't play in the IPL or the Big Bash. Other players are constantly playing in front of big crowds and improving their skills and that's not something we had in the World Cup. England were thoroughly embarrassed at the 50-over World Cup earlier this year, dumped out of their group . Brendon McCullum is adept at playing T20 all over the world and Hales wants more of that for English stars . 'It's tougher here with the indifferent weather and I don't really know what goes on behind the scenes, but in terms of standard and quality I think the franchise system would work in England.' At Thursday's Edgbaston launch there were players from all 18 counties, but that number would be cut down if the ECB and its new management ever get round to introducing a more city-based league. Woakes, who hopes to start bowling again in the next two weeks after recent foot problems, will play alongside McCullum for a Warwickshire team now styled as the Birmingham Bears. He believes the rebranding added to the support they received last season, and could so elsewhere if replicated: 'As a player you felt like there were more people behind you,' he said. 'It might attract more people to come to the ground from different areas of the city, they might feel more part of it. 'I'm sure if it happened it wouldn't feel right at first but I bet the Big Bash didn't feel right at first, everything moves forward and evolves. I think it would probably be a good thing. It would improve the standard of cricket, it might not feel right but eventually it would. 'It's a tricky one, you would have to get counties to merge. Some players might benefit and others wouldn't. Some people are going to be unhappy. I don't think counties would be shut down but if franchises are going to happen something has to give.' Advanced ticket sales are said to be up 41 per cent on last year ahead of the May 15 start with other overseas stars in action including Glenn Maxwell, Aaron Finch, Chris Gayle and Kumar Sangakarra.","England suffered humiliation in the 50-over World Cup this year .

"Yaya Toure's attacking gifts aren't enough to make up for his defensive deficiencies anymore, said Gary Neville in a scathing attack on the Ivorian following Manchester City's 4-2 derby loss to United. Manuel Pellegrini's City were poor for all but the opening 15 minutes against Louis van Gaal's side at Old Trafford and Neville, speaking on Sky Sports, is certain big changes are afoot for the club. 'It's a crossroads for them now,' Neville said as City drifted four points behind their third-placed cross-city rivals who are now one point off Arsenal in second. Yaya Toure's defensive lapses are costing Manchester City, claims Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville . Niall Quinn and Graeme Souness joined the chorus of criticism of the under-fire Ivorian . 'There is definitely going to be change at Manchester City, whether it's players, the manager, people above. Certainly some players. 'There are some weeds in the garden and you've got to get them out of the changing room pretty quick. You cannot carry passengers.' Neville singled out Toure as an example of the 'weeds' at the Etihad in a scathing attack. 'He does that much for the team in an attacking sense you live with maybe the consequences of that defensively,' he said. 'But when the balance tips to a point when going forward isn't quite as effective as it once was, you've got to do something different because the defensive side is poor. Neville predicts changes at Manchester City and says the club need to get rid of 'weeds in the garden' 'If I was a player in that dressing room looking at him in central midfield thinking you're not chasing back, you're not running around, you're not sprinting for the ball. There might be a physical problem that he cannot do it, let alone if he doesn't want to do it. I think there's definitely going to be some changes.' Graeme Souness, also on Sky Sports, even suggested the 31-year-old's work when his side doesn't have the ball is a factor in their disappointing Champions League results in recent years. Neville accused Toure of a 'complete dereliction of (his) duty' when marking Marouane Fellaini and blamed his lack of tracking back for United's third goal from Juan Mata. City players' heads drop after conceding the fourth goal on Sunday their their cross-city rivals . 'He cannot play in a two in midfield against an opposition of any quality,' said Neville on Sky Sports. 'Against maybe one of the lesser teams at home you can put him in there and play with two up top, but against any team of quality you've got to shift him out of that position in the centre of midfield. 'There are too many examples, too much evidence when watching him where he cannot do his job, simple as that. As a central midfield player in the big matches he just cannot do it.' Souness said Toure's become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young celebrate after the winger's cross found the tall Belgian for 2-1 . 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why they've not done as well as they should have done in Europe.' Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher pointed the finger at the City chiefs for allowing the team to get into their current state and said the fallen champions are 'gone'. The former Liverpool defender told talkSPORT: 'They’ve been a great team, but that team needs breaking up and changing. The criticism I have is for the people at the top, to have that much money and to allow yourself to get into a situation where you might need five or six players to go straight into the team. 'You look at the age of the team and it’s too old, so you need a lot of new blood. It’s going to take a lot of money. 'It’s gone for them now, physically, mentally, every part of the game. They’ve been a great team and we should applaud what they’ve achieved over the past three or four years, but it’s the end for this team now. It’s got to be broken up.' Niall Quinn, also on Sky Sports, said bluntly: 'Manchester City lost out today because he was all at sea and didn't do his defensive duties.' Toure also came in for criticism on Match of the Day 2 for his lack of leadership after he took the captain's armband at half-time. Trevor Sinclair said: 'He keeps on getting caught in no-mans land, he's not really at it, clipping the heels, and he's literally going through the motions. Trevor Sinclair and Phil Neville were both critical of City and Toure on Match of the Day 2 . 'Fellaini has completely outshone him today. He is outnumbered and I'm sure he's frustrated but again he's just going through the motions.' Picking out on particular aerial duel, which Toure lost, Sinclair said: 'This is nothing to do with ability, that's to do with desire and wanting to take one for the team.' Sinclair also felt Toure was at fault for Chris Smalling's goal, United's fourth. 'He's got to organise this better,' he said. 'If you're captain of the team you've got to keep that high line, dictate and tell the lads to get in positions and win the ball. They were queuing up on the far stick.' Phil Neville said: 'The minute they concede a goal and their backs are against the wall, they crumble. They lost their shape, they lost their discipline, they were all over the place. 'There was nobody in there today that said ""right, we're going to get two banks of four, hard to beat and actually try to grind out a result"".'","Manchester City lost 4-2 to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday .

"Andrew Flintoff fears Kevin Pietersen is 'running out of time' to resurrect his England career. Flintoff, speaking at the England and Wales Cricket Board's NatWest T20 launch, sees a bright summer and lasting future ahead for 'probably the premier tournament' in this country. The dual Ashes-winning all-rounder is less convinced, however, about Pietersen's prospects of forcing his way back into Test contention. Kevin Pietersen scored 170 for Surrey in The Parks as he bids to earn a recall to the England squad . Former England star Andrew Flintoff thiks time is running out for Pietersen to resurrect his England career . Pietersen already has three Ashes series wins on his CV but will be 35 before the 2015 edition begins, and Flintoff senses he no longer has age on his side. The controversial record-breaking batsman has been surplus to requirements since being sacked 14 months ago after Alastair Cook's team were whitewashed 5-0 in Australia, but has taken heart from incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves' hints that there may be a way back after all. Pietersen and his agent have both spoken of the 'clean slate' being presented to him, and he began restating his case by hitting 170 against MCCU Oxford in his first red-ball innings for Surrey since June 2013. Flintoff is concerned nonetheless that there is simply no vacancy for Pietersen. 'He's a fantastic player, but nobody just walks into any team - especially the England team, 'I'm back, I'm here, I'm playing',' Flintoff told Press Association Sport. England have won their last three Tests under Cook, pre-dating a miserable World Cup, and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the West Indies. Pietersen has not featured for England since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . It is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside, on current form. 'Which of them do you say ""you're not playing!"" for Kevin to come in?' Flintoff said. 'I just think Kevin is running out of time a little bit. 'If he'd started the season last year with Surrey, and scored run after run and put himself in the position... whereas now I think he's looking at the Ashes and he's just running out of time. 'That's not to say he (definitely) won't feature, but I can't imagine it's going to be in the near future.' Flintoff is optimistic about England's fortunes, despite their winter woes, with or without Pietersen. 'Alastair Cook is so important, and you get the sense everyone within the England set-up wants him as captain,' he said. 'He's a popular lad, and a great player. 'Peter Moores, there aren't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke.' The former England star is hoping to win back his Test place with a return to red ball cricket . England, Flintoff believes, just need a little more support. 'I think sometimes as a pundit, ex-player, you forget how difficult it can be,' he added. 'In Australia, you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants Australia to do well. 'With England, I've never had a sense of that. 'It's about time we started talking them up. I think it's time we started supporting the side, getting behind Cook, Moores, the players. 'It's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who hasn't moved his feet. (I think) maybe we should be a bit better than that, and start celebrating the lads a bit.' He is enthusiastic too about this summer's T20 Blast, insisting it is no poor relation of the Indian Premier League - or the Big Bash, in which he played last winter for Brisbane Heat. Flintoff says Alastair Cook is so important to England despite poor showing in the first Test against West indies . Flintoff said: 'The competition gets stronger. It's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now, with the crowds and excitement behind it. 'We're seeing that, with some of the players coming over - the world's best, Chris Gayle, Brendon McCullum, (Glenn) Maxwell, (Aaron) Finch. 'I played in the Big Bash, and the standard was high (but) this stands up as a competition. 'You turn up at Old Trafford for Lancashire-Yorkshire, and get 25,000 people, then to Chelmsford where they're playing in front of packed houses - so I don't subscribe to that. 'Anything in this country, we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there. 'We don't really focus on what we've got. Flintoff shares a joke with players at the Natwest T20 Blast launch at Edgbaston on Thursday . 'I didn't see anything within the Big Bash and thought 'this is far better than what we've got at home'.' Whether at 37 he will be a part of the Blast again, after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping Lancashire to win the tournament last summer, is another matter. 'I'm not arrogant enough to think I can just walk into the Lancashire dressing-room and say 'I'm back, I'm playing',' he added. 'The one reason I wanted to play (last year) is because I love it and I never want to look back at my life, when I'm older, and think 'I wish I'd done that'. 'I don't see failing as a problem. But I see not having a go as a crime. 'So I thought ""I'm going to have a go"", and I certainly loved it.'","Kevin Pietersen was sacked by England 14 months ago after Ashes defeat .

"Andrew Flintoff has called on the English cricketing public to show their love for the NatWest Twenty20 Blast - and under-pressure Test captain Alastair Cook. The Blast's stock is at a new high, in its second year and 12th for the Twenty20 domestic format, with the England and Wales Cricket Board announcing much-improved advance ticket sales and a clutch of overseas superstars such as Brendon McCullum set to take part. Cook, however, is at a much lower ebb as his quest for a long overdue Test century - to add to his record 25 - brought him two more failures at the top of the order in the opening match of England's series in the West Indies. Andrew Flintoff shares a joke with Warwickshire and England's Chris Woakes at the T20 Blast launch . Under-pressure England captain Alastair Cook walks out to bat during the first Test in Antigua this week . He nonetheless has a supporter in former England team-mate and fellow 2009 Ashes-winner Flintoff. 'I get fed up of people having a go at Alastair Cook,' the all-rounder told Sky Sports News, as he helped to launch this year's Blast competition - back at Edgbaston where he came within one more big hit of winning last year's final with Lancashire. 'I was captain when Alastair came into the side. 'I got a lot of things wrong as England captain, but the one thing I got right was picking Alastair Cook. 'He's one of England's finest ever players. If you have a career spanning more than 100 Test matches, there are going to be blips along the way. 'But Alastair ... will get through this. I'd like to see people outside the England team backing the lad. 'It's nice some time when you get a bit of loving from people, and I think that's the only thing that's missing with Alastair at the minute.' Flintoff has thrown his weight behind his former teammate Cook with the West Indies series ongoing . Woakes and Hampshire's James Vince (right centre) look in high spirits at Edgbaston . Flintoff wants to spread the love too for a tournament he hopes will become an institution in British sport. 'You've seen the success of Twenty20 cricket around the world, and the appetite for it in England is no different,' he added. 'I went to watch Lancashire v Yorkshire last year - 25,000 people (were there). I was fortunate enough to play in finals day at Edgbaston - a terrific night, even though we lost. 'You find a new audience with the NatWest Blast - an introduction to cricket. 'With some of the overseas signings coming over this year, and the English players, there's a lot to be excited about.' There was a player for all 18 counties present at the launch on Thursday . At 37, Flintoff is still unsure whether he will be playing again - having made a comeback in 2014, five years after his retirement. He does have a view on the future of his ex-England colleague Kevin Pietersen, though. After his sacking last year, 34-year-old Pietersen is hoping a welter of first-class runs for Surrey can pave his way back to Test cricket this Ashes summer. Flintoff said: 'He wants to play Test cricket again, but he's going to have to state his case. 'You can't just walk into a side - there are lads, especially in the batting order, in possession of places and performing.'","NatWest Twenty20 Blast launched at Edgbaston on Thursday .

"Michael Vaughan has been heavily linked with the newly created role of Director of England cricket – and for captain Alastair Cook the move cannot come soon enough if it gets him out of the commentary box. Vaughan is currently in the West Indies working as part of the BBC's commentary team but has made no secret in his desire to replace Paul Downton in the top job in English cricket. But in his role as a commentator for Test Match Special the former England skipper put the ultimate curse on Cook by praising him moments before he lost his wicket in the second innings. Alastair Cook walks off after being dismissed by Jerome Taylor . Cook  kicks out in frustration after being dismissed for 13 caught by Sulieman Benn . Michael Vaughan praised Cook in the commentary box moments before he was dismissed . Cook has struggled with the bat over the last year and lost the One Day captaincy at the end of last year. The England captain scored 11 in the first innings but was looking better in the seconding innings which lead Vaughan praise him in the commentary box. He said: 'I know it is early and I know they will say it is commentator's curse, but I am watching his (Cook's) movement. And the movement is so much better than last year. You watch his right foot, he goes back with his left foot now...' But before Vaughan could finish his sentence Cook was tempted to follow a Jerome Taylor delivery outside off stump and squirted a waist-high catch to gully for 13. Despite being the favourite for the director of cricket job, Vaughan is seeking more clarity over the role. Speaking earlier this week, he said: 'I think the role needs to be defined, what exactly it is and what the team require. I don't think anyone can say whether they are interested or not until then. 'All I've said is I'd like to know what that role is, as Andrew Strauss has said, and Alec Stewart. All of us would be ¬interested if the role was right. So it's just a case of waiting to see.' But despite an Ashes summer on the horizon, Vaughan added: 'I don't think the ECB have to panic. They have to take their time. 'We have a big summer coming up, but this is about the future of England cricket.'","Michael Vaughan said Alastair Cook's movement had improved since last year .

"Alastair Cook must somehow shut out the deafening noise enveloping English cricket  and concentrate on what has become one of the most important Test series of his career. Defeat against West Indies in a three-Test battle that begins here on Monday is simply unthinkable for an England captain who is desperate to avoid being distracted by the seismic changes going on all around him. There has been so much happening, from the demise of Paul Downton, to speculation surrounding the new director of cricket and the ever-present spectre of Kevin Pietersen, that the imminent first Test has barely registered. Alastair Cook in the nets ahead of the first Test in the West Indies of a vitally important series for his career . Cook and his England team-mates share a few words in practice ahead of the first Test on Monday . West Indies (probable): K Braithwaite, Smith, Samuels, Chanderpaul, Darren Bravo, Blackwood, Ramdin (captain and wkt), Holder, Benn, Taylor, Roach. England (probable): Cook (captain), Trott, Ballance, Bell, Root, Stokes, Buttler (wkt), Jordan, Broad, Tredwell, Anderson. Umpires: Steve Davis (Australia) and Billy Bowden (New Zealand). TV umpire: Bruce Oxenford (Australia). Match referee: Andy Pycroft (Zimbabwe). TV and RADIO: LIVE Sky Sports 2 (from 2.30pm) and BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra (from 2.45pm). Chance of showers on all five days and strong cross-wind throughout which will affect bowling and make reverse swing crucial. 26°C . Yet Cook knows that he, and coach Peter Moores, can afford no slip-ups in what should be the least taxing assignment of England’s ridiculous schedule of 17 Tests in the next nine months. In less chaotic times Jimmy Anderson’s 100th Test appearance and his chances of securing the four victims he needs to overtake Sir Ian Botham and become England’s leading Test wicket-taker would dominate the agenda. Equally, the return of Jonathan Trott, who looks set to open with Cook, 18 months after he left England’s Ashes tour in a state of turmoil is a significant development that has virtually passed under the radar. Instead all eyes are on the duo whose futures are in the balance with an arch-critic of both, Michael Vaughan, favourite to become supremo even though he has played down his links to the job. Cook has seemed relaxed in his first week in the Caribbean and looked in good touch while scoring a hundred against St Kitts with the slightly altered stance he has been working on with Graham Gooch. Cook (left) and coach Peter Moores (right) know they can't afford any slip-ups in the Caribbean this month . Cook has slightly altered his batting stance after working with Graham Gooch in his enforced off-season . He made three half centuries in his last four Test innings against India last summer while leading England to three successive victories, yet the disaster of a World Cup that went on without him has heaped pressure back on his side. That pressure can only have been increased by the somehow inevitable news that Pietersen had smashed a huge century on his return to the domestic game with Surrey yesterday, albeit against the students of Oxford University. England, both publicly and privately, still insist that nothing has changed regarding Pietersen and there seemed a genuine indifference from Cook when asked about the sacked maverick for the umpteenth time on Sunday. Kevin Pietersen hit 170 off 149 balls against Oxford MCCU as he put on a show for Surrey . James Anderson (left) will make his 100th Test appearance as Cook looks to get the tour off to winning ways . ‘I’m pleased he scored runs for Surrey but it is exactly what I said before we came here,’ said Cook. ‘It’s for other people to make any decision regarding him.’ The difference now, of course, is that the two men most responsible for jettisoning Pietersen after the Ashes have gone, Downton having been sacked and former ECB chairman Giles Clarke now marginalised as the new president. It was Downton who put so much faith in Cook to lead a new England era that the captain still believes is full of promise. ‘It’s sad when anyone gets fired,’ said Cook. ‘It’s not a nice feeling in any walk of life. Paul is a good man and I feel for him but as players and staff we have to concentrate on the next three weeks.’ Jonathan Trott has returned to the Test side . Equally, Cook did not want to think about the implications of what will happen when the new men at the helm in chairman elect Colin Graves and new chief executive Tom Harrison continue their revolution of the English game. ‘I have absolutely no idea,’ said Cook when asked about the new director of cricket. ‘I’m probably reading less about it than anyone. That’s how it should be. The day before a Test the captain should be worrying about what’s important to him. ‘That’s making sure we’re ready to try to win a series against West Indies.’ A glance at the West Indies net session yesterday was an exercise in trying to put faces to names that are little known in the wider cricket world. This is an inexperienced home team and one that England really should defeat easily. Yet the pitches will be slow and turgid, making it difficult for either side to take 20 wickets and West Indies can clearly sense that England must be vulnerable. ‘We had a function the other night and it was made quite clear to us that West Indies are here to fight and want to beat us 3-0,’ said Cook. ‘They kept on calling it a war so we know we’re in for a hell of a battle.’ One thing that has become clear under the new regime is that the ECB want to try to involve the many good brains of former captains, with Nasser Hussain due to talk to the team last night and Mike Atherton due to make a presentation to Anderson today ahead of his landmark Test. For now what comes next for England has to be pushed to one side. For Cook is facing a Test series he has to win.","It has been an eventful few days since England arrived in the Carribbean .

"Sir Vivian Richards believes James Anderson will be remembered as an England great and a worthy heir to Sir Ian Botham. Anderson will earn his 100th Test cap on Monday when England take on the West Indies at the Antiguan ground that bears Richards' name. Four wickets in the game would take him past Botham's national record of 383 Test wickets, making Anderson the most prolific English bowler in history. England's James Anderson plays his 100th Test match in Antigua against the West Indies from Monday . Anderson needs just three wickets to go level with Sir Ian Botham as England's top Test wicket taker . Sir Vivian Richards believes Anderson is a worthy heir to Sir Ian Botham (pictured in August 2014) As one of the greatest batsmen to have lived and a long-time friend of Botham, Richards is well placed to judge the scale of Anderson's achievements and his endorsement is ringing. 'He ranks with the great English fast bowlers, with the Bob Willises, the Ian Bothams and folks like that,' said Richards. 'They made a great mark and for him to be in that category, it's a tribute to him. 'He's done magnificently well. Anderson has got tremendous ability and I guess where he's at now - four wickets away from surpassing the great Sir Ian - is a tribute to the individual and to his professionalism as leader of the bowling attack. 'I captained a lot of great bowlers and I would have liked Anderson too.' Anderson has attempted to divert the attention ahead of his big day, focusing on the team's efforts to come back from a dreadful winter of white ball cricket. Four wickets in the game would take Anderson past Botham's national record of 383 Test wickets . Richards is well placed to judge the scale of Anderson's achievements and his endorsement is ringing . But with Richards' words echoed by Curtly Ambrose, one of the most fearsome fast bowlers to have graced the game, he would be forgiven for getting a touch carried away. Ambrose, speaking at the launch of his new autobiography 'Time to Talk', said: 'I've always liked James Anderson, he is a quality fast bowler. 'To have taken so many wickets in Test cricket is no mean feat because a fast bowler's life is a short one. To be four wickets away from Botham's 383 is a phenomenal achievement. 'I want to wish James all the best for his 100th Test but I hope he doesn't do too well, because I think the West Indies will win.'","James Anderson will earn his 100th Test cap on Monday .

"Manuel Pellegrini accepted the blame on Sunday night for the emphatic Manchester derby defeat that has plunged his job into even greater jeopardy. Manchester United heaped more pressure on the beleaguered City boss with a 4-2 win at Old Trafford, lifting them four points clear of their rivals in the race for a Champions League place. City capitulated after taking an early lead through Sergio Aguero, and Pellegrini said: ‘I always think it is my responsibility, always. I think it was a clear result for Manchester United. Manuel Pellegrini watches from the touchline as Manchester City lose 4-2 to United at Old Trafford . Manchester City players show their dejection at the derby defeat on Sunday afternoon . ‘But I am not talking about my position – it is not important.’ The Premier League champions have lost six of their last eight games in all competitions, and a team that were joint top on New Year’s Day are now fighting to finish in the top-four. City sources maintain that Pellegrini is unlikely to be axed before the end of the season. But Patrick Vieira has impressed in his work with the club’s elite development squad and is believed to be willing to step in as interim manager until the end of the season if Pellegrini goes. Vieira is in charge of City’s Under-21 development squad and is being groomed to become the manager at the Etihad in the future. Pellegrini admitted that the spirit within his squad is a concern as he tries to arrest the slump. City are five points ahead of fifth-placed Southampton ahead of next Sunday’s game at home to West Ham. Patrick Vieira looks on during a Manchester City UEFA Youth League match against Schalke in February . Manchester United players celebrate as Chris Smalling (centre) scores their fourth goal of the afternoon . ‘Maybe it is something we can be concerned (about),’ he added. ‘The spirit of the team does not seem the real spirit but we must try to continue playing the way we did for the first 20 minutes. ‘It is the same team. We must improve and I hope when we win again the team will recover their trust. ‘We are concerned to try and win the next game. We have to play six games more. We were the whole year in the first or second position. ‘United and Arsenal have to play against Chelsea. We have 18 points more to play so we must not try make it a dramatic moment. We now have two games at home, we must try to recover from this defeat.’ United’s win in front of their jubilant supporters ended a run of four successive Manchester derby defeats. Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling gave Louis van Gaal’s team an unassailable lead before Aguero got his second goal late on. Sergio Aguero walks off the pitch after the final whistle is blown at Old Trafford . Van Gaal claimed that United’s 4-3 advantage on aggregate in this season’s two derbies with City means that they can consider themselves to be the top team in Manchester. He said: ‘It’s great to be a supporter of Man United right now. ‘You are playing for the fans and at the start of the season it was not fantastic to be a United fan. We had 11 matches and 13 points and still they supported us. This week they can go on the streets, head up and say “we are the better team because goal average is in our favour”. ‘We are now four points ahead of City in third place which is very important because it gets you automatic qualification into the Champions League. We started badly, there was a lot of stress building up and because of that we went 1-0 behind. But we have good team spirit and came back. The second half was fantastic. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal (right) celebrates victory with Ander Herrera at full-time . ‘But we have still six matches to go and that can be changed again so we can enjoy ourselves today and tomorrow maybe. Tuesday is a day off but then we have to prepare for a match against Chelsea away. ‘The goal we set was to get into the top four and I’ll be very pleased if we reach that goal.

"Manchester City are planning to table a mega-bid for Raheem Sterling on the day the transfer window reopens. The reigning Barclays Premier League champions have made the Liverpool forward a primary target this summer as they look to increase their homegrown quota. And the club plan to make a major statement by making a formal offer for the forward at the earliest possible opportunity this summer. Man City are planning a mega-bid to sign Liverpool star Raheem Sterling when the transfer window reopens . Sterling, pictured against Newcastle on Monday night, is a primary target for Manchester City this summer . The transfer window officially opens on July 1, but deals can be discussed between clubs prior to that date. City believe they are leading the race to land Sterling this summer and are confident they can complete what would be one of the biggest transfers this summer. Liverpool value Sterling at around £50million, a fee that City can certain afford. But City will have to be cute in their attempts to land Sterling given the threat of Financial Fair Play sanctions. They may look to use other players as bait, but Liverpool are likely to demand a straight cash fee.

"Daley Blind has hailed a pre-match team talk from skipper Wayne Rooney about ending their run of four successive losses against City with giving the United players an extra edge on Sunday. 'It was a thing what was always in our minds. It was going through the team. Everyone knew how important this game was, not only because it's a rat race in the last games, but also because of the history of the last four games,' he said. 'Wayne Rooney mentioned that in the dressing room before the game to all the players and it is something that you have in mind when you go on to the pitch. You saw how everyone was fighting for each other. Daley Blind played his part in Manchester United's 4-2 derby win over City on Sunday . Wayne Rooney's team talk inspired United to end a run of four defeats by their local rivals . 'Maybe after the first five minutes we were a bit like, 'What is happening here?' but after that we picked it up again and we did very well. And with the crowd behind us, it was amazing.' The Holland international also warned that Manchester United need to focus on the end of this season rather than thinking about challenging for the title next year. The 25-year-old Dutchman, who has played a significant role in United's run of six consecutive wins, accepted rivals would have taken note of the 4-2 derby win. He insisted, however, that although United could win the title next year, they had to focus on securing a Champions League place - starting against Chelsea on Saturday. City captain Vincent Kompany was fortunate not to be sent off for a reckless challenge on Blind . Blind and Ashley Young celebrate after coming back from behind against their 'noisy neighbours' Blind said: 'I think Manchester United is always a club that is fighting for the title. 'Of course other teams are watching us, but we have to watch ourselves this season, our own games, focus on that and then we will see where it ends . 'We don't have to watch for Chelsea. We have to watch for our own games, we have to look at ourselves. Every game is a final to the end and we have to believe in ourselves.'

"Only after the fourth goal had been scored, only after this derby demolition had been completed, did Louis van Gaal turn to the most expensive player in English football and the player who commands the highest wages. Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao were little more than fresh legs here on Sunday, and any success Van Gaal has enjoyed in his first season at Old Trafford needs to be measured against the difficulties two phenomenally talented players have endured. But it also a measure of the qualities the Dutchman possesses that players with only a fraction of their ability are not just keeping them out of the side, but are performing as well as this. Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao were left on the bench by Louis van Gaal on Sunday . Argentine £60m man Di Maria came on for Juan Mata in the 81st minute at Old Trafford . Falcao replaced Belgian Marouane Fellaini with seven minutes to play in the win over Manchester City . A sixth successive Premier League victory that cements United in third place owes much to the revival of Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata and the progress being made by Chris Smalling and Phil Jones. David Moyes once said Smalling and Jones were good enough to become England’s central defensive pairing and Roy Hodgson, a spectator here on Sunday, is sure to be encouraged by their rate of development. In Young, Fellaini and Mata the transformation has been most startling, however, and credit has to go to Van Gaal for the way he has managed three players who were so central to the downfall of Moyes 12 months ago. In fairness to Fellaini, and indeed Moyes, the Belgian just needed time to make the transition from Everton to United. In fairness to Mata, he probably needed time, too, after being ejected from Chelsea by Jose Mourinho. Ashley Young celebrates after bringing Manchester United level having earlier trailed . But Young is a triumph for the style of leadership Van Gaal has long been recognised for: his ability to work with players on a personal basis as well as part of a collective. Even Van Gaal’s critics recognise the skills that also made him a fine schoolteacher when he was supplementing his income as a poorly paid player in Holland with a career in education. He is clearly very good at restoring confidence and inspiring an individual, with Young finally looking like the player Martin O’Neill used to admire so much. Young, one of five Englishmen in United’s outfield 10, was the outstanding player in this hugely entertaining contest, scoring the equaliser that quickly cancelled out Sergio Aguero’s opener, as well as providing the assists for Fellaini and Smalling, but more to the point, responding most effectively to what, presumably, were his manager’s instructions. Fellaini headed in at the far post to give Manchester United the lead and continue his fine recent form . Mata slots under Joe Hart to extend Manchester United's lead to 3-1 early in the second half . Van Gaal would have seen how vulnerable City were to the aerial threat posed by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Monday and it was Young who delivered the crosses that enabled United’s tallest players to punish them again, on both occasions with headers. Exactly why the issue had not been addressed by Manuel Pellegrini is anybody’s guess. But if this game highlighted the skills of Van Gaal, it also illustrated where City’s beleaguered manager has fallen short this season. While United are in the ascendancy, Pellegrini has overseen a period of decline for a stuttering City side. While United are now celebrating the renaissance of players like Young, Pellegrini faces the question of what on earth has happened to a side who were so superior to United a year ago. Chris Smalling headed in a free-kick to score Manchester United's fourth goal in the derby . England manager Roy Hodgson watched the Manchester derby from the stands at Old Trafford . 5 - Games lost by City in 2015, one more than the whole of 2014. 13 - City's position in the Premier League form table after losing four and winning two of his last six. 4 - The first time since losing 4-3 to United in 2009 that City have conceded four in the league. 9 - City have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season. 70.8 - City's pass completion rate percentage at Old Trafford was their worst of the season. It was a 3-0 win at Old Trafford that effectively finished Moyes at United, with the eventual champions moving 15 points clear of their neighbours that day with two games to spare. But this game was a microcosm of City’s season: a decent start, marked by that first Aguero goal, and then a period of steady, draining decline. Since the turn of the year City have collected just 18 points from 13 games. Compare that to United, who have taken 29 from the same number of matches. Pellegrini was honest enough to admit that they have thrown away their title defence with the ‘garbage’ but the real garbage is on the pitch, in the form of some truly inept performances. Not least away from home. If Pellegrini had a desire to ‘continue being noisy’ and extend a period of dominance over their neighbours to a fifth league meeting, the evidence on Sunday would suggest it was not shared by his players. They were a poor imitation of the side that so impressed here last year. Nothing like the champions of England. Louis van Gaal shakes hands with his opposite number Manuel Pellegrini after the final whistle . Manchester United boss Van Gaal thanked supporters for their patience after Sunday's victory . Manchester City boss Pellegrini has come under increasing pressure after a dismal second half of the season . Compared to Chelsea, United are some way short of the best in England too and both clubs will need to invest heavily again this summer to close that gap. But this morning United and City appear to be travelling in opposite directions, one on the rise and the other entering another period of upheaval. Vincent Kompany blames financial fair play but overlooks the fact that Pellegrini has actually spent more than £75million since last summer. Just as he ignores that the problem is closer to home; that he is chief among players operating on restricted power. At Old Trafford the drop in standards at City was obvious to all, and probably explained why the atmosphere was electric. United’s supporters are enjoying seeing City suffer as much as they are now beginning to appreciate the leadership of Van Gaal. His management has taken on an almost magical quality. Judging by the fact that he can keep his two most expensive players on the bench for 80-odd minutes and nobody even notices.","Manchester United beat Manchester City 4-2 at Old Trafford .

"As Jimmy Anderson prepares to play his 100th Test - needing only three wickets to equal Ian Botham’s England-record haul of 383 - Sportsmail's Lawrence Booth spoke to those who knew him and played with him in his early days for Burnley, Lancashire and England. England quick James Anderson plays his 100th Test match in Antigua against the West Indies from Monday . Anderson needs just three wickets to go level with Sir Ian Botham as England's top Test wicket taker . MICHAEL BROWN . Burnley CC team-mate, now club chairman . We used to call Jimmy the ‘Pro Killer’. Playing in the Lancashire League, he’d regularly get the opposition professional out. He was quite a slight kid. It was probably when he was 17 that we thought, wow, he’s got some pace. And he had this ability to bowl jaffas. When he bowled so brilliantly against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup everyone at Burnley was saying: ‘We’ve seen these magic balls before.’ Anderson was known as Pro Killer during his days with Burnley, reveals former team-mate and now club chairman Michael Brown . My mum can take some of the credit for Jimmy being signed by Lancashire. He was bowling really well for Burnley, and she rang up John Stanworth, who was at the club at the time. Jimmy was invited for trials by Lancashire and that was that. He was always a shy lad. But he cares very much. JOHN STANWORTH . Former Lancashire player development manager . His potential was brought to my attention by Val Brown so I’m not going to take credit for unearthing Jimmy. I didn’t necessarily think he’d be the bowler he is today but there was just something about him. When he arrived for Under 17 nets he was a shy introvert but with the ability to bowl at good pace. But it was the late swing that stood out. Even established batsmen struggled to line him up. They were playing and missing all the time. He made them look ordinary. In the early days I just left him alone. He had these unusual mannerisms, like not looking at the batsman at the point of delivery, and a strange rotation of the shoulders. But I ignored all that even when coaches at other counties were pointing it out. I just said: ‘We’ve got a 17-year-old bowling 80mph and getting the top three out!’ WARREN HEGG . Anderson’s first captain at Lancashire and wicketkeeper . He burst on to the scene in my first year as captain. There was talk of this kid from the valleys in Lancashire. He wouldn’t say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light with the funniest action. He bowled to me in a centre net practice at Old Trafford and was either turning me inside out or hitting me on the shin. I thought: ‘Either I’m losing it or this kid’s special’. And he really was. We sat down with coach Mike Watkinson and tried to work out how to set fields that were both attacking and defensive at the same time in case he sent down the odd poor ball. So we’d have three slips, a gully and a deep point. It gave him confidence to concentrate on how to be a fast bowler. He went from strength to strength. Anderson (back row second from left) 'wouldn’t say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light,' says his 2002 Lancashire captain Warren Hegg (front row fifth from left) He was a keeper’s dream. He was in the high-80s and took the ball away so I always thought I was going to get a nick. That said, he was partly responsible for ending my career a few games early. He bowled James Middlebrook down at Chelmsford and I dislocated a thumb after the ball ricocheted off the bails. But I could console myself with the thought that I’d kept to England’s best. MIKE WATKINSON . Anderson’s first coach at Lancashire . I was coaching the Lancashire second team when Jimmy arrived. He had wicked pace back then - probably even more than he has now - but he could be a little inconsistent. Some would swing, others wouldn’t. I’d been a swing bowler myself before changing to spin and I did some work with him before one game at Middleton. I tried to convey to him the importance of the relationship between the ball and the fingertips. He related to it straight away. Since then, he’s worked things out for himself. Jimmy’s been his own best coach. IAN WARD . Anderson’s first first-class victim: Lancashire v Surrey, Old Trafford, May 31, 2002 . He was then as he is now - as lithe as a whippet. His run-up was the same. I just remember him being quality. He had this very fast arm which was difficult to pick up at first. To me, a left-hander, it was an awayswinger. I remember getting one that was too good for me and edged it to Warren Hegg. Sky Sports commentator Ian Ward (left with Shane Warne) was Jimmy's first first-class victim . I thought ‘Christ, this guy can bowl!’ In those days Lancashire had Peter Martin and Glen Chapple and we weren’t expecting them to go on forever. We thought, they’ve found another one already. That was the talk in the Surrey dressing-room. And when he got Ramps in the second innings you could see he had something different. MARK RAMPRAKASH . Dismissed first ball in the second innings of the above match . I faced his first couple of balls in the first innings and they were wide of off stump. But they went through noticeably quickly and hit the keeper’s gloves quite hard. He was swinging it and getting it through at a good lick. Mark Ramprakash, now England batting coach, was dismissed LBW with the first ball of the second innings . In the second innings he gave me a straight one first ball. It was fast and swinging in and it hit me plumb in front. I was beaten for pace and a little bit of inswing, or maybe reverse. It was a terrific delivery. You tend to remember when a young man comes in and does that straight away. It raised a few eyebrows. At the Old Trafford Test against India last summer I was sitting on the team balcony as batting coach and I couldn’t remember a better exhibition of swing bowling. To witness that live was amazing. NASSER HUSSAIN . Anderson’s first England captain, in 2002-03 . He came into the team after yet another Ashes disaster. He was a breath of fresh air, a natural talent - very un-English! He wasn’t over-coached or too technical. He just ran in and bowled swing. He was the kind of player you might get from Pakistan. Anderson and his first England captain Nasser Hussain celebrate a wicket during the 2003 World Cup . For such a young lad, he wasn’t someone you needed to over-manage or look after. He was incredibly quiet but he knew exactly what he wanted to do. If anything I probably had such a good impression of him that I gave him more responsibility than I should have done - like bowling him instead of Andrew Caddick at the end of our World Cup game against Australia at Port Elizabeth in 2003. He got hit for six and I apologised to him later. He was playing pool, shrugged his shoulders, and got on with his game. But I knew he was going to be one of our greats. It’s one thing being a swing bowler but it’s the way he could get it to go so late. I faced him just once and he got me first ball at Old Trafford as part of a hat-trick. He’s a very clever cricketer. MARK BUTCHER . Man of the match on Anderson’s Test debut against Zimbabwe at Lord’s in 2003 . Anderson celebrates the wicket of Zimbabwe's Travis Friend with Michael Vaughan (right) and Robert Key (left) during his debut Test at Lord's in May 2003, in which Mark Butcher claimed five wickets and man of the match . Like Jimmy, I took five wickets in that game. I like to think I taught him everything he knows about swing bowling. This was the first time I’d seen him close up. He swung it both ways and at serious pace. I thought, we’ve found one here. I took a catch off him. Andy Bignaut was trying to work one through square-leg but he nicked it to slip. It was a cracking delivery. It’s an easy thing to do when you’re new to get your bouncer through quickly, then send down something a bit floaty when you bowl a fuller length. But his full balls were coming out at a good pace too. He was brilliant.","James Anderson plays his 100th Test match in Antigua starting Monday .

"Kevin Pietersen battered Oxford’s students for 170 off 149 deliveries in his first game of red-ball cricket for 15 months – then insisted the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves has told him everyone has a ‘clean slate’. Pietersen’s quest for an improbable return to international cricket began as his scriptwriter must have known it would: with sumptuous strokes, a standing ovation and much of the old bravado. The fact that his first hundred since the Old Trafford Test against Australia in August 2013 came against a modest attack, at a windswept Oxford, in a game not deemed first-class, is beside the point. Pietersen’s only hope of playing for England again is to score lots of runs for Surrey – wind, rain or shine. Here was the first box ticked, in style. Surrey's Kevin Pietersen (right) celebrates reaching his 100 during the three-day Match at The Parks . Pietersen makes his way out to the crease following the dismissal of Rory Burns . It was the 34-year-old's first appearance for Surrey since the LV= County Championship in June 2013 . Asked what Graves had said to him when the pair spoke over the phone last month, Pietersen replied: ‘He said he wants the best players playing for England, and everyone has a clean slate. Right now, it’s just about me hitting the red ball. I think it can help England going forward. ‘I took confidence from the way I played in Australia [at the Big Bash]. It was as well as I’ve ever batted. I’ve been given a lifeline, and I have an opportunity to get back to doing something I love that was taken away from me prematurely.’ England meet West Indies in Antigua on Monday, and comparisons will be inevitable. There will be mixed feelings both in the Caribbean and at Lord’s. Whether Pietersen’s journey will prove more futile than fruitful is another matter. The first aim of the new regime at the ECB has been to stop the sniping; the second may be to keep Pietersen sweet in case English cricket needs him after he retires, possibly in a mentoring capacity. Regardless, the evidence here – as if it were required – suggested he is deadly serious about reclaiming his place. Pietersen has played exclusively Twenty20 cricket throughout the world since being axed by England . A young spectator points to a dent in her mother's car made by one of Pietersen's shots . Pietersen made 62 on his only prior appearance at The Parks, for Nottinghamshire in April 2004 . With Surrey 122 for five at lunch, Pietersen (left) found himself on 47 not out from 58 balls . Nearly 10 years on from his Ashes-clinching century at The Oval, Pietersen cannot have imagined he would need to prosper in the Parks simply to stay afloat. But in front of a crowd of several hundred – almost unheard of in these parts – and with Surrey stumbling to 113 for five, he had a captive audience and a job to do. Pietersen was careful at first, waiting until his eighth delivery to pinch his first run in red-ball cricket since the Sydney Test of January 2014, and not finding the boundary until his 31st. Then he opened up. His fifty came from 63 balls, his hundred from 110, and his 150 from 137. By the time he was out for 170, caught at mid-on off the bowling of Abidine Sahande, a human sciences undergrad from St John’s College, the total was only 310. He knocked one spectator off his stool with a fierce drive, dented a Peugeot 207 with the first of two successive straight sixes, and unveiled his full repertoire. Stealing headlines and causing damage, Pietersen might never have been away. Pietersen's inclusion in Surrey's line-up attracted several hundred spectators and a number of photographers .","Kevin Pietersen scored a century for Surrey against Oxford MCCU .

"Brendan Rodgers admitted Liverpool’s big-game mentality must improve after his hopes of winning the FA Cup were left in tatters. The Liverpool manager had no complaints about their 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa — their first loss in an FA Cup semi-final since 1990 — and accepted his side have to do better in the most important games.

He said: ‘We’ve come up short in a few games, that’s something we’d certainly need to improve. But I think all these experiences will make them better. ‘We’re a team that’s grown and changed quite a bit in the summer. ‘We’re obviously bitterly disappointed, more with the performance.

Steven Gerrard almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left, but his header was cleared . Rodgers shouts instructions at his players, but to no avail as Liverpool slump to defeat at Wembley . ‘There will be disappointment over the next few days but we now have to get ready for our next league game. ‘This last block of games it’s more the performance level hasn’t been what we would like. ‘We need to have the courage and bravery to play better in the big games. ‘We looked as if the occasion and the energy got to us a wee bit.

"Belgian teenager Obbi Oulare scored as Club Brugge came from behind to beat Anderlecht in front of scouts from a number of Europe’s top clubs. Scouts from Manchester United, Everton, Sunderland, Burnley, Dortmund and Leverkusen were in Belgium to watch the top of the table clash. And Sportsmail understands 19-year-old Oulare was the reason the scouts from England and Germany were in attendance. Club Brugge forward Obbi Oulare holds off a defender during his side's Europa League game last week . Oulare started against Dinpro in midweek and scored against Anderlecht for the Brugge on Sunday . And he did not disappoint as he scored in the 74th minute after a Timmy Simons own goal to put Anderlecht ahead. Ruud Vormer then scored with four minutes remaining to take all three points and extend Club Brugge’s lead at the top of the league to four points. Oulare is the son of former Guinea international Souleymane Oulare and has represented Belgium at Under 18 and 19 level before making his U21 debut against Moldova in March. The young striker came through the youth ranks at Lille, the same academy that has produced the likes of Liverpool loanee Divock Origi and Chelsea star Eden Hazard, also both Belgian. The young striker is being watched by some of Europe's top clubs, including Manchester United . Despite being just 19 years of age, Oulare is a strong forward, and has scored four times this season .","Highly rated striker Obbi Oulare attracting attention from around Europe .

"Reading manager Steve Clarke and his players will rally round goalkeeper Adam Federici to help him get over his Wembley gaffe. The Australian blew his side’s chances of beating Arsenal in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final by spilling Alexis Sanchez’s shot into his own net in extra-time. Federici was inconsolable after the match and Clarke revealed: ‘I tried to hug him but he was very, very disappointed. He just wanted to get inside and have his sad moment by himself. You have to respect that. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp . The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game . Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp . ‘When he comes into training we’ll have a little chat but he’ll be fine. He’s a professional.’ The incident was reminiscent of Robert Green’s error in England’s 2010 World Cup opener against the USA, when Clint Dempsey’s strike got through him. Reading midfielder Jem Karacan added of Federici: ‘He’s one of the best goalkeepers around and they all make mistakes. ‘The saves he made earlier were top-class and he was probably man of the match up to that point. Nobody will blame him.’ Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal .

"The lawyers for a female Pennsylvania police officer charged with criminal homicide last month are trying to keep a video of her fatally shooting an unarmed motorist in the back out of the courtroom. Footage of Hummelstown police Officer Lisa Mearkle shooting two bullets into David Kassick's back as he lay face down on February 2 that was recorded by her stun gun has not been made public. Her attorneys asked a judge on Friday to bar the distinct attorney from releasing the video. Scroll down for video . Pennslyvania police Officer Lisa Mearkle is charged with criminal homicide in the shooting of David Kassick . Kassick, 59, was shot in the back while he lay face down on the ground on February 2. He was unarmed . Mearkle, 36, claimed she shot Kassick in self-defense because she saw him reach into his jacket for a weapon . A preliminary hearing to determine if there is enough evidence to send the case to trial is scheduled for Monday, CBS News reported. A lawyer working for Kassick's family who has seen the video, Christopher Slusser, said it 'leaves nothing to the imagination'. Mearkle is free on bail and suspended without pay . He said: 'Whether she would have been charged or not had the video not existed, I can't answer that,' 'But I can tell you having that video, for me - I won't speak for the DA - but it made it very clear the DA had very little choice not to charge her.' Mearkle, who is free on bail but is under electronic monitoring, is suspended without pay. Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico previously called the video the strongest evidence in the case when Mearkle was charged at the end of March. The stun gun's camera started recording when Mearkle, 36, used it on Kassick, 59, after she tried to pull him over for expired inspection and emissions stickers. Kassick sped away but she caught up to him after he got out and ran. Marsico said Kassick was trying to remove stun gun probes from his back when he was shot. Mearkle's lawyer, Brian Perry, said his client fired at Kassick in self-defense because she thought he was reaching for a gun. She performed CPR after the shooting. Kassick's family said he had struggles with drug addition but that he was not a violent person. A syringe was found near Kassick's body and he had alcohol and unspecified drugs in his system when he died. He was a construction worker. Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Mrisco (left) called video of the shooting the best evidence in the case . The offense of criminal homicide encompasses charges from misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter to murder . According to the arrest affidavit: 'At the time Officer Mearkle fires both rounds from her pistol, the video clearly depicts Kassick lying on the snow-covered lawn with his face toward the ground. 'Furthermore, at the time the rounds are fired nothing can be seen in either of Kassick's hands, nor does he point or direct anything toward Officer Mearkle.' Marsico planned to show the video on Monday, but Mearkle may waive the hearing. The motion filed by her defense team about the video is scheduled to be addressed on Tuesday. The offense of criminal homicide encompasses a range of charges, from misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter to felony first-degree murder. Prosecutors often narrow the charge later in the process, about the time when defendants are formally arraigned.","Pennsylvania police officer Lisa Mearkle charged with criminal homicide .

"A mother is demanding $300,000 from a school claiming her son would rather commit suicide than face his bullies. Ashley Shupe claims Kaiden, eight, has tried to choke himself, throw himself from a height, and stop eating. It was a reaction, she claims to repeated 'taunting, bullying and physical assault' inflicted by one student in his class at Oakmont Elementary School in Dickson County, Tennessee, for more than a year since Spetember 2013. Distraught: Ashley Shupe says her eight-year-old son Kaiden (pictured together) is suicidal after being bullied . Police: After the latest alleged attack, Shupe took these pictures of Kaiden's injuries and filed a police report . Eventually, in March this year, Shupe filed a police report against the child when Kaiden allegedly came home with a swollen and bruised head, bruises on his knees, and scratches. According to the lawsuit, filed last month, Kaiden was diagnosed with clinical depression in October 2013, a month into the alleged attacks. Despite notifying the school, Shupe says they continued to let the children interact. By April 2014, she claims, Kaiden began to display 'odd behaviour'. Anger: Shupe is demanding $300,000 for the school district's negligence in protecting her son . He tried 'to choke himself' and warned 'he may harm himself', the suit, read by The Tennessean, states. In a lawsuit, Ms Shupe accuses the school of failing to adequately protect her child despite witnessing the attacks and being notified that Kaiden had been diagnosed with depression. The school, she says, agreed to formally separate the children in April 2014, but that was not adhered to.","Ashley Shupe says Kaiden tried choking himself and jumping from a height .

"Steven Gerrard looked glum at Boujis nightclub in Kensington after being knocked out of the FA Cup on Sunday - and his Liverpool farewell tour is unlikely to have him breaking into a grin either. The Liverpool captain spent the evening in the VIP room with friends, knowing full well that defeat by Aston Villa at Wembley confirmed what he had feared all season: he would end his final year at Anfield without a trophy. Sunday's loss means there will be no birthday FA Cup final for him on May 30, while Chelsea's victory over Manchester United in the Barclays Premier League made it mathematically impossible for Liverpool to catch the league leaders. Steven Gerrard is seen at Boujis nightclub in Kensington Sunday night after being knocked out of the FA Cup . Gerrard looked glum after it was confirmed he would end the season without a trophy before moving on . Gerrard climbs into a car outside the club in London as his Liverpool career winds down to a poor ending . Aston Villa's players celebrate their victory at Wembley while Gerrard reflects on the pitch in defeat . Sunday April 25: West Bromwich Albion (A) Tuesday April 28: Hull City (A) Saturday May 2: Queens Park Rangers (H) Sunday May 10: Chelsea (A) Saturday May 16: Crystal Palace (H) Sunday May 24: Stoke City (A) As the curtain comes down on his 17 years in the Liverpool first-team, Gerrard has just six games left to play in a red shirt with little to play for and a fixture list that seem unlikely to bring his smile back. Among the opponents that late April and May bring are four teams in the bottom half of the Premier League table: West Bromwich Albion, Hull City, Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace. Towards the end of that run, a trip to champions-elect Chelsea beckons and then Gerrard is set to play his final game in England at the Britannia Stadium against Stoke City on May 24, a dead-rubber that is unlikely to even be shown on television. While the supporters from the Kop will undoubtedly give their Champions League-winning captain a huge send off at Anfield against Palace on May 16, it does give a sense of anti-climax after one of the finest careers seen in the Premier League era. Anything but a defeat against Arsenal for Chelsea would likely see them likely to be confirmed as champions before Gerrard comes to Stamford Bridge, and with a title party ongoing he will be reminded of the one prize that has eluded him throughout his career in England. Liverpool's players, including their captain, were outclassed by Villa at Wembley and deservedly lost . Wembley, where Gerrard has captained his country on many occasions, now has a final bad memory for him . Liverpool fans show their support for Gerrard - his latest Anfield appearance is against Crystal Palace . It will also bring back memories of his slip to let in Demba Ba at Anfield, almost a year ago to the day, a fatal error that robbed the 34-year-old of a maiden title last season. The chance of leading a guard of honour if Chelsea seal the league crown against Leicester City or Crystal Palace would rub salt further into the wounds. Jose Mourinho might have asked the Chelsea supporters to stop singing the about Gerrard's unfortunate tumble, but the Stamford Bridge faithful are unlikely to relent as they take the opportunity to give their two-time transfer target a farewell he won't forget - for the wrong reasons. Gerrard slipped up in last year's game against Chelsea to gift Demba Ba a goal and throw away the title . Memories of that mistake will be strong in the mind for Gerrard is Chelsea are celebrating winning the league . England's failure at the World Cup - with Gerrard as captain - followed, and he quit the international game . Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Wayne Rooney leave the pitch after drawing their final game with Costa Rica . It has been a difficult final year for Gerrard. Missing out on last year's title was followed by captaining England at a winless World Cup and now another trophyless year where he has found himself surplus to Brendan Rodgers' starting XI at times with Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen preferred as options in midfield. The decision to retire from the international game after last summer's tournament, with a focus on his club career, didn't work out either with Liverpool knocked out of all four cups - including at the first possible opportunity in the Champions League. And now, a Premier League legend bids farewell in a way that doesn't seem fitting. There is no big finale like in Istanbul or Cardiff all those years ago, instead Gerrard leaves Liverpool and England with a whimper. Now, the Liverpool captain's  final game is at the Britannia Stadium - though he did score there last year .

December 9, 2014: The captain scores but Liverpool are knocked out of the Champions League after a 1-1 draw with Basle leaves them on just five points in Group B. January 27, 2015: Liverpool are knocked out of the Capital One Cup at the semi-final stage after losing 1-0 to Chelsea in extra time at Stamford Bridge, with Gerrard unable to inspire a victory. February 26, 2015: Gerrard misses Europa League tie with Besiktas through injury and they crash out on penalties in Istanbul. March 22, 2015: Any hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League for Liverpool take a huge blow in a 2-0 defeat by Manchester United at Anfield. Gerrard is left out of the starting XI and comes on as a second half substitute but is sent off just 38 seconds after coming on. April 19, 2015: Liverpool lose their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa to end all hopes of a trophy in Gerrard's final season. May 10, 2015: Gerrard travels with Liverpool to face Chelsea, who could have already wrapped up the title, and faces being ridiculed by the Stamford Bridge crowd.: Sto . May 24, 2015: Seventeen years playing in the Premier League end with a trip to face Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium in a game that will likely be of little importance to either side. P.S. Along with Gerrard and Frank Lampard, there's another member of England's much-maligned 'golden generation' who is likely to be leaving the Premier League in the summer: Rio Ferdinand. The Queens Park Rangers defender's farewell season has fallen flat as he spends much of his time sat on the bench at Loftus Road in their relegation battle. Ferdinand struggled from the start of the season at the centre of the Rs defence after moving on from years of loyal service at Manchester United. The 36-year-old's final days in England's top tier are so chilled, that he showed off his ability to watch House of Cards on his way into training in the back of his car on Monday morning.

"Ask most players about the hat-tricks they've scored and they'll describe in detail how they managed to find the back of the net three times in 90 minutes. But that doesn't apply to Lionel Messi. The Barcelona star has scored so many trebles at club level - 32 to be exact - that he can't remember each one despite keeping a match ball from every game. Messi will be hoping to add another to his list when Barca take on PSG in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. Lionel Messi poses with each of the 32 balls he has taken home after scoring a hat-trick for Barcelona . Messi bends home his side's opening goal against Sevilla on Saturday during Barcelona's 2-2 draw . Speaking to Barcelona's official magazine ahead of the game, Messi revealed that  his hat-trick balls have a special place in his home even if he can't recall which games they're from. Asked about getting each one signed by his team-mates, the 27-year-old said: 'I always sign it because I believe it is recognition for the whole team. 'Without my team mates I would not have achieved all that I have on an individual level and I think that with a hat-trick, more than ever, because I depend on them to score goals, so it is a nice souvenir to have them all sign it.

Having netted 277 La Liga goals for Barcelona over the last 10-and-a-half years, it's little surprise that Messi has some trouble remembering the 96 which arrived in just 32 matches. Asked if he can recall all of his hat-tricks for the club, Messi said: 'Right now, as we speak, no. I need to see the goals again or for somebody to tell me something about them to actually remember them.' Messi celebrates after scoring the second goal of his hat-trick against Real Madrid in March 2007 . Less surprising is the one that stands out to him. 'The one I scored against Real Madrid when we drew 3-3 at Camp Nou was very special for me, for what it meant in the game and because for me it was my first hat-trick and it kept us ahead in the league,' said Messi. 'Even though at the end we didn’t win the league, at that moment it was important and also because it was against Real Madrid.'","Barcelona star Lionel Messi says he need to be reminded of his hat-tricks .

Scroll down for video . Living the Good Life: Michael Fyson, 77, has grown his own fruit and veg for more than 10 years. But the Broadway Allotment Association member says soil at the group's new site is 'dreadful' Thriving: The association's allotments were moved by Oldham council. The old prize-winning site (pictured) has been bulldozed to make way for a car park and football pitches . Pay out: But gardeners have complained about their new site, saying it has bad drainage and poor soil. The association has called on the council to pay growers compensation for the problems they've experienced . Many are complaining that the soil in their new allotments is so poor they cannot grow a bean - and that the new plots' drainage is so bad that their seedlings are rotting in the ground. They are demanding that Oldham council pays out compensation for the problems - which have seriously curtailed their growing season. Michael Fyson, 77, has grown his own fruit and veg for more than 10 years and he and his wife, Margaret, 78, live the Good Life as they are largely self-sufficient. He said: ‘The soil is dreadful and the land is flooded. It is impossible to grow there so the allotments are not fit for purpose and need plenty of work. ‘I still have potatoes, leeks, parsnips, cabbage, broccoli, strawberries, raspberries and gooseberries in storage from last year’s crop but this year I’ ll be lucky to grow anything. 'Dreadful': Gardeners say the soil at their new site (pictured) is so poor they can't grow a bean. Oldham council moved the group from their old allotments, which had been popular with residents since the 1930s . The drainage (pictured left) is also so bad that the seedlings of allotment holders are rotting in the ground. They are demanding the council pays out compensation for the problems at the plots in Failsworth, Oldham . ‘My wife and I totally depend on the crop from my allotment each year as we have three freezers to store it and it keeps us going all year.’ Mr Fyson, who has two grandchildren and one great grandson, has won award after award at the annual competition for Best Allotment in Oldham. He said: ‘I’ve done quite well over the year. But this year is going to be dreadful. I’ve been digging some trenches to drain the land and have had to bail out with a bucket. We won’t be able to grow anything of any quality here for quite a while.’ Green as you like: Council chiefs moved the Broadway Allotment Association to land a few hundred yards away from their original prize-winning site (pictured) as part of a plan to redevelop the nearby Lancaster Club . The development will include 144 homes, with the Grade II-listed club turned into apartments and a five-a-side football pitch and car park built on the former allotments where growers (pictured) used to plant their seedlings . Much-loved: One allotment holder, Michael Fyson, 77, has grown fruit and vegetables at the old site (pictured) for more than ten years. He has won award after award at the annual competition for Best Allotment in Oldham . The plots managed by the Broadway Allotment Association in Failsworth, Oldham have been popular with residents since the 1930s and kept many fed during the Second World War. However growers have been moved to land a few hundred yards away as part of a plan to redevelop the nearby Lancaster Club off Broadway into a ‘garden suburb’. The development will include 144 homes, with the Grade II-listed club turned into apartments and a five-a-side football pitch and car park will be built on the former allotments. Oldham council developed the new site and constructed greenhouses and sheds for the growers in recompense for losing their original plots. Ian Wade, 55, association secretary, said: ‘I understand the need to redevelop the area and it would be okay if they had given us a plot that worked. ‘But the soil they have put down is ridiculous. It has powdered brick, rubble, sand and stones in it and it is impossible to grow anything in it. ‘Gardeners can work to improve the soil but it is so shocking nothing will grow for years. The site is also flooded and seems impossible to drain.’ Now, the 17 tenants are calling on the council to give them compensation for the delay they will face in growing their produce and the extra work in making the land fit. Unhappy: Secretary of the the Broadway Allotment Association, Ian Wade (pictured), said the soil which had been put down at the new site was 'ridiculous'. He believes nothing will grow there for years . Oldham council said relocation of the allotments to the new site was not due to be completed until May but growers say this will limit their growing season. The 17 tenants are calling on the council to give compensation . Oldham council’s Elaine McLean said: ‘We are carrying out soil testing in the coming days to establish the cause of the standing water and how we can improve the situation for the plot holders.’ Oldham council said the relocation of the allotments to the new site was not due to be completed until May but growers say it will limit their growing season. Elaine McLean, Oldham council’s executive director for economy and skills, said: ‘Issues have been raised by Broadway Allotments Association regarding a number of plots at the new site and we are working closely with the group to address these matters. ‘We are carrying out soil testing in the coming days to establish the cause of the standing water and how we can improve the situation for the plot holders.’","Allotment holders moved elsewhere after prize-winning plots bulldozed .

"James Collins can rest easy. As sensational an own goal as his inadvertently precise lob over Adrian was in West Ham's 2-0 defeat at Manchester City, it was not the weekend's most bizarre. Not by a long way. That honour falls to Mohammad Shatnawi of Jordanian club Al Faisaly, whose effort will be considered as one of the strangest own goals ever. His team were 1-0 down against Al Whidat in the Amman Derby when their opponents pushed forward, looking to double their lead. VIDEO - Scroll down to see Mohammad Shatnawi's amazing own goal . Mohammed Shatnawi bizarrely scored an own goal by kicking the ball over his head at the weekend . Shatnawi appeared to be trying to put the ball out of play after initially making a good save . He watches on in horror as the ball floats ominously towards the net after his overhead kick . As the Al Whidat striker closed in on goal and lashed a venomous strike on target, Shatnawi got down well to stop it with his foot, an impulsive reaction block. But what happened next, as the ball looped up in the air, is inexplicable. Perhaps Shatnawi did not realise he had as much time as he did to collect the rebound. Maybe he thought what he was about to do was the best way to eliminate any impending danger. Or maybe he even mistook his team-mates for opponents. West Ham's James Collins (right) accidentally lobbed his goalkeeper trying to clear a cross on Sunday . Shatnawi kept his eyes on the ball, leaned back, raised his right leg and kicked it over his head, one would imagine in an unorthodox attempt to send the ball over his goal and out for a corner. Instead, his touch was a little too cushioned, and the ball drifted nonchalantly into his own net.","Mohammad Shatnawi scored a bizzare own goal in the Jordanian league .

"Bryony Hibbert (pictured), 25,  the girlfriend of the footballer caught having drunken sex in the dugout, has slammed those responsible for the clip . This is the first picture of the girlfriend of the semi-professional footballer caught having drunken sex with a female supporter in the dugout after his team's 4-1 defeat. Striker Jay Hart, 24, could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. He was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside was shared on social media and has now begged for his 25-year-old girlfriend Bryony Hibbert's forgiveness. The 73rd minute substitute for non-league Clitheroe FC, in Lancashire, today admitted he had no idea who the woman was and reached out to Wayne Rooney on Twitter for advice. Speaking for the first time since he was caught in the act, he said: 'All I want say is that I regret doing what I did. 'I was drunk, I'd had more than a few drinks, and I want to say I'm sorry to my family and everyone involved at Clitheroe. 'I regret that I did it, not that I got caught. 'I've spoken and tried to sort things out with Bryony . 'Everyone in the world knows about it, I just want to get my apology out there. 'I haven't seen the girl since, I don't have a clue who she is, don't have a clue.' His team had just suffered a 4-1 defeat at Mossley's Seel Park stadium in the final game of the season which was billed as a 'ladies day' to attract more female supporters. The face of the blonde fan cannot be seen in the close-up footage. Hart was sacked by the club, which play in Evo-Stik Division 1 North, within hours of the footage being shared to fans. His girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who has two young children, slammed those responsible for filming and sharing the clip. Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' Striker Jay Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with blonde . One person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first. He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed. 'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.' Mr Hart said he thinks of Ms Hibbert's  children as his own and hasn't seen them since the incident. His mother, Dawn Hart 46, also revealed Jay's younger sisters have been targeted by trolls, with someone sending the video to the youngest, aged nine. 'I know he's done wrong, but at the end of the day, he's my son and to see what people are saying about him, it's not nice,' she said. Mr Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde . 'People have done a lot worse. Someone sent the video to my girls as well. 'They know something's gone on but they don't know what exactly, and to have to explain it to them when someone sends them something like that is horrible. 'It's had a knock on effect on his girls as well.' Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute'. She said: 'I can't have somebody wearing the Clitheroe FC tracksuit bringing us down. 'It has brought the club into disrepute and it's not proper for him to scupper our reputation. I expect our players to act professionally. 'It was brought to my attention on Saturday night and dealt with through the management. I did offer to speak to him myself but Simon (Garner, the manager) said he would take care of it.' Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground. 'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them. 'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done. 'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that. 'Football is only a small part of it. If he had thought about what would have happened when he did it, he wouldn't have done it. He will pay for it. 'When I spoke to him, he sounded very apologetic about it. I'm disappointed for him. He will regret what he did and it was totally wrong.' No-one from Mossley AFC was available for comment yesterday. He was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside was shared on social media and has now begged for his 25-year-old girlfriend Bryony Hibbert's forgiveness .

"Nine months after she suffered horrific injuries in a brutal attack, former porn star Christy Mack still has to wear a wig and glasses to look herself. With 18 broken bones, a broken nose, a ruptured kidney, a ruptured liver, missing teeth, and a fractured rib, Mack was unrecognisable as she fled her Las Vegas home on August 8, 2014. It was the climax, she claims, of an abusive on-off relationship with MMA fighter Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver, known professionally as War Machine. She is still undergoing reparative dental work - while fighting to see Koppenhaver convicted of attempted murder. The journey, she told ESPN, has been monumental. Scroll down for video . Nine months ago, Christy Mack was in hospital fighting for her life. Now she is on the road to recovery . Mack, 23, claims MMA fighter Koppenhaver, 33, became abusive months into their one-year relationship . 'I didn't look in the mirror for weeks,' she said. 'Just feeling my face, I knew it wasn't right. So when I'd look in the mirror, it's not me - that person wasn't me. It's so hard to go every day without being you anymore.' Mack, 23, claims Koppenhaver, 33, became abusive four months into their one-year relationship, which started fast. When they met on a photo shoot set, she had pneumonia and he offered to look after her, bringing pizza to her hotel, she told ESPN. 'It was an amazing connection. I feel in love really quick,' she said. Mack posted this message on Twitter soon after the attack to show how she had been hurt . Bruised: Mack published this picture of her leg in the wake of the attack . As well as posting images, Mack described the attack, claiming Koppenhaver cut off her hair with a blunt knife . Mack says the couple met on a photo shoot when she had pneumonia and he offered to care for her . She said she believed, after the first attack, that it would never happen again. Around six months later, a male friend Corey Thomas was sleeping in her bed when she says Koppenhaver, who had a spare key, burst in. Koppenhaver allegedly beat Thomas then told him to go, but not to phone 911. Then, prosecutors allege, he approached Mack with a kitchen knife. He beat her and used the knife to saw off her mohawk, she told police. Mack, who has agreed to be identified in reporting of the case, was left with broken bones and a ruptured liver . A prosecutor asked the court to record Koppenhaver laughing and shaking his head as Mack said he sexually assaulted her . Koppenhaver has maintained his innocence and tweeted that he was also beaten by another man . Koppenhaver, who has legally changed his name to War Machine, will be tried this autumn . It wasn't until he went to the kitchen that she was able to flee to a neighbor's house, it is claimed. Koppenhaver maintains his innocence. Throughout court proceedings, he has dismissed the 26 charges against him as 'heart breaking', insisting he was a victim. He took to Twitter days after the alleged attack to say that he had gone to propose to Mack but 'ended up fighting for my life'. 'I only wish that man hadn't been there and that Christy & I would be happily engaged. I don't know (why) I'm so cursed. One day truth will come out,' he wrote. Mack, who had already been a supporter and donor for women's right groups before her attack, slams the critics who targeted her with abuse that suggested she got what she deserved. 'It wasn't OK for people to say I got what I deserved when they had no idea what my struggle was.' The court will resume the case this autumn.

"Armed men killed eight people in a raid on a Sao Paulo football fan club on Saturday night that has close links to a notorious, now-closed prison. Police said witnesses told them that around midnight on Saturday three gunmen stormed the dark and gritty site where Corinthians' fan group Pavilhao 9 meets underneath a highway overpass. They ordered the victims to lie face down on the ground and shot seven in the head. An eighth man was shot but tried to escape, reached a gas station and was later taken to a nearby hospital where he died. Armed police stand guard outside the headquarters of Corinthians fan club Pavilhao 9 on Sunday morning . A distraught woman talks on her mobile phone outside the building where seven men were executed . A policeman shows the bullet shells that were collected at the scene of the shooting west of Sao Paulo . Detective Arlindo Jose Negrao ruled out a fight between rival fan groups. He would not reveal the motive behind the attack, however, saying that could interfere with the probe. 'Through witnesses, we are already exploring a line of investigation, which is not leading us to believe it was caused by fan rivalry,' Negrao said at a press conference. 'We even have possible suspects.' The victims were having a barbecue at the club at the time and making flags with their team's colours for Sunday's anticipated match between Corinthians and Palmeiras. The fan group did not answer several phone calls. Pavilhao 9 was founded by a group of Corinthians fans who played football with inmates at Brazil's Carandiru prison, known widely for a massacre that left 111 inmates dead, which was turned into a movie. The prison is now closed. Police say that the killings, that took place late on Saturday night, are not related to any football rivalry . A woman is comforted by a policeman as she talks on a mobile phone outside the fan club . The Corinthians team did not respond to a request for information but posted the word 'mourning' against a black backdrop on its official Facebook page. Former president of the team and current federal congressman, Andres Sanchez, said on the social network he was 'deeply saddened to learn of what had happened at Pavilhao 9, with which I had a strong bond since I was a kid.' Much of the football violence that breaks out in or near Brazilian stadiums is traced to fan clubs. Police often investigate fan groups for ties with drug traffickers. The victims were having a barbecue as they prepared for Corinthians match against Palmeiras on Sunday when gunmen raided the premises . Brazilian police guard entrance to the building where the fan group were making flags ahead of Sunday's game . 'It is widely known that criminal organisations are inside of all fan clubs. Organised crime uses these fan groups as a front for their misdeeds,' Juca Kfouri, one of Brazil's best-known sports commentators, told radio station CBN. Last year, dozens of members of another Corinthians' fan club, Gavioes da Fiel, invaded the team's training centre. Angered by the team's performance, they attacked employees and grabbed Peruvian striker Paolo Guerrero by his neck, forcing other players to flee into a locker room and barricade themselves in until police arrived.

"In the aftermath of Sunday's derby disaster the talk among fans was of summer incomings to reboot a blue machine that, all-of-a-sudden, looks as outdated as a Commodore 64. Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City risk losing star man Sergio Aguero should they slip out of the Premier League's top four . Aguero scores the first of his two goals during City's 4-2 defeat at the hands of rivals Manchester United . It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. The Argentine forward clinched the Premier League title for City with this striker against QPR in 2012 . Aguero wheels away in celebration after giving the City faithful inside the Etihad a moment to remember . Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain £38m for in 2011. Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. Aguero scores past United goalkeeper David de Gea to earn his 19th Premier League goal of the season . The City players look dejected during the 4-2 defeat which left their side fourth in the Premier League table . If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Manuel Pellegrini signed former Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony for £30million in January . April 19 West Ham United (H) April 25 Aston Villa (H) May 3 Tottenham Hotspur (A) May 10 Queens Park Rangers (H) May 17 Swansea City (A) May 24 Southampton (H) Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. The former Swansea City man, who cost just £10m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? City are reportedly targeting Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba as they look to strengthen this summer . The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Pellegrini's future as City boss is in doubt after a difficult 2014-15 campaign at the Etihad . Are they at fault for spending the best part of £200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash.","Manchester City have slipped to fourth in the Premier League table .

"An emotional David Raven reflected on a 'dream come true' after his last-gasp winner sent Inverness through to their first-ever William Hill Scottish Cup final at the expense of favourites Celtic. Defender Raven slotted home the deciding goal four minutes from the end of extra time as Caley stunned 10-man Celtic 3-2 at Hampden Park to set up a final showdown with Falkirk. The 30-year-old Raven, who has only managed a handful of goals in his entire career, struggled to describe how he felt following an eventful match which he admitted could have gone either way. David Raven (second right) celebrates with his Inverness team-mates following his extra-time winner . The celebrations continue on the pitch as Inverness rejoice in reaching the William Hill Scottish Cup final . He told Sky Sports: 'I don't know really, a bit emotional to be honest, got tears in my eyes. I thought it was just our day and to score the winning goal today is a dream come true. In a cup semi-final against Celtic, I can't believe it. 'It was topsy-turvy and it could have gone either way.' Celtic took an 18th-minute lead through Virgil van Dijk's brilliant free-kick and then had loud claims for a clear penalty turned down just before half-time when the ball struck Josh Meekings' hand a yard from goal. That was a key incident in the match, as was the penalty that was awarded to Inverness in the 55th minute which saw Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon sent off for bringing down Marley Watkins. Greg Tansey slotted home the penalty to make it 1-1 and Raven would end up settling the match right at the death after Edward Ofere and John Guidetti had made it 2-2 in extra time. The Caley defender hailed his late winner as 'a dream come true' ahead of the final against Falkirk . Celtic players stand dejected on the pitch with their hopes of a treble over following their 3-2 loss . Inverness boss John Hughes said: 'The sending off changed the game in Inverness' favour, but as I said before the game, what these boys have done for me since I came to the club, they deserve that today. 'I'm absolutely delighted to be there. 'Well done to the boys and supporters. On their final opponents, Hughes said: 'A small club, Falkirk have had some wonderful times there and it'll be a right good cup final, and hopefully it is for Scottish football.'","Inverness upset Celtic 3-2 in the Scottish Cup semi-final on Sunday .

"Fox Sports Australia will not take action against a freelance presenter who posted an Instagram picture of herself and a friend in blackface make-up. Briony Ingerson posted the image from an 'African-themed party' almost three months ago, writing that the costume was as a light-hearted tribute to a friend who was working on Network Ten program 'I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here!'. I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! aired on Network Ten and involved more than a dozen identities camping under the stars in South Africa's Kruger National Park. She used the hashtag #IHopeThisComesOff alongside the photo of herself painted in black, seemingly oblivious that people would take offence from her costume. It has since emerged that on April 11, Fox Sports Australia posted an image of a man dressed in blackface, as part of a competition which asked viewers to dress up as their favourite sports star. Sports presenter Briony Ingerson has been widely criticised for posting a photo with black face make up . On Tuesday the photo made headlines and Ingerson responded with a message on Twitter, insisting she had not meant to be offensive . The issue was flagged by journalism student Ahmed Yussuf who complained about the photo. He interned alongside Ingerson . Fox Sports Australia tweeted a photo of a man in black face on April 11, before the controversy surrounding Briony Ingerson began. It's understood the tweet was later deleted . 'No harm intended, just wanted to give our hardworking friend a giggle,' Ingerson wrote on Instagram. On Tuesday the photo made headlines and Ingerson responded with a message on Twitter, insisting she had not meant any harm. 'Sorry if you're upset by this, no harm was intended, it was an African themed party #NotAtAllRacist,' she wrote. A Fox Sports spokeswoman told AAP that they had only become aware of the photograph on Monday and it was unacceptable. 'She (Briony Ingerson) is deeply upset that she has offended people in the community as this was not her intent,' the Fox Sports spokewoman said. 'She is aware of how offensive and inappropriate her actions were. 'Fox Sports is satisfied that Briony is apologetic and will be making no further comment on the matter.' Ingerson is a freelance sports journalist who specialises in motorsports. She has presented for Fox Sports Australia as well as on 7Mate, Network Ten and SBS. A Fox Sports spokeswoman told AAP that they had only become aware of Briony Ingerson's photograph on Monday and the company know it was unacceptable . Jet James called for Fox Sports Australia to make an example of the Melbourne-based freelance presenter and terminate her employment with the company . John Patten was another member of the public who felt strongly about the presenter's 'ignorant' actions . The matter came to light after Fairfax reported a complaint from LaTrobe University journalism student Ahmed Yussuf, who worked as an intern alongside Ingerson. 'V hurt to see Briony Ingerson do #blackface. Feel disgusted and disappointed, especially having worked with her. #Racism is not okay,' Yussef tweeted. Yussuf told Fairfax that at first he tried to ignore the photo but finally felt as though he had to speak out. 'It's very difficult to say something about someone who could possibly be a contact in the future but I thought someone should say something,' he said. 'It was there for weeks and no one said anything.' Yussef says that Ingerson has now blocked him on Twitter following the widespread media response. Briony Ingerson explained that she was going to an African themed party and is '#NotRacistAtAll' Ben Williams pointed out that Ingerson should have been aware of how wrong her actions were . 'I read the comments between her friends and herself and it seemed very off-putting having blackface on in an Africa-themed costume party as if being black is something to be put on and taken off.' The photo has sparked outrage, with members of the public taking to social media to condemn her 'ignorant' actions. 'Far too many Australians are either openly or incredibly naively racist. Times like this I'm ashamed of my country,' tweeted Tom Read. 'It shouldn't take 11 WEEKS before something like this gets picked up. I wonder how many people saw it & thought it was ok?' 'I really don't understand how this still happens in Australia in 2015, especially after the Hey Hey incident in 2009,' Ben Williams wrote on Twitter. '@foxsportsaus - sack the girl and set an example will you! @BrionyIngerson - serious misjudgement and just disgusting,' Jet James wrote. 'So a TV 'personality' wears #blackface and is ignorant enough to attempt to justify it. Only in Aus! Sacked her yet @foxsportsaus?"" posted John Patten.","Briony Ingerson posted a photo of herself and a friend in 'blackface'

"A quadriplegic, former Indy Racing League driver got a chance to drive on the Long Beach Grand Prix road course track Sunday thanks to the creators of a modified 2014 Corvette C7 Stingray. When Sam Schmidt became paralyzed from the neck down after crashing during testing in Orlando in 2000, his team thought he would never walk, let alone, drive again, according to ESPN. Although he defied the odds last spring, driving on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Schmidt conquered a trickier task Sunday: navigating the twists and sharp turns of the famous street course in Long Beach. Overcoming: Sam Schmidt (photographed)  drove a sports car on the Long Beach Grand Prix road course Sunday despite being paralyzed from the neck down . Independent: Schmidt conquered a the 11-turn circuit Sunday in a modified 2014 Corvette C7 Stingray -- a vehicle which allowed Schmidt to navigate the car independently using only his head and mouth . Schmidt took to the course about an hour before the Grand Prix and did nearly two laps around the 11-turn circuit in the modified Corvette. He said it was an 'unbelievable experience.' 'Coming here for 25 years with my parents, I always wanted to race here, but never had the opportunity so it's a really, really special day,' he said. 'It's a totally different experience sitting here. There's bumps you don't see from the TV and video games don't do it justice.'

Arrow leads the development. The modified car includes integrated advanced electronics and a human-to-machine interface which allows quadriplegics -- like Schmidt -- to safely operate the vehicle under 'racetrack conditions,' according to Arrow's website. *Based on reports from Arrow. The car includes an infrared camera system, a sip/puff system, a computer system, GPS technology, and a safety system. 'This is probably the most fun and less stress that I'll see all day,' Schmidt said. 'Being on the stand is not as fun as this...In the IndyCar Series it's a team effort and this is a team effort with this group of engineers. It's pretty nice to being to drive this car again.' Drive: When Sam Schmidt (photographed before the accident) became paralyzed from the neck down after crashing during testing in Orlando in 2000, his team thought he would never walk, let alone, drive again . Schmidt reached a top speed of 80 mph at the track, which was less than what he reached at Indianapolis last spring. But this feat involved the tricky turns around Long Beach streets. Just one year after the life-changing crash, he founded Sam Schmidt Motorsports and in 2013 formed Schmidt Peterson Motorsports along with Ric Peterson.","Sam Schmidt drove a sports car on the Long Beach Grand Prix road course Sunday despite being paralyzed from the neck down .

"Cooperative weather and the efforts of hundreds of firefighters helped beat back flames Sunday that had threatened hundreds of homes near a Southern California dam. Evacuation orders were lifted just before dawn for about 300 homes in an area along the border of the cities of Norco and Corona, about 35 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. By midday, fire officials said they had contained 25 per cent of the fire, which had grown to 1.5 square miles. Flames burn just after nightfall in the Prado Dam Flood Control Basin adjacent to homes, foreground, as seen from Corona, Calif. Cooler overnight temperatures and low winds allowed fire crews to attack the blaze, increasing containment from 15 per cent, though on-the-ground conditions did not make that fight easy. The fire burned in the Prado Dam Flood Control Basin, where vegetation has not burned in decades, according to Capt. Mike Mohler of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. As a result, the area that is burning has up to 3 feet of 'duff' - needles, leaves and other combustible plant debris. Cooperative weather and the efforts of firefighters helped beat back flames Sunday that had threatened hundreds of homes near the Southern California dam . At the same time, California's drought means the basin has not held much water recently, Mohler said. Because the smoke was not blowing away, area residents were urged to stay indoors.

The former-four-star recruit was booked into the Alachua County Jail on Sunday on a charge of robbery with a firearm. He was held on $150,000 bond. Jail records didn't show whether he had an attorney. In a statement, Florida first-year head coach Jim McElwain said in a statement that he was aware of Jackson's actions, according to AL.com. 'We are aware of the news involving JC Jackson, and he is currently dealing with a serious issue,' he said. He added: 'We don't condone any of his actions, and it is not something that reflects on the expectations we have in the program. It is being handled accordingly due to the severity of his actions.' Jackson has been on the Florida Gators football team since last season. He was injured in the first game and took a redshirt . This is the third time since December that Jackson has made headlines for non-football-related activity. In December he was driving in his hometown with two other when someone in a passing vehicle began shooting at them. A bullet grazed Jackson during the shooting. Earlier that same month he and two fellow Florida football players, quarterback Treon Harris and cornerback Jalen Tabor were stopped for speeding on campus by university police. The University of Florida Police Department found two small bags of drugs in the car after reporting that the vehicle smelled like marijuana. Since the vehicle did not belong to any of the three athletes who were in the car at the time, none of them were charged.","Redshirt freshman JC Jackson, 19, was arrested on Saturday in Gainsville .

"Ian Wright has hailed Chelsea's up-and-coming star Jay Dasilva, claiming he is better than any current left back in the Barclays Premier League. The 16-year-old was part of the Chelsea Under 19 team that won the UEFA Youth League by beating Shakhtar Donetsk in Monday's final in Nyon, Switzerland. And former Arsenal and England striker Wright took to Twitter to praise him, saying: 'Congrats to Chelsea winning UEFA youth league. Jay da silva left back better player than any current prem left back.' Jay Dasilva has been praised by Ian Wright following his performances in the UEFA Youth League . Dasilva is better than any current Premier League left-back, according to Wright . Wright has predicted that four of the Chelsea side are set for a bright future in the game . In a later tweet, Wright also tipped Dasilva's team-mates Tammy Abraham, Charly Musonda and Charlie Colkett to enjoy bright futures in the game. Chelsea became the first English team to win the Youth League after two goals from captain Izzy Brown and another from Dominic Solanke led them to a 3-2 win. Dasilva, who hails from Luton and was signed by Chelsea aged 12, is an attack-minded left back who can also operate as a winger. Despite a slight build, he is able to make his presence felt and is quick going forward in possession of the ball and when tracking back.

Dominic Solanke celebrates after scoring Chelsea's second goal against Shakhtar Donetsk . He progressed quickly from the Under 15 team to the Under 18 side last season and helped Chelsea to their FA Youth Cup win over Fulham. He scored in the first leg at Craven Cottage. This season has seen further progress, with Dasilva making eight appearances in the Under 21 Premier League and nine in the Youth League run. He recently helped England's Under 17 team to this summer's European Championship finals and is set to feature in the tournament in Bulgaria next month. Abraham, the 17-year-old forward, has enjoyed a prolific season for the Chelsea Under 18 side, scoring 24 times in the league at that age group and adding four more in the Youth League. His six goals have helped Chelsea to a fifth FA Youth Cup final in six seasons - they will play Manchester City in the final, with the first leg scheduled for Monday.

"It was the sort of training ground accident that can happen to anyone, but it had far-reaching consequences for Philipp Lahm. So too, indirectly, for Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt. Lahm's tackle on a team-mate at Bayern Munich's training ground on the outskirts of the city appeared innocuous enough, until a scream of pain pierced the morning air and a frantic wave signalled he was in trouble. As players milled round him, and a physio inspected the damage, the call went out for expert medical help. There wasn't any. To the dismay of Pep Guardiola, there wasn't a single qualified doctor on site. Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt quit this week after a reported rift with Pep Guardiola . The pair fell out over an injury to Philipp Lahm during training as early as November last year . As Lahm lay on the turf with what was later diagnosed as a broken ankle, the physio tended to him as best he could, while an ambulance was summoned to take him to a local hospital. Muller-Wohlfahrt, meanwhile, was at his city centre clinic, nearly eight miles away. It was last November, and from that day on, the 72-year-old's days as head of Bayern's medical department were numbered. They finally ended after Bayern's Champions' League defeat at Porto, when Guardiola went public with his displeasure over recovery rates for injured players by blaming a lengthening injury list for his side's quarter-final first-leg demise. It was more than the world-renowned specialist could stomach, and he promptly walked away from the Bundesliga champions for a second time, taking the rest of his staff with him. He quit in high dudgeon once before, after a fall-out with Jurgen Klinsmann, but there will be no coming back this time. Not as long as Guardiola holds the reins. And that may just be for quite a while yet. The Bayern boss is aware Manchester City long to install him as replacement for Manuel Pellegrini, even if it means waiting another 12 months for his contract to expire, but the latest ructions at The Allianz Arena have evidently done nothing to increase their chances. Bayern  doctor Muller-Wohlfahrt is a world-renowned specialist and quit after Guardiola's injury complaints . The 72-year-old had been at Bayern for almost 40 years but is now unlikely to return to the Bundesliga club . Unseemly though his undermining of Muller-Wohlfahrt may have been, there was only ever going to be one winner. And, by all accounts, when his hand was raised in triumph, it strengthened his hold on power like never before. Dispiritingly for City, the former Barcelona manager reaffirmed, at his Friday press conference, that he will 'for sure' honour the remaining year on his contract, ruling out any hope of a deal being struck with Etihad bosses this summer. Beyond that, he could even commit himself to a further spell in charge, according to a Bayern insider, who told Sportsmail: 'There is no question that Bayern will do absolutely everything in their power to persuade Guardiola to sign another contract. 'There will be negotiations after the season is finished, and there is an air of confidence within the club that he will agree. It is far from certain, but, interestingly, the departure of Muller-Wohlfahrt makes it more probable, rather than less so. Muller-Wohlfahrt (fourth from left) sits behind Pep Guardiola during the defeat by Porto this week . Manchester City long to bring in Guardiola to replace Manuel Pellegrini but they may have to wait for him . 'That was a problem, because they had many disagreements over the treatment of injured players. Now he has gone, Guardiola is in a stronger position than ever. That is clear, because when Muller- Wohlfahrt said he was leaving, the club made no attempt to talk him out of it. They simply accepted it and said thanks very much. 'Pep has got his own way again, and that could play a part when they sit down in the summer to discuss a new deal.' So what went wrong between them? How could it be that a vastly- experienced and hugely-respected surgeon with a track record for rescuing stellar careers imperilled by injury failed to meet Guardiola's requirements as club doctor? Certainly, availability was a major issue. Sportsmail has learned that one of Guardiola's stipulations, after taking over from Jupp Heynckes, was that the club doctor should be at the training ground every single time the players were there. Dante, Sebastian Rode, Lahm and Robert Lewandowski (L-R) trudge off the pitch after defeat in Porto . Muller-Wohlfahrt has worked with the German national team as well as athletes including Usain Bolt . Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt has often courted controversy with his methods. He claims that a substance called Hyalart, which is extracted from the crest of cockerels, helps lubricate knee injuries and take away pain. He also swears by Actovegin, an amino acid preparation derived from calves' blood. In 2009, he prescribed more than 50 injections of goat's blood to St Johnstone striker Peter MacDonald for his hamstring injury. Among those to have been treated by him are Ronaldo, Usain Bolt, Michael Owen and Jose Maria Olazabal. Muller-Wohlfahrt claims to have administered more than one million injections, at least half of which have been to athletes. A stickler for detail, he wanted to ensure any mishap could be dealt with expertly at a moment's notice and made it clear it was an instruction to be adhered to by Muller-Wohlfahrt. It placed club bosses in a quandary, not for the last time, as Muller-Wohlfahrt pointed out he had a steady stream of high-profile patients to his city centre practice, not least the likes of Usain Bolt, and that he could ill-afford to desert his post to spend day after day at the club's training facility. Irked by Muller-Wohlfahrt's defiance, it soon became apparent to Guardiola that they were diametrically opposed when it came to policy over ushering players back from injury. In a nutshell, Guardiola wanted players declared fit and pencilled in for selection as rapidly as possible, whereas care and caution were the key words for Muller-Wohlfahrt. It drove Guardiola to distraction, according to the club insider, who said: 'Pep has never been the most patient about players' recovery time. If there is an injury, he expects it to clear up. He wants the players back on the pitch, but it wasn't happening. 'Muller-Wohlfahrt is the opposite. He takes the view that you have to be patient and allow the healing process to take its course. He wants a player to be in perfect condition when he returns and argues that rushing people back runs the risk of a fresh injury. Really, it's no wonder they were at loggerheads.' Guardiola wanted players declared fit as rapidly as possible, but Muller-Wohlfahrt wanted care and caution . Muller-Wohlfahrt prescribed a course of action for a nagging injury to Thiago Alcantara but was overruled. As a further insight into the core differences between the pair, Muller-Wohlfahrt prescribed a specific course of action for a nagging injury to Thiago Alcantara but was overruled. The midfielder suffered damage to the same area of his knee three times in quick succession, and Muller-Wohlfahrt was adamant he should attend the veteran medic's clinic in Colorado for specialised treatment. Guardiola was having none of it and, instead, arranged for Thiago to undergo treatment in Barcelona, where, to Muller-Wohlfahrt's exasperation, surgery was followed by recuperation and an eventual return to the Bayern squad. Usain Bolt was one of many athletes to benefit from Muller-Wohlfahrt's treatment at the London Olympics . Guardiola is now in the strongest position he has ever been at Bayern and he could agree a new deal there . If protesting to the Bayern boss was futile, trying to appeal to Thiago was just as pointless. His agent is none other than Guardiola's brother, Pere. The odds were stacked ever-higher against Muller-Wohlfahrt, and his resignation on Friday morning was merely confirmation the Guardiola empire is not about to be overthrown. City must now wait to see if the Spaniard's Bavarian rule is about to be extended, as forecast with growing confidence in Munich circles.","Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt quit this week .

"Pep Guardiola has denied claims of a dispute with former Bayern Munich club doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt, who quit the club on Thursday after 'being blamed' for the defeat by Porto. The 72-year-old, who had worked at Bayern for almost 40 years, sensationally quit the Bundesliga club, claiming 'the bond of trust is damaged', but Guardiola has played down claims of a feud. 'The reaction is on me, I was disappointed,' he told reporters in the wake of a shock Champions League quarter-final defeat by Porto. 'It was nothing to do with the doctor.

'I've been informed of the doctor's decision and I fully respect it. Nothing happened between us, it was his decision. Injuries are part and parcel of football, they're not the medical staff's fault.' Muller-Wohlfahrt's decision came after Bayern boss Guardiola appeared to imply that Wednesday's defeat was down to a lack of available players, commenting post-match: . 'We have players who were out a long time with injuries. Their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.'

"Paul Smith, having bravely lost his two challenges to Arthur Abraham in Germany, now finds himself in pole position for a third successive joust against a reigning world super-middleweight champion. Only this time the elder of Liverpool's fine family of four fighting brothers will not be boxing for a title, even though it is against a far more formidable champion.

"Randy Lerner will attend Aston Villa’s FA Cup final against Arsenal after missing the victory over Liverpool at Wembley because of a family bereavement. Villa chief executive Tom Fox said the American owner was delighted by the 2-1 win and upset he had not been able to make the trip across the Atlantic. Fox, who sacked Paul Lambert and hired Tim Sherwood, said the result can get rid of the doom and gloom that hung around the club. He backed Villa to have a chance of beating his old club Arsenal, where he was commercial director until last summer, on May 30. Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner is rarely seen at the club's games but is expected to make the FA Cup final . Lerner missed Villa's 2-1 win over Liverpool at Wembley, which included a goal from Fabian Delph (centre) Fox said: ‘Randy had a family bereavement. He has a very small family and his mother's sister passed away and he wasn't able to make it. ‘What does he think about it? He's ecstatic, I have emails on the phone. He will be here for the final. He was pretty upset he couldn’t be here. ‘This is something which can create a positive atmosphere and blows through the negativity and clears it out. I hope it is the beginning of something great. If we play the way we played today I think we'll have a chance. ‘People talk about football where confidence makes a big difference. Our performances the last few games have been good. This is a way for those performances to galvanise the club and get the fans to be really behind the club. ‘We have a lot of work to do, I have been very honest about that. We have a lot of work to do to put the club back into a place where this is a thing we can do on a much more regular basis. ‘Greg Dyke made a speech before the game and I wish all of our fans could have heard it. He talked about the history of Liverpool and Villa, seven FA Cups apiece, all the semi finals we've been in, and he talks about the club in a way the fans still see the club and a way we want people to see the club. ‘Here we are heading into a final with another great club.

Winning silverware is of more consequence, he insisted. ‘It could be great, I wasn’t envisaging it that way,’ he said. ‘I thought we'd build to it more slowly but the thing would be winning the FA Cup. It would be a such a positive emotional driver for what we want to do. I am more focused on that than what it means for Europa League qualification. ‘It's all about pride and I sat there at the end of the game and I was incredibly proud of the effort the players put in and for the supporters I thought we outshouted some of the loudest supporters in the world.’","Randy Lerner was expected to make a rare appearance for Cup sem-final .

"Izzy Brown has spoken of the incredible weekend that saw him inspire Chelsea's youth team to glory in the UEFA Youth League either side of a call-up to Jose Mourinho's first-team squad. The Blues' under 19 captain played the full 90 minutes of Chelsea's 4-0 semi-final win over Roma in Switzerland on Friday afternoon after learning that Mourinho wanted him on the bench for the Premier League clash at Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. So Brown flew back to London, watched from the Loftus Road dug-out as a late goal from Cesc Fabregas took Chelsea a step closer to the title, and then hopped back on a plane to Geneva. Izzy Brown has spoken of the incredible weekend after Chelsea won the UEFA Youth League on Monday . Brown was on the bench for Chelsea seniors for the Premier League clash at Queens Park Rangers on Sunday . But just a few hours later he was out in Nyon scoring twice and captaining his side in becoming champions . And clearly untroubled by the 'commuting', the 18-year-old scored twice in the 3-2 final win over Shakhtar Donetsk as Chelsea became the first English team to lift the Youth League trophy. After the triumph in Nyon, Brown told Sportsmail: 'I got a phone call at lunchtime (on Friday) and I was told I had to come back to England because the first team needed me on the bench. 'So I was a bit shocked because I wanted to play the final and I didn't know whether I'd get back or not. It's been a bit of a rush but I'm glad I was here and also glad I was on the bench.' Brown's close-range finish gave Chelsea a seventh-minute lead against Shakhtar in the final. Although the Ukrainians were gifted an equaliser when defender Andreas Christensen put through his own net, Chelsea took command after the break. Dominic Solanke (left) and Brown got the goals as Chelsea saw off Shakhtar Donetsk to take the trophy . First, Dominic Solanke headed in a Jeremie Boga cross to restore their lead and then Brown made sure of victory with a well-taken left-foot finish a few minutes later. Brown then had the honour of lifting the Lennart Johansson trophy as Chelsea followed in the footsteps of Barcelona last year. He added: 'It is an amazing achievement, we've come so far since the first game against Schalke. 'There's been lots of ups and downs through the tournament but we've stuck together and now we're European champions. We've got so many creative players, so many people who can score goals.' Brown had the honour of lifting the Lennart Johansson trophy as Chelsea followed in Barcelona's footsteps . Solanke ended the competition as leading scorer, with his 47th-minute header taking his tally to 12, and was understandably delighted. He said: 'It's a great tournament, i managed to do quite well. I finished as top goalscorer, which is an amazing achievement for me. 'Obviously playing against all these different teams in Europe, I've got to adapt to how they play and I think I'm scoring a lot of goals in that way and it's really good to do that.' Solanke ended the competition as leading scorer, with his 47th-minute header taking his tally to 12 . The England under 18 international was handed a taste of first-team action by Mourinho in October's Champions League tie with Maribor and he is hopeful of further opportunities in the future. 'It's a tough task at Chelsea to get into the first team but you've just got to keep working and see what happens,' he said.","Chelsea won the UEFA Youth League by beating Shakhtar Donetsk 3-2 .

"When these villagers in China spent £1,000 and hours of hard labour digging a new well, the least they expected was some fresh drinking water. But they were left disappointed after pumping the liquid to the surface, only to discover it was so polluted that they could set it on fire. Residents of Ansai, in Shaanxi Province, central China, said they could smell gas and petrol coming from the well, and blame a leak from a local petrol station, The People's Daily Online reports. Villagers in Ansai, Shaanxi Province, in central China, dug a 46m well in order to get fresh drinking water, but when the pumped it to the surface the found it was so polluted it could be set on fire . Local officials say they have now launched an investigation into how the water from the well, which cost £1,000 to build, became so polluted . Locals said they could smell  petrol when the water surfaced, and blame the pollution on a leak from a local gas petrol station, a claim which the owner denies . However, when Chinese officials investigated, they said they could find no trace of a spillage, leading some people to theorise that the villagers could have struck oil. However this is highly unlikely, as oil deposits only occur between 750 and 4,500m underground, and the well is only 46m deep. Tuo Zhijun, a villager in Ansai, said: 'Who knew when we turned on the pump, once the water was seeping through, everyone could smell gas and see oil slick.' Some locals have suggested that the lucky villager may have struck oil, but this is highly unlikely, as oil deposits typically occur between 750 and 4,5000m underground, and the well is only 46m deep . After drawing the first fresh water out of their new well, the villagers discovered they were able to set it on fire because it was so polluted . Local officials do not yet know exactly what substance is in the water, though they say they are conducting a specific investigation to discover the cause . ‘We suspect that there was an oil leak from a petrol station not far from here.’ However, Li Jianhua, the manager of the petrol station, refuted these claims, saying: ‘The authorities have already examined the place and nothing was wrong. 'There has not been any problems with the well in the petrol station either.' Local government officials in Ansai say they have already started a specific investigation. Intrigued locals take pictures of the flaming water near the site of the new well in Ansai, central China .","Villagers in Ansai, central China, spent £1,000 digging new 46m well .

"Real Madrid are keeping tabs on Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling. Bernabeu legend Zinedine Zidane, now managing the Spanish giants' Castilla B-Team but long tipped for the No 1 role, insists the club are looking for the world's best youngsters to add to their squad. Sterling would certainly fit the bill. The England winger, who has netted six times in the Premier League this season, is at loggerheads with the Anfield hierarchy over a new deal. Zinedine Zidane has revealed La Liga giants Real Madrid are keen on signing Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling . Zidane (left, pictured with Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti) has said Real are monitoring Sterling . Liverpool starlet Sterling has rejected an offer of £100,000 a week to extend his stay at Anfield . He rejected the most recent offer of £100,000 a week and has attracted interest from Liverpool's Premier League rivals Manchester City and Chelsea. But Zidane has revealed that the European Champions are also after Sterling, pointing to recent Real captures like Gareth Bale and Raphael Varane as proof of their commitment to snapping up the continent's premier young talent. 'We know who Raheem Sterling is, and of course we are monitoring him as a player,' Zidane said. 'There are very few players in the world who can improve the Real Madrid squad, so it is going to make sense we monitor the progress of the best young players in the world. 'We monitored Bale for over a year, the same with Isco and also Varane. 'We monitor many of the best young players in Europe, then if we feel they have something to offer Real Madrid we will contact their club and try and make the next step.' Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has admitted Liverpool may struggle to attract top players . Real Madrid have the splashed the cash on the likes of Gareth Bale and Raphael Varane in recent years . La Liga giants broke the world transfer record in August 2013 by forking out £86million on Bale . Sterling's boss Brendan Rodgers admitted after his side's dismal 4-1 defeat at Arsenal that Liverpool will have trouble attracting top players without Champions League football. He said: ‘It makes it difficult, there’s no doubt about that. Most players want to be in the Champions League. They want to play at the top level of the game and if you’re not in the Champions League it makes it difficult for you. We know that. ‘It’s going to be a little like this until we become more stable. We’ve got young players who are growing, getting more experience and then hopefully there will be a period where we qualify again. We want to be in the Champions League. That’s important and it is key for us. ‘It’s highly unlikely this year. But Liverpool is a great club. I said that before I came into it. It’s a phenomenal club that players want to play for.’","Exclusive: Zinedine Zidane has confirmed Real Madrid are keen on signing Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling .

"A German rapper turned Islamic State terrorist has released a propaganda  video where he calls on jihadist sleeper cells in Europe to carry out terrorist attacks. Denis Cuspert, 39, dubbed the 'Goebbels of ISIS', sings about planning attacks in Britain, Germany and France, rapping 'We want your blood'. This follows reports that British police have raised security levels ahead of  several World War I commemorative events taking place next week. Scroll down for video . Cuspert had been a relatively successful rapper under the name Deso Dogg before trading in his faux-gangster lifestyle to wage jihad on behalf of the Islamic State . In the slick three-minute video Cuspert sings 'in France deeds were done, in Germany the sleepers are waiting. We want your bloo . Anzac Day, which takes place on April 25, honours Australian and New Zealand soldiers who have died in war, originally observed in memory of troops who fought at Gallipoli in 1915. 'We already have protective security plans in place for major Anzac events in the UK but as a sensible precaution all forces have been asked to review security arrangements at related events,' a Scotland Yard spokeman told the Sunday Times. The propaganda production made by the 39-year-old, who now calls himself Abu Talha al-Amani, is filled with horrific footage of prisoners being beheaded and Jordanian pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh being burned alive. In the slick three-minute video, he sings: ‘In France deeds were done, in Germany the sleepers are waiting. We want your blood. ‘Even if you’re in Europe, wage your jihad. Allah will reward you, put an end to the filthy ones. Oh Allah destroy them.’ German rapper turned Islamic State terrorist Denis Cuspert has released a music video threatening his home nation with a Charlie Hebdo-like atrocity . The propaganda video contains staged footage of bombs being assembled and guns being prepped . Pictured is a grab from the video - a news footage clip of Paris attacker Amedy Coulibaly being shot by armed police . The video contains footage of passages from the Koran such as ‘kill the polytheists wherever you find them’ being highlighted, along with images of Western soldiers being treated in hospital and staged footage of bombs being assembled and guns being prepped. The number of Britons who have travelled to Iraq and Syria to join ISIS is twice than what has previously been reported. It is now thought that 1,600 Brits have joined ISIS, foreign intelligence officials told the Sunday Times. 'We believe that 1,600 is a very conservative estimate and we're seeing at least about five people leaving the UK for Syria anbd Iraq every week - and that's not to count the ones we don't know about,' an intelligence official said. According to the newspaper, about 500 have returned to the UK after heading to the Islamic State. News clips from last year’s Paris attacks carried out by Saïd and Chérif Kouachi – who murdered Charlie Hebdo staff members - and Amedy Coulibaly, who gunned down shoppers at a Jewish supermarket, also accompanie the singing. Cuspert had been a relatively successful rapper under the name Deso Dogg before trading in his faux-gangster lifestyle to wage jihad on behalf of the Islamic State. In February it was revealed that the militant - who has starred in several grisly beheading videos for the Islamic State - was being spied on for the FBI by a Syrian woman he thought was his wife. The spy transmitted critical information about the rapper and his ISIS colleagues before escaping to Turkey - where she was arrested and then turned over to the US, according to the German newspaper Bild. The paper said German and American intelligence sources confirmed the existence of the operation, Fox News reports. The unidentified woman fled Syria after her handlers told her it was no longer safe to continue the mission as militants had began to hunt and flush out infiltrators. She is now thought to be in the US. In February it was revealed that the militant - who has starred in several grisly beheading videos for the Islamic State - was being spied on for the FBI by a Syrian woman he thought was his wife . German newspaper Bild believe Cuspert may have been targeted for the operation because of his womanising past. In Germany he fathered three children by three different women, including one who he dumped just before embarking on his career as an ISIS poster boy. Cuspert arrived in Syria in 2013 from a so-called German jihadi colony in Egypt. In February the US added rapper Cuspert to its list of 'global terrorists' - freezing all his assets under US control and prohibiting any transactions with him in the future. The State Department said: 'Cuspert is emblematic of the type of foreign recruit ISIL seeks for its ranks -– individuals who have engaged in criminal activity in their home countries who then travel to Iraq and Syria to commit far worse crimes against the people of those countries.' Last November, Cuspert was compared to Nazi Minister for Propaganda Joseph Goebbels for his ability to appeal to young, disillusioned people in Europe while providing an alternative ideology. He spent several years as a major player in the Berlin hip hop scene under the name 'Deso Dogg' before embracing radical Islam. He has been known to oversee the group's sophisticated media operation and is reportedly using British fighters in an attempt to attract even more of their countrymen to the war-torn region. It is understood he leads a unit of German-speaking ISIS terrorists operating under the name 'The German Brigade of Millatu Ibrahim'.","Denis Cuspert sings 'in Germany the sleepers are waiting' in the video .

"Tim Sherwood said his Aston Villa team ‘bamboozled’ Liverpool and paid particular tribute to Christian Benteke, Fabian Delph and Jack Grealish, the teenager who shone on his Wembley debut. Villa earned a comeback win to book their place in the FA Cup final against Arsenal and end Steven Gerrard’s dream of lifting the famous old trophy on his birthday before bidding farewell to the club. Sherwood was dealt a blow by Gabby Agbonlahor’s failure to overcome a hamstring injury, but adapted his plans to brilliant effect as Liverpool struggled to cope with Villa’s fluid attack. Christian Benteke is congratulated by Aston Villa team-mate Fabian Delph after scoring at Wembley . The Villa manager said: ‘We changed the way we played. We normally go very direct, and use our pace down the sides, I think Liverpool would have expected us to do that. ‘But we played it short through the thirds and caused some problems in the little pockets of areas. They were a little bit bamboozled to be honest. ‘We needed to create a threat. I’m not sure Liverpool tried to second-guess what we were going to do but I don’t think they would have expected that.’ ‘We looked Liverpool and thought it might cause them a few problems if we played two No.10s with Jack Grealish and Charles N’Zogbia and it turned out that way. They got them on the back foot. ‘We needed to get players in support of Christian Benteke. I thought our game plan worked perfectly. We weren’t worried about what Liverpool were going to do. We just knew if we played like we can we were going to cause them a lot of problems.’ Brendan Rodgers conceded his side had been second best, but praised captain Gerrard, who had a late header cleared off the line. Aston Villa players chase Delph after the England midfielder made it 2-1 with 36 minutes left on the clock . ‘He was doing everything, everything he possibly could to help the team,’ said the Liverpool boss. ‘I thought he was excellent. But collectively we didn't perform well enough to get a victory.’ Sherwood kept faith with Grealish, the 19-year-old academy graduate, after handing him his first Premier League start against Queens Park Rangers a fortnight ago. He did not disappoint, playing a part in Benteke’s equaliser, then setting up Delph’s winner. ‘The bigger the stage the better he plays, the more he relishes it,’ said Sherwood. ‘That’s the sign of a good talent. Jack’s someone I looked at before I was at the club and when I’ve seen him in training, if you give him an instruction he sticks to the plan. He’s got a big future at the football club.’ Delph and team-mate Ashley Westwood celebrate their FA Cup win over Liverpool at Wembley . Grealish, who wears children’s shinpads and socks rolled down, won two free-kicks for his team through dribbling with the ball. ‘He’s very durable,’ added Sherwood. ‘You should see the size of his legs, he’s still a kid, he’s still learning. He takes more kicks in training than he does on the pitch so he’ s getting a lot of practice fending off those kicks – he probably needs bigger pads!’ Benteke scored his ninth goal in seven games to level Philippe Countinho’s opening goal, before Delph found the net for the second time under Sherwood, following his quarter-final goal against West Bromwich Albion. He failed to score under Paul Lambert this season. ‘When I came to the club Fabian Delph had just signed a new contract, he had an opportunity to go to some of the teams in the top four. He showed a lot of loyalty to Aston Villa. I need characters like that, who put themselves on the line, show that spirit. Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho is mobbed by his team-mates after opening the scoring . ‘I’ve never seen him have a bad game here at Wembley for England and he’s not had a bad one today, so hopefully he plays well in the final. ‘He can add goals to his game, he has so much energy he can get into the final third and score. He’s nicked a couple of goals for me already. I just want to encourage him to do that and then he’ll be too expensive for anyone to buy!’ On Benteke, Sherwood added: ‘He’s done that consistently for me. When I first come in I couldn’t believe they’d only scored 12 goals with that strike force. I saw something wrong and viewed the tapes and saw they weren’t getting the service.’ Coutinho spreads his arms out wide after scoring during his side's surprise FA Cup defeat . Sherwood praised Villa’s 32,000 fans and turned his attention to Arsenal. ‘They were fantastic. It’s easy to support your team when they’re winning but even at 1-0 down I thought they were great and dragged the boys back. ‘I watched the other semi-final yesterday and I saw how calm Arsene Wenger was after the game. But he probably realises there’s nothing won. ‘I’m sorry I can’t be Arsene Wenger after that final whistle, I was just delighted and I had to spill out them emotions. ‘We’ll be the underdogs, the pressure is on Arsenal, they’re the holders and they’ll want to win it again. We realise we’ve got a lot of hard work between now and then to secure our Premier League safety and then come back here and take the game to Arsenal.’ Benteke leaps in the air after levelling the scoreline  by hitting the back of the net in the 36th minute .","Tim Sherwood paid tribute to his bamboozling side after Wembley win .

"Nottingham Forest will make a renewed move for Blackburn's £10million-rated striker Jordan Rhodes this summer.

"Striker Jay Hart, 24, has been sacked after he was filmed having sex with a supporter in the manager's dugout while wearing a Clitheroe FC tracksuit . A semi-professional footballer has been sacked by Clitheroe FC after he was filmed having sex with a supporter in the manager's dugout while wearing a club tracksuit. Striker Jay Hart, 24, could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde still in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. The 73rd minute substitute for the Lancashire non-league side was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside, on Saturday afternoon, was shared on social media. His team had just suffered a 4-1 defeat at Mossley's Seel Park stadium in the final game of the season which was billed as a 'ladies day' to attract more female supporters. The face of the blonde fan cannot be seen in the close-up footage. Hart was sacked by the club, which play in Evo-Stik Division 1 North, within hours of the footage being shared to fans. His girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who has two young children, slammed those responsible for filming and sharing the clip. Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' One person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first. He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed. 'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.' Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute'. She said: 'I can't have somebody wearing the Clitheroe FC tracksuit bringing us down. 'It has brought the club into disrepute and it's not proper for him to scupper our reputation. I expect our players to act professionally. 'It was brought to my attention on Saturday night and dealt with through the management. I did offer to speak to him myself but Simon (Garner, the manager) said he would take care of it.' The footballer  could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde still in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs . Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute' Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground. 'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them. 'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done. 'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that. 'Football is only a small part of it. If he had thought about what would have happened when he did it, he wouldn't have done it. He will pay for it. 'When I spoke to him, he sounded very apologetic about it. I'm disappointed for him. He will regret what he did and it was totally wrong.' Mr Hart and his girlfriend could not be reached for comment. No-one from Mossley AFC was available for comment yesterday.","Striker Jay Hart, 24, was caught having sex with supporter after 4-1 defeat .
