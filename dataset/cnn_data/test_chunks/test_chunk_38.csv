"Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. The Crown Prosecution Service has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that Janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer’s disease. But now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an April 9 note to Lords authorities. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Lord Janner, who will not face child sex charges because he has dementia, with his daughter, rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner . Signed: The letter Lord Janner signed on April 9. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons . The former Labour MP, 86, claimed more than £100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. He has not attended the Lords since detectives raided his North London home in December 2013. Last October he took a formal leave of absence from Parliament, allowing him to resume his duties after giving three months’ notice. New rules which came into effect last May provide a way for peers to retire permanently while keeping their titles and certain perks. But Janner requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior Lords official 12 days ago. A House of Lords spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself, but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his. Simon Danczuk, the Labour politician who exposed the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith’s horrific abuse of boys, said it was not right for Janner to stay in the Lords yet avoid court. ‘If you are putting yourself forward to remain a legislator, then surely you are fit enough to be tested before the law,’ he said. ‘If he has got a leave of absence from the Lords, that implies that he may get well. Why isn’t he retiring? It makes a mockery of it all. He is bringing the House of Lords into disrepute almost single-handedly.’ The Crown Prosecution Service faced widespread criticism after announcing that Janner (pictured) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer’s disease . Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, added: ‘He couldn’t have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis. ‘But if he isn’t compos mentis, there’s no way he should be anywhere near our legislature. How can they say he’s not fit to stand trial for the most serious of crimes when he himself has argued that age should not be a barrier to prosecuting Nazi war criminals? ‘It stinks of the Establishment covering up and ensuring he doesn’t have to take the stand in public. This is a cover-up, there can be no question about it.’ Janner’s alleged victims have accused him of preying on boys at care homes around his former Leicester West constituency. He was suspended by Labour after the CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. Allegations against the peer were first made public in 1991 during the trial of Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children’s homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. After Beck was jailed, many other politicians spoke out in support of Janner in a Commons debate led by Leicestershire North West Tory MP David Ashby. Mr Ashby, 74, who stood down from Parliament in 1997 after being caught up in the Major government’s sleaze scandals, appeared to repeat his backing for the peer yesterday. ‘Of course I didn’t know anything at the time,’ he said from his home in South-West London. ‘The man has dementia and should be left alone.’ Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Lord Janner's QC son . Prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the Janner case. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Labour peer’s QC son. Neil Moore, who was based at the 23 Essex Street chambers where Daniel Janner works, was consulted by Mrs Saunders before she concluded not to prosecute. Senior police officers have privately raised concerns with her about Mr Moore’s involvement in the decision-making process. But a spokesman for the UK’s top prosecutor said she made the decision alone and that Mr Moore informed her of the connection before any discussions took place. She said Mr Moore was a barrister of the highest integrity and had not spoken to Mr Janner for two years. The potential for a conflict of interest is unhelpful for Mrs Saunders as she tackles the aftermath of her controversial decision. Last week it was revealed she over-ruled an expert in child abuse cases by deciding not to charge Janner. Eleanor Laws QC recommended a ‘trial of the facts’ in the defendant’s absence to ‘get to the bottom of the allegations’. A CPS spokesman said: ‘It is the DPP’s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what the DPP has done.’","Lord Janner told the Lords he wanted to remain a peer earlier this month .

"Flying for business or pleasure is one of the most thrilling experiences in the world, but it remains full of mystery for the average traveller. Curious passengers have burning questions every time they step foot on a plane – from whether pilots require a key to start a plane to where flight attendants sleep on long-haul flights. MailOnline Travel spoke to a number of experts to debunk some of the myths that exist and answer some of travellers’ frequently asked questions about planes. Scroll down for video . Once a pilot initiates the sequence to start a modern plane, the remaining steps are done automatically . How do pilots start a plane? It’s not as simple as turning a key or pushing a single button. Starting a plane is ‘a little more complicated’ than starting a car, said Captain Piers Applegarth, a representative of the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA). The retired training captain said an air start motor rotates the jet engines before adding fuel and starting the ignition. He said: ‘This means that there are a few levers and buttons that need to be moved. On modern aircraft, most of this is done automatically once the start sequence is initiated but a pilot can still start it manually.’ Flight attendants eat the same meals that are provided to passengers if the airline bothers to feed them at all . Is the crew served the same food as passengers? If meals are provided by the airline, pilots do not eat the same reheated chicken or pasta dishes that are served to passengers in economy. To reduce the risk of food poisoning, the captain and co-pilot usually eat different meals, said Mr Applegarth. Like passengers, the flight crew can bring their own food on board, but the meals provided to them are the same or variations of the meals provided to passengers in business class. Caterers will sometimes load meals designated specifically for the crew, said Patrick Smith, a pilot and author of Cockpit Confidential. He said: ‘At my airline we are given a menu prior to departure and will write down our entree preferences – first choice, plus at least one alternate. ‘Eating in the cockpit can be messy, so on international flights I usually take my meals in the cabin, on my rest break. ‘With potential illness in mind, pilots are encouraged to eat different entrees, but this is not a hard and fast rule. In practice it comes to down to your preferences and what’s available.’ Flight attendant Sarah Steegar, who works for a major US airline, said if – ‘and that’s a big if’ – an airline provides food to cabin crew it will be the same food that is served to passengers. But it’s rare for some airlines to provide meals to flight attendants on flights under 12 hours, she added. ‘If there are meals left over we can have that. Many of us try to bring our own food, but it’s a challenge, considering periods of time with no refrigerators and different liquid restrictions and customs laws. ‘Fun fact: the UK is the most difficult when it comes to trying to bring food for ourselves.’ The Airbus A350 has private sleeping quarters for flight attendants on long-haul flights . Where do pilots and cabin crew sleep and go to the loo? Planes that fly long-haul routes which require more than two pilots usually contain private bunks for the flight crew, said Mr Applegarth. In other cases pilots try to catch some shut-eye in special rest seats allocated for them within or near the cockpit, or within the passenger cabin, he added. Mr Applegarth said: ‘Generally flights less than about 10 hours and 30 minutes only carry two pilots. For longer flights extra pilots are carried so that each pilot can have a chance to sleep and be rested for the landing.’ The Airbus A380, which is the world’s largest passenger airliner, has private sleeping quarters below its decks which flight attendants use for rest. Mr Smith said: ‘Flight attendants also work in shifts, and similarly to the pilots their rest quarters can either be a designated block of cabin seats or a separate room somewhere. ‘Many flight attendant rest quarters are located in the far aft of the plane, above or below the main deck, and can accommodate six or more cabin crew simultaneously.’ When nature calls, flight and cabin crew on most planes use the same toilets as passengers. The Boeing 747, the original jumbo jet, has a lavatory just for pilots. Prior to any flight the crew will verify that the toilets have been serviced and the waste tanks are empty . What happens if a toilet’s tank fills up? The toilets cannot be emptied in the sky, so that means all of the human waste is stored on board until the plane lands and a ground crew empties the tanks. ‘If the toilet becomes full then it is out of action and the flight attendants block out the toilet so it can't be used,’ said Mr Applegarth. Prior to any long-haul flight the crew will verify that the toilets have been serviced and the waste tanks are empty, Mr Smith added. He said: ‘It seldom happens, but if a particular lavatory tank fills or overflows en route, that lav will be closed off. It's extremely unusual for all of the lavs to become unusable – a serious situation that could result in the flight being diverted.’ Pilots monitor multiple frequencies and occasionally chat with other pilots about turbulence . Do commercial pilots communicate with other pilots during a flight? Mr Applegarth said pilots are always monitoring multiple frequencies and occasionally chat with other pilots who are in the air. He said: ‘We are always listening out on one frequency that air traffic are using and we use another radio tuned to a special frequency to listen out for aircraft which may have an emergency. ‘We also have a chat frequency that we can use to share information such as turbulence.’ The amount of fuel that is consumed depends on the aircraft type, altitude, flight path and weather . How much jet fuel is required? A jet engine typically burns about 2,400 pounds (approximately 1,100 litres) of fuel per hour, with planes carrying a lot more fuel than required for the individual trip. Mr Applegarth said: ‘For a flight we load an amount of fuel that is the sum of the fuel needed to fly the route, an extra amount added for contingency – for instance, in case we have to hold – some extra fuel so that we could divert to another airfield and we also have to land with a minimum amount of fuel even if we used all the fuel just mentioned. ‘So after a flight we always have a minimum of fuel on board. On top of this, pilots can also decide to add extra fuel for each trip if they think it will be needed above and beyond that above.’ Mr Smith said the amount of fuel that is consumed depends on the aircraft type, altitude, flight path and weather. A Boeing 767 on a flight from London to New York would burn about 75,000 pounds of jet fuel (34,020 litres), while a Boeing 747 or an Airbus A380 might use twice that amount, he said. Condensation trails are similar to the fog that results when a person exhales on a cold day . Why do planes leave long white trails in the sky? These condensation trails form when humid exhaust from jet engines cools very quickly in colder and dryer air at higher altitudes. Mr Smith said: ‘It's not unlike the fog that results when you exhale on a cold day. In other words, contrails are clouds. ‘Water vapour, strange as it might seem, is a by-product of the combustion within jet engines, which is where the humidity comes from.’ 'Not even the world's strongest man would be able to open' a plane door in mid-air, said one expert . What would happen if a plane’s door suddenly opened mid-flight? This ranks among passengers’ biggest fears, but Mr Applegarth said it is extremely unlikely, if not impossible, for someone to open the door as the pressure inside the plane is much greater than the pressure outside. He said: ‘This means the door is being forced closed. Not even the world's strongest man would be able to open it.’ Mr Smith added: ‘In addition to any mechanical latching, most aircraft doors open inward before they open outward, and like a drain plug they are held in place by the forces of the pressurised cabin. ‘If a door were to open somehow the result would be a very quick decompression, though in all likelihood not a destructive or catastrophic one.’ Margins on the average economy class ticket are similarly thin, said pilot and author Patrick Smith . How much money does an airline pocket from each ticket sale? A recent Travelzoo study found that British Airways’ profit margin for each £690 ticket it sold for a flight from London to New York was just £4.24, accounting for 0.61 per cent of the overall cost. Almost the entire cost of the return flight went towards taxes, surcharges and operating costs. Mr Smith said budget airlines probably make nothing from their super-cheap promotional fares, and margins on the average economy class ticket are similarly thin. ‘Margins on a premium-class long-haul fare costing thousands of pounds, on the other hand, will be much higher,’ he said.","Flying is a thrilling experience but is full of mystery for most passengers .

"The U.S. put the first man on the moon, but in a strange twist of history it appears the Russians may have beat America in settling Oregon. Experts proposed this new theory in a recently released 200-page report on the Molalla Log Cabin, a structure they believe could have been built as early as 1795 - ten years before Lewis and Clark reached the Pacific Ocean. Historic building repairer Gregg Olson and architectural historian Pam Hayden have been analyzing the log cabin for seven years and say it is unlike anything else found in Oregon. Secrets hidden in wood: Experts believe the Molalla Log House (above) was constructed as early as 1795 - a decade before Lewis and Clark reached the Pacific Ocean . One of a kind: The construction of the log cabin is unlike pioneer building methods at the time - suggesting it was instead made by foreigners . Russians in America: Historic building repairer Gregg Olson and architectural historian Pam Hayden believe the house could have been used by a small settlement of Russians sent to the Willamette Valley as farmers to feed fur traders in Alaska . Passion project: Gregg Olson (pictured), of Historic Building Repair, has spend seven years working on the Molalla Log Cabin . The cabin's intricate construction is not consistent with pioneer building methods, suggesting it was created by foreigners, and more specifically Russians. The way the logs are tightly interwoven, secured without nails and leaving no gaps to fill, is similar to Russian log cabins of the same time period, when Catherine the Great was sending envoys to Alaska to boost the fur trade. Olson and Hayden hypothesize that the 18-foot-wide cabin could have been a home for a small group of 10 to 50 Russian settlers sent to Oregon's Willamette Valley as farmers to feed the fur trappers on Alaska's Kodiak Island. Looking for a home: Above, a view of the cabin before its roof collapsed and it was moved indoors in 2008. Olson and Hayden are currently trying to find a permanent place to house the cabin . The first mobile home: Olson discovered that the original builders of the cabin wrote numbers into the boards, so that the structure could be disassembled and reassembled . Expert craftsmanship: The boards fit perfectly together so that nothing is needed to fill in the gaps and winterize the structure for winter . Many uses: Throughout its storied life, the Molalla Log Cabin has been used as a home, animal shelter, machine shed and granary . Preserved: The structure was made a historical landmark in 1991 and moved in doors in 2007 when the wood was starting to succumb to the elements . Current home: Above, the structure as it sits today in a storage facility where Olson has been working to preserve the cabin . 'The unique construction and extraordinary craftsmanship of the Molalla Log House offer fascinating clues to a mystery that we didn't even know existed about the earliest white exploration and settlement of the Pacific Northwest,' Peggy Moretti, executive director of Restore Oregon, a non-profit helping fund the research, told the Oregonian. 'It may well add a new chapter to our history and we hope more evidence will be uncovered to further substantiate Pam and Gregg's very compelling theory,' Moretti added. Olson and Hayden are now hoping to find a permanent location to house the structure, as well as someone with a deeper knowledge of European construction to analyze the cabin. Russian expansion: Russian merchant Grigory Shelikhov founded a fur trading settlement on Kodiak Island in 1784. Above, a rendering of the port . Business on the Alaska frontier: Above, a 1794 drawing of the Russian fur trading post in Kodiak, Alaska . Tsarina: Russia's Catherine the Great encouraged the expansion of her empire to Alaska for fur trading . Above, a map shows where Russian traders set up fur trading business in Alaska, and their possible farming settlement near Molalla Oregon . Throughout its storied life, the Molalla Log Cabin has been used as a home, animal shelter, machine shed and granary. It was made a historic landmark in 1991 and moved to a storage facility in 2008 to protect it from further erosion. The oldest evidence of habitation in are the Fort Rock and Paisley Caves in Lake County, Oregon, which date back 13,200 years. By 8,000 BC there were settlements throughout the state. The first Europeans to venture to Oregon were led by Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo in 1543. By the 1770s, Oregon had become a valuable port for trading to Asia. In the wake of Lewis and Clark's expedition, which reached the Pacific Ocean in November 1805, French Canadian trappers and missionaries started arriving in the eastern part of the state. Their presence in Oregon's early pioneer history is evidence in the many French names throughout the state including Malheur Lake, the Grade Ronde and Deschutes rivers and the city of La Grande.","New report says Molalla Log Cabin could have been built as early as 1795 .

"An Ohio police officer has been praised for not firing at an armed double murder suspect as he charged at him during a terrifying incident caught on a bodycam. Former Marine Jesse Kidder was in a patrol car chasing Michael Wilcox, who allegedly gunned down is fiance and best friend, in New Richmond on Thursday when they stopped and continued the confrontation on foot. The 27-year-old accused killer then started sprinting towards Kidder, asking him to shoot. The officer had been warned by dispatchers before he arrived at the scene that the suspect might try 'suicide by cop'. Former Marine Jesse Kidder (right) has been praised for 'restraint and maturity' after he refused not to use deadly force against an armed double murder suspect. He had only been on his Ohio police force a year . Terrifying bodycam footage shows Kidder aiming at Michael Wilcox, 27, following a police chase. Wilcox, accused of gunning down two people, was also armed . At one point Wilcox said: 'Shoot me or I'll shoot you', but the Purple Heart winner refuses and responds by saying: 'I don't want to.' Eventually the suspect surrendered and lay on the ground with his hands outstretched as backup arrived, allowing Kidder's partner to handcuff him. The footage shows Kidder's gun aiming at Wilcox throughout the encounter. The officer told Cincinnati's WLWT: 'I was trying to open a dialogue with him. 'I don't want to shoot you, get on the ground,' but he wasn't having it. 'He got towards my face right as I lost balance. I'm thinking, at this point, that if he goes into attack me, that I'll have to use deadly force to defend myself.' Despite the tense confrontation, which could have quickly turned deadly, Kidder said he had to make sure his decision was correct. 'Law enforcement officers all across the nation have to deal with split-second decisions that mean life or death. I wanted to be absolutely sure before I used deadly force.' After the clip surfaced, Richmond Police Chief Randy Harvey, led the response for the cop's actions. 'For him to make the judgment call that he did shows great restraint and maturity,' he said. Wilcox, who allegedly gunned down is fiance and best friend, ran at Kidder (right) and asked the rookie to shoot him in New Richmond on Thursday. He has since been arrested and is being held on a $2m bond (mugshot left) 'This video footage, it eliminated all doubt that this officer would have been justified if in fact it came to a shooting.' Kidder, who did two tours of duty in Iraq, also revealed that a member of his family gave him the body cam after Michael Brown was shot dead by Darren Wilson in Ferguson last August. Harvey is now fundraising so all his cops can wear the devices. Wilcox was being held on Saturday on a $2m bond. Kidder's actions come in the midst of controversy and protests around the country over police officers shooting suspects dead. As Wilcox gets closer, Kidder refuses to shoot him, despite the suspect's attempt to try suicide by cop . Eventually the suspect surrendered and lay on the ground with his hands outstretched as backup arrived, allowing Kidder's partner to handcuff him .","Officer Jesse Kidder was confronted by Michael Wilcox, 27, in Ohio .

"We're always hearing about the latest 'superfoods' - and how they could have a powerful effect on our health and wellbeing. And while the term 'superfood' might be thrown around a little too freely sometimes, there are some fruits and seeds that really are a power-house of nutritional value. Here, I reveal which ones are worth adding to your shopping basket today... Scroll down for video . Sour cherries contain high levels of antioxidants and as a result are anti-inflammatory, can help a person sleep and can improve recovery after a sports injury, Dr Sally Norton said . TART CHERRIES . What are the benefits? Tart or sour cherries  have been found to contain high levels of antioxidants. As a result the benefits  include anti-inflammation, boosted sleep, and improved sports recovery. Reports have suggested that an increased intake of tart cherries could help to reduce certain post-workout side-effects, such as muscle aches, inflammation and weakness. AVOCADO . What are the benefits? More than just the main ingredient in guacamole, avocados seem to be having a real moment in the spotlight, and it's not surprising. They're a great source of healthy, mono-saturated fats – which have been known to help lower bad cholesterol, and as a result, reduce our risk of heart attack and stroke. In fact, a recent study has suggested that combining a moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day could actually lower your levels of bad cholesterol by more than a low-fat, or moderate-fat diet without avocados. Avocados are a great source of healthy, mono-saturated fats, which have been shown to lower bad cholesterol and reduce a person's risk of heart attack or stroke . CRANBERRIES . What are the benefits? As many of you will know, cranberries have been used for years as an aid against urinary tract infections. But studies have suggested these berries could also have a wide range of other benefits – from improving our heart health, helping to prevent certain cancers, to boosting our oral health and helping to reduce infections. What helps to make them just so good for us are the polyphenols that are present in those little red berries. Polyphenols have been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, to name just a few. Just be careful where you get your cranberry intake from, as cranberry juice and juice drinks are often full of sugar. Polyphenols found in cranberries are reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Studies have shown they can improve heart health and help prevent certain cancers . BLUEBERRIES . What are the benefits? With their high levels of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, blueberries have been linked to all kinds of health benefits, including heart health, cancer prevention, enhanced brain function and improved eyesight. And if that's not enough, some studies have suggested that the antioxidants in blueberries could help to delay the ageing process – a much cheaper alternative to all those anti-ageing creams. PUMPKIN SEEDS . What are the benefits? We all know how nutritious pumpkins are, but there's even more to be said for the pumpkin seed. It provides great levels of protein, fibre, manganese, magnesium, and phosphorous, and is a rich source of zinc - important for immunity, cell growth and division, as well as sleep, mood, and eye and skin health. It's not surprising it's been dubbed a 'superseed'. A handful of these little seeds make a great, nutrient-packed snack, or add them to your porridge for a tasty nutrient boost. Blueberries, left, have been linked to a wide range of health benefits including improved heart health, cancer prevention and improved eyesight. And pumpkin seeds, right, dubbed 'superseeds', are thought to help a person sleep, improve their mood and boost eyesight . CHIA SEEDS . What are the benefits? Seed du jour, the chia seed has seen a steep rise in popularity over the past couple of years - unsurprising, given its high levels of nutrients and low-calorie intake. Loaded with antioxidants, soluble fibre and minerals, chia seeds are also a source of omega-3 - though not as easily used by our bodies as that obtained from fish - and contain more calcium, ounce for ounce, than milk. If you're after a easy way to add chia seeds into your diet, try out our simple, creamy chia porridge recipe. Sprinkle the seeds on to porridge that has been mixed with low-calorie, but vitamin-rich rice milk, and you’ve got yourself a healthy, creamy, nutrient-packed breakfast.

"Unwilling: The British Medical Association also found nearly two-thirds of GPs were not willing to join into larger groups to ensure one surgery in an area was open on Saturdays and Sundays . GPs are in revolt over Government plans for them to offer patients appointments seven days a week. Almost all family doctors polled in a new survey said they do not think their own practice should open on weekends. And nearly two-thirds are not even willing to consider forming groups with other surgeries to ensure that at least one in the area is open to patients on Saturdays and Sundays. The Government has tried to encourage GPs to offer out-of-hours appointments through a scheme known as the Prime Minister’s Challenge Fund, launched in 2013. Surgeries have been urged to form into groups of 20 to 30 to ensure that between them at least one stays open in the evenings and at weekends. The results of early trials published last month showed that among 34 practices taking part in the scheme in Central London, the number of patients going to A&E dropped by between 8 and 10 per cent. But a survey of 15,560 GPs by their union, the British Medical Association, found 63 per cent were opposed to forming networks with other surgeries to open seven days a week. Some 94 per cent were against their own practice opening every day. Just 2 per cent were in favour, while the remainder didn’t know. The survey also found that 67 per cent want to make the standard ten minute appointment longer to give them more time to properly care for patients. And 93 per cent said their heavy workload has negatively affected patient care. This is mainly because they do not have the staff or the resources to provide appointments to the increasing numbers seeking them. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the BMA’s GP Committee, said: ‘GPs want to provide better services and spend more time with their patients, especially the increasing number of older people who often have a range of multiple health needs that require intensive, coordinated care. 'Unfortunately, this landmark poll highlights that GPs’ ability to care for patients is being seriously undermined by escalating workload, inadequate resourcing and unnecessary paperwork. Drop: A trial period opening GPs surgeries seven days a week found the numbers going to A&E fell . ‘While there is a willingness from GPs to look at offering extended hours, more than nine in ten GPs do not feel that their practice can provide blanket seven day services when GPs are struggling to provide even basic care to their patients. ‘GPs also feel it is more important to provide longer consultations.’","Two thirds are also not willing to consider joining into a group to ensure at least one surgery in an area is open on Saturdays and Sundays .

"It is a fascinating view of exactly what goes into a modern smartphone - and how Samsung does business. The Chipworks site has posted this amazing image revealing the internals of the firm's Galaxy S6, which goes on sale on April 10th. The internals reveal Samsung used more of its own chips to power the new Galaxy S6 smartphone than it did for the predecessor S5, according to an early teardown report, in a blow to U.S. chip supplier Qualcomm. The teardown shows, from the front, the screen, logic board holder, battery, logic board with processor, camera, rear case and antenna. Samsung is not only using its own Exynos mobile processor, as had been widely reported, but also decided to rely on its in-house semiconductor business to source other parts, including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips, Ottawa-based consultancy Chipworks said. Samsung is counting on its new flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge phones to help revive earnings momentum after a disappointing 2014. Strong sales of system chips such as its Exynos processor could also help boost earnings, analysts and investors say. The Galaxy S6 also comes with Samsung's Shannon modem chip, U.S. phone carrierAT&T said on its website. 'It's pretty clear if they're using Shannon for the modem for AT&T that they're trying to use all-Samsung silicon,' said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. 'With their market share going down they're under pressure to increase profit margins.' The findings suggest a deeper loss of business for Qualcomm in the new generation of Samsung's flagship handsets than anticipated previously. Teardown reports of the predecessor Galaxy S5, released last year, showed the U.S. chipmaker supplied several components that Samsung has supplanted with its own this year, based on the phone Chipworks investigated. Samsung's new S6 and S6 Edge: The phones are also the first to feature dual-standard wireless charging technology built inside the handsets, and will battle the iPhone and HTC's One . Qualcomm said in January that a key customer declined to use its new Snapdragon processor in an upcoming flagship phone presumed to be Samsung's Galaxy S6. But it had been unclear whether Samsung would drop Qualcomm's modem chips as well. Qualcomm is the industry leader in LTE, the most advanced modem technology, but Samsung, Intel, MediaTek and others have developing their own offerings. Samsung and Qualcomm did not immediately reply to requests for comment.","Samsung previously relied on other firms to make its chips .

The plan also shows the air burst at under half a mile up over the city and the subsequent shockwaves that the explosion would create. A second plan, titled 'survival manoeuvres', expands on the initial diagram to show the flight paths of support planes The Great Artiste and Necessary Evil. The diagram concludes with a handwritten note: 'Caution – stay at least 2/3 miles away from the atomic cloud at all times.' Auctioneer Bonhams expects the drawings to fetch £26,000 in two lots when they go under the hammer as part of Captain Lewis's archive of material in New York on April 29. The collection, being sold by his son Stephen, also includes a copy of Lewis's unofficial eye-witness account of the Hiroshima mission, which he disguised as a letter to his parents, which alone could sell for £40,000. Also for sale are Lewis's two log books from the war noting flightplans, duration, type of plane, engines, and horsepower with a column for remarks. They are tipped to fetch £130,000.

"Sharon Winters was searching for her soulmate when she met Kevin Hawke on an online dating site - but less than two weeks later she was dead after he stabbed her in a brutal knife attack. Now her brother Stephen Robinson, 44, from Wirral, Merseyside, is speaking for the first time since his sister's murder, to warn other women to be careful when looking for love online. The father-of-seven said: 'She was a lonely heart just wanting love. That animal preyed on her caring nature.' Sharon Winters, pictured here with her brother Stephen Robinson, was looking for her soulmate online . Kevin Hawke has been jailed for 17 and a half years for murdering Sharon  in a frenzied attack triggered by an argument over what to watch on the television . Mr Robinson told how his 39-year-old sister suffered more than 90 injuries after  Hawke stabbed her in the liver, spleen, lungs and heart with a four-and-a-half inch knife. He said that the vicious attack was triggered by a row over what to watch on the television. Afterwards, the 33-year-old killer, who had drunk 15 pints and a bottle of vodka over the course of the day, had a beer before calling the police. Hawke was jailed for a minimum of 17-and-a-half years after he admitted the murder in July last year. Liverpool Crown Court was told Hawke, of no fixed abode, moved into Ms Winters' house after just one date, and started being very controlling with her. Mrs Winters suffered from depression and had learning difficulties and Mr Robinson said: 'I still can't believe someone would want to hurt my poor, defenseless sister in such a horrific manner.' Devoted aunt Sharon is pictured here with her niece Ellie, Stephen's daughter . He had begged her to end the relationship after hearing that Hawke would 'push his sister around'. But Ms Winters told her brother that she was 'just desperate to be loved' and stopped speaking to him. Mr Robinson said: 'She continued her relationship with that monster.' Just three days later, on July 13, 2014, police found Ms Winters dead in her flat in Liverpool. He is now determined that his sister's death will not in vain and is appealing for women in violent relationships to seek help, and be cautious when online dating. 'Sharon was the kindest, most loving sister. All she wanted to do was find her soulmate,' he said. 'She wore her heart on her sleeve. She was kind and caring - a lovely woman.' Ms Winters, who was unable to work due to depression, started going on dating websites in 2013. Father-of-seven Mr Robinson disapproved, fearing that men were taking advantage of his susceptible younger sister. He said: 'I used to check up on her all the time, I was incredibly protective. Sharon Winters was lonely and felt that Kevin Hawke was the only man who wanted her; Sharon, pictured with her mother Ann, had very low self-esteem, says her brother Stephen . 'One day when I was taking her over some shopping, I noticed she was looking brighter, and she told me she'd met someone online. 'She showed me their messages to one another and I was horrified. They were very sexual and he'd even sent her pictures of his privates. 'I feared he was just after one thing, and told her as much. She said that chatting to men online made her feel good about herself. 'She got frustrated by my disapproval, so I dropped the subject. I just begged her to meet these dates in busy places.' However, Ms Winters would often invite men she met online back to her home, meeting them there face-to-face for the first time. Mr Robinson said: 'For all her amazing qualities, my sister lacked common sense. She'd been bullied throughout childhood and felt like she was worthless, that she was unlovable. 'My wife Helen and I tried to build up her self-esteem, and our children loved spending time with their aunty. Stephen is trying to raise awareness of the dangers of online dating after his sister lost her life at the hands of a man she met on the internet . Stephen Robinson describes his sister as a 'lonely heart who just wanted love' 'But at the end of the day she just wanted someone she could share her life with.' Ms Winters thought she'd found that someone when she met Hawke, a chef, on a dating website. Mr Robinson said: 'From the off she was smitten. She called me up after meeting him for the first time, saying it was love and that he was moving in. 'I was concerned, but didn't say anything to Sharon. I knew it would upset her. Instead my wife and I arranged a dinner with the new couple, only Kevin didn't show. 'We rescheduled for the next day and the same thing happened again. By now I was also hearing rumours that Kevin was being aggressive towards Sharon, so I pleaded with her to end it. 'All she said was, ""no one else wants me'"", and it was heartbreaking to hear.' Mr Robinson's pleas fell on deaf ears, and Ms Winters stopped talking to her brother. It would be the last time they'd ever speak. He said: 'We had a bit of an argument about it, and three days later I called her to apologise. 'She didn't pick up her phone, which was odd, so I decided to head over to see her. I quickly checked the football scores before I left.' As Mr Robinson checked his local news website, he also saw a news story so devastating it would change his life forever. He saw a picture of his sister's home with the headline: 'A 39-year-old woman has been found dead in her flat.' He said: 'I felt sick to my stomach. I called the police who told me the news, Sharon was dead. 'I knew immediately who had killed her. We were eventually told Kevin Hawke had called the police after killing my sister, and had been charged with her murder. 'As we waited for the trial I planned Sharon's funeral. We had a butterfly theme as they were Sharon's favourite – delicate and beautiful, just like her.' During the trial at Liverpool Crown Court Mr Robinson heard how the couple had been rowing over what to watch on TV. An alcoholic, Hawke had drunk 15 pints of lager and a bottle of vodka. Stephen, pictured here with his daughters Sophie (left) and Ellie, on a trip to Sea World, begged Sharon to meet online dates in a busy public place rather than at her house . Mr Robinson said: 'It was horrendous to listen to. Apparently Sharon had begged for her life and held her hands up to protect herself. If only I'd been there. 'He was savage, her injuries were unbelievable. He'd even ripped through her ribcage. 'When the judge sentenced him to life in prison it was justice of sorts, but all I really want is my beloved sister back. 'After the case we went to get Sharon's belongings, and you could still see blood on the walls even through the flat had been cleaned. It must have been a bloodbath.' Now Mr Robinson is trying to raise awareness about domestic violence as well as letting women know the dangers of online dating. 'I hope by telling Sharon's story, people will be more wary about who they are chatting to online and make sure, if they do meet up, it's in a busy public place. 'Kevin was aggressive towards Sharon before he killed her, and I wish she'd gone for help. 'Instead my poor sister suffered in silence, with tragic consequences.'","Sharon Winters, 39, from Wirral, met chef Kevin Hawke online in July, 2014 .

"NFL murderer Aaron Hernandez is no longer No 81 - he is Prisoner W106228, Daily Mail Online can reveal. The official number was issued to Hernandez as he started the rest of his life in jail, at Cedar Junction state prison in Massachusetts. He was being moved to the maximum security Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center near Shirley today. Hernandez is being held separately from other prisoners and is on suicide watch. He is now equipped with green prison scrubs and his tattoos are being examined for gang affiliations. It can also be disclosed that he was hooked on 'angel dust', a drug known to cause users to experience violent outbursts and paranoia. The former New England Patriots star smoked the hallucination-inducing drug in marijuana cigarettes that are known as 'killer joints' in the world of drugs. Sources said the brute, found guilty of murdering Odin Lloyd, was using the dangerous drug for at least a year before the victim was shot dead. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . The beginning of the rest of his life: Aaron Hernandez was taken to the MCI Cedar Junction prison in Walpole, Massachusetts on Wednesday after he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez circled in red, arriving at the 700-inmate prison . Nothing to smile about now: Hernandez slumped down in his chair on Wednesday as a guilty verdict was read (left).He will no longer be No 81 having been given his prison number: W106228. A man who knew Hernandez and asked not to be identified, said: 'He was regularly high or out of his mind on Angel Dust. 'People who were in his circles knew about it and we would talk about how it turned him into a punk. He was consistently aggressive, arrogant and unpleasant. 'His dope man would bring it to his house and he would roll it in with some weed and smoke it with his friends. 'He got so full of himself that he sometimes stopped caring if people saw him doing it and he would be told to go outside because restaurant owners were worried about their licenses. 'Some of my friends do security for high profile sports people and celebs and I was invited to a party by one. Hernandez was there and throwing his weight around. 'When I said 'Hi' to him, he looked me up and down like I was a piece of s***. 'He just ignored me like I shouldn't have been there. 'I guess he was a d**head before because all that fame and money went to his head. But the drugs made him turn out to be a monster. Few people liked him. They just went with everything to keep him under control.' Hernandez was a heavy drinker and would often down cocktails and champagne on nights out with his hangers on, picking up large bar bills and doing his best to impress women with his celebrity status. His jury heard that on the night of the murder he smoked marijuana and he was caught on camera dancing at a gas station while filling up his rental car after he smoked the drug . Stately: Before his arrest, Hernandez lived in a $1.3million mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts . Moving day: Prison life is a far cry from Herandez cushy life in North Attleborough. He is being transferred to the Souza Baranowski maximum security prison near Shirley today, say sources . Maximum security: Aaron Hernandez will be held in maximum security in the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Mass . Prisons: The yard at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center (left). Hernandez began his sentence at MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts (right) He was careful not to be high or boozed up whenever he was required for training sessions or for Patriots' games. Angel dust is also known as PCP and is a white crystalline powder that can also be dissolved in alcoholic drinks. It is also available in a variety of tablets, capsules, and users snort the colored powders as well as insert them into reefers with hash or dope. Doctors say the effects are that users feel detached, distant, and estranged from their surroundings. They experience hallucinations, severe mood disorders, and amnesia and outbreaks of violent behavior. Experts say PCP is addictive and one of the long lasting effects can be that users become violent or suicidal. Angel dust has been called 'devil dust' by those who have seen the violent outbursts of users and the manner in which it transforms them. The US Department of Justice's Drug Enforcement Administration says Angel Dust normally sells on the streets in powder, crystal, tablet, capsule, and liquid forms frpm $5 a tablet to $300 per ounce. Officials said users also referred to as Supergrass, Boat, Tic Tac, Zoom and, Shermans . Shayanna Jenkins, the mother of his two-year-old daughter, told the Lloyd murder trial that Hernandez smoked drugs on a daily basis. Hernandez showed signs of the effects with his brooding behavior in the months leading up to the Lloyd murder and is also accused in another murder case. Hernandez is charged in a 2012 double killing in Boston, accused in the drive-by shooting of two men he felt disrespected him at a nightclub. Victim: Odin Lloyd, who was murdered by Aaron Hernandez, resulting in the New England Patriots star receiving a whole-life sentence . Former Pats player Hernandez can be seen displaying his hip-hop moves as his rental car fills with gas, earlier that evening he had ran up a $243 bar tab and smoked marijuana . Having a high feeling of self worth is a classic symptom developed by users of the deadly drug. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder in the second case. He is charged with murdering Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado after an encounter at the nightclub called Cure. Daniel de Abreu is said to have accidentally bumped into the footballer at a nightclub, spilling Hernandez's drink. Hernandez told a friend he thought the man was 'trying' him, and surveillance video outside the club showed Hernandez pacing back and forth while his friend tried to calm him down. But he is accused of following them in a silver SUV and shooting them in their car at a stop light later that evening. The NFL waill now have to investigate how a heavy drug using sports star could have avoided rigorous testing designed to weed out drug cheats. They will have to consider whether the fallen star may have had a supply of masking agents which can be bought over the counter or he stayed clean long enough each summer to pass pre-season tests and then fell off the wagon without fear of being caught. Either finding will prompt calls for more rigorous testing of NFL players for illicit substances.","New England Patriots No 81 is starting whole life term for murder of Odin Lloyd - and will now go by his prison number .

"A Chinese hospital is being painstakingly moved just eight metres a day on 1,000 metal rollers  to prevent it from being demolished to make way for a new road. The building, which was built in the 1960s and belongs to Zheng Gong Hospital in Henan Province, was under threat of demolition as it is situated in the path of a road expansion project, reports People's Daily Online. But hospital bosses decided to save time and money - and avoid paying for a new building - and employed a team of engineers to put 'wheels' on the building. The two-storey brick hospital outpatient building in China is being rolled every day on giant metal 'wheels' The large brick building is 1,700 square metres in size and needs more than 1,000 wheels to 'roll' it . Now, the two-storey hospital outpatient building in the city of Zhengzhou, in central China, is being slowly and carefully pushed just a few metres a day on the giant cylinder-shaped rollers. The engineers aim to 'push' the entire structure south by 17.5 metres to its new, designated spot, away from the demolition zone. The 'wheels' the building is being moved on are large, cylinder-shaped metal rollers. The People's Daily reports the large brick building is 1,700 square metres in size and requires more than 1,000 wheels to make the daily 'walk' possible. One of the engineers working on the project secures the metal sheeting and rollers which are being used . It will take three days of careful and slow rolling to move the hospital building 17.5m to its new, safe spot . While it should only take three days to move the building to its newly assigned spot, engineers say the preparation has taken over a month. The entire building was initially placed on metal plates, which then had the cylinder-shaped rollers wedged between them. The ambitious project is expected to be completed in the next couple of days. It is not the first time engineers in China have carried out such a move. In November 2013 a six-storey building in Shanghai which weighed 12,000 tonnes was moved 38 metres with the help of 18 lifting jacks. And according to the Guinness Book of Records the largest building to have ever been moved in this way is another Chinese achievement - in 2004 the Fu gang Building in Guangxi Province was moved 36 metres and took 11 days to complete. The building was 111 feet tall and weighed 15,140 tonnes. The building has been placed on metal plates which have cylinder-shaped rollers wedged between them .","Chinese hospital marked for demolition because of road expansion project .

"A furious New York diner lost his cool grabbing a restaurant manager by the neck before slamming him against a bar and into an elderly woman - after waiting more than an hour for his omelette, according to witnesses. Nicholas Dematteis, 39, flew into the rage while at restaurant Bocca East during brunch on Saturday afternoon, and demanded a free meal around 4pm because of slow service, police said. Dematteis was arrested and charged with assault following the incident, according to the New York Daily News. Police said New York resident Nicholas Dematteis, 39, flew into the rage while at Bocca East (above) during brunch, and demanded a free meal around 4pm after waiting an hour and a half . 'We heard yelling and glass breaking, restaurant patron Jason Wirtz told the Daily News. 'The guy was screaming, ''I'm not paying for it!'' There was some expletives used in there.' The 34-year-old manager made attempts to calm Dematteis down, who waited an hour and a half for his omelette, when he spewed a homophobic slur at the man, according to another manager Joseph Verdi. He then allegedly grabbed the manager's neck and slammed him against the bar. Verdi added that Dematteis, who he said appeared to be drunk, was 'a lot' bigger than the manager. As the 34-year-old manager followed Dematteis outside of the restaurant, he grabbed his neck and hurled him into an elderly woman who was standing on the street, according to the Daily News. The woman got up after being knocked over and witnesses said she left before police arrived at the scene. 'There was a hustle and bustle out here and she hit the ground pretty hard,' said diner Julie Chappell, who was seated near the sidewalk. Authorities said Dematteis was previously arrested earlier this year in January for breaking into his girlfriend's apartment, according to the Daily News.

"The runaway success of Furious 7 shows no signs of slowing down as the high-octane action movie enjoyed its third winning weekend in a row at the domestic box office. The reigning box office champion might have slowed from its blockbuster debut, but Furious 7 maintained first place for the third weekend in a row with an estimated $29.1 million, according to box office tracker Rentrak on Sunday. This brings the fast car sequel's domestic total to a staggering $294 million, well above the $202.8 million that Fast & Furious 6 had earned at the same point in the cycle in 2013. Scroll down for video . The fast car sequel, starring Vin Diesel, has raced to number seven on the list of highest grossing movies in just three weeks and is predicted to overtake the likes of Frozen and Iron Man 3 in a matter of weeks . Crashing hit: The blockbuster, also co-starring Vin Diesel and Jason Statham, has already earned $1 billion . On Friday, Furious 7 joined the $1 billion club at the worldwide box office, leaping into the top twenty grossing films of all time worldwide. Over the weekend, Furious 7 added even more to its international total, jumping even higher on the all-time worldwide charts. Furious 7 is now one of the ten highest grossing movies of all-time worldwide, ranking seventh with $1.152 billion. With Furious 7 still going strong, the question becomes now how high can it climb? The film will almost certainly race past Iron Man 3 and Frozen to join the top five all-time at the worldwide box office before the month is out. 'The film has set a new standard for the potential for box-office in the pre-summer month of April and has truly become part of movie folklore with its record setting numbers, strong reviews, spectacular word-of-mouth and of course the outpouring of support for late star Paul Walker,' Rentrak's Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian said. Poll position: Furious 7, starring the late Paul Walker, right, won the box office crown for the third week running, taking an estimated $29.1 million over the weekend . Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 came in a close second with an estimated $24 million. While the PG-rated comedy didn't perform as well as the first film's $31.8 million opening in 2009, it did surpass Sony's modest expectations. Also, it only cost $30 million to produce. 'It's a great result. It's going to be very profitable for us and a big success,' Sony's President of Worldwide Distribution Rory Bruer said. 'It was something that Kevin really wanted to do and we wanted to do it with him,' he said. 'Kudos to Kevin for working so hard in promoting the film.' Dergarabedian said 'Blart's' opening 'proves that if you give the people what they want, you can make a tidy profit.' Meanwhile, the low-budget, social media themed thriller Unfriended took third place with $16 million — sixteen times its production budget.","Furious 7 is now one of the ten highest grossing movies of all-time worldwide, currently ranking seventh with $1.152 billion .

"She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match. The 29-year-old from Chicago has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder affecting 1 in 20,000 which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen or other unusual places in the body. Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class. The brunette - who currently works for a non-profit addressing the legal rights of intersex individuals - immediately phoned her mother to discuss her suspicions and was shocked to find her worst fears confirmed. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis (above) was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match . Flashback: The 29-year-old (seen above circa 1990) has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen . 'I was like, ""Oh. My. God! That's the thing the teacher was talking about ... ,""' Pagonis told the Associated Press. 'And then I went into like a freefall.' Two decades ago, there was little information about AIS and Pagonis' parents were'n't sure how to talk openly about the condition. Pagonis was born with an enlarged clitoris, no uterus and a partial vagina that surgeons later extended so that as an adult she might have normal sexual intercourse. However, Pagonis says she learned as a teenager that this was 'almost impossible'. Undescended testes were also removed from her abdomen to prevent them from developing cancer; although some doctors now think affected children can be monitored instead. For a long time Pagonis struggled with depression and angst until meeting young intersex adults who've embraced their differences. Growing pains: Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class . Body confident: Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon,' doesn't identify as female or male and works as an artist and intersex activist against surgery . Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon', doesn't identify as female or male and works as an intersex activist against surgery. Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Pagonis' advice for parents with intersex infants? 'Take them home and love them ... just the way they are.' Alice Dreger, a Northwestern University ethicist and author, says it makes sense for parents to raise affected kids as boys or girls. 'But sometimes we get that gender assignment wrong. And in those cases it's particularly important that we've not done unnecessary interventions.' Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is when a person who is genetically male (who has one X and one Y chromosome) is resistant to male hormones (called androgens). As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman, but the genetic makeup of a man. It is caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome. These defects make the body unable to respond to the hormones that produce a male appearance. Complete androgen insensitivity prevents the penis and other male body parts from developing. At birth, the child looks like a girl. The complete form of the syndrome occurs in as many as 1 in 20,000 live births. How many male traits people have differ in incomplete AIS. A person with complete AIS appears to be female but has no uterus, and has very little armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female sex characteristics - such as breasts - develop. However, the person does not menstruate and become fertile. Persons with incomplete AIS may have both male and female physical characteristics. Many have partial closing of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short vagina. Complete AIS is rarely discovered during childhood. Sometimes, a growth is felt in the abdomen or groin that turns out to be a testicle when it is explored with surgery. Most people with this condition are not diagnosed until they do not get a menstrual period or they have trouble getting pregnant. Incomplete AIS is often discovered during childhood because the person may have both male and female physical traits. Tests used to diagnose this condition may include blood work, genetic testing or a pelvic ultrasound. When it comes to treatment, testicles that are in the wrong place may be removed when a child finishes growing. Estrogen replacement can also be prescribed after puberty. SOURCE: MedLinePlus . Vocal: Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Idea exchange: It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions . Pagonis hopes that by speaking out about her condition she can help comfort others with AIS. Efforts in the medical sphere also are underway to change the way intersex children are treated. 'The way that we took care of things in the past... where there was a fair amount of secrecy, where there was surgery done in the infant state, and potentially irreversible surgery, is probably not the best way to go about things,' said Dr. Earl Cheng, who runs the two-year-old sex development disorders program at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital. The program is one of several nationwide that employ a team of specialists including surgeons, hormone experts, genetic counselors, psychologists and ethicists. The team helps families weigh their options, including whether surgery should be considered at all. It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions. Some affected children have typical male or female chromosomes, but genetic glitches and hormonal problems that begin in the womb, cause genitals to resemble those of the opposite sex. Others have a male-female blend of sex chromosomes and reproductive organs.","Jennifer Pagonis has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)

"Supermarket customers in France can add airline tickets to their shopping lists thanks to a unique promotion by a budget airline. For a limited time Transavia France is offering cheap flights with packets of crisps, gummy bears and cereal bars at participating shops. Customers who buy one of the products before the #SnackHolidays promotion ends on April 21 will find a voucher code that can be redeemed online for a discounted flight to one of three destinations within Europe. Scroll down for video . Transavia France is selling cheap flights with packets of crisps, bags of gummy bears and cereal bars . Each package contains a voucher that can be redeemed for a discounted flight to one of three destinations . Billed as ‘the first snacks with airline tickets’ promotion, the products are being sold at participating Carrefour City shops, in Selecta vending machines at two Paris metro stations, and at an Mk2 cinema in Paris. Once customers enter a code on SnackHolidays.com they can book one-way flights to Barcelona (€35), Dublin (€40) or Lisbon (€40) with guaranteed prices, for travel between June 1 and October 24. Customers who purchase the products will find vouchers for cheap flights to Barcelona, Lisbon or Dublin . Passengers can already fly to Dublin from Paris Orly Airport from €40, even without a voucher code . According to the fine print, passengers must pay a booking fee on top of the airfare cost, and fees  for any checked baggage. A quick scan of Transavia’s website found that the savings with a voucher code from one of the packages would mostly be minimal, depending on the day of the flight. Passengers can already fly from Paris Orly Airport to Barcelona from €35 to €65, to Dublin from €40 to €60, and to Lisbon for €40 to €120 on most days of the week between June 1 and October 24. The snacks are being sold at participating Carrefour City shops, in vending machines and at a cinema . The campaign was supposed to launch last month but was delayed due to the crash of Germanwings flight 4U9525 in the Alps, French media reported. This is not the first time Transavia France has launched a marketing stunt like this. They previously offered discounted airline tickets in exchange for  unwanted Christmas gifts. Based at Paris Orly Airport, Transavia France launched in 2007 and is a low-cost subsidiary of Air France-KLM.","Transavia France has included voucher codes with the branded products .

"Drunks who repeatedly turn up at A&E should be fined to pay for treating for their injuries, Nigel Farage has claimed. The Ukip leader, who admits to having a pint most lunchtimes, said that it was a ‘reasonable proposition’ to charge people who end up in hospital more than once after drinking. He also revealed he is finding the election campaign ‘knackering’, as polls suggest support for Ukip is on the slide. Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who admits to having a pint most lunchtimes, said that it was a ‘reasonable proposition’ to charge people who end up in hospital more than once after drinking . Ukip supporters should consider switching to back the Tories in areas where their party cannot win, Nigel Farage has suggested. The Ukip leader said his backers had to use their vote 'as wisely as they can', and urged them to do what they can to secure a referendum on the European Union. David Cameron has urged Ukip supporters to 'come home' to the Tories, the only party able to deliver an EU vote. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, conceded his Ukip supporters could back Conservative candidates in areas where there is no chance of winning. He said: 'Of course, it's a complex electoral system and people have to use their votes as wisely as they can."" Mr Farage suggested that Ukip MPs could prop up a Tory government to keep Ed Miliband out of power. 'If the Tories were the biggest party, and we helped to make up the numbers and this country had a full, free and fair referendum, that would be an infinitely better position.' There were nearly 60,000 assaults on NHS staff in 2011-12 and alcohol-related hospital admissions have now topped a million a year – a rise of 510,000 in a decade. Politicians from across the political spectrum have backed the idea of fining or charging people who visit A&E after drinking too much, but doctors leaders warn the plan is unworkable. It would also cast doubt on the principle that the NHS is free at the point of use. Mr Farage said he would support the idea of charging for treating drunks, but only persistent troublemakers. He told the Sunday People: ‘It wouldn't be for first-time offenders,"" he told the Sunday People in an exclusive interview. ""We were all young once. But for a second offence it's a reasonable proposition."" But he rejected the idea of issuing fines for people who miss GP appointments. ‘That would not be practical. Chasing up fines would cost too much money. The NHS has huge problems but I'm totally for an NHS free at the point of delivery.’ Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb last year suggested a £50 levy on drunks. He warned that people who ‘gratuitously’ consume too much alcohol, especially at the weekends, were putting a ‘huge’ burden on hospitals. Tory Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt signalled that he was open to the idea of fining those who cost taxpayers through their own ‘irresponsibility’. ‘I have a great deal of sympathy for the people who say we should charge people who use A&E because they go over the top on a Friday or a Saturday night,’ he said. ‘I don’t see why we, as taxpayers, should be funding that.’ Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb and Tory Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt have both signalled they are open to fining drunks who cause problems in A&E . Gordon Miles, chief executive of the College of Emergency Medicine, said in September that the proposal would be ‘very tricky’. He added: ‘For example they had a couple of glasses of wine, fell and really hurt themselves? The priority is treating them. ‘It’s all very well saying these people are a huge burden on hospitals which they are, and A&E staff do face challenging situations. 'But there are many other ways we need to tackle alcohol abuse before it gets to hospital.’ In a separate interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Farage admitted that he tries to drink every day. He also admitted he was feeling the strain of the election campaign, which has been dogged by botched events and falling poll ratings . Asked if he has a pint of bitter every lunchtime, he replied: ""Generally - I try to. I like Adnam's. Young's. Master Brew."" He also admitted he was feeling the strain of the election campaign. 'Of course it's a bit knackering, I am not superhuman,' he said. Ukip has struggled in recent days with misfiring campaign launches, angry protests and falling poll ratings. The latest ComRes survey for the Mail put the party on 12 per cent, level with the Lib Dems for the first time in two years. It marks a sharp fall from the 19 per cent recorded in October, when Mr Farage boasted he was making inroads across the country.","Ukip leader says it is a 'reasonable position' to charge repeat offenders .

"A handful of peanuts a day may help prevent food poisoning, a study has found. Eating the kernels without their skins can improve gut health and the ability to ward off bugs like E.coli, according to the research. Scientists from the University of Maryland found that flour made from peanut kernel significantly stimulated the growth of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, the type of friendly bacteria more commonly associated with yoghurt drinks. Eating peanut kernels without their skins can improve gut health and the ability to ward off bugs like E.coli, according to research by the University of Maryland . By increasing the amount of good bacteria, the peanut flour was able to reduce the amount of a dangerous bacterium, Enterohaemorrhagic E.coli, which can cause severe food poisoning. The friendly bacteria out-competes the harmful bacteria by occupying space on intestinal walls and by producing antimicrobial substances. Four made from peanut kernel stimulates the growth of friendly bacteria, research has found . Lead researcher Dr Debabrata Biswas said: ‘Eating approximately 50g of peanut kernels a day could improve the gut microflora and would help to protect against foodborne illnesses caused by common foodborne bacterial pathogens.’ When the scientists tested the peanut skin, however, they found it had the opposite effect to the peanut kernel, inhibiting the growth of good bacteria and promoting the growth of the harmful E.coli and Salmonella bacteria. Writing in the Journal of Food Science, the researchers concluded: ‘These results suggest that peanut kernels, by improving the beneficial effect of lactobacillus, might reduce the risk of foodborne pathogens infection in the gut. ‘However, the role of peanut skin in human health remains to be further investigated.’ E.coli can be transmitted by eating undercooked meat such as mince, or contaminated vegetables that haven’t been washed properly. Salmonella is found in the gut of many animals, especially poultry. Proper cooking usually destroys it. Undercooked eggs can also be a source.","Flour made from peanut kernel majorly stimulated growth of friendly bacteria .

Scroll down for video . According to Michael Redwood, inevitable wind-ups surfaced 'whenever the devil inside' Peter O'Toole needed entertaining . Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria attempts to pay homage to Saint Katherine . Director Michael Redwood paid tribute to O’Toole. He said: ‘Peter was certainly not the type to let illness decide over his career, and despite his being poorly at the time of filming, he remained full-on 10 hours a day, showing great interest in the storylines, angles of shots and the lighting.’ He added: ‘Of course, the inevitable wind-ups surfaced whenever the devil inside him needed entertaining. Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria attempts to pay homage to Saint Katherine by portraying her as a real women who experiences fear and torment while remaining steadfast in her beliefs regarding the denouncement of Rome’s enforced pagan worship upon the masses. Director Michael Redwood said Peter O’Toole was certainly not the type to let illness interrupt his career . Redwood said: ‘My agenda was simple: painstaking research, to create an intelligent screenplay and to seek out Britain’s best performers for their unrivalled ability to help portray the story of this religious icon. ‘The dialogue demanded some of the world’s most recognisable voices such as Peter O’Toole and Edward Fox, who were an inspiration to work with. Katherine’s voice had to be most haunting in its delivery.’ The director also paid tribute to the late actor’s sense of humour and noted that his onscreen chemistry was quickly established with Keniheart on account of the pair discovering that they had both had similar, difficult pasts. Michael Redwood stated that on screen chemistry was quickly established between Peter O'Toole and Nicole Keniheart .

Redwood said: ‘Peter managed to politely subdue his mischievousness with Keniheart, but not for long, as she well found out when filming an intimate library scene together. ‘I'd asked Peter to perhaps whisper something to make Ms Keniheart smile after about 30 seconds of a long tracking shot that contained no dialogue, and what he said did indeed make her burst into a grin, but, what he said could never be printed.’ O’Toole enjoyed a long and decorated career and was nominated for a total of eight Academy Awards, received an honorary Oscar, and won four Golden Globes.

"A Chinese woman has become an internet sensation after charting  life with her pet pig who she dresses, walks and even sleeps with every day. The woman, who calls herself Zhu Diandian online, has raised her beloved Five Flowers since it was a piglet and the porker has now grown to a whopping 187lbs (13st) But that has nothing to weaken the bond between the two, with Ms Zhu proudly posting pictures  of them snuggled up in bed together, it was reported by People's Daily Online.

The designer's say the technology used in their dresses and tops helps minimise clamminess with breathable fibres and wicks away moisture much quicker than wool or cotton.

"Listening to The Beatles could help to enhance the enjoyment of a fish and chip supper, psychologists have found. Research suggests that certain types of music can bring out specific flavours - including sweet, salty and bitter - in a range of foods. The intensity of Nessun Dorma, performed by Luciano Pavarotti, is said to be the perfect accompaniment to dark mouse or coffee. Meanwhile, the high-pitched piano in Billie Holiday's Autumn in New York can help emphasise the autumnal flavour of a pumpkin pudding. Listening to the right sort of music, including the Beatles (pictured) can enhance flavours in certain food and drink, researchers have found . In the Ultraviolent restaurant in Shanghai, fish and chips (pictured) are served up to a backdrop of the Beatles . In Ultraviolent restaurant in Shanghai, fish and chips are served up to a backdrop of the Beatles, while in El Celler de Can Roca in Girona, Spain, scented meringue comes with a commentary describing Barcelona footballer Lionel Messi in action, a clip which apparently brings out the citrus flavours in the dessert. The so-called digital seasoning also applies to wine, helping drinkers to enjoy their tipple by up to 15 per cent more, if served alongside the right music. Researchers found people enjoyed their wine more while listening to 'paired' music, rather than while being sat in silence. Tchaikovsky's String Quartet No 1 in D Major particularly compliments Chateau Margaux 2004, while Mozart's Flute Quartet in D Major should be played while drinking Puilly-Fume. Professor Charles Spence, a behavioral psychologist from Oxford University, told the Observer's Neil Tweedle that taste is not as dominant as we might think in judging a meal and that our ears might subconsciously talk to our tastebuds. He said: 'Music cannot create taste or flavours that are not there in your mouth, but it can draw attention to certain notes in a wine or food that are competing in your mind... It's kind of digital seasoning.' The deep tones of Luciano Pavarotti (pictured left) singing Nessun Dorma can enhance the bitterness in coffee and the intensity in a chocolate mousse (pictured right) Mr Spence added that humans tend to match the same sounds to the same tastes. He described sourness as 'high-pitched', meaning it should be played alongside music of the same quality. He also said sweetness is associated with richer sounds, while bitterness is linked to deeper tones. He believes the sound associated with salty - which he has not yet pinned down - would be enhanced by a throbbing type of sound. 'Bitter, sweet, sour - we have those,' says Professor Charles Spence, 'But salty is the hardest taste to embody in sound.' To carry out his research, Mr Spence gives people two pieces of identical chocolate and asks them to each eat one while listening to a different piece of classical music. While the more sombre music is played, people generally describe the chocolate as more bitter. When they described the chocolate as 'sweet', it generally when the more upbeat piece was being played, he said. Heston Blumenthal, who runs the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, is among restaurateurs who have sought the professor's advice. Mr Spence said that, as well as music, colour and even the weight of cutlery are factors which can combine to make a dining experience more enjoyable. Ambient lighting was found to have a positive effect on a person's enjoyment, with red light bringing out the fruitiness in red wine.","Research suggests certain types of music can bring out specific flavours .

"Midsomer Murders is to have its first regular Asian character in its 18th series, four years after the drama's producer said the programme 'wouldn't work' with ethnic minority characters. Manjinder Virk will play pathologist Dr Kam Karimore in the ITV police drama. Although there have been Asian actors in cameo parts, this is the first significant role for an ethnic minority actor. In 2011, executive producer Brian True-May described the show as the 'last bastion of Englishness' because it had no black or Asian characters. Gwilym Lee, Manjinder Virk and Neil Dudgeon (pictured left to right) will star in the upcoming season of Midsomer Murders . He said the show 'wouldn't work' if there was racial diversity among its cast. Mr True-May was suspended as a result of his comments and he later quit. The long-running crime drama is set in the quiet countryside village of Midsomer where DCI John Barnaby investigates a string of murders. Executive producer Jo Wright said Dr Karimore will cause DS Nelson, played by Gwilym Lee, 'trouble in more ways than one.' Midsomer Murders began in 1997 and is watched by more than 6million viewers a week. True-May said at the time the programme just doesn't 'have ethnic minorities involved. Because it wouldn't be the English village with them. It just wouldn't work. Executive producer Brian True-May (left) described the show as the 'last bastion of Englishness' in 2011 because it had no black or Asian characters, pictured with John Nettles . 'Suddenly we might be in Slough. Ironically, Causton (one of the main centres of population in the show) is supposed to be Slough. 'And if you went into Slough you wouldn't see a white face there. We're the last bastion of Englishness and I want to keep it that way.' ITV said at the time that it was 'shocked and appalled' at the sentiments.","Manjinder Virk will play pathologist Dr Kam Karimore in ITV police drama .

"Sorry: Journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely (pictured) is expected to apologize for an article she wrote for Rolling Stone magazine about campus rape . The journalist who wrote Rolling Stone's flawed account of a campus rape is set to apologize Sunday night, when the Columbia Journalism School publishes a review of what went wrong with her reporting. Sabrina Rubin Erdely has been silent since December, when the magazine was forced to issue an apology in the wake of several factual errors highlighted in the piece about a University of Virginia student named Jackie. In the story, titled 'A Rape on Campus', Jackie claims to have been gang raped by seven men at campus fraternity Phi Kappa Psi two years ago. But a recent investigation by the Charlottesville Police found no evidence to support her story- including the fact that the man who brought her to the fraternity the night of the alleged incident doesn't seem to exist. The Columbia Graduate School of Journalism will release their review of the botched Rolling Stone investigation at 8pm on Sunday. Following that, sources tell CNN that Erdely will release an apologetic statement and Rolling Stone will take the story down from their website. While the article initially sparked protests on campus, Erdely's reporting quickly began to fall apart as the Washington Post and  local outlets started following up on the allegations. One mistake of Erdely's previously highlighted, was the fact she agreed not to contact Jackie's alleged attackers. Scroll down for video . Report: The Columbia Journalism School is expected to release a review of the botched story Sunday night . Claims: The story published in November focused on a University of Virginia student named  Jackie who claimed to have been gang raped by seven men at the campus' Phi Kappa Psi fraternity two years ago. Above, the frat house on January 15, 2015 . Anonymous: Jackie has never been identified. Police officials say she refused to be interviewed in the course of their investigation . Three of Jackie's friends also denied Erdely's assertion that they discouraged the alleged victim from reporting the assault. By December 5, Rolling Stone acknowledged that there appeared 'to be discrepancies in Jackie's account.' The magazine asked for the independent review, which was conducted by the dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. The fraternity has called the article defamatory and said it was exploring its legal options. 'These false accusations have been extremely damaging to our entire organization, but we can only begin to imagine the setback this must have dealt to survivors of sexual assault,' said Stephen Scipione, president of the Virginia Alpha Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi, after the Charlottesville police suspended their investigation. Despite its flaws, the article heightened scrutiny of campus sexual assaults amid a campaign by President Barack Obama. The University of Virginia had already been on the Department of Education's list of 55 colleges under investigation for their handling of sex assault violations. The article also prompted UVA President Teresa Sullivan to temporarily suspend Greek social events. Fraternities later agreed to ban kegs, hire security workers and keep at least three fraternity members sober at each event.","Sabrina Rubin Erdely wrote 'A Rape on Campus' which was published in Rolling Stone in November .

"A 73-year-old councillor stabbed his wife eight times with a seven-inch kitchen knife after discovering she was having an affair with the postman, a court heard. Joseph O'Riordan was sitting on Polegate Town Council in East Sussex when he grew suspicious his wife, Amanda, 47, was having an alleged affair and hired a private investigator to follow her. Brighton Magistrates' Court heard they agreed to stay together but O'Riordan later attacked her - stabbing her in the chest, torso, arms and back. Joseph O'Riordan stabbed his wife of ten years Amanda (left) with a seven inch kitchen knife eight times . The couple had been married for ten years when O’Riordan, who was also the president of his local Royal British Legion and had attended the Queen’s garden party in 2013 for his work on the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, discovered his wife was in a relationship with a man named in court as Nicholas Gunn. Mr Gunn had been the postman in the couple's neighbourhood before moving away from the area. After becoming suspicious of Mrs O’Riordan, a jealous O’Riordan used a GPS tracking device to monitor her car journeys and hired a private investigator to follow her. On the day of the attack, in October last year, the couple were at Mrs O'Riordan's mother's house to help with the shopping when the councillor received a call, believed to be from Mr Gunn. Giving evidence in a pre-recorded interview, Mrs O'Riordan said: 'After the phone call he came back into the room and I could see a shift in his mood. 'We left my mother's to get some food at KFC, and in the car Joe said to me, ""you can probably tell there is something wrong"". 'He then told me he had hired a private investigator and told me I had lied to him about previous phone calls I had received.' On the journey home Mrs O'Riordan tried to get out of the car, but was dragged back in and held down by her husband so she could not to escape. When they got home she went straight to the bedroom to dump her handbag and O'Riordan asked why she had not removed her coat. Brighton Magistrates' Court heard he hired a private investigator to follow his wife and discovered she was having an affair with their postman, Nicholas Gunn . She replied: 'I'm not sure if I am going to stay here, I might go back to mum's for a cup of coffee.' O'Riordan then left the room before returning with the seven inch knife and allegedly cried out: 'You have made me do this. This is all your fault.' He stabbed his wife violently before calling her an ambulance and admitting to the call handler what he had done. The court heard an audio clip of the 999 phone call in which O'Riordan can be heard saying: 'My wife's been stabbed in the stomach. She's bleeding really badly, she could be dying. 'It was me who stabbed her. She's lost quite a lot of blood. I want to look after her, it's me who's done this to her.' In the tape Mrs O'Riordan can be heard groaning in pain in the background before sirens sound and police arrive. She suffered life-threatening injuries including a collapsed lung in the vicious attack. Dale Sullivan, prosecuting, said: 'In the evening of that night, Joseph O'Riordan went from his bedroom to the kitchen and selected a knife before returning to the bedroom to stab his wife multiple times. 'The issue in this case is a narrow one, but it is simply this-on October 22 did Joseph intend to kill Amanda?'. Sussex police constable Steven Wilson said: 'Mr O'Riordan's demeanor struck me as unusual under the circumstances. 'He was compliant and co-operative and had a distinctive bored air about him.' O'Riordan pleaded guilty to wounding with intent but denied a charge of attempted murder. The trial continues.

"It was home to a 65-year-old hoarder and her mother's corpse for at least five years. Described by police as the 'worst we have ever seen', the San Francisco property was teeming with black widows, rats, feces and 300 bottles of urine when it was discovered on April 4. But apparently, it's still a hot ticket. Just a week after removing the rodents, trash, and corpse, realtors have priced this San Francisco property at a cool $2.5 million. The 1904 Victorian build in Bay Area will be sold at a live auction by Tim Hawko of Zephyr Real Estate. Still worth it! Property developers are expected to pay millions for this house which was made available last week after police evicted a 65-year-old hoarder and removed her mother's five-year-old mummified corpse . With seven bedrooms and two bathrooms, the single-story property has the structure of a valuable home. And according to experts, the eerie backstory could even add to the intrigue. Kevin Birmingham, a real estate agent, told the San Francisco Chronicle it will primarily be property developers bidding for the home, in the hope that they can perform a magical turnaround. 'The people looking at hoarder houses are developers or investors, so the fact that someone passed away—whether mummified or not—it doesn't bother them a bit,' he said. The remains which were removed from the house on April 4 are believed to be that of Anna Ragin who lived with her 65-year-old daughter Carolyn, a hoarder. Neighbors told The San Francisco Chronicle the mother had not been seen for years. According to records another man, Archibald Ragin, lived at the property but died 15 years ago at the age of 101. Carolyn, said to be a retired Pacific Bell worker, was taken to hospital after her mother's body was removed from the house. She is now being mentally assessed. Police removed the body, believed to be that of Anna Ragin, from the property in the Richmond area of San Francisco. Authorities said the home was covered in debris, including dog feces and bottles of urine . Supervisor Eric Mar, a representative in charge of the area, told the Chronicle : 'The police captains I've spoken with tell me this is the worst case of hoarding they have ever seen.' He was concerned for the health and safety of the residents, but questioned how the situation in the property could have gotten to such a point. Mr Mar said: 'We certainly want seniors to stay in their communities as long as possible, but when people aren’t getting adequate health care and attention, this is what happens. 'This appears to be a nightmare of what can happen when people age in place for too long,' he added. 'We need to identify what the triggers are for the city to step in.' He told the Daily Mail Online that he heard the body was wrapped up in a carpet and described that, from the outside, it looked like the home was abandoned. When city workers arrived to clean up the body on Wednesday, they reportedly struggled to get in the door because the house was filled with so much debris. The mess was said to have included mold and piles of trash that reached the ceiling. They were forced to call in professional workers. The Chronicle quote a firefighter saying the body was lightweight and wrapped in a blanket. It is not clear where it was discovered.","San Francisco property to be auctioned at $2.5m starting price .

"The Balinese woman who hired hitmen to murder her Australian husband has told a court that she wanted to teach him a lesson because he refused to give her money or grant her a divorce. Noor Ellis admitted a role in the killing of her 60-year-old husband, businessman Robert Ellis, at their home in Bali last October. His body, with wrists and feet bound, was found wrapped in plastic, dumped in a ditch in a rice field near Sedang Village. Mrs Ellis faced court on Wednesday charged with the premeditated killing of her husband of 20 years, and explained that he was now 'in heaven'. Scroll down for video . British man Robert Kelvin Ellis (left), here with wife Noor Ellis (right) was found in a rice paddock with his throat cut in October 2014 . Mrs Ellis told Judge Beslin Sihombing that her husband died 'Because of the order from me'. The Balinese national, who has two sons with her late husband, was arrested along with seven other people, including the couple's two former maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids. 'For a long time he hadn't given me sufficient (money), (he) even took the money for my kids' schooling,' Mrs Ellis told the court. 'Because his attitude didn't change, I couldn't stand it anymore. Once I asked for divorce but he didn't want to,' she said. 'He said we should just go on, in our own way.' 23-year-old Urbanus Yohanes Ghoghi, who slit Mr Ellis's throat, told the court on Wednesday in graphic detail of the roles he and four other men played in the killing. Noor Ellis gave one of the men, Martin, a towel and a pillow, and asked his 'help to teach a lesson'. The men first tried to suffocate him, but when their victim fought back, Martin handed him the kitchen knife he used to slash his throat. Already in custody for his murder is his Indonesian wife of 25 years, Noor Ellis, the couple's two maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids . If the suspects are found guilty of murder, they could face the death penalty . 60-year-old Robert Ellis's (left) body was found wrapped in plastic with his wrists and feet bound and was dumped in a ditch in a rice field near Sedang Village. Sons Peter (centre) and John (right) now face the loss of their mother too if she gets the death penalty for their father's murder . Afterwards, Mrs Ellis handed Martin the plastic to wrap her husband's body in, Urbanus told the court. 'That night, Mrs Noor gave Rp 50 million ($5000) to Martin. It was then split, Rp 10 million each,' he said. 'Martin also said to us that tomorrow, there will be more.' In early January police reportedly handed a brief of evidence to prosecutors which claimed the victim’s wife paid hit-men 150 million rupiah, or $14,200 AUD, according to The Daily Telegraph. The court heard that Mrs Ellis told her husband's killers 'to be neat' when they murdered him, and called a meeting prior to his murder to ensure the men knew the instructions. 'Mrs Noor said that when killing Mr Bob, don't use a sharp weapon,' Urbanus said. 'Close his nose and mouth with a pillow only. To be neat, basically.' Julaikah Noor Aini, known as Noor Ellis (second left) takes part in a reconstruction of her husband's murder . Mrs Ellis faces the death penalty if she is found guilty of the charge of premeditated murder, which her two sons, Peter and John, said they are reconciled to. Both sons have refused to attend their mother’s court hearing, and said that they want to see justice for their father. ‘If that [the death penalty] happens, it happens,’ Peter told Channel Seven's Sunday Night program. ‘But we want justice for our dad no matter what.’ Mr Ellis was set upon in his own Bali kitchen by the killers who slashed his throat 'like killing a pig', police said, after Mrs Ellis employed the men along with two housemaids to clean up the murder. His wife, who was taken into custody after confessing to her role in the crime, helped local officials to recreate the murder. Mr Ellis' body had have been lying in a ditch for several days and was in a state of decay . 'There is no doubt this was an execution-style murder,' said a senior police officer in the Bali capital, Denpasar. Mr Ida Bagus Putu Alit, who headed the district's forensic team, said Mr Ellis' throat had been slashed three times. 'One of the wounds to the throat was fatal, but he also had several bruises around his head, suggesting he had been knocked to the ground before receiving the fatal throat wound,' he said. Peter and John text messaged their mother to ask where their father was to which she chillingly replied, ‘I’ll ask him when I see him.’ When Ellis was arrested at the end of last year, she admitted to police and her two Perth-based sons that she paid $14,000 to men to carry out the murder with her motive likely being his $30 million estate. Noor’s lawyers have claimed that Robert was abusive and the hit men were only paid to scare her husband, not murder him. Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife . Noor and Robert's son John Ellis (in grey shirt) arrive at Bali police station in October to visit his mother . Robert Kelvin Ellis was found dead in a rice field near the village of Sedang, north of Denpasar in Bali . Police have also alleged Noor confessed to ordering his murder because he cheated on her 'often' and has claimed that she was possessed by a spirit or a monster and pushed to organise Robert’s killing by an outside supernatural force. Her sons, Peter and John Ellis have told The West Australian of the perils they face, not only of a life without their father, but potentially without their mother as well. ‘Mum felt like she wasn’t being treated well enough, she wasn’t given enough money,’ Peter said. ‘And her only option in her mind was to murder my dad.’ Officials confirmed that Mr Ellis had a UK passport and had lived in Australia before moving to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife. Ellis also has two other children from a former relationship. At the time of their father’s death, the four children and Mr Ellis’ brother John released a joint statement. ‘Bob was a loving and devoted father, grandfather, brother, son and husband. His loss leaves a hole in the lives of everyone he touched.’ ‘His work in business created jobs for thousands of Indonesians. He was a good and honourable man. 'His integrity, generosity and spirit is evidenced by the way the business community both expat and Indonesian have rallied to support us and show their respects.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Noor Ellis admits planning execution-style killing of husband Robert Ellis .

"A toddler suffering from an huge birthmark that could have blinded him in one eye has undergone life-changing plastic surgery. Colby Ramos-Francis, who is 17 months old, was born with a small, heart-shaped growth over his eyelid. But it quickly developed into a large benign tumour that continued to expand. His parents claim NHS doctors were unable to treat the growth or offer surgery, leaving them no option but to beg for help abroad. Scroll down for video . Colby Ramos-Francis, now 17 months old, was born with a small, heart-shaped growth over his eyelid. But it quickly developed into a large benign tumour that continued to expand, threatening his sight . Colby has now had the tumour removed free-of-charge thanks to the US-based Little Baby Face Foundation. His parents claim NHS doctors were unable to treat the growth or offer surgery, leaving them no option but to beg for help abroad . The NHS does not routinely remove the type of tumour Colby had, instead treating the condition with medication. This week, Colby had the tumour removed free-of-charge thanks to the US-based Little Baby Face Foundation (LBFF). His mother Aimee, 18, said: 'Seeing Colby come out without the birthmark is the best thing ever. It makes me incredibly happy. 'If it hadn't been removed properly it could have resulted in him losing his eyesight. It was so emotional seeing him trying to touch it and realising it was not there anymore. 'It is so nice not to have these worries anymore and he can just grow up and be happy.' While also delighted with the outcome, Colby's father Jamie, 23, said he was disappointed the family had been forced to fly across the Atlantic to get the treatment they desperately needed. He said: 'When someone like Josie Cunningham can have free plastic surgery on the NHS and Colby can't, it's just out of order. 'There is a huge waiting list for people like Colby but she can just come along, snap her fingers and gets it. It's heartbreaking.' Ms Cunningham sparked outrage when she announced she'd received a £4,800 boob job on the NHS. Colby, with his parents Jamie and Aimee. His mother said: 'If the growth hadn't been removed properly, it could have resulted in him losing his eyesight. It was so emotional seeing him trying to touch it and realising it was not there anymore' Colby was born with a condition known as haemangioma, a tumour, swelling or growth of the cells that line blood vessels - the endothelial cells. These growths are usually benign but can cause severe pain and can bleed or weep easily if disturbed . Colby was born with a condition known as haemangioma, a  tumour, swelling or growth of the cells that line blood vessels - the endothelial cells. These growths are usually benign but can cause severe pain and can bleed or weep easily if disturbed. Ms Ramos-Francis, from Corsham, Wiltshire, who endured a 46-hour labour, said she noticed something different straight after the birth. She said: 'He had a small, pink birthmark on the side of his eye and it was in the same shape as a love-heart. 'I wasn't really that concerned about it because a lot of children are born with them. 'After we got home and we'd settled in with Colby we went for a six-week check up. 'By that time his birthmark had ballooned and it was really bulbous and it wasn't really a nice sight. 'It should have shrunk by the age of one but it hadn't made any progress.' She said doctors in Britain used a range of topical medications and pills - including propranolol - to try and reduce the swelling, but to no avail. The toddler's parents say they were also been the victims of abuse and slurs over their son's appearance, and feared for his chances of living a 'normal' life . His mother added: 'In England they seemed to be picking random numbers hoping it would make a difference, hoping it would shrink it, but it didn't make a difference. 'They then offered steroids but I didn't think it would be right giving a baby steroids, I was against it. 'We didn't really have much of an option except the wait-and-see approach, which we knew deep down really wasn't the best thing for Colby. 'The lady we were seeing eventually said we could possibly see a plastic surgeon - but that it would take years for him to be seen. 'It was a shock we would have to wait that long for surgery. It was heartbreaking.' On top of medical worries, Colby was banned from several daycare centres because of the risk of his growth weeping, leaving his mother unable to seek work while she studies English at the Open University. The toddler's parents say they have also been the victims of abuse and slurs over his appearance. Mr Francis, who works in a hardware store, said: 'We had very nasty comments about Colby and very nasty comments about ourselves. People have even asked if we are beating him. 'Others said ""why don't you get that disgusting thing removed from his face?"" 'It was difficult and it has been very hurtful at times. We just wanted Colby to have the best.' In February, a team led by paediatric facial plastic surgeon Dr Milton Waner (left) went ahead with a three-hour operation to cut the tumour away at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital . The operation, consultation fees, flights and accommodation would have set the couple back at least £10,000 without the help of the foundation . Desperate, and frustrated with the lack of options in the UK, they turned to the New York-based Little Baby Face Foundation (LBFF), contacting them by Facebook. The charity specialises in treating children born with severe birthmarks and facial deformities. On February 5 this year, a team led by paediatric facial plastic surgeon Dr Milton Waner went ahead with a three-hour operation to cut the tumour away at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital. The operation, consultation fees, flights and accommodation would have set the couple back at least £10,000 without the help of the foundation. But with the level of expertise on offer, including other specialists, nurses and assistance, the figure would be 'much, much higher', the couple say. She said: 'Asking strangers for help can be amazing. We knew no-one in New York before this but they have done so much for us and Colby. We can't thank them enough.' Colby is just one many children to be helped by the LBFF since its founding by Dr Thomas Romo in 2002. Dr Romo said: 'Treating children with facial birth deformities is the most gratifying surgery I can perform. The NHS trust treating Colby before his surgery said that haemangiomas are not routinely surgically removed in the UK . 'The Little Baby Face Foundation transforms not only the face of a child, but their entire life.' The family's claims they would have had to wait many years for plastic surgery have been denied by by Deborah Lee, deputy chief executive of University Hospital Bristol, where Colby received treatment. She said: 'The Trust does not recognise the parents' recollection of the information they were given. 'General advice for this condition in that UK practice is to treat conservatively in the initial stages in the hope that surgery would not be necessary, but even if a decision to proceed to surgery was reached, this would still be during the childhood years. 'Haemangiomas are not routinely surgically removed in the UK. The standard treatment for the condition is propranolol, to which most haemangiomas respond well. 'In the event they do not, patients would be referred to a dermatologist. Any patient accepted for treatment is managed in accordance with national waiting-time standards, which aim to treat 90 per cent of patients within 18 weeks. 'We hope Colby's procedure in the USA was successful, and we wish him the very best for the future.' Colby will now be monitored remotely from New York with the family sending photographs back to the hospital every week. Doctors have not ruled out a second operation in the near future to correct any abnormalities.","Colby Ramos-Francis was born with a small growth over his eyelid .

"A gene that affects the melting point of cocoa butter could lead to the creation of new types of chocolate - as well as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. US researchers discovered that a single gene called TcSAD1 is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter. Plant geneticists say their finding could also lead to new varieties of climate change-resistant cocoa plants, which could boost plants’ yields and the income of farmers. A gene involved in determining the melting point of cocoa butter could lead to the creation of new types of chocolate as well as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, scientists claim.  A stock image of chocolates is shown . More than five million cocoa farmers and their families depend on cocoa for their livelihoods around the world, where Cacao, Theobroma cacao L is cultivated in West Africa, Central and South America. The World Cocoa Foundation puts annual cocoa production worldwide at 3.8 million tons, which is valued at $11.8 billion (£7.9 billion). Each cocoa pod has 40 seeds, which are composed of cocoa butter and used in the making of chocolate – and some drugs. Lead researcher Mark Guiltinan, professor of plant molecular biology at Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences said that cocoa butter with altered melting points may find new uses in specialty chocolates, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. US researchers discovered that a single gene called TcSAD1 is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter. Plant geneticists say their finding could also lead to new varieties of climate change-resistant cocoa plants. Cacao trees growing at a research facility in Ecuador are pictured . The world's largest confectionary producer, joined Mars in November in warning of a massive shortfall of chocolate, which could reach a million tonnes a year by 2020. Switzerland's Barry Callebaut Group said soaring demand has helped chocolate prices hit more than double what they were just eight years ago. Industry experts say the world is in its longest production shortfall for five decades. Cocoa prices rose by a quarter in a year to a peak in August of £2,000 a tonne, nearing a February 2011 peak, Barry Callebaut said. Before the end of 2007 they had barely risen above £1,300, according to figures from the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Barry Callebaut chief executive Juergen Steinemann said the hike was fuelled partly by a 'potential cocoa shortage' by 2020 - echoing previous warnings by Mars Chocolate that demand will outstrip supply. 'The global cocoa sector may suffer a one million metric ton shortfall by 2020 because of increasing economic and environmental pressures on cocoa farms around the world,' the firm said. 'Our long-term business depends on a sustainable supply of high quality cocoa, and we believe that securing cocoa’s future begins with increasing yield for the smallholder farmers.' Disease and drought are partly to blame, but countries are also eating more sweets, particularly developing nations such as China. For example, a chocolate with a higher or lower melting point would be useful for production of chocolate with specific textures and specialty applications. 'The ""snap"" and ""melt"" of chocolate are two very important textural features that determine the appeal of chocolate to consumers, and having new varieties of the cocoa plant that produce butter with different melting points would be a valuable resource to control those characteristics,’ Professor Guiltinan explained. ‘Medical applications could include production of drug-delivery products with slower release of drugs than is possible with current cocoa-butter-based systems.’ Professor Guiltinan was previously involved in research that first described the stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SAD) gene family in the cocoa tree. Collaborators from the International Cocoa Genome Consortium sequenced the genome of the plant. Now Professor Guiltinan and his team have discovered that a single gene - TcSAD1 – in the SAD family, is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter. ‘We used state-of-the-art plant science techniques to gain evidence for the role of the SAD1 gene in cocoa butter biosynthesis,’ he explained. ‘The other SAD genes appear to play other roles in the growth of the chocolate tree, such as flower and leaf development, where these fatty acids play important roles as key components of various membrane systems. ‘This information can be used to develop biomarkers for screening and breeding of new cacao varieties with novel fatty acid compositions of cocoa butter.’ This image shows cacao seeds after harvest. A mixture of lipids called cocoa butter makes up about half of each seed. The natural melting point of cocoa butter is close to human body temperature. This trait gives chocolate its melt-in-your-mouth texture and provides a creamy texture to lotions applied to the skin . Professor Guiltinan and his team have discovered that a single gene - TcSAD1 – in the SAD family, is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter. He said the discovery could lead to new types of chocolate, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. A cocoa butter body scrub is shown left and a stock image of drugs, right . Cocoa butter consists of almost equal amounts of palmitic acid, stearic acid and oleic acid. Its exact composition determines its melting temperature, which is very close to human body temperature. This is why chocolate feels smooth in the mouth and cosmetics containing cocoa butter have a creamy texture when applied to skin. ‘During cacao seed development, large amounts of fatty acids are synthesised that are rich in saturated and monounsaturated lipids,’ Professor Guiltinan said. ‘An important part of this process is the activity of an enzyme produced by the SAD1 gene that creates a special double bond critical in determining the melting point of chocolate that is very close to the human body temperature and makes cocoa butter quite unique.’ 'The ""snap"" and ""melt"" of chocolate are very important textural features that determine the appeal of chocolate to consumers (stock image), and having new varieties of the cocoa plant that produce butter with different melting points would be a valuable resource to control those characteristics,’ Prof Guiltinan said .","Plant geneticists at Pennsylvania State University discovered that a single gene called TcSAD1 is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter .
Discovery could lead to chocolate with unique textures and new drugs too .
Research could also be used to create new varieties of cocoa plants .

"The family of a heavily pregnant Jehovah's Witness who died along with her baby after she refused a blood transfusion, have defended the woman who they said had put her baby's life above her own. Jenny-Lee, 28, was diagnosed with leukaemia seven months into her pregnancy, and although doctors at Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick told her she could give birth via a caesarean section and undergo chemotherapy, she refused both options as they required her to receive a blood transfusion. However her mother Heather has told The Daily Telegraph that her daughter believed the cancer treatment would harm her unborn child, named Aroura. 'She knew chemo would kill Aroura — she put the baby first each and every time and no matter what happened, she wanted that baby alive,' Heather said. A pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman and her baby have died after she refused a blood transfusion . 'We were told she would have six weeks to live — she fought to have the baby. That's the decision she made — she gave up her life.' Instead she blamed local doctors for her daughter's unnecessary death, claiming they should have tested her for the cancer sooner, but instead only attributed her symptoms to the flu and her pregnancy. The Sydney mother's baby died in utero three days after she was offered a caesarean. She had a stillbirth and died 13 days after her diagnosis by suffering a stroke and multi-organ failure. Jenny-Lee's elder daughter Chelsie, who was only 10 when her mother died in August 2009, also defended her mother. However the 28-year-old's brother David blamed the religion for how his sister died, calling her a 'fool'. 'It was not my sister who was sad and selfish, it is this religion and any other teaching this sort of nonsense,' he said. Jenny-Lee, 28, had pregnancy complications due to her leukaemia but rejected treatment on religious grounds . Her treating haematologist at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Dr Giselle Kidson-Gerber, said the mother understood the risks of her refusal to accept blood. 'Her refusal to receive a blood transfusion meant that we were unable to perform a caesarean section and to deliver the foetus,' Dr Kidson-Gerber told Daily Mail Australia. 'Obviously it's a very big ethical issue. Legally in Australia the mother has the right to make decisions on her behalf and her foetus's behalf. 'Most mothers would make decisions in favour of the unborn baby and this was a decision that was not in favour of the unborn baby.' Dr Kidson-Gerber added: 'If we were to give chemotherapy without blood transfusion support she surely would have died.' She was being treated at the Royal Hospital for Women and the Prince of Wale Hospital in Randwick . Hospital staff were 'distressed' over what were perceived to be two avoidable deaths, as 83 percent of pregnant leukaemia sufferers go into remission with treatment. Dr Kidson-Gerber said it was a challenge to respect a patient who refuses life-saving treatment. 'It was sad. I think that I did my best to help her. But ultimately I couldn't change the course of events,' she said. In a recent article published in the Internal Medicine Journal about the 2009 case, Dr Kidson-Gerber and her colleague Dr Amber Biscoe wrote: 'Not administering blood products in this case undoubtedly contributed to the death of mother and foetus. 'Refusal of a lifesaving intervention by an informed patient is generally well respected, but the rights of a mother to refuse such interventions on behalf of her foetus is more controversial.' Sascha Callaghan, an expert in ethics and law at the University of Sydney said the current law allows the mother to make decisions that would directly affect her unborn baby, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. She said Jehovah's Witnesses are often condemned for their beliefs, especially in relation to their stance against blood transfusions. 'This woman has a long-held commitment to the Jehovah's Witness faith and that's how she chose to die,' she told the Herald. 'When your foetus is in utero, it is inextricably tied to your life.' Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe the Bible commands them to abstain from ingesting blood and that avoiding blood pays respect to God as the giver of life.

"An Egyptian goose that lived for at least a week with an arrow piercing its neck as it evaded capture by animal control workers in Southern California died after it was wrangled and taken to surgery. The goose at first appeared to make it successfully through the operation at a bird and wildlife clinic Wednesday but then died a short time later, said Katie Ingram of Orange County Animal Care. 'The vet did everything that they could do,' Ingram told Los Angeles television station KNBC. 'We are unsure if it was due to the extent of the injuries or some other complication. We were all hoping for a happy ending for this little guy.' Scroll down for video . Dead goose: Goose with an arrow piercing its neck dies after surgery to remove the piercing object . Puncture wound: The goose at first appeared to make it successfully through the arrow removal operation at a bird and wildlife clinic Wednesday but then died a short time later . Poor goose: Somehow this poor little goose ended up with an arrow through it's neck . She said the bird's skin had healed around the arrow and made the process more difficult. Animal officials had high hopes for the bird's recovery after its capture earlier Wednesday because it seemed in otherwise good health and the arrow had missed all its vital organs. A worker at the Anaheim Hills Car Wash befriended the goose several days ago by feeding it bread crumbs and was able to catch it and turn it over, Ingram said. She said the animal was shot intentionally at least a week ago. Animal control officers started getting calls on April 5 about the bird and found it after a call from Hole 5 at the Anaheim Hills Golf Course on April 8, Ingram said. The birds are not native to the area, so it was probably living near the course or was someone's pet. The cause of the birds injuries are unknown but officials believe it was the victim of animal cruelty. Animal cruelty officers planned to launch an investigation into the assault and fingerprint the arrow after it was removed from the goose's neck. The investigation still stands but sadly the goose will waddle no more. Evaded care: The duck ran from animal care workers for at least a week after it was pierced in the neck . Tragic death: Veterinarians at an area bird and wildlife clinic examined the bird and said it appeared to be in good health, except for the arrow that missed all its vital organs .

"Nearly one in four teenagers are ‘almost constantly’ online as their lives are swallowed up ever more by their mobile phones, a study has revealed. Some 24 per cent of 13 to 17-year-olds admitted they were continuously checking their devices, including when they were at school. Nine in teenagers also confessed to going online every day as they were unable to resist the lure of Facebook and Instagram. In danger? The study also looked at social media and found that middle class teenagers were more likely to use Snapchat, the controversial message service where messages disappears seconds after they are sent . Parents now find it increasingly difficult to monitor their children's online behaviour as more than 70 per cent of teens use now more than one social network. The study was carried out on American teenagers but the findings would likely be worse in the UK as more British teenagers own smartphones than their US counterparts. The Pew Research Centre asked 1,060 children aged between 13 and 17 about their phone habits. The report found that what Pew described as a  ‘frenzy of access’ was facilitated by mobile phones - particularly smartphones. Of the 92 per cent of teens who went online every day, more than half said that meant using their phones several times a day. Some 12 per cent admitted to using a gadget once a day, six per cent said they went online just once a week and a mere two per cent said it was less than that. Addicted: Overall Facebook remains the most used social media site among teens with 71 per cent using it . In the largest ever systematic study of emails - examining more than 16 billion messages - researchers have found that most people send replies containing just five words. The study, which was conducted by researchers at Yahoo Labs and the University of Southern California, also found that our email habits also follow remarkable patterns. Replies become faster as the conversation progresses, but the researchers found they could tell when a email thread was about to end as the last reply was much slower than the previous replies. 'The long delay in a reply could be considered as a signal for the end of the conversation,' said the researchers, led by Farshad Kooti, a computer scientist at the University of Southern California. The study examined the emails sent by two million Yahoo users over a period of several months. They found that on average younger people tend to spend less time composing an email - with a reply time of around 13 minutes on average for teenagers. Young adults take 16 minutes, while those aged 36 to 50 years old spend around 24 minutes before sending their reply. Phone ownership was almost ubiquitous among young people, meaning they grow up used to being able to access anything any time they want. The Pew study found that nearly three-quarters of teens have access to a smartphone. Some 30 per cent have a basic phone and just 12 per cent of 13 to 17-year-olds have no phone of any kind. The study also looked at social media and found that middle class teenagers were more likely to use Snapchat, the controversial message service where the text and images disappears seconds after they are sent. The service has been blamed for a rise in ‘sexting’, where young people send explicit pictures to each other. Overall Facebook remains the most used social media site among teens with 71 per cent using it. Amanda Lenhart, the lead author and associate director of research at the Pew Research Centre, said: ‘There’s been a huge diversification of social media. ‘If you are wondering where your child is, you probably need to cast a wide net, because there is a variety of places where your teen could be spending his or her social media time’ Previous studies have starkly illustrated the extent to which young people are addicted to their mobiles. Smartphone users check their devices an average of 150 times a day as they cannot bear to be apart from them, one research paper showed. The study showed that we are so addicted to their mobiles that we cannot go 10 minutes without fiddling around with them.","9 in 10 teens go online every day, unable to resist the lure of Facebook .

"A 42-year-old man paralyzed in a Utah neighborhood watch shooting and found guilty of repeatedly having sex with a 17-year-old girl is asking an appeals court to either throw out his conviction or reduce his sentence. Attorneys for 42-year-old David Serbeck on Monday told the Utah Court of Appeals that Serbeck's original lawyers should have pushed harder to exclude or dispute allegations tying his 2007 relationship with the 17-year-old victim to his shooting. Two years after he had sex with the 17-year-old, Serbeck was shot and paralyzed in July 2009 by Reginald Campos, who suspected Serbeck of aggressively following his daughter in an SUV while patrolling their Buffdale neighborhood. Campos' daughter and the 17-year-old victim were not the same girl. Motion: Attorneys for 42-year-old David Serbeck, pictured in court in 2010, are asking an appeals court in Utah to either throw out his sex with a minor conviction or sentence . Serbeck (left) was shot and left paralyzed by the teenage victim's angry father, Reggie Campos (right) in July 2009 after the girl told Campos that Serbeck was aggressively stalking her . In March 2012, Serbeck was found guilty of three felony counts of unlawful sex with a minor and sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. His victim testified during the trial that she was 17 when she and Serbeck had sex three times in his Magna home in 2007. The girl visited him under the guise of playing with his pet snakes. Defense claims: Serbeck's attorney says the jury gave her client a long sentence after being led to believe that Serbeck was shot while out looking for more girls to exploit . The illicit affair came to an abrupt end when a friend discovered nude pictures on the teen's phone and told her parents. Serbeck staunchly denied the accusations, saying the teen, now 24, had a crush on him and wanted to impress her friends. Now, his defense team wants a new sentence for Serbeck, arguing that during the trial his attorneys failed to push back against claims that he was stalking other girls in July 2009 when he was shot and left paralyzed. Attorney Nathalie Skibine told the appeals justices that her client never got the chance to deny allegations of stalking and sex with other minors during his original trial, reported Deseret News. She also argued that the jury gave her client a long sentence after being led to believe that Serbeck was shot while out looking for more girls to exploit, even though he was never charged with any crime in connection to that incident. Prosecutors countered by saying that it was not the implication that Serbeck was on the hunt for more victims that got him the longer sentence, but rather, as the judge put it during his sentencing, his failure to 'own up' to his actions. ‘He has no remorse, he denies it and he considers himself the victim,’ Utah Attorney General Jeffrey Gray told the court Monday. On July 22, 2009, David Serbick was patrolling the Buffdale neighborhood with another man when he noticed two girls on the sidewalk, one of them Reginald Campos' teenage daughter. Campos, pictured here with his family, was convicted of attempted murder and aggravated assault in 2010 . Reprieve: In September 2013, a judge granted Campos parole. The man, pictured in court in 2010, was released from prison last July . The girl went to her father saying that Serbeck aggressively followed her in his SUV, prompting Campos, a married father of four, to grab his gun and go out looking for his daughter's stalker. Campos eventually found Serbeck and fired two shots at him, severing his spine and leaving him permanently paralyzed from the waist down. In 2010, Campos was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to three years to life in prison, reported KSL.com. He also received a consecutive term of up to five years in prison on a separate aggravated assault charge. But in September 2013, a judge granted Campos parole. He was released from prison in July 2014. The appeals court will rule on David Serbeck's appeal for a new sentence at a later date. He is due to appear before a parole board in September.","David Serbeck, 42, was found guilty in 2012 of unlawful sex with a 17-year-old girl in 2007 and sentenced to up to 10 years in prison .

"This is the heart-stopping moment two robbers pointed a gun at a family and their toddler during a corner-shop raid, before throwing sweets at them when they refused to hand over cash. Luke Munro, 19, and Dylon Thompson, 21, burst into the Londis shop in Cleveleys near Blackpool in October last year while the owner, his wife, and their toddler were behind the counter. The pair then pulled out a 'realistic looking' handgun and began waving it in the family's faces, demanding cash from the till, but the brave parents refused to hand it over. Luke Munro, 19, and Dylon Thompson, 21, raided a corner shop in Cleveleys near Blackpool using a 'realistic looking' handgun,pointing it at the owner, his wife, and their toddler as they hid behind the counter . When the mother and father refused to hand over cash, Munro and Thompson threw sweets at them before storming out empty handed . At that point, CCTV footage shows Munro and Thompson began throwing handfuls of sweets at the couple behind the counter, before fleeing empty handed. The duo were tracked down, and at Preston Crown Court on Wednesday Munro was jailed for five years and four months, while Thompson was sentenced to three years and four months. After the sentencing police said the attack was 'extremely distressing' for the family, who had been 'left in fear of their lives' during the raid. Detective Inspector Gareth Willis, from Lancashire Police, said: 'It's just incredibly brave of them not to give them what they wanted. 'The victims have been extremely brave in what must have been a terrifying incident for them both. Munro (left) was jailed for five years at Preston Crown Court for robbery, possessing a firearm and burglary, while Thompson was jailed for three years and four months for robbery and firearms offences . Police said the victims had been left 'extremely distressed' during the raid, and had been 'left in fear of their lives' as the gun was waved in their face . 'The female actually had her baby with her in the store when she was threatened with the weapon, which makes the offenders' actions even more reprehensible.' Detective Constable Paul Morris, from the same force, added: 'This was a terrifying ordeal for the two shop owners and their young child who were left in fear of their lives after being threatened with what they believed to be a real firearm. 'Munro and Thompson caused extreme distress for the victims involved and I hope that the sentences send a warning to criminals that crimes of this nature are treated seriously by both the police and the courts as well as bringing some closure for the victims.'","Luke Munro, 19, and Dylon Thompson, 21, raided Londis near Blackpool .

"Foreign workers will have to pay an average of £22,000 in tax before they can claim benefits under Tory plans to be unveiled this week. Migrants arriving in the UK will be banned from receiving handouts from the welfare state for four years, forcing them to pay tax and national insurance the state. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Tory manifesto will spell out plans to negotiate a new deal with Europe, including curbing access to benefits. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Tory manifesto will spell out plans to negotiate a new deal with Europe, including curbing access to benefits . Under the proposals, unemployed EU migrants in Britain will be banned from receiving state support, and would be deported if they do not get a job within six months of arriving. For those in work, they would be barred from claiming handouts like housing benefit or tax credits until they have being in the UK for four years. It means a migrant workers on an average wage will pay £22,600 in tax and national insurance over four years before they are able to receive state support. There will also be a ban on 'exporting' child benefit for children living in other EU countries. The crackdown was ordered after the government failed to meet David Cameron's target of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands. Latest figures show that in the year to September, 298,000 more people arrived in the UK than left. Mr Cameron rowed back from plans to limit freedom of movement across the EU after a backlash from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But Mrs May today said the benefits changes would act to limit the appeal of coming to Britain from poorer parts of the EU. 'Our plan would remove a huge financial incentive for European migrants to come to Britain for the wrong reasons,' she told The Sun. 'Instead of claiming in-work benefits, under our plans the vast majority will pay into the system, contributing thousands of pounds.' Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . She said the Tories had made the immigration system 'fairer and more effective' than it was in 2010, but more was needed. The Home Secretary said: 'That's why our manifesto, which will be published this week, will spell out our plan to negotiate a new deal with Europe. 'The changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be a key part of our renegotiation with the EU, and we will put our reform package to the British people in a straight in-out referendum by the end of 2017. 'Labour oppose this plan, as they have opposed all the steps we have taken to create a fairer immigration system since 2010. Ukip talk a lot about immigration - but they don't have a serious plan for action.' Under the plans, migrants with jobs will only receive in-work benefits, such as tax credits, and social housing once they have been in the UK for four years. And no child benefits or tax credits for children living elsewhere in Europe will be paid out, regardless of how long an EU migrant has paid into UK coffers under the plans. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said immigration was important for Britain but it needed to be 'controlled and managed'. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said immigration was important for Britain but it needed to be 'controlled and managed' She told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: 'The practical policies are that we want to make sure we have stronger border controls and that means having 1,000 more border staff to actually do proper checks to follow up on visas.' Labour, she added, would change the benefit rules so that people coming to Britain could not claim benefits until they had been in the country for more than two years. She said: 'It's not happening, what have they done in the last five years, they haven't dealt with it. And the thing that is different about our approach compared to any other party is we would deal with the exploitation by agencies, recruitment agencies and employers, who are exploiting immigration to undercut wages and jobs, that makes the system unfair. 'You've got some recruitment agencies who are recruiting from abroad, we would change the law, make exploitation a crime.' The Conservatives, she added, should not be trying to restrict overseas university students at the same time as 'doing nothing' about illegal immigration.","Conservatives will ban in-work benefits for migrants for four years .

"ALL DAY LONG . By Joanna Biggs . (Serpent’s Tail £14.99) Famously and memorably, the poet Philip Larkin asked: 'Why should I let the toad work / Squat on my life?' He longed to be '... courageous enough / To shout Stuff your pension! - but knew he never would. Coffee morning: Britain at work . The tyranny of the nine-to-five is about money (of course), but also about moral worth: we work because we know we should 'pull our weight' in society's tug-of-war. On any morning, in any town or city all over the world, people stream into their places of work, some driven by a sense of vocation, some by resigned boredom, some by greed, some by need. Surely it is work, not love, which makes the world go round? Joanna Biggs offers an excellent contribution to our knowledge of the world of work in all its variety - not through tedious sociological analysis (thank goodness), but through the stories of real people she has interviewed all over the country. Reading this book reminds me how times have changed dramatically since my generation left school or college in the Sixties with no worries about finding a job. We were lucky. Joanna Biggs makes it bleakly clear that for many people today, 'the idea that good work brings a good life no longer holds'. Biggs divides her workers in interesting categories, yoking disparate occupations in terms of their overall function. So the 'Making' chapter gives us a potter, a shoemaker and (yes) a robot, which introduces us to its maintenance engineers. 'Serving' includes a sex worker, two baristas, a call centre adviser and a political special adviser. Those 'Repairing' are a rabbi, an Army major and a nurse, while those 'Leading' are a company director, a stay-at-home mum (inspired, that one) and a hereditary lord. Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me' The scope of the book is broad. We meet those who are selling, entertaining, thinking, caring - as well as a curious clutch of people Biggs lumps together under 'Starting': a goldsmith's apprentice (one of my favourites), a rebellious intern, an entrepreneur specialising in 'start-up' technologies, an unemployed graduate. There's also a 56-year-old man on Mandatory Work Activity, usually known as 'workfare' - the Government initiative designed for those on Jobseeker's Allowance, to help them 'gain a better understanding of the discipline and focus required for work... while at the same time making a contribution to the community'. Joanna Biggs clearly does not think very much of 'workfare': in fact, it's clear she despises the scheme. Here, although of course anyone can see that the system is not perfect, I wish she hadn't editorialised so overtly. I really wanted to hear more about what John thought of his life. A book which aims to give the reader much-needed insight into other people's lives (and it certainly does that) seems to me to be spoilt by degenerating into a student newspaper leader: 'A citizen's income set at the right level - £320 a week is the current estimate - would kill off the sort of unproductive and low-paid jobs that have proliferated since 2008 in the UK.' At that point the author does not speculate what disastrous effects such indiscriminate largesse could have on the economy, with inevitable repercussions for the very men and women she has met. ALL DAY LONG By Joanna Biggs . In the Seventies I was a huge admirer of the work of America's Studs Terkel and England's Tony Parker, both oral historians who aimed to give insight into the lives of those with no voice, by using recorded interviews, carefully transcribed, with no questions included and no comment or judgment. It was a magnificent technique which catapulted the reader movingly (and sometimes shockingly) into the hearts and minds of prisoners, drifters, miners, people on a housing estate, and so on. You felt you got to know them without the author-interviewer standing in the way - although, of course, all interviews have to be edited. Joanna Biggs invokes Terkel: 'I've often wondered what (he) would think of how we think about work now.' Well, I reckon the great man would continue to record what he heard, without surprise, and without trying to fit life stories into a pre-conceived mould. In contrast, Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me: it felt as if work was becoming more insecure on one hand, and the work ethic increasingly revered on the other.' At the end, she lays her cards on the table, confessing that as she listened to people's stories, 'I most often wished for the way we work as a society to be organised more fairly and hoped for more resistance to the way it's organised now.' That's the trouble with the workers, you see. They've always been unpredictable individuals who may like or dislike their jobs but just get on with life, turning their backs on revolution.","Joanna Biggs tells the stories of real people she has interviewedin the UK .

Authorities have urged the public not to approach him as he is considered extremely dangerous. They have asked anyone who believes they have seen him to phone 911 immediately. According to WRAL, a student government representative said the shooting took place on the third floor of the Wayne Learning Center, which houses the library, cafeteria and student lounge. Fire Marshall Brian Taylor told NBC News that multiple members of local law enforcement descended on the scene and a massive manhunt was underway for the suspected shooter. According to MSNBC, the lockdown was lifted as of about 10.30am ET.

"A Santander bank worker who helped hackers in a bid to steal more than £1.25m is facing jail today. Personal advisor Tola Ore, 32, fitted a high-tech device to her desktop computer which allowed fraudsters to take control of the workstation from outside the bank in Palmers Green in north London. The Old Bailey heard that Ore attached a keyboard video mouse (KVM) to her computer allowing the unknown criminals to steal money electronically from the bank. Tola Ore, pictured, attached admitted one  count of fraud at the Old Bailey as she was about to stand trial . Ora, 32, fitted a keyboard video mouse to the USB port of her computer in the Santander bank branch in Palmers Green, pictured, allowing fraudsters to remotely access the computer to transfer cash . The gang attempted to deposit £1,274,000 into 12 different bank accounts over the course of one morning on July 23, 2013. Another member of staff spotted the suspicious transaction before the full amount could be transferred so the bank's losses here stopped at £147,678. Eight-months pregnant Ore was due to stand trial this week, but yesterday admitted her part in the scam. She claimed the masterminds of the fraud had threatened her then two-year-old daughter and warned her: ‘We are going to put you in the coffin.’ Judge Richard Marks QC, the Common Serjeant of London, is due to sentence Ore later this morning. Edmund Fowler, prosecuting, said the scam was spotted on July 23 2013 after more than £1.25m was deposited into 12 Santander bank accounts before the branch’s opening time, sparking an investigation and search of the premises. Ore had worked for the bank for six years and had her own office by the time of the fraud. Mr Fowler said: ‘Analysis revealed a device capable of providing remote access had been fitted through one of the USB ports on her computer. ‘It was Ms Ore who was the only one who had access to the computer at the time the device was fitted and she was the only person to have left the branch prior to the search.’ An audit revealed the fraudulent deposits had been made from Ore’s computer. The court heard that Ore, pictured, is eight-months pregnant and only took part because the gang threatened her daughter who was aged two . Mr Fowler continued: ‘The work station was obviously the key. The answer was there was a remote device plugged in.' The KVM device, which is about the same size as a video tape, contains a SIM card that allows it to be controlled over WIFI, the court heard. He said: ‘It allows someone else to have control of the screen as if someone is physically at the work station.' The device was fitted at 5.08pm on 22 July 2013 and removed at 8.55am the following morning. ‘CCTV footage provided the last piece of the jigsaw,’ the prosecutor added. Ore was the only person in the branch when the device was connected and disconnected. Footage showed her removing something about the size of a video tape from her handbag, which she had taken into her office against company policy. She was also seen clutching a lever-arch file as she left the branch shortly after the item was disconnected from her computer. Ore was then spotted entering Morrisons where she entered the toilet shortly followed by another person before they both left after just 50 seconds. She was arrested on 23 July and initially denied knowledge of the fraud. She insisted she was innocent right up to the start of her trial. Sam Robinson, defending, said there was evidence Ore and her four-year-old daughter had been threatened by others involved in the scam who have never been caught. ‘There was pressure being brought to bear in order for her to give up her details’, he said. ‘She would be aware of the security protocols in operation, but hugely incriminating details is being used, her log in details, which is entirely consistent with her not having a choice about it. ‘Had she had a choice about it, that is the last thing she would have done..’ Ore said she was first approached in early June 2013 by a ‘man outside work as she left’ who started asking questions about her job. A few week later, her daughter suffered a cut hand and grazed knee after falling in a park, and a few days afterwards Ore said she was approached by a woman at Westfield Shopping Centre. ‘She said that incident that happened in the park with your daughter, that wasn’t an accident’, she told the court. ‘I just froze, she was saying don’t tell anyone, that’s it, we will find you - we know where you live.’ Ore said the mystery woman warned her: ‘We are going to put you in the coffin.’ She said she received a package through the post containing the KVM device, then an Asian man came in to the bank to show her how to attach it to her computer. ‘Those threats are reissued’, said Mr Robinson . ‘He said “You are being watched, if you tell anyone what is happening there will be consequences for you and your daughter. Be ready to do what you are told.”’ Mr Robinson said Ore was told to throw the device in a bin in Morrisons after the fraud had been carried out. Judge Marks offered Ore the chance to give evidence after first hearing her explanation, saying: 'I’ve serious reservations about what I have been told. This account comes the Friday before the Monday of the trial, a year and a half after the event, and in terms of credibility which is central, she has lied throughout.’ Ore, of Edmonton, north London, admitted a single count of fraud.

"Don McLean (pictured) is responsible American Pie, the lyrics of which have been puzzled over for decades . There has never been a popular song quite like it. For more than 40 years, its lyrics have been an enigma wrapped in an eight-and-a-half minute long rock 'n' roll puzzle. Argued over by generations of geeky fans, deciphered and re-deciphered by code-breaking rock nerds and considered to be poetic reflections on mid-20th century U.S. social history by even groovier academics, it's called American Pie. And this week its lyrics, hand-written in 1971 by a young folk singer called Don McLean, were sold at auction in New York for more than $1 million. That's a lot of money for 18 sheets of paper, albeit with a lost seventh verse. But, to be honest, I rather think that whoever bought them got a bargain. Because, in this age, when song lyrics have all but become meaningless, American Pie illustrates, in a series of images, metaphors and allusions, just what can be done within the frame of a melodically straightforward pop song. It's also a paean to education. McLean loves words, he says, 'almost as much as life'. That may be a slight overstatement, but it shows. Of course, like all poets, McLean didn't give us a key to the riddle of what his song was about when he released his multi-million-selling single. That would have spoiled it. 'It means I'll never have to work again,' he would joke about how much money the song had made him, leaving us to work out for ourselves what the 'sad news on the doorstep' was exactly, and why he 'couldn't take one more step' when he read it. That was the easy part, of course, for anyone of my and his generation who learned about the death in a plane crash in 1959 of one of the first great singer-songwriters of rock, Buddy Holly, when we read about it in the morning newspaper. As McLean sings, it was truly 'The day the music died'. I was on a Ribble bus going to school in Lancashire, peering over the shoulder of the man in front of me when I saw the headline. McLean, according to his song, anyway, was 14 and delivering papers in the rather smart New York suburb of New Rochelle where he grew up. It was a strange, wistful opening for a pop song, but then, as the beat kicked in, the lyrics began to portray the innocence of God-fearing, teenage high school in Fifties America. Listing pop song titles like the Book Of Love and A White Sports Coat and A Pink Carnation, and dances in the gym where the worst that could happen would be that the girl you fancied was dancing with some other guy, it painted a picture of what by 1971 was already a bygone time. Then, in between every verse, would come that cryptic chorus about driving his 'Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry'. For years, I thought that was something to do with the raised earthworks — levees — that run along the banks of the Mississippi in New Orleans, until I discovered that a 'levee' can also mean a party. So the parties that kids would attend in the non-threatening Fifties would always have been dry — that is, without alcohol. Yes, same in Britain. On the surface, it might seem that American Pie — especially the first half, which was the section mainly played on the radio because the record was far too long to be played in full — was just a misty-eyed lament for an untroubled Mom and Apple Pie American youth. But, suddenly, the mood changed as McLean — jaundiced almost, and certainly disappointed — looked around late-Sixties America and saw how the 'jester in a coat he borrowed from James Dean' (thought to mean Bob Dylan in his leather jacket) stole the King's 'thorny crown'. Or, as you and I might say, knocked Elvis Presley off his top-notch perch. Almost everything is seen through youth icons. In the line 'while Lenin read a book on Marx', was he teasingly criticising John Lennon for appearing to be espousing Marxist revolutionary theory in his solo songs? I think he might have been. And was 'helter skelter in a summer swelter' a reference to the murders of actress Sharon Tate and friends by the 'Charles Manson Family' in Los Angeles in the summer of 1969? It has to be. In an absurd defence, murderer Manson maintained that he had interpreted The Beatles innocuous lyrics in their song Helter Skelter as instructions to go out and kill. Manson is still in jail. Even after all these years, much of American Pie is still opaque. Was the reference to The Byrds' record Eight Miles High a comment on the carpet-bombing by U.S. jets in Vietnam? Only McLean knows — and he isn't saying. When asked to give a few hints as to the meaning of the lyrics for this week's auction catalogue, he simply said that 'the song was not a parlour game', but 'an indescribable photograph of America that I tried to capture in words and music'. And metaphor, he might have added, as, in my interpretation of the lyrics, a game of American football becomes a student demonstration, probably at Kent State University, over America's military extension of the Vietnam war to Cambodia, to the music of The Beatles' Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album. To this day, songwriter Don McLean has refused to divulge what the lyrics of American Pie refer to . 'The half-time air was sweet-perfume', which probably means that everybody was smoking pot, and wanting to have a nice, quiet time, when the demo was broken up violently by the Ohio National Guard, who shot four students dead. Then there's the question of Mick Jagger. Is he 'Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack Flash sat on a Candlestick'? Maybe. But there is confusion because it isn't The Beatles' famous last U.S. show at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, that McLean is singing about, but The Rolling Stones' performance at nearby Altamont in 1969. At that concert, the Stones performed Sympathy For The Devil and then watched helplessly as, before them in the crowd, Hell's Angels beat a man to death. 'And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage,' go the lyrics of American Pie. 'No angel born in hell, could break that Satan's spell.' Dancing to rock 'n' roll was never meant to get like this, he seems to be saying. I'm not sure that if I were Mick Jagger, I'd want to hear that sung about myself. Although McLean said before the auction of his song's lyrics that the pages would 'divulge everything there is to divulge' about this 'mystical trip into my past', they clearly don't. But the material does cast some light on how the song changed before he recorded it. Originally, he had intended a positive ending, suggesting an extra verse that the music he once loved would be reborn in happier times. But in the end he settled for the more worldly-wise: 'The three men I admire the most, The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost / They caught the last train for the coast / The day the music died.' A bleak ending, yes, but apart from the reference to the Holy Trinity, is there also perhaps a nod here to John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, whose assassinations occurred in the Sixties? Again, McLean isn't saying. What he does do, however, is give excellent advice to songwriters who are just starting out: 'Immerse yourself in beautiful music and beautiful lyrics and think about every word you say in a song.' Were the lyrics 'The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost' a nod to John F. Kennedy (left), Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King (right), whose assassinations occurred in the Sixties? It seems so obvious, doesn't it? But then you turn on the radio and realise that, with just a few exceptions, an appreciation of good music and lyrics has played little part in the education of so many of today's songwriters. As McLean showed, the right word can mean so much. Most people will probably think of 69-year-old Don McLean as a one-hit wonder — now living in semi-retirement, and no doubt the lap of luxury, with his wife in Maine. And he certainly wasn't able to ever better American Pie. But at around the same time, he also wrote two other pop classics. Vincent, about Vincent Van Gogh's painting The Starry Night, as well as And I Love You So. This week's buyer of the lyrics of American Pie unfortunately prefers to remain anonymous, and that suggests to me that's he's a billionaire who wants to frame them and stick them on his study wall. I'd far rather they had been bought by an university so students of U.S. literature and social history could spend another 40-odd years poring over them, and discussing what can be done with a popular song, and how America was, as it says in the lyrics, a 'long, long time ago'.","For more than 40 years, the lyrics of American Pie have been puzzled over .

"A dog who was living in a shelter for the past five years has finally gone home to a loving family in New York state after his photo was shared on social media. Chester, a 6-year-old Pit Bull mix, had been housed at the North Fork Animal Welfare League on Long Island. The poor pooch had been living in New York state shelters since 2010 and it looked as though things were going to remain that way, until a picture that was shared online garnered sympathy from across the country. Scroll down for video . How could you say no? This is the picture that secured Chester a loving home . Long-time coming: Chester, a six-year-old pit bull, was found as a stray and had been living in shelters for the past five years . Welcome to the family: On Friday morning, Dana Dor, her husband Adi, and their boys, Aidan and Brandon, headed from their Lake Ronkonkoma home to meet Chester . The shelter, which is based in Riverhead on Long Island posted a picture on Thursday that was hard for dog-lovers to resist. It showed Chester with a sign around his neck. An image that was clearly designed to tug at the heartstrings of dog-lovers. 'Why doesn't anybody want me? I've been waiting 5 years. Everyone at the shelter tells me what a good boy I am. So why has no one adopted me? I promised to be good and love my new family. Please maybe you are my new family/ I sit and wait for you to come,' the message pleaded. The picture was shared more than 6,000 times and inquires about adopting Chester poured in from all over the world. 'It was crazy. I posted the original photo on the League's Facebook page and by later that day there were over 6000 shares,' NFAWL manager Gabby Stroup said. 'There were more phone calls then I can count; the phone just never stopped. People called from Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Michigan, Oregon, New Jersey Wisconsin, Nova Scotia, Australia and more — people were tearing up as they called.' Tugging at heartstrings: Staring with his sad puppy dog eyes into the camera, Chester sat with a paw draped over a sign which read: 'Why doesn't anybody want me? Saying goodbye: Saturday morning, volunteers came to the shelter to say good-bye to Chester, a longtime favorite among those who'd come regularly to walk him and give him belly rubs and kisses . Within a couple of days of the posting, Chester was adopted by a family with two sons from New York. They came to take him home on Saturday. 'A woman named Dana called me inquiring about him; a friend of hers from Michigan had shared Chester's picture on her page,' Ms Stroup said. 'Dana and I talked about Chester for a bit; she wanted to talk it over with her family.' On Friday morning, Dana Dor, her husband Adi, and their boys, Aidan and Brandon, headed from their Lake Ronkonkoma home  to meet Chester. 'They came and met him and it is just a perfect match,' Stroup said to Southold Local.com . 'It was by far the most amazing thing I have ever seen — the amount of people who shared and called or emailed was amazing. This was one of the happiest days,' Ms Stroup said. Yesterday morning, volunteers came to the shelter to say good-bye to Chester. After five years, he had become a longtime favorite among those who'd come regularly to walk him. So happy together: Dana Dor said the family lost two Yorkies, five years ago, the same amount of time that Chester has been waiting for his forever family. 'We think he was waiting for us,' Mrs Dor said . Part of the family: Adi Dor sets up a cage for Chester to sleep in at his new home . Settling in: Chester had found his perfect match in the Dor family and was soon taken for a new life at their Lake Ronkonkoma home . The Dors arrived and Chester seemed to like the family instantly, covering their faces with licks and kisses. 'We saw him and we felt connected. It was meant to be, ' Adi Dor said; his wife said her husband had tears in his eyes the first time he met Chester. Their two young boys were delighted with the new addition to their family. They had been asking for a dog for some time. Ms Stroup said it was all down to the power of Facebook and the pleading message that hung around Chester's neck. The shelter has received a lot of attention as a result of Chester's plight and intends to use it's Facebook page to help other long-term residents of the refuge find new homes. Puppy power: Using the power of social media the animal shelter took a picture of the poor pooch and posted it onto a Facebook page where it received 6,000 likes and Chester found a loving home .","A heartbreaking photo of a six-year-old Pit mix appeared on an animal shelter's Facebook page .

"Cleared: Andrew Anderson, 43, pictured outside Manchester Magistrates' Court, was claimed to have forced a social worker to the floor, injuring her wrist . A father-of-three has been cleared of assaulting a social worker following a Black Friday bundle at Tesco over a 32in TV - after a judge said the chaotic scenes made it hard to blame anyone. Andrew Anderson, 43, was accused of forcing social worker Julie McGoldrick to the floor, injuring her wrist, as they battled over the unit which had been reduced from £199 to £99 as part of the frenzied midnight sales event. The self-employed gardener ‘strategised’ his shopping and grabbed a TV near the bottom of a pallet in Manchester, only for Mrs McGoldrick, 53, to grab the same one at the same time - and suffer injuries that saw her end up in hospital. However, a judge at Manchester Magistrates’ Court has now cleared him of any wrongdoing, saying it was not certain that Mr Anderson 'went on not caring whether she was hurt or not'. The court was told how Mrs McGoldrick slipped her hand behind the TV box’s security cable in an effort to hang on because she could not hold it normally due to her injured thumbs. But seconds later she ended up on the floor and in serious pain as Tesco workers grabbed Mr Anderson and pulled him while he was holding the TV - taking the trapped woman with them. CCTV footage was shown at court where a judge called the incident ‘extraordinary’ and said ‘excitement and tension’ had built up before the reduced Blaupunkt TVs were unveiled. The video showed dozens of shoppers piling into Tesco to get their hands on discounted goods as part of the annual US tradition of Black Friday, which has received a controversial reception since being brought to Britain in 2008. Arriving at the store just ten minutes before the 12am opening time on November 28 last year, Mr Anderson, of Middleton, Manchester, managed to get to the front of the queuing throng - beating some shoppers who had waited for up to four hours. Black plastic sheets covering a pallet of cheap TVs were still in place at 12.15am at the store in Burnage, Manchester, which led to shoppers becoming ‘frustrated’ and ‘upset’, the court heard. Scroll down for video . Fracas: Mr Anderson (wearing the grey hat, circled) 'strategised' his shopping and grabbed a TV near the bottom of a pallet, only for Julie McGoldrick (in the light blue jacket) to grab the same one at the same time . When the sheets were eventually lifted, cameras captured the ‘free-for-all’, with customers pushing and shoving to get the best chance of grabbing their discounted sets. Mrs McGoldrick had attended the Tesco with her 30-year-old daughter Marie to try to grab a bargain TV for her, while Mr Anderson had arrived with his mother, girlfriend and young child. After the incident, police were called and arrested Mr Anderson, while Mrs McGoldrick was taken  to hospital where it was feared she had broken her wrist. She was released the next day with bruising. CCTV footage of the moment Mrs McGoldrick fell to the floor was played repeatedly in court as it was argued Tesco employees can be seen pulling Mr Anderson which ultimately lead to her injury. Mrs McGoldrick described the five minutes before midnight as ‘chaotic’. She said: ‘I put my hands out and around a box. I don’t have use of my two thumbs. 'So I put my hand through the wire and grabbed it with my forefingers. I was holding the box and then people were coming forward to get other boxes around me. Video: CCTV footage of the moment Mrs McGoldrick (in light blue jacket) fell to the floor was played as it was argued Tesco employees can be seen pulling Mr Anderson (in grey hat) which ultimately lead to her injury . ‘The box was grabbed quite violently and I fell back. Then as I looked up I saw the same gentleman who is here today. He could have had the TV but I couldn’t let go because my arm was in the wiring. ‘I was saying ""Let go, I can’t let go of the TV, can you please let go?"" I was trying to pull the cord to release my arm. Once my arm was released I felt sick and shaken. ‘Somebody had gone to get frozen peas but an ambulance had already been called.’ Mr Anderson told the court that he had gone to another nearby Tesco earlier in the evening but had moved on because it looked like they only had coffee machines on the pallet. He added: ‘I had to strategise. I thought they would all go for the TVs at the top so I went for the bottom and picked the TV.’ He faced a day-long trial but was cleared of common assault. After the hearing Mr Anderson said: ‘I knew it was going to be a tussle. I’m not sure why a middle-aged woman was there anyway. In attendance: Mrs McGoldrick had attended the Tesco store in Burnage, Manchester, with her daughter Marie to try to grab a bargain TV for her, while Mr Anderson had arrived with his mother, girlfriend and young child . ‘When you go to something like that you know what you are in for. I’m sorry the lady’s hand got caught. There was nothing I could do. Everyone wanted to get a TV. Timed to follow Thanksgiving, Black Friday was an all-American tradition marking the beginning of the Christmas shopping rush. US stores have made the day a huge event, promising big short-term discounts to create excitement and queues outside shops. But it has been marred in recent years by aggression among shoppers. In 2013, an 11-year-old girl was taken to hospital after being trampled by a crowd in New Boston, Ohio. In 2008, a Walmart worker died after being crushed by frenzied customers at a Long Island store. It is thought Black Friday, first brought to the UK seven years ago by online retailer Amazon, was so named as it is the day stores go ‘into the black’ financially. Last November police chiefs appealed for calm after sales-crazed shoppers sparked a wave of disorder and violence. Bargain hunters were accused of behaving like animals as they grappled over coffee machines, hair-dryers and computers. 'There was no-one going out to injure people. I don’t know why she put her hand in the security tag. I didn’t even get my TV in the end. I even missed out on the Sainsbury’s sale at 6am because the police held me until the afternoon. ‘Everyone was there looking for a bargain and that’s all it was. I thought I would get a TV quickly without people realising and she has seen me come up with a TV and thought ""I will have that one"". There was nothing I could do. I’m just a bargain hunter.' He added: 'After that I didn’t even go to the January sales. I’m going to stop going to sales. I would rather pay full price because it’s not worth it if this is what ends up happening.’ Clearing Mr Anderson of wrongdoing, District Judge Anthony Carr said: ‘Mrs McGoldrick tried to get one or two TVs disappearing before her eyes, and did get her hand on a box - and unfortunately got her hand through the wires, because she thought that was the best way to hold on to it. ‘Mr Anderson is taken to one side and Mrs McGoldrick is taken to one side with him because she is attached to the box. I have to be satisfied that he went on not caring whether she was hurt or not - and I can’t be.’ No Tesco staff directly involved in the melee were called to give evidence. After Black Friday last year, police were called to eight Tesco stores in Greater Manchester and three men were arrested. At the time, Greater Manchester Police’s Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy said the incidents were ‘totally predictable’, and criticised supermarkets over their security arrangements.","Andrew Anderson was accused of forcing Julie McGoldrick to the floor .

"A green-skinned figure in a medieval manuscript may look very familiar to Star Wars fans. The ink illustration appears to show the Jedi knight Yoda on the pages of a religious document. But in fact, the drawing is part of a bizarre representation of the Biblical story of Samson, one expert claims. A green-tinged cloaked figure in a medieval manuscript (pictured) bears more than a little resemblance to Yoda from the Star Wars films, but is in fact a part of a strange representation of the Biblical story of Samson . The drawing shows a cloaked creature  with long, spiky hands and protruding pointy ears - just like the fantasy character. ‘The Yoda image comes from a 14th century manuscript known as the Smithfield Decretals,’ British Library curator Julian Harrison told MailOnline. ‘I'd love to say that it really was Yoda, or was drawn by a medieval time traveller, but it's actually an illustration to the biblical story of Samson — the artist clearly had a vivid imagination!’ the curator of the museum’s medieval manuscripts blog said. The Yoda like image comes from a 14th-century manuscript known as the Smithfield Decretals. A model of the popular Star Wars character is shown . According to the biblical account, Samson was given supernatural strength by God in order to combat his enemies and perform heroic acts such as killing a lion, slaying an entire army with only the jawbone of an ass and destroying a pagan temple. But he had two vulnerabilities - his attraction to untrustworthy women and his hair, without which he became weak and powerless. These vulnerabilities ultimately proved fatal for him in the story of Samson and Delilah. However, it’s not clear which character ‘Yoda’ is meant to be in the tale. Dr Harrison said it is simply a whimsical addition to the page, which also includes other strange human-animal hybrids. The manuscript that appears to bear the sci-fi character’s image is also known as the ‘Decretals of Gregory IX with gloss of Bernard of Parma’ and was painstakingly written and illustrated in France between 1300 and 1340, NPR reported. So the biblical character, or ‘Yoda’ made his appearance in a collection of papal letters and church decrees in the precious volume, which can be viewed in its entirely online. It also includes a bizarre image of a rabbit shooting a leaping dog with a bow and arrow. No-one is suggesting that the image of Yoda influenced the popular films in any way, but according to Star Wars folklore, Yoda is 900 years old – in the films shot in the late 1970s. So if it were him in shown in the book, it would have been a ‘portrait’ drawn when the character was approximately 260 years old. The trailer for Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens has now been released and shows Hans Solo, played by Harrison Ford, who appeared more than 30 years ago as the character in The Jedi Returns. The eagerly anticipated film directed by JJ Abrams is set for release on 18 December and features original trilogy actors Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher who played Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. This is a more traditional image of the story of Samson, painted in 1630 by Anthonie van Dyck. The tale goes that Samson is given supernatural strength by God and does great acts, but he loses it when his hair is cut off and dies a violent death .

"With a sting like a hot nail being hammered into the body, Asian hornets have killed at least six people in France. Now experts fear millions of them could be heading for Britain – and the threats they pose are to be discussed at a summit meeting by beekeepers. This is because the two-inch-long Asian hornets pose a terrible danger to our honeybees. They pick off bees as they leave their hive until the colony is so exhausted the hornets can move in and ransack it. Scroll down for video . Sting in the tail? Experts fear millions of two-inch-long Asian hornets (above) could be heading to Britain after leaving six people dead and terrorising wildlife in France . The hornet is thought to have travelled to France on some Chinese pot plants in 2004. It has colonised huge swathes of the country and, with a few hornets capable of destroying 30,000 bees in just a couple of hours, honey production has plummeted. The Norfolk Beekeepers' Association will hold its Bee Health Seminar at Easton and Otley College on May 23, organised in conjunction with the National Bee Unit, which delivers the Bee Health Programmes on behalf of Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Topics under discussion will also highly infectious diseases which threaten bee colonies such as European and American foulbrood. Carolyne Liston, chairman of the Norfolk Beekeepers' Association, warned Asian hornets are a 'very, very aggressive predator' and said they could 'come here on the wind'. She said: 'They can absolutely decimate colonies and we are concerned that it is going to come in on someone's caravan who has been travelling in France.' UK beekeepers have been sent email alerts by Defra asking them to be on the look-out for the menaces. Danger: The threats posed by Asian hornets are to be discussed at a summit meeting by beekeepers, while UK beekeepers have been sent email alerts by Defra asking them to be on the look-out . The Asian hornet can measure up to  2in long with a 3in wingspan – slightly smaller than the European hornet but much more aggressive. One Asian hornet can kill 40 bees in a minute, while a handful can destroy a hive of 30,000 bees in a couple of hours. They build rugby ball-shaped nests in trees, housing some 500 hornets. They scare off intruders by sending a lone worker hornet to 'warn' them – if that fails, the workers attack en masse. Worker hornets have lifespans of 30-55 days. Asian hornets have a black head with an orange-yellow face and bright yellow leg tips, while the European hornet has a copper coloured head with a bright-yellow face and entirely reddish-brown legs. They have been urged not to approach nests, which they say hornets make in tall trees or in garages and sheds. If Asian hornets are spotted here, the National Bee Unit will send out experts from the Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency to kill them using special chemicals. Ministers drew up battle plans in case killer Asian hornets are discovered in Britain last year. A law announced in the Queen's Speech gave officials powers to enter private land and destroy new invasive species within days. Groups of Asian hornets hover in front of a beehive, picking off single honeybees, decapitating them and stripping off their wings and legs before making off with the 'meat ball' to feed their young. In Asia, honeybees have learned to encircle an intruder hornet and, by flapping their wings, cause it to overheat and die. But the French bees have not had enough time to evolve an effective tactic. The hornet sting can be extremely painful to humans but, like bee stings, it is likely to kill only if the victim has a severe allergic reaction. The victims in France died from anaphylactic shock after being stung. Last night, a Defra spokesman confirmed there had been no sightings of Asian hornets in the UK so far.","Millions of Asian hornets have colonised swathes of French countryside .

"It is not just humans who are concerned about the privacy implications of drones. An Arnhem TV station has lost one of its expensive drones after a chimpanzee managed to knock it out of the sky. The craft was supposed to be capturing footage of the Royal Burgers Zoo chimp enclosure for a TV show. Watch the video here . Look out! An Arnhem TV station has lost one of its expensive drones after a chimpanzee managed to knock it out of the sky. Following the attack, the drone crashes to the ground - only for the chimp to pounce on it . 'On the morning of Friday, April 10, 2015, the chimpanzees of Royal Burgers' Zoo once again proved how intelligent they are,' a spokesman for the zoo said. The incident happened during filming for a reality show set in the zoo. Programme makers had hoped to use the drone to capture the enclosure from above. 'Today, for the second season of the national television program Burgers' Zoo Natuurlijk, film takes were planned with a drone, with which spectacular images of the animals and their habitats could be made from above.' The drone was able to fly around the zoo - before arriving at the chimp enclosure. 'Once the drone arrived at the chimpanzee quarters the intelligent primates immediately discovered the spying little plane and right away armed themselves with long sticks against this inquisitive electronic intruder,' the zaoo revealed. One of the chimpanzees was high up in a tree with a long branch. 'Apparently very calm and satisfied, half asleep in the morning sun, the primate let the drone make its curious images. 'Until..... the drone got just a bit too close. Once grounded, the chimp investigates its prey, taking a selfie in the process - before eventually wandering off. 'Like a flash the chimpanzee struck out with the long stick she had held hidden behind her body. With a direct hit the animal knocked the drone to the ground, where the group of primates quickly overpowered the 'prey'. 'With much enjoyment they very efficiently dismantled the play thing. 'During the entire moment of action the camera kept rolling, so despite the completely destroyed drone this still provided some very special images!' The zoo did not confirm if it was able to salvage the drone.","Drone was filming at Royal Burgers Zoo chimp enclosure for a TV show .

"A former commander of the Metropolitan Police's elite Flying Squad has said the Hatton Garden gem heist could be linked to the huge underground fire which ripped through London last week. The massive fire started  last Wednesday and took more than 24 hours to put out. John O'Connor, a highly experienced former police detective, has claimed the major power outage and the proximity of the multi-million burglary was far more than a coincidence. Scroll down for video . A gang of criminals broke into the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend . It came shortly after firefighters  battled a major fire in Holborn - just 500 metres from the raid site . Speaking on LBC, Mr O'Connor said: 'Yeah, I think that probably was deliberate. 'I've never heard of an outage of electricity like that causing a fire that lasted as long as that. That seems to me as too much of a coincidence.' He also said that in his opinion, to succeed with such a complicated and ambitious crime, the gang must have had some inside help. He added: 'You're gonna have to have a detailed layout of the whole of the business. So clearly they got that from somebody on the inside.' He later told Sky News: 'You've got a major strong room, there's no sign of a forced entry, they've apparently been able to abseil down the lift shaft to get access to the vault - I just find it astonishing that it was that easy. 'The fact that there is no sign of forced entry, what does that mean? That someone left the door open? That someone left the windows open? Former head of Scotland Yard's Flying Squad, John O'Connor, pictured, said the Holborn fire and the raid could be linked . 'It smacks all the time of inside aid, all of the way through it. This doesn't look to me like a genuine sort of smash and grab raid by determined criminals, this looks like they've had accomplices on the inside.You wouldn't go to attack a building like that unless you knew you could gain access.' The London Fire Brigade said they do not believe that the blaze was caused deliberately. Fire experts said their initial assessment showed that the fire was caused by an electrical fault in the Victorian tunnels running below ground, damaging an eight inch gas main which ruptured and fuelled the flames. Fresh details of the daring heist emerged yesterday as police forensic teams continued to sift through the rubble in the vault. It is believed an alarm was triggered when the professional gang broke into the building in the heart of London’s jewellery district. A security guard is understood to have made a cursory check of the property on Good Friday before leaving when he found nothing untoward. Police have refused to say whether officers were despatched to investigate around the same time. The gang used a heavy-duty drill weighing 77lb to bore through a reinforced 7ft concrete wall to reach the vault. When the raid was discovered on Tuesday, police discovered cheaper jewels left strewn amid a large heap of rubble in the vault. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad said: ‘I’d say it’s a sophisticated offence and clearly it would have taken some pre-planning. It’s organised. It’s people who have planned it and they know how they were going to go about it. ‘I would imagine that the pool of people [who could carry out the heist] is quite limited.’ The  fire started underground just several hundred yards from where the heist took place a few days later . The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . It has also emerged that celebrities and Premier League footballers could be among the victims of the thieves. A source told the Daily Mail: ‘At least two of the jewellers have gems in the vault which have been bought by footballers and celebrities. They are waiting nervously to find out if they are among the victims.’ Mr Johnson described how the gang gained access to one of the offices on the second floor of the building where they disabled the lift before climbing down. Once in the basement the thieves forced open the lift doors to get close to the vault. They used a £3,500 Hilti DD350 drill, which is commonly used on large construction sites, to drill through the reinforced concrete wall to reach the vault. Joel Vinsant, secretary of the Drilling and Sawing Association, said that even with high-tech equipment, it may have taken hours for the thieves to drill through the concrete. He said: ‘What they might have done is to bore several holes with a rig-based drill until they had made a space big enough to get through, rather than boring one hole and breaking through. It could have taken up to an hour per hole.’ Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad, speaks to journalists outside Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd today following last weekend's burglary in London . Police yesterday revealed the thieves used a Hilti DD 350 drill to get through the two-metre thick vault walls . During the raid the gang used an angle grinder and crowbars to force their way into 70 deposit boxes to steal the gems and cash inside. They then made their escape before employees arriving for work on Tuesday spotted the raid. Mr Johnson added: ‘The scene is chaotic. The vault is covered in dust and debris and the floor is strewn with discarded safety deposit boxes and numerous power tools, including an angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars. ‘There is no sign of forced entry to the outside of the building. We are in the process of identifying the owners of the safety deposit boxes and contacting them to take statements and find out what has been stolen.’ He said his team had only just reached the vault because of the amount of debris at the scene. Mr Johnson added: ‘It’s got to be a slow, painstaking and methodical forensic process to get in there.’ Experts fear the thieves may have already smuggled the jewels out of the country and are planning to cut up the larger gems to make it easier to sell them on the black market. One jeweller who rents a deposit box said police have identified the owners of 30 boxes which had been broken into. Furious jewellery dealers today accused the manager of the safe deposit of 'gross negligence'.

"Amazon has won approval from U.S. federal regulators to test the latest version of its delivery drone outdoors, less than a month after the e-commerce powerhouse blasted regulators for being slow to approve commercial drone testing. The Federal Aviation Administration had earlier given the green light to an Amazon prototype drone in March, but the company told U.S. lawmakers less than a week later that the prototype had already become obsolete while it waited more than six months for the agency's permission. The FAA granted Amazon's request to test its new delivery drones in a letter dated Wednesday, posted on the agency's website. Scroll down for video . The company must supply monthly data to the regulators, and conduct flights at 400 feet (120 metres) orbelow and in 'visual meteorological conditions,' Amazon is developing aerial vehicles as part of Amazon Prime Air. The aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds. About 86 percent of Amazon's deliveries are 5 pounds or less, the company said. 'We believe customers will love it, and we are committed to making Prime Air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so,' Amazon has said. Amazon must keep flights at an altitude of no more than 400 feet (120 meters) and no faster than 100 miles per hour (160 km per hour), according to the letter. Seattle-based Amazon.com has been pursuing its goal of sending packages to customers by air, using small, self-piloted aircraft, even as it faces public concern about safety and privacy. The company wants to use drones to deliver packages to its customers over distances of 10 miles (16 km) or more, which would require drones to travel autonomously while equipped with technology to avoid collisions with other aircraft. In February, the FAA proposed long-awaited rules to try to set U.S. guidelines for drones, addressing growing interest from both individual and corporations in using unmanned aerial vehicles. Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Previously the firm blasted federal regulators  for being slow to . approve commercial drone testing - and warned the United States is . falling behind other countries in the potentially lucrative area . of unmanned aviation technology. Less than a week after the Federal Aviation Administration . gave Amazon.com the green light to test a delivery drone . outdoors, the company told U.S. lawmakers that the prototype . drone had already become obsolete while the company waited more . than six months for the agency's permission. 'Nowhere outside of the United States have we been required . to wait more than one or two months to begin testing,' Misener . said in written testimony submitted to the Senate Subcommittee . on Aviation Operations, Safety and Security. Misener said Amazon had applied on Friday for permission to . test a more advanced drone system and now hopes for quicker . approval. The Amazon.com case illustrates the frustrations of many . companies and industry lobbyists, who say the U.S. regulatory . process is not keeping up with rapidly developing drone . technology that could generate new revenues and cost savings for . a range of industries. Misener, who was scheduled to join a witness panel at the . subcommittee hearing, said European and other international . authorities have more 'reasonable' approaches that recognize the . potential economic benefits of commercial drone operations. 'This low level of government attention and slow pace are . inadequate, especially compared to the regulatory efforts in . other countries,' Misener said. 'The (FAA) already has adequate statutory authority. 'What . the FAA needs is impetus, lest the United States fall further . behind,' he added. The FAA recently proposed rules that would lift the current . ban on most commercial drone flights, but several restrictions . attached would make package delivery and other business . applications unfeasible. Among other constraints, the proposed rules would limit . commercial drones to an altitude of 500 feet (150 metres), allow . flights only during daytime and require operators to keep the . aircraft in sight at all times. The agency does not expect to finalize the rules until late . 2016 or early 2017, according to government officials.","FAA gave Amazon green light to test latest version of its drone .

"Eerie footage has emerged showing a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO. The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the  cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace. The video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to YouTube, prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life. Spine-chilling: The creepy footage shows a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO . Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared. Once the cloud had rapidly dispersed, no trace of it was left in the sky. Speaking to local news website Today.kz, villager Oleg Menshikov said: 'It was like a black cloud. We saw it at around 4 pm on April 3. It dissipated like smoke, but it was completely odourless.' Within minutes of the video being shared online, YouTube users began to question whether the thick black hoop was an alien spacecraft, while others suggested it might just be cigarette smoke immediately in front of the camera but giving the perception it is in the sky. Others thought the cloud was likely to be a naturally occurring weather event known as a thermal microburst, which is caused by a falling mass of warm air. Mysterious: The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace . Dispersing rapidly: Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . Experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air. Speaking to Russia Today, Andrey Solodovnik - associate physics professor at the Northern Kazakhstan State University - dismissed suggestions the cloud was caused by aliens. He said that based on similar clouds seen in the skies in recent years, the giant black hoop was likely to have been little more than a smoke ring generated by combustion at nearby factories. Plenty of industrial machinery is known to create ring-shaped clouds of smoke, though these are usually lighter-coloured, considerably less dense and vanish in just one or two minutes. In the latest instance it is likely the cloud was far more visible and hung around in the sky for much longer than usual for the simple reason it was cloudless day with little to no wind.","Clip shows mysterious black cloud hanging over the village of Shortandy .

This rose to 16,983 in 2010, 18,468 in 2011 and 18,829 in 2012. In 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, 20,307 received As across the board. The figures suggest Britain’s most able students are increasingly getting top marks in all subjects. GCSE grades are used by universities to decide who to admit to courses, along with personal statements and references. However, as a greater proportion of pupils is classified as excellent, it is harder for top universities such as Oxford and Cambridge to identify truly exceptional youngsters. And while British results appear to be improving for some pupils, the country is slipping behind other nations when measured using international tests. Results published just over a year ago showed British teenagers dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths, science and reading for the first time. Tests on more than half a million pupils worldwide found those in Vietnam, Shanghai and Poland had a much better command of core subjects. Children in the Chinese city of Shanghai were three years ahead of their British counterparts by 15. Overall, the UK came 26th out of 65 countries and economic regions in the report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Christopher McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘Sadly, grade inflation has devalued GCSEs to such an extent that any pass below a B has become little more than a certificate of incompetence. Critics say increasing numbers of high-fliers mean not enough has been done to stop qualifications becoming too easy. GCSE grades are used by universities to decide who to admit to courses (file picture) ‘International comparisons of educational attainment, very serious concerns expressed by employers and the fact that many universities now have to put on remedial catch-up courses for new undergraduates, all point to a disastrous dumbing down of standards.’ The Coalition tried to halt grade inflation by making qualifications more rigorous, but many reforms are still being implemented. A Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘Importantly, while overall results are up, the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and peers is closing.’ Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that teenagers applying to university had their details wrongly passed to advertisers, the data protection watchdog ruled yesterday. The university admissions service UCAS broke the law by signing youngsters up to receive adverts about mobile phones, energy drinks and other products. The practice earned UCAS more than £12million in a year, but, the Information Commissioner’s Office found it broke marketing rules and told it to change its procedures.","More than 20,000 passed ten or more GCSEs with A or A* in last five years .

"Dustin Wayne South died in Louisville, Kentucky, on Wednesday after police were called to a field where South was seen wielding a gun . A 32-year-old man shot himself in the head during a firefight with police officers in Kentucky as horrified witnesses watched the chaotic scene unfold. Dustin Wayne South died Wednesday night at the Louisville scene, in a field behind Lassiter Middle School, a normally peaceful neighborhood in the southern part of the city. The shootout occurred after a neighbor saw South walking around the field while waving a gun in the air. Two bullets fired by police struck South, but neither was lethal, said Jo-Ann Farmer, chief deputy coroner. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Cherylyan Rayhel said she watched from a window as South waved a gun and fired into the air just behind her house about 8pm, which is when she reported the situation to the police. Officers yelled three times for him to drop the gun, but instead he raised it and pointed it at them, she said. Gunfire erupted. She did not see the man turn the gun on himself. 'I saw him fall; I screamed,' Rayhel said Thursday morning. 'I haven't slept all night.' The Louisville Metro Police Department identified the officers involved as Rondall Carpenter and Zachary Cooke. The officers have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation. This is the second fatal shoot involving Carpenter in less than a year. Last October, he and another officer, Skylar Graudick, were involved in a shooting that killed 38-year-old William Chad Mattingly, who had allegedly fired on the officers. Louisville Metro Police officers Rondall Carpenter (left) and Zachary Cooke (right) were involved in a shootout with South, but South eventually shot himself in the head . The shooting remains under review with the commonwealth's attorney. On Wednesday night, Rayhel said she saw South fighting with a woman in the street in front of her house, just around the corner from South's home. South, weeping, hugged a young boy who was with the couple and turned to leave, Rayhel said. The boy tried to chase him, but the woman held him back. Neighbors described South as friendly and sweet. Sherri Reynolds said she often saw him in the neighborhood, playing with a little boy. But she said he'd recently seemed troubled. Last week, he went out for a drive 'to clear his emotions,' he would later tell police. Before police arrived on scene, a neighbor said that she saw South fighting with a woman in the street in front of her house . He 'was unaware of his surroundings' and careened his truck off Northwestern Parkway in Shawnee, according to court records. He slid down a hill into the Shawnee Golf Course. He tried to drive through the golf course to find an exit, but got stuck in the mud, damaging a green as he tried to drive free. South was cited for criminal mischief and scheduled to appear in court for arraignment later this month. In May 2014, he was arrested on allegations of domestic assault. His wife told police he came home drunk, became aggressive and pushed her 14-year-old daughter out of his way. She got between them, she said, and he pushed her into a countertop. He pleaded guilty days later to the lesser charge of harassment with physical contact. He completed alcohol treatment and domestic violence programs, and the court set aside the conviction. Officers yelled at South to put down the gun when they arrived on scene, but instead he pointed it at them before turning it on himself . Rayhel, who just moved to the neighborhood, did not know South. After he walked away from the confrontation with the woman, he disappeared around her house, noticeably agitated, toward a field between her backyard and the middle school. Alone and frightened, she ran to her kitchen window that overlooks the field. She saw him wave a gun around and fire several times. It was close enough to rattle her windows, she said. She called 911 around 8pm and pleaded for help. Officers arrived minutes later, she said. Rayhel called her mother, still watching from her window as the officers closed in on South. They yelled for him to drop his gun. Shawn Jones, an eighth-grader, was with two friends behind the school when he heard the commotion and saw the man waving the handgun in the air. The man kept firing into the sky, he said. The officers yelled a second time for him to drop the gun, Rayhel said. She told her mother she was afraid they were going to kill him in her backyard. 'Baby, just look away,' she recalls her mother telling her. The officers shouted for the man to drop his gun a third time and Rayhel looked back up as gunshots rang out and South slumped to the ground. The coroner on Thursday formally ruled his death a suicide. The incident, in which shots were fired by both the police and South, occurred outside a middle school at about 8pm on Wednesday .","Police were called after a neighbor saw South walking through a field behind a Louisville middle school while pointing a gun in the air .

"This incredible footage shows the moment an 'apocalyptic' weather storm struck Belarus, turning day into night when fast-moving storm clouds blocked out the sun. Filmed from a high rise apartment, the video shows traffic moving along a busy street in the province of Salihorsk, south of the capital of Minsk on Monday afternoon. As dark clouds move over the city, the entire area is plunged into darkness - forcing motorists to turn on their lights as they navigate the darkened roads. Dark clouds start forming over the city of Soligorsk, Belarus, as the sandstorm sweeps over the city . Within a matter of minutes, the storm had blocked out the sun, creating chaos on the city streets . The sandstorm was so thick the city was plunged into darkness during the Monday afternoon storm . Towards the end of the video, the clouds thin out and the city once again slowly becomes illuminated. The storm was caused by a cold front moving in from the Ukrainian-Belorusian border, named a haboob - which is Arabic for an intense dust storm, RT reported. Not only did it cause chaos on city streets, but forced about 100,000 residents of the city of Soligorsk to stay indoors. Those that did venture outside travelled by torchlight. Heavy rain associated with the storm also caused electricity cuts and damage to buildings. Several people from the region who commented on the video described the storm as like a 'doomsday scenario' or the apocalypse. While sandstorms, or haboobs, are commonly associated with the Sahara region, they can occur in any arid area. The deserts of Australia are particularly prone to the storms, as are countries located along the Arabian Gulf and parts of Africa. Associated with thunderstorms and small tornadoes, sandstorms are characterised by strong winds which move huge amounts of sand in a dense wall across thousands of kilometres - at heights reaching 1,000m.","Incredible footage of an 'apocalyptic' sandstorm in Belarus has gone viral .

"My teenagers demand something a bit more exciting than sand and sea from family summer holidays nowadays, and given their obsession with all things Kardashian, we decided on California this year. In fact, we plumped for a classic American road trip - driving along the Pacific Coast Highway (aka Route 1) from San Francisco to Los Angeles. It took Molly, Dylan and I three weeks to do it, and we fitted so much in during that time it's difficult to even do it justice. Navigating Route 1 from San Fran's iconic Golden Gate Bridge to LA, Jane Horrocks enjoys her road trip . San Francisco is known as America's most European city, possibly because you'll need to pack a fleece even in late July. The mist that rolls in off the sea and shrouds the Golden Gate Bridge most days can sometimes linger, but we never stayed still long enough to get cold. Based in the funky Hotel Zetta - where the foyer-come games room and bar is plastered with colossal photos of John Lennon and past guests of Alcatraz - we spent three days hurtling around the city, often clinging for dear life to the famous cable cars that haul you up and down the City's hills. We ate clam chowder from a bread bowl at Fisherman's Wharf, we trawled the boutiques of Haight Ashbury in search of the summer of love, we bussed out to the Golden Gate, and we wondered at the aquarium in Golden Gate Park. Jane travelled the scenic route, taking in beaches . And, fleeces on, we took the boat trip to Alcatraz, which is not to be missed. The brilliant audio guide that leads you around the prison is narrated only by men who were once guards or prisoners on the rock, making for an eerie and compelling tour. After trying to distil the city into only 72 hours, we climbed into our SUV and headed for Route 1. It's only about 350 miles as the crow flies between San Francisco and LA, but this (mostly) coastal route is probably well over 500 miles long as it winds through some of California's most wonderful, ever-changing scenery. Much of the highway has a 55mph speed limit and has only one lane in each direction - it's time to take your foot off the gas, relax and take it all in. My children said it reminded them of Dorset as we headed south past Santa Cruz and then nipped briefly into Monterey to dine in a seafront restaurant on the edge of Cannery Row, the waterfront district made famous in John Steinbeck's novel of the same name. At Dylan's insistence, we took a detour on to 17 Mile Drive, the scenic road around the Monterey Peninsula that leads to the world-famous Pebble Beach golf club. He was rather disappointed by the condition of the course there, but thrilled with the state of Quail Lodge and Golf Club, our first port of call just outside the pretty little town of Carmel. Even the non-golfers among us loved our luxurious bungalow at the edge of the course; secluded and tranquil, plush and green with a view of distant mountains. When the sound of silence got too much for us, just across the street at Valley Hills there was the excellent and lively Baja Cantina Mexican restaurant, and a wonderful deli too. Leaving Carmel, you find yourself at the edge of the spectacular area known as Big Sur: wild and often mountainous terrain battling it out with the equally wild Pacific. Dining in Cannery Row, the waterfront district made famous in John Steinbeck's novel of the same name . The road coils up and down cliffs and crosses cavernous gorges for almost 100 miles - incredibly dramatic but sometimes not for the faint-hearted. We stopped off at the Garrapata National Park, in a baking-hot and silent valley, where the crash of the waves was replaced by the hum of insects and the call of the buzzards wheeling overhead. This was a completely different wildness, underlined when Dylan narrowly avoided stepping on a basking rattlesnake. At the end of Big Sur you can encounter yet another type of wildness altogether in the form of the legendary Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo. Every bedroom is themed here - from Rock Bottom (it's a cave) to Old Mexico and the comparatively muted silver walls and flock wallpaper of our own Crystal Room. To call the Madonna Inn 'kitsch' is to do it a huge disservice, because it takes everything to a whole new level of eye-popping taste. Take the Gold Rush Steakhouse, which puts the shocking into pink. The whole place is furnished and upholstered in this garish shade, softened only by the presence of enormous gold chandeliers. You have to see it to believe it, but the food and service were fantastic. Big Sur: Where the wild and often mountainous terrain battles it out with the equally wild Pacific Ocean . We took a rare detour off Route 1 to the Danish settlement of Solvang, a sort of cutesy yet sinister re-creation of Denmark in the California sun, full of pastry shops and Chinese tourists. A little unnerved by this, we headed back to the safety of the highway and soon found ourselves in Santa Barbara. It's the classic California of posters and T-shirts, with infinitely long palm-lined streets with mountains at one end and the ocean at the other. We stayed at the beach side end of one such thoroughfare in the aptly named Harbor View Inn, and found great seafood at the end of the pier at Stearns Wharf opposite the hotel and at the fantastic Fishhouse just a couple of blocks along Cabrillo Boulevard. Over the rail tracks behind the inn is State Street, where you can find everything from Macy's and American Apparel to tattooists and cavernous bars advertising Punk Rock Bingo. The farmers' market closes the street on a Tuesday afternoon, offering up a Californian cornucopia of fruit, veg and other tasty treats. To the east of State Street is The Funk Zone, an old industrial area that is regenerating itself into a haven of restaurants, art galleries and wine-tasting rooms. Back on the road near San Simeon, you will see exotic animals on either side of the highway. Floundering on the beach are gigantic elephant seals - enormous specimens of blubbery ugliness hooting and honking and generally having a riot at the edge of the sea. Spectacular: An enormous neo-Classical marble swimming pool dominates Hearst's magnificent mansion . On the other side are zebras - direct descendants of the herd that press tycoon William Randolph Hearst installed at the magnificent Hearst Castle, which appears right ahead of you. You can take a tour of the castle and its grounds. After a 15-minute coach drive up the snaking road to the top of the hill, you discover a spectacular mansion furnished with antiques and tapestries from all over Europe, and boasting Roman baths, an enormous neo-Classical marble swimming pool and its own private cinema. In the 1930s, Hearst Castle was party central for Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Greta Garbo et al. Having soaked up a bit of the Golden Age of Hollywood, we headed off on Route 1 again to see the City of Angels of today. There we stayed at the slick and sleek Viceroy Santa Monica Hotel, choosing the beach-life of Santa Monica and Venice over the urban sprawl of Hollywood or Beverly Hills where the car is king. The body-builders and gymnasts of Muscle Beach and the rollerblading buskers of Venice are highly entertaining, and you can walk everywhere. Hollywood is really an idea rather than a place anyway. It always seems as if it might be just around the next corner but it never is, and the Hollywood sign always stays aloof in the distance. What a beach: Huntington Beach is a pure three-and-a-half miles of uncrowded white sand loved by surfers . We went on an excellent guided tour taking in the Chinese Theatre, Walk of Fame, Rodeo Drive, Sunset Strip and other spots of note. A Sunday trip to Universal Studios was great fun, too, for the rides and a look at a real working film set on its day off. Mind you, the scariest ride of the day was getting on the freeway by accident on the way into LA. Unless you're a professional stunt driver in a hurry, the freeway is probably best avoided in favour of a trundle along the city's more sedate boulevards. We drove the last 40 miles south through the LA suburbs to our final stop at the Huntington Beach Hyatt Regency. And what a beach it is - three-and-a-half miles of uncrowded white sand known as Surf City. It was thrilling to watch the guys surfing along on the waves. Later we watched the sun go down over the pier from the comfort of the superb Duke's Restaurant, before ambling back along a beach glowing with fire-pits and shrouded in barbecue smoke - preparing ourselves for the horrors of donning fleeces again for the journey home.

"She hadn't spoken for weeks after her health deteriorated rapidly due to terminal brain cancer. But one day recently, Sara Martin, from Lititz, Pennsylvania, uttered a single word: 'Florida'. Now, the mother-of-three's devoted family is taking her there for what will likely be her final holiday. They leave for Sarasota, south-west Florida, today.

Since her diagnosis, she has taken part in charity runs, gone on holidays and made countless invaluable memories with her family. All the while, she has been well supported by her loved ones. However, Mrs Martin's health declined this winter after she underwent a second round of radiation treatment, prompting her relatives to arrange for her to receive hospice care at her home. Soon, she no longer talked. But during a recent visit, her sister, Amy Martin came up with a new way to try to get her sibling to smile, nod, or say something - offer her the opportunity to go to Florida. 'If you say 'Florida,' I'll get dad to take us,' Amy Martin promised her sister. But she added: 'But you've got to tell me. I've got to know if you really want to go.' Although Mrs Martin, a former physical therapy assistant at Lancaster General Hospital, said nothing for the rest of the day, the next morning she shocked her relatives while she was being dressed.

"A teenage girl has suffered serious injuries after falling 200ft from a cliff at a campsite - in front of her horrified father. The 15-year-old girl, named locally as Leah Price from the Nottingham area, was airlifted to hospital last night from the Blue Dolphin camping site near Filey, North Yorkshire. It is believed she lost her footing on the cliffs. A retired woman who owns a caravan near the cliff has said she heard crying and shouting before she rushed outside. Tragedy: The cliffs at Filey where a 15-year-old girl, named locally as Leah Price,  fell. She was airlifted to hospital  with serious injuries. Police say it is believed she may have been sat on the cliff edge with a friend . She said: 'A man, who I think was her dad, was in such a hurry to get to the cliff that he flew passed our van in a great big transit van and nearly tore the corner off our van. 'I could hear crying and shouting, so I went outside to see what was happening. I could hear crying in a van, it was such a drama. 'It happened right at the back of our caravan. We back onto the field and then there is the cliff edge. We first thought that somebody had thrown themselves over. 'Where she went over it was a bit of a slope whereas further up it is more of a sheer drop.' The holidaymaker said coastguards arrived within ten minutes and there was a scene of over a dozen emergency service people on the field. She said: 'It was still daylight and we were thinking ""please find her before the light goes"". The coastguard was shining their headlights over the cliff and a helicopter came and swept around and went to the sea. 'Others were hammering things into the ground to attach ropes to. A lot of dog walkers walk on the path called Cleveland Way where she had been walking. 'It is a couple of feet from the path to the cliff. I don't know why she was walking so close to the edge. I hope that this will mean they put fences up, especially where the vans are.' Camping site: The cliffs where the girl fell are near the Blue Dolphin Holiday Park in North Yorkshire. Her father was said to have witnessed the incident and alerted the emergency services . The coastguard has revealed that the call to emergency services was made by the girl's father who witnessed his teenage daughter 'accidentally falling over a cliff edge'. The incident happened before 8pm and North Yorkshire Police and the coastguard were dispatched to the scene within ten minutes. A lifeboat crew was also called out to the scene in Filey but was not needed as the girl landed on land and not in the sea. It is not clear how the girl, who was taken to hospital in Hull, came to fall from the cliff but a spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said it was believed she may have been sitting at the cliff edge with a friend. The force confirmed this morning that the girl was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary with head injuries and police say she is in a critical but stable condition. The Blue Dolphin site is run by Haven, described on its website as 'Britain's largest provider of domestic holidays with family holiday parks around the UK'. A spokesman for the holiday park said: 'Leah's father alerted our security team immediately after his daughter's fall from the cliff path. 'The coastguard and police, assisted by a Sea King helicopter, were quickly on the scene. 'We are continuing to offer assistance to Leah's family and friends through this difficult and painful time.' Another holidaymaker who owns a van at the site said: 'I think they were on holiday here. Nobody knows them so I don't think they own a van here. 'It makes my stomach to turn over to think that somebody's child went over the cliff.' A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said this afternoon: 'We can now advise that the girl who fell from the cliff at Filey on the night of April 9 is from the Nottingham area. 'She remains in a critical but stable condition in Hull Royal Infirmary.' A spokesman for The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: 'The UK Coastguard were contacted on Thursday evening by a father who witnessed his teenage daughter accidentally falling over a cliff edge. 'Coastguard Rescue Teams training nearby were able to get on scene within ten minutes. 'Specially trained cliff technicians were able to descend to the girl and administer first aid until the Coastguard rescue helicopter arrived on scene.'","Teenager was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary with serious head injuries .

"The wife of a Navy veteran who was battered to death with a claw hammer by his crazed pensioner neighbour has spoken of how stumbling upon the bloody scene will 'stay with me for ever'. Enid Hatch, 70, told of the horror as she ran out to the communal hallway of their sheltered housing complex near Cardiff to help what she thought was an injured man, only to discover blood splattered walls where her husband had been brutally beaten yards away. The man was in fact Alan Rogers, 73, who had smashed the skull of 76-year-old Fred Hatch. Yesterday Rogers was sentenced to a hospital order under the Mental Health Act and told he may never be released. Fred Hatch, 76, had bought his wife Enid 50 yellow roses - her favourite flowers - to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary, telling her 'each one is for a year of happiness'. He was brutally killed two months later . Grandfather Fred Hatch's injuries were so severe that the surgeon told his wife he had never seen anything so horrific in 20 years of neurosurgery. It is not the first time Mrs Hatch, 70, has lost a loved one in violent circumstances. Her sister Betty Elston was murdered on a beach in Sully in 1971 by a stranger who had absconded from a mental health institution. On their golden wedding, Mr Hatch had bought his wife 50 yellow roses - her favourite flowers - telling her 'each one is for a year of happiness'. The pair married six months after meeting in the Royal Navy and were together for five decades. But two months after their anniversary, Mrs Hatch said her life was 'destroyed' when her husband was killed in the horrific attack. Mrs Hatch said the memory of the bloody scene that greeted her as she went to look for her beloved husband at the sheltered accommodation where they lived in Dinas Powys has remained stuck in her head and said 'it will stay with me forever'. She said she had hoped they would go on as 'golden oldies' together. She spoke of the kind, caring and loving man she had known for over half a century, describing him as 'the love of my life'. Alan Rogers, 73, was sentenced  under the Mental Health Act and told he may never be released . Mrs Hatch said: 'Fred didn't deserve to die this way - we had many happy years ahead of us. 'He was the love of my life and my life is destroyed - this man has taken everything.' Heartbroken Mrs Hatch and her four children, who had rushed to their dying father's bedside for one last goodbye, were at Cardiff Crown Court  to hear Rogers plead guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibilty. Michael Jones, prosecuting, said Rogers had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time and was 'profoundly mentally ill'. He told the court: 'Mr and Mrs Hatch had lived at the flats since 2012 but on October 8 last year South Wales Police received a telephone call from the defendant telling them 'I've just killed one of my neighbours and hit his head with a hammer'. 'He was in the communal hallway, where Mrs Hatch, concerned she hadn't seen her husband for some time, came out to see Alan Rogers lying on the floor, the phone in his hand. 'It was a man she had seen before and who she described as ""articulate but unkempt"" and her initial thought was that he was injured. 'She ran down asking could she help and the defendant told her ""No but you may be able to help him"" and that was when she saw her husband with his catastrophic injuries and blood all over the floor and walls.' Rogers told police he had hit him at least six times and had intended to kill him. Mr Jones said Rogers told a police officer he didn't need to be handcuffed because he was no threat to the police. '""I'm only a threat to evil people"" he said and on his way to the police station added ""I've been waiting a long time to kill that man"".' In interview, Rogers said he had been pottering around in his flat that morning before seeing Mr Hatch going past.

Enid Hatch's sister Betty Elston (pictured holding a child) was murdered in 1971 by a stranger who had absconded from a mental health institution . He added: 'They are using modern technology, the equivalent of witchcraft and he was in collusion with the Main Man.' Sentencing Rogers to a hospital order under the Mental Health Act, Mr Justice Warby said he may never be released. 'On the evidence I have read and heard, it seems there is little likelihood that the doctors would ever consider you safe enough to release into the community.' The judge told Rogers: 'On that day he had got up, made his wife a cup of tea and set off to spread some lawn seed, saying it was a good day to do it. 'He didn't know you were lying in wait to kill him. 'As he went to leave the building you launched a ferocious and unprovoked attack. 'He greeted you with the words 'good morning' and you struck him on the head. 'As he stumbled you hit him again, he collapsed and you hit at least four times until you were sure he was brain dead. 'Enid Hatch had to witness with her own eyes the bloody scene you had created and two neighbours had to witness the aftermath. 'The injuries were so severe that the surgeon told his wife he had never seen such horrific injuries in 20 years of neurosurgery. 'He was a devoted loving and much-loved husband, father and grandfather and this is the family on which you have visited this truly shocking and terrible crime.

"A cat who went missing after escaping a damaged crate after 14-hour flight from Abu Dhabi to New York about last week has been found. Felix was discovered at JFK airport after being on the loose for more than two weeks. The cat's owners, Jennifer Stewart, 31, and her 34-year-old husband, Joseph Naaman, were left devastated after their beloved pet when missing from his damaged crate. Jennifer Stewart and husband, Joseph Naaman, pictured with their cat, Felix, who disappeared April 1 . Facebook updates: Ms Stewart updated her friends after hearing the news that Felix the cat had been found . The couple had launched a desperate search for their pet after he disappeared following a 14-hour flight from Abu Dhabi to New York. Felix the cat was missing for more than two weeks after he escaped from his crate, which was damaged in transit. The two-year-old grey tabby's crate was travelling in an airline-approved carrier but it was damaged so badly – apparently while being transferred from the plane  – that Felix was able to get out and run away. Found! Felix the cat was discovered at JFK airport after being on the loose for more than two weeks . The releaved couple were alerted that a cat had been been found at the New York airport . The couple updated their Facebook profiles to announce the good news. They wrote: 'FELIX HAS BEEN FOUND!!! We got word earlier this evening that a cat had been humanely trapped in the area the scent dogs in last week's search were most interested in... And the cat is FELIX!!!!' Jennifer later added: 'Joe picked him up at JFK and they are on their way home to Princeton right now. So HAPPY!!!! Thanks to everyone for your help and positive energy these last two weeks! We're incredibly grateful for such love & support! xo' Jennifer and Joseph never gave up hope and planned to return to the airport to search for Felix . The couple was told that the plastic crate broke open after one of the ropes became tangled on something . At the time of the disappearance, Jennifer had told MailOnline Travel that she wasn't satisfied with the way Felix's crate was secured and transported on the Etihad Airways flight. She said his crate was tied down to a large metal pallet and cracked open, apparently when one of the straps got caught on something as it was being moved to a cargo bay after the April 1 flight. She said: 'To find out how he was transported, I was horrified, I was sick. They basically strapped him in like he was an old box. 'If I had known he was going to travel like that we would have looked for other alternatives. 'He is a part of our family. He's like a dog. He plays fetch and hide and seek, and he's the coolest little cat.' Jennifer wasn't sure which company was responsible for transferring Felix from the plane, but a cargo manager called her and her husband into an office after they landed to deliver the bad news. 'We were in shock that this happened. At first I thought he was going to tell me that [Felix] died. 'He told me his cage was crushed.' Felix's plastic pet carrier was tied down to a metal pallet while he was transported on the plane . Felix the cat disappeared after his crate was damaged after a flight from Abu Dhabi to New York . While in Abu Dhabi she had spent weeks researching the best way to transport Felix and she initially booked a ticket with a different airline, but there was a problem with the reservation and she was forced to switch to their flight and Felix's to Etihad Airways. Jennifer, a yoga instructor, and Joseph, a strategy consultant, couple spent $1,200 (£800) to bring Felix  to the US with them after living in the United Arab Emirates for three years. They adopted him seven months ago after they found him wandering on the street in their Abu Dhabi neighbourhood, and they never gave any thought to leaving him behind. The couple adopted the two-year-old cat seven months ago after he was abandoned in their neighbourhood . Jennifer and Joseph have enlisted the help of a non-profit organisation to locate the cat at JFK Airport . The couple never gave up hope that Felix would be found, and sought help from a non-profit organisation, Where Is Jack?, which provided a dog that is trained to track down animals based on their scent. They had previously searched the airport, but were initially unable to access secure areas. An Etihad Airways spokesperson told MailOnline Travel at the time of the disappearance that it was investigating Felix’s disappearance and continuing to search for the cat. The spokesperson said: ‘We are working with the ground handlers and other third-party specialists, paid for by Etihad Airways, to locate the cat. Etihad Airways said it is working with ground handlers and 'third-party specialists' to find the cat . ‘We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search. ‘We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets travelling with Etihad Airways is a top priority.’ Etihad cargo carries more than 200 animals each year and it is ‘extremely rare’ for one to escape, the spokesperson added.","Felix the cat was found two weeks after going missing in transit .

"She has been selling herself as a sex pot to push copies of her new album Rebel Heart. But not everyone thinks she's the cat's meow. After belting out Human Nature to Drake at Coachella on Sunday night, Madonna pulled the 28-year-old singer back to plant a kiss on his lips, making out with him for at least three seconds. What the 56-year-old mother-of-four didn't see was that when she was finished, the musician looked horrified, even wiping his mouth. This happened: Madonna French Kissed Drake onstage at Coachella on Sunday night . In pain: Though Madonna didn't see his expression, he clearly was in pain over the experience . Later, sources were quick to tell TMZ that Drake liked the kiss, but that it was merely her lipstick that turned him off, therefore the foul look on his face. It was added by insiders that the smack on the mouth was not planned, but rather a last-minute decision by Madge. The Eighties pop star looked confident as she went in for the bold kiss. Wearing black a tank top that said Big As Madonna, hot pants with stockings that showed off her toned legs, and a pair of kinky boot heels, she sauntered over to Drake, who was sitting in a chair. The blonde beauty pulled back his head after caressing his cheek in a shock move. It was not a little peck either: The 56-year-old singer spent at least three seconds making out with the 28-year-old hit maker . It WAS shocking: The mother-of-four really went for it and didn't let the Pinkprint singer go . He didn't like it: After the makeout session, Drake seemed horrified, to say the least . She kept singing: As the Canadian wiped his mouth in disgust, the Rebel Heart singer ignored him . She won't be happy: Madonna has always prided herself on being a sex bomb so she won't want to know that the young star was repulsed by her . The Cherish singer pulled her hair back before planting her lips on his with her mouth full open for all to see. Drake rubbed her head, seemingly enjoying the makeout session at first, before he seemed to change his mind. The Ray Of Light crooner pushed away his hand as she made it clear who was in charge of the steamy encounter.

"The distinctive patterns on butterfly wings really do help protect the insects by mimicking the eyes of predators. While scientists have long suspected the role played by eye-spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry, it has never been clearly tested. Recently researchers suggested that the eye spots may simply scare away predators by confusing them or overloading their senses. Owl butterflies (left) have eye spots that mimic those of pigmy owls (right) to scare off predators like great tits. While scientists have long suspected the role played by eye-spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry, it has never been clearly tested . But a new piece of research by biologists at Jyväskylä University in Finland claims to have settled the debate. They say that eye-spots on the wings of butterflies do in fact mimic the eyes of larger and more threatening species, like owls. Having bright colours and distinguishing features is a common way for insects to scare away predators like birds. Often they help to lure them away from vital body parts or confuse them. However, this only works on predators that hunt using sight while bats tend to be immune to such devices. Now scientists have found that a moth has an unusual evolutionary adaptation that allows it to confuse the ultrasound used by bats. The luna moth has two tails that extend for more than an inch beyond its body. Scientists in the US showed that these appendages produce a confusing acoustic signature in the bats echolocation. It makes the bats target the end of the tails rather than the moth itself. This helps to keep other birds that might normally eat the insects away. The team were finally able to test the theory by showing great tits pictures of owl butterflies that had been digitally altered, and watching their reaction. Images where the eye spots had been removed from the butterfly wings did not stop the birds from snatching a mealworm snack below the picture. However, when pictures that had not been digitally altered flashed on the screen, the birds were more weary. And the researchers found the butterfly eye spots may even be more terrifying to the great tits than the real animal they are mimicking. When shown pictures of a pygmy owl with its eyes open the tits reacted strongly and kept away, but their reaction was not as strong as with the butterfly markings. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Dr Johanna Mappes and her colleagues said: 'In this study, the presumed model - owl eyes - and the mimic eyespots appeared to elicit similar reactions both in terms of response type - interest versus aversion - and its intensity - startle versus flee - adding support to the eye-mimicry hypothesis. The researchers flashed up digitally manipulated images of an owls face and the owl butterfly to see how great tits reacted. In some images they removed the owls eyes (far left) or removed the eye spots (far right) Eye spots are a common feature on butterfly wings, like the Bycyclus anyana butterfly above, but scientists have been divided over whether they were intended to mimic other predators or simply confuse predators . 'Predator-prey interactions in nature often involve dynamic encounters between the partners, and eye spots are more likely to appear suddenly in front of the predator. 'Their intimidating effect has been proved to increase when they are revealed abruptly. 'We therefore conclude that it is unlikely that the adaptive value of eye spots is due to sensory or information overload caused by the conspicuousness of colour pattern.' The researchers conducted their experiments by placing wild captured great tits into a cage where the floor had been fitted with a computer monitor. The birds were offered a dead mealworm and as they approached an image was flashed up on the computer screen. Images of owl eyes caused the birds to be startled, flee and in some cases give off alarm calls. but images of owls without eyes did not produce the same reaction. Atlas moths (above) have colourful patterns on their wings that are thought to mimic the head of a cobra . A cobra poses a far greater threat to a predator than an Atlas moth and so by mimicking the reptile with the patterns on its wings the moth is able to scare off potential hunters that might make it a tasty snack . However when the birds were shown images of the owl butterfly, they were also scared away. If the irises of the eye spots were removed, or the eye spots removed altogether, then they were scared away far less often. Many species of butterfly have eye-spots as part of the pattern on their wings. The Atlas butterfly, for example, has a pattern that looks like the head of a cobra. Some entomologists have also claimed that the Eyed hawk moth look like the head of a fox when viewed from the front. In one extreme example of mimicry, the caterpillar of the Eastern tiger swallowtail looks like a snake and spits a foul smelling chemical to keep away predators. Last year scientists at Oregon State University looked at the butterfly Bycyclus anyana and showed that it varies the intensity of its eye spots depending on the season. They claimed bright colours in the rainy season allowed the butterfly to confuse the dominant predators - preying mantids - while duller colours in the dry season helped them hide from birds. Some entomologists claim the eyed hawk moth looks like the face of a fox or dog from the front . The wing patterns of the eyed hawk moth is said to resemble the dark nose and the light coloured eyes of a fox .","Biologists at Jyväskylä University in Finland studied how wild great tits reacted to images of the wings of butterflies and the faces of owls .
The tits were startled and tried to flee at the sight of owl faces with open eyes, and butterflies that had eye spots on them that mimiced owl eyes .
They say their study is evidence that butterfly eye spots mimic predators .
Scientists have long debated whether butterfly eye spots were an example of Batesian mimicry or if the patterns simply served to confuse predators ."
"Bruce Jenner will break his silence in a two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer later this month. The former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview with Sawyer for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24, ABC News announced on Monday. The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman, and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February. And while the Kardashian women are known for enjoying center stage, they will not be stealing Bruce's spotlight because they will be in Armenia when the interview airs, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Jenner, pictured on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' will speak out in a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer later this month, ABC News announced on Monday . Return: Diane Sawyer, who recently mourned the loss of her husband, will return to ABC for the interview . Rumors started swirling around Jenner's gender identity last year, when he emerged from a Beverly Hills clinic with his Adam's apple shaved down. His behavior over the past year also fueled speculation as he began embracing an increasingly female appearance, including growing out his hair, shaving his legs and painting his nails, while reportedly undergoing hormone therapy. He also split from with his wife of more than two decades, Kris Jenner, with whom he has two daughters, Kyle and Kendall. She filed for divorce in September 2014, citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Reports also emerged over the past week that he has received a breast enhancement. 'Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He went with a smaller implant because he didn't want to look ridiculous.' On Sunday, he was seen walking to his car in Malibu but hid his body beneath a bulky sweatshirt. Out and about: Jenner was pictured walking back to his car in Malibu on the weekend and hiding beneath a large sweatshirt on Sunday, days after reports that he had undergone a breast enhancement . Hiding: He also apparently had painted his nails red when he was seen walking on Sunday . According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'. Jenner is also rumored to be filming a spin-off docu-series about the transition on E!, although his reps have refused to confirm the claims. While Jenner himself has remained silent about his reported transition, some of his relatives, including step-daughter Kim Kardashian, have spoken about about his 'journey'. 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about,' Kim recently told Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way. I think everyone goes through things in life and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu. Deadly: In February, Jenner's vehicle, which was pulling a trailer and an ATV (seen right) rear-ended a woman's car (left) and pushed it into the lane of an oncoming Hummer. She died at the scene . By his side: Bruce, pictured with his ex-wife Kris Jenner and four of his step-children (from left) Rob, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, has received support from his family. Kris filed for divorce from him last year . His Cadillac Escalade, which was pulling a trailer and off-road vehicle, plowed into the back of a Lexus and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer on February 7. The Lexus was carrying 69-year-old Kim Howe, who died from chest trauma at the scene. Police sources say Jenner is unlikely to be prosecuted because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. His tell-all interview will also be one of Sawyer's first forays back to TV news following the death of her husband, acclaimed director Mike Nichols, following a heart attack last November. Last September, she left the anchor chair of ABC World News and announced that she planned to focus on specials. In February, she presented 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', in which she went to prisons across the country to speak with female inmates.","Tell-all interview with the reality TV star, 69, will air on Friday April 24 .

"Claudia Martin, 33, has been convicted of suffocating her newborn baby daughter . A mother-of-five has been convicted of killing her newborn baby girl by filling her mouth with toilet paper and hiding her body in a suitcase. Claudia Martins gave birth alone at her sister's flat having kept her pregnancy secret from her family and friends. Paramedics were called after the 33-year-old, a Portuguese national, was found sitting in the bath with 'a lot of blood' and she was taken to hospital. Earlier she had killed the infant by stuffing toilet paper down its throat. She then wrapped the baby girl in towels and a plastic bag and hid the body in a suitcase - where it lay undiscovered for three days. Martins was acquitted by a jury of a single charge of murder but convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. During her trial at Bristol Crown Court the jury was told she gave birth alone at her sister's flat in Knowle, Bristol on September 12 last year. Adam Vaitilingam QC, prosecuting, said: 'She told no-one of her pregnancy and gave birth in as secretive a way as she could, for someone living in a crowded flat, and kept the fact of that birth secret from all those around her and closest to her, including her sister. 'She placed the body of the baby in a suitcase, hidden from anyone. 'No doubt, we suggest she intended to dispose of it but was prevented from doing so by the arrival of the paramedics, who took her off to hospital.' Two days later, her sister Vilma raised the alarm after noticing a smell coming from a suitcase in the defendant's bedroom. Police were called to the flat and discovered the body of a newborn baby inside Martins' small, black suitcase, on September 15. Martins, described as having an extremely low IQ, was arrested and admitted she had given birth but said the baby was stillborn. A post-mortem examination found a wad of toilet paper inside the baby's mouth, which experts claim was 'deliberately inserted'. The jury heard Martins is originally from Mozambique in Africa but moved to Portugal before settling in Bristol in 2011, living in a two-bedroom flat with her sister Vilma Marshall, Ms Marshall's partner, and five children. Giving evidence, Martins told the court: 'I did not kill my daughter. I did not put tissue paper in her throat. I didn't kill her. No, I did not kill my daughter.' Mr Justice Teare remanded Martins, of Marshall Walk, Knowle, Bristol into custody to await the preparation of reports. She will be sentenced at a later date. Detective Inspector Neil Meade, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'The death of a baby is always a tragedy but the unique circumstances make this a particularly emotive case for everyone involved. 'We carried out a sensitive and comprehensive investigation into the circumstances of the baby girl's death and obtained statements from medical experts specialising in this field. 'We've also worked closely with the Crown Prosecution Service from the outset. The jury has listened to the evidence and convicted Claudia Martins of manslaughter. 'Our thoughts are very much with the victim's wider family as they are struggling to comprehend how and why this tragedy happened.' Martins was acquitted by a jury of a single charge of murder but convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility at Bristol Crown Court, pictured .","Claudia Martins convicted of the manslaughter of her newborn baby girl .

Rogan was rushing his wife to hospital for the birth of the eighth child, with all seven other children in the vehicle, when a deer hit by another car flew through their windshield . Rogan was pronounced dead at St. Joseph’s Hospital in the town of Marshfield. Niki, who managed to steer the van into a shallow ditch after the impact, gave birth a few hours later to a son, Blaise. The accident occurred when the deer was hit by another vehicle and thrown into the windshield of the van Rogan was driving. Friends set up a GoFundMe account to help +the family out with the goal of covering funeral expenses. Within three days almost $190,000 has been raised. Rogan, 42, was a devout churchgoer and former marine, and ran an organic seed business . Niki home-schools the children and the money will allow her to continue to do so, while also replacing the van and covering the family’s medical expenses. Rogan, originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, married Niki in 1998. He was a member of St. Mary’s Oratory in Wausau, as well as the church choir and The Holy Name Society. He would go to services about three times a week. The family attended Mass on Sunday as they always do, and a baptism for Blaise was held afterwards. ‘It was a very teary morning,’ Reverend Aaron Huberfeld of St. Mary's Oratory told the Wausau Daily Herald. Niki had called Huberfield on the morning of the crash and he had rushed to the hospital to be with them. He said that the family is doing ‘amazingly well’, given the circumstances. For eight years Rogan owned and operated Arnie’s Farm Care, an organic seed and fertilizer business, which he took over from his father-in-law after he passed away.

"It's a charged scene. A woman wearing just a bra and a flared mini skirt sashays across a room, where a smartly dressed man awaits. It could be an outtake from a film noir movie of yesteryear or even a discarded scene from the hit recent film Fifty Shades of Grey. In fact, it's an advert from cosmetics giant Revlon for their latest lipstick. The stylish ad is filmed entirely in black and white, with just a slick of pink visible on the woman's lips. Scroll down for video . Revlon's latest lipstick advert looks suspiciously familiar... It's shot in black and white, the only colour being the pop of pink on the woman's lips . The video, titled Love Is On, was created by agency George Patts Y&R for the cosmetics company as part of a major rebrand. Revlon UK's new global tag line, Love Is On, is the label's first major relaunch in more than a decade. The move is said to signal it's intention to inspire love and connect with people around the world on an emotional level. A spokesperson says: 'The idea for Love Is On grew from our quest to find a universally inspiring emotion. Love is by far and away the most powerful and most positive... Truly, L-O-V-E is at the heart of the word REVLON. And O-N (at the end of REVLON) is about being open or ""on"".' The stylish video features an appropriately jazz-heavy soundtrack. We see the woman - taking on the role of seductress - pushing the man back onto the couch as he laughs, entranced; the couple then dance around. The woman indulges in an impromptu selfie session with an old Polaroid camera and seductively emerges with the prints. She flicks them to the man, who's only too delighted to receive them. It's a collection of photos of her lips, painted in various colours of lippie. Later the woman climbs onto the coffee table in platform heels and almost straddles the man, slowly removing his lie and using it to loosely blindfold him. She takes some Polaroids of herself and seductively emerges from behind a room divider, presenting them . She then whispers something incomprehensible in his ear through lipsticked lips, and leaves. The man removes the blindfold and laughs to find she's drawn a heart in the mirror and left a lipstick kiss within it.

"They gave us sanitation, wine, aqueducts and roads, but it seems the Romans also gave us one more addition to the list - tuberculosis. Researchers have isolated bacterial DNA of several strains of the disease from the bodies of mummies found in the crypt of a church in the city of Vác in Hungary. They found 14 different strains of TB bacteria that had infected eight of the bodies in the tomb and traced them all back to a single source. Mummified remains of 28-year-old Terézia Hausmann (above) found in the 18th century crypt of the Dominican church in Vác, Hungary, were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researchers . They say the strains of TB they found all evolved from a single germ that had began infecting people during the late Roman period. Professor Mark Pallen, a geneticist at Warwick University who led the work, said: 'By showing that historical strains can be accurately mapped to contemporary lineages, we have confirmed the genotypic continuity of an infection that has ravaged the heart of Europe since prehistoric times.' Historians have long taught that Native American populations were almost wiped out by diseases such as tuberculosis, brought to the New World by European explorers. But a new theory suggests the arrival of seals and sea lions could in fact be to blame. Scientists believe the marine animals brought the disease to South America where it spread - long before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. While estimates vary, it is thought that 95 per cent of the 20 million people living in the Americas before the Europeans arrived were killed by ‘new’ diseases carried by explorers. Anthropological geneticists Anne Stone of Arizona State University and Johannes Krause of the University of Tubingen in Germany have studied pre-Columbian Mycobacterial tuberculosis genomes. The team examined TB DNA from 1,000-year-old skeletons found in Peru as well as other samples and compared them to modern genomes. They found a clear relationship to TB lineages in animals - especially seals and sea lions. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications, used samples taken from the mummified remains of 26 people who had been buried in a cyrpt of Vác's Dominican church during the 18th century. Workers attempting to restore the church stumbled on the remains of nearly 200 people in the crypt in 1994. The bodies had become naturally mummified in the exceptionally dry air. The bodies, many of whom had been wealthy Catholics, had been placed in the crypt fully clothed and in coffins between 1731 and 1838. Walled up and forgotten for about 150 years, the coffins were discovered when a construction worker tapped on a wall during renovation work. Part of the wall gave way to reveal coffins decotrated with skulls and stacked from floor to ceiling. The researchers found that eight of the 26 bodies they examined showed signs that they had died of tuberculosis, five of whom had suffered from multiple strains. It is the first evidence that mixed infections of multiple strains of TB were common in the 18th Century. The researchers found that all of the strains belonged to a lineage of Tuberculosis bacteria known as Lineage 4, which still causes more than a million TB cases a year in Europe and America. By analysing the DNA from these bacteria, the researchers were able to trace back the evolutionary history of the different strains they found by looking for genetic changes that had occurred. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The researchers found several different . The mummies were discovered during restoration work at the Dominican church in Vác, Hungary (above) They found that they all seemed to stem from a single strain of tuberculosis that was in existence between 396CE-470CE. The Roman dating supports recent scientific estimates that tuberculosis first emerged about 6,000 years ago, although some have suggested the disease is tens of thousands of years old. Writing in the journal, the researchers said: 'Phylogenetic dating places the most recent common ancestor of this lineage in the late Roman period. 'Our dating is consistent with evidence that a strain containing the pks15/1 deletion was present in Britain by the second–fourth centuries CE.' The findings also suggest that at the time when the mummies died, TB was already raging in Europe and killing large numbers of people even before urbanisation and crowded housing created devastating epidemics. The dry climate in the crypt preserved the bodies and clothing of the people placed there in the 18th century . The church where the mummies were found is in Vác in the Pest region of northern Hungary (shown above) Professor Pallen, who conducted the work along with researchers at the University Birmingham, University College London, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest, said: 'Microbiological analysis of samples from contemporary TB patients usually report a single strain of tuberculosis per patient. 'By contrast, five of the eight bodies in our study yielded more than one type of tuberculosis - remarkably, from one individual, we obtained evidence of three distinct strains.' Dr Gemma Kay, the first author of the study, added that their analysis had revealed some of the tragic toll the disease was having at the time. She said: 'Poignantly, we found evidence of an intimate link between strains from in a middle-aged mother and her grown-up daughter, suggesting both family members died from this devastating infection.'","More than 200 mummified bodies were found in a hidden crypt of the Dominican church in the city of Vác in Hungary during restoration work .

"Conrad Clitheroe, left, and Gary Cooper, right, were thrown in jail after being arrested for writing down aircraft registration numbers in Dubai . Three British men who have spent two months in prisons in Dubai and Abu Dhabi after they were seen plane spotting are to be freed. Conrad Clitheroe, 54 and Gary Cooper, 45, from Stockport, along with their ex-pat friend Neil Munro were stopped by police for writing down aircraft registration numbers at Fujairah Airport. They were taken to a police station and despite being told they would not be detained, were put into prison. Families of the three men confirmed they had been told they would finally be able to return home and charges of espionage would not be brought against them. Attorney Nasser Hashem said the men would be free to go after the court accepted a defense argument that they were pursuing their passion for plane spotting and had no ill intent. The news means Mr Clitheroe, who suffers from a heart condition, will be able to return home to celebrate his first wedding anniversary with his wife Valerie on May 9. She said: 'I am absolutely ecstatic. Apart from our wedding and the birth of my children this is the best day of my life. 'I just can't wait to see him, to hug him, to hold him. 'We got a call from the lawyer at 10am today to tell us he'd been in court and the case had been dropped. 'We then confirmed it with the consulate. 'I am just so happy, we've been ringing everyone to let them now. I'm in a bit of shock too, I don't feel like it can be real. 'How can you hold someone for that long with no charges? I don't understand it but I'm so so glad.' Earlier this month Mrs Clitheroe had raised concerns because her husband had run out of blood pressure medication. The men had travelled to Dubai for a four-day holiday on February 18. All three friends were keen to see Fujairah Airport, which is used by older and rarer aircraft. They drove the 70-mile journey there on February 21, but were stopped by an off-duty policeman after they slowed down to note the registration numbers of planes. Mr Clitheroe has always insisted they never took any photographs. Although plane spotting is not illegal in the United Arab Emirates, it is not understood and is frowned upon. Mr Clitheroe posted this picture on February 19 as he pursued his hobby at the Sheraton Deira Hotel in Dubai . The men were taken to a police station, where they were allegedly told they could only leave if they signed a form in Arabic saying they would not practise their hobby there again. But after signing the document, without asking for a translation, they were kept in custody overnight. They were brought before a prosecutor the next day and then moved to Fujairah Prison. Their case was escalated to a matter of 'national security'. Sharing a cell with over 20 others, eating on the floor and forced to stare at the four walls for most of the day, the families were concerned about their welfare - particularly as Mr Clitheroe needs medication for his heart condition. Valerie Clitheroe (pictured with her husband) said both he and Mr Cooper had been keen plane spotters since boyhood and pleaded for their release . A judge last month extended their custody licence, which was up again on April 12, but an admin error delayed the hearing until today. Mrs Clitheroe, who had recently written to the Prime minister for support, added: 'Conrad was beginning to think the worse and that they would never be released. Things had seemed to be so against them from the start that they thought it was going to end badly. 'We thought they would be charged with something and fined so it's come as a shock that there are no charges at all. We had started planning to go out there to deal with the lawyers face to face.' Mrs Clitheroe said the men had been keen plane spotters since they were children. The men were held after being seen by police writing down aircraft registration numbers at Fujairah Airport . The families of Mr Clitheroe and Mr Cooper were helped by charity 'Detained in Dubai' to pay £9,000 for a lawyer to fight their case. A crowd-funding site set up by the men's work colleagues has raised more than £5,000. Today Radha Stirling, the founder of Detained in Dubai said charges of espionage against the trio had finally been dropped at the Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi. 'The charges are being dropped with no fines or penalties. They've had a long time to wait to be told your case is ridiculous,' said Ms Stirling.","Conrad Clitheroe, 54, and Gary Cooper, 45, were taken to a police station .

"For Chris Brugger the cost of staying alive is $16,000 every three weeks. This is what the New South Wales leukaemia patient must pay for a new drug treatment that is keeping him alive. The 35-year-old, father-of-two from Griffith says the non-taxpayer subsidised treatment for his Hodgkin's disease - Brentuximab Vedotin - has improved his condition dramatically. It's for this reason that his 'My Name Is Chris' campaign and website was created to help raise the money needed for his treatment as it can't be distributed on the current Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Scroll down for video . The Brugger family (from left to right: Tomas, Naomi, Liam and Chris) attended a Senate inquiry on Monday in Canberra . Chris relaxs at The Kinghorn Cancer Centre as he receives his first dose of Brentuximab in January . The 35-year-old has had no shortage of support from his friends during his treatment . He's now been able to go back to work part-time in between travelling to Sydney for medical treatment. His family argue that it also reinforces why it is essential to get Hodgkin's Lymphoma treatment, Brentuximab Vedotin, on the PBS. 'My Name is Chris' was launched in mid-January following confirmation of Chris's relapse in December, and it has made a huge difference,' Chris's wife Naomi told Daily Mail Australia. 'Words can't describe! Without the campaign, we simply would not be able to afford to access Brentuximab. The Brugger family are hoping that the new treatment will mean there are happier times ahead . Chris and his son Tomas share a hug in hospital in December after Chris hears the devastating news he had relapsed . Chris and his one-year-old son Liam enjoy some time out together . 'Mentally it has also had a huge impact on Chris, he literally thought he was going to die in December, by the end of January he was feeling well, and inspired to fight harder than ever before.' Some of the fundraising that has taken place and donations given to the campaign have hugely raised his spirits too, with people's generosity taking him aback. 'Individually we had a $5,000 anonymous donation,' Chris told Daily Mail Australia. 'Over Easter we held the Festival of Chris which raised $15,000 as well as an event 'Celebrazione' at De Bortoli Wines Bulbil where we operated the BBQ and gate, collecting $3425.40. A hospital bill shows the $16,000 cost of Chris's Brentuximab Vedotin treatment . It's not just adults that have been helping - kids also proudly wear 'My Name Is Chris' T-shirts that have been purchased . 'De Bortoli Wines matched that, meaning we raised $6850.80 - so in two days we raised close to $22,000.' One donation in particular stood out for Chris and showed humanity at its best. It took place in March when Chris was at a fishing event - the Bidgee Classic selling merchandise for the 'My Name is Chris' campaign. 'A young boy, maybe 8 or 9 years old was talking to him and said his grandma had passed away from cancer,' Chris explains. 'He then disappeared and came back with a handful of coins - he donated all that he had to help. 'This was extremely moving and quite emotional.' A cricket bat signed by all the Australian team was just one item that was auctioned to help raise money for Chris's treatment . Chris has been humbled by the generosity that has been shown to him in recent months . It's been a taxing time for Chris, his wife Naomi, 32, and his two young sons Tomas, 4, and Liam, 1, but they remain positive that thanks to his treatment they will still share many happy years together. 'The immediate future is all about survival and raising the profile of My Name is Chris in order to educate others about cancer, medications, their options and taking their health into their own hands,' Naomi says. 'Beyond that, Chris hopes the future is bright. Brentuximab is working which means he will be around for a good while yet to enjoy being a dad to Liam and Tomas and take back his life. A Shannon Noll signed shirt was overwhelmingly popular at a recent auction for the cause . Chris's treatment at The Kinghorn Cancer Centre has been going well . 'It's important to remember cancer is a word, not a sentence.' 9 News also reports that Naomi told a Senate inquiry on Monday of the family's initial distress when trying to raise the sum for each dose of the new drug treatment. 'It's been hard going, I've been away from the boys,' she told the inquiry hearing in Canberra. A Penrith Panthers jersey signed by all the team also generated plenty of interest at auction . 'They're not only missing out on dad, they're missing out on mum who's trying to keep Dad alive.' Naomi told the hearing about the death of two other patients in December because they could not get affordable access to the drugs. The most concerning issue was the time it took for drug treatments to get approved for subsidies from the government regulator.","35-year-old, father-of-two from Griffith suffers from Hodgkin's disease .

"CBS political analyst John Dickerson has been announced as the new host of Face the Nation, taking over from veteran broadcaster Bob Schieffer. The Chief Political Correspondent of Slate Magazine was announced as the new host on the show on Sunday after the 78-year-old announced he would be retiring last week. He is expected to make his first appearance this summer, ending Schieffer's 14-year reign as host of the long-running news program, and said he's 'honored and excited' by the new job. Dickerson worked for Time Magazine for 12 years, four of them as White House correspondent, and has written extensively about the 2008 presidential campaign, the Obama presidency and his second run at the White House in 2010. CBS political analyst John Dickerson (left) has been announced as the new host of Face the Nation, taking over from veteran broadcaster Bob Schieffer, who announced his retirement last week (right) Career: Schieffer began at the political affairs show 'Face the Nation' in 1991, asking direct questions to politicians in a Texas twang . Schieffer, who has worked for CBS since 1969, revealed he was stepping down last Wednesday. He was speaking during an annual symposium that bears his name at Texas Christian University's Schieffer School of Journalism in Fort Worth, his alma mater. 'It's been a great adventure,' Schieffer said at the college. 'You know, I'm one of the luckiest people in the world because as a little boy, as a young reporter, I always wanted to be a journalist, and I got to do that. 'And not many people get to do that, and I couldn't have asked for a better life or something that was more fun and more fulfilling.' Last Wednesday night, Schieffer tweeted 'Great talking journalism at @TCU tonight. Also really happy to be in my hometown, where it all started, to announce my retirement.' 'Breaking': Producers of the show announced the decision on Twitter on Sunday during the show . Background: Dickerson worked for Time Magazine for 12 years, four of them as White House correspondent, and has written extensively about the 2008 presential campaign, the Obama presidency and his second run at the White House in 2010 . Big reveal: CBS This Morning Anchor Gayle King said Schieffer's announcement 'stunned' Stay tuned: King also uploaded this shot of Schieffer to Instagram after the news broke . Tribute: CNN news anchor Jake Tapper called Schieffer a 'legend' Wednesday night . He will be missed: Matt Drudge also said he was 'sad to see' Schieffer retire . A former newspaper reporter at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Schieffer joined CBS News in 1969 and has been the network's chief Washington correspondent since 1992. He began at the political affairs show 'Face the Nation' in 1991, asking direct questions to politicians in a Texas twang. He had an unexpected career highlight starting in 2005, filling in as anchor of the 'CBS Evening News' following Dan Rather's exit for a year and a half until Katie Couric took over the role. His folksy style got good reviews, boosted ratings and healed morale at the news division following the network's discredited report on President George W. Bush's military service. Schieffer survived bladder cancer about a decade ago, a brush with mortality that was one factor in his 2008 announcement that he would retire with the inauguration of a new president in January 2009. That inauguration came and went and Schieffer stayed. He was enjoying the job too much. The death of NBC's Tim Russert, whose 'Meet the Press' led in the ratings for many years, opened Sunday morning to a tighter competition. 'Face the Nation' often led, and CBS responded by expanding the show to an hour. 'I know what you're thinking,' CBS News President David Rhodes said in a memo to his staff Tuesday. 'Bob's thought about retiring before, is he really retiring now? And of course with his long connection to CBS News we'd be happy to learn that he's not leaving now, or that he can be seen by our viewers in the future.' But Rhodes said Schieffer wanted to announce the end of his career where it all began. Rhodes called him 'an inspiration and a mentor to so many colleagues - and, frankly, to me.' CBS would not talk Tuesday about potential successors at 'Face the Nation.' Schieffer hasn't had a single substitute when he took time off; Charlie Rose, Norah O'Donnell, Major Garrett, John Dickerson and Nancy Cordes have all filled in at different times. His chief competitors are Chuck Todd at 'Meet the Press' and George Stephanopoulos at ABC's 'This Week.' Rhodes told Politico '[Schieffer] felt very strongly about doing this at TCU. He's been really deveoted to us, he's had such a long career here - but he's also made a huge investment in TCU. 'His wife is still on the board, his name is on both the journalism and the communications school. He and I have been talking about this for a long time.' CBS News quoted Schieffer as saying Wednesday 'We like any large organization we have had our ups and downs; we're on a high right now. 'Face the Nation,' I think, is better than it has ever been.'

"A mother of three has been jailed for a year after conning a D-Day veteran out of nearly £10,000 and leaving him too traumatised to leave his home. Beverley Davis was supposed to be helping to care for 89-year-old former Royal Marine Ray Warren but tricked him into handing over his bank cards to steal £9,164 over 42 transactions. Her actions left elderly Mr Warren so devastated that he lay in bed at night worrying about money and even stopped going out. Beverley Davis, pictured, pleaded guilty of duping a Royal Marine war veteran out of almost £10,000 . The 35-year-old mother-of-three used Ray Warren's bank cards to buy Chinese takeaways, pay for creche fees and even clear some of her mortgage arrears after she gained his trust while working as a carer in his home . He died just five months after her crime was discovered and his daughter Elaine Symonds said Davis, 35, got what she deserved. The 58-year-old, from Norwich, Norfolk, said: 'He just gave up on life, he just couldn’t believe someone would do this to him. 'She robbed me of my dad. He stopped going out, he was so scared. 'I’ll never be able to forgive her – she needs to realise she can’t do this to people.' Davis first won Mr Warren's trust by helping him with his shopping and chores at home, Portsmouth Crown Court heard. He had lent her £6,000 - which she had never paid back - and also paid her £30 a week for helping around the house. Prosecutor Martyn Booth said: 'He had the usual struggles of people of that age, because of that he relied quite heavily on neighbours and friends to assist him in his day-to-day routines. 'This defendant also began to help in a small way and would do his shopping."" But the pensioner realised something was wrong when his bank Santander contacted him to say he had insufficient funds in his bank account to pay for items he had tried to buy. He expected to have around £6,000 in the account and was immediately suspicious of Davis, who had duped him into handing over his cards by saying the bank needed to see them. Mr Warren and his daughter then went through his accounts and discovered cash had been spent on Amazon and eBay. A number of the transactions Davis paid to Paypal were also in the name of her children and to a family centre. In total Davis, of Havant, Hampshire, made 42 transactions from both accounts between December 19, 2013 and February 10, 2014. Davis - who cried throughout the hearing - spent cash on Chinese takeaways, Amazon, eBay, children’s nursery fees, insurance and on mortgage arrears payments. But when questioned by police she claimed her vulnerable victim was confused and a drinker. Portsmouth Crown Court, pictured, heard Mr Warren paid Davis £30-a-week to help him around the house . Mr Booth told the court she changed her story in four interviews and said: 'She changed her position saying she knew nothing about these things. 'She then said she had used some of the card details from Mr Warren and it must have been done by mistake. 'She suggested that he gave her permission to buy some of these things. 'She said he must have been confused and he was a drinker.' But Mr Warren was described by his GP as being of sound mind and was lucid despite his age. Mr Booth added: 'He was somebody who was competent and that’s a view shared by the police who investigated these events.' Police investigating Davis also uncovered a second scam where she spent £1,046 using card details from a customer at a shop she worked at. Her victim Tanya Saliba, from Havant, Hampshire, said she spotted the cash was missing and thought she had not been paid.

"Nicola Sturgeon has said she would work with Ed Miliband's left-wing backbenchers to ensure a Labour minority government did not pursue austerity. The SNP leader also pledged to form alliances with minor parties such as the Greens and Plaid Cymru to ensure Mr Miliband did not impose any more cuts. 'I don’t think the country can afford more austerity,' she told ITV's The Agenda. 'I would be seeking to build alliances with parties like Plaid Cymru and the Greens and backbenchers. I could never ever support a Tory government.' Nicola Sturgeon has said she would work with Ed Miliband's left-wing backbenchers to ensure a Labour minority government did not pursue austerity . Miss Sturgeon said she would make a decision on an issue-by-issue basis, forcing a Labour minority government to seek SNP support for every single bill. The comments came after a Scottish poll delivered another blow to Mr Miliband’s hopes of achieving an overall majority. The shock survey found that 52 per cent of voters north of the border supported Nicola Sturgeon’s nationalists – more than double Labour’s support at just 24 per cent. It means Mr Miliband could not hope to move into Number 10 without the SNP’s say-so. Asked if never she could never vote down a Labour government, Miss Sturgeonresponded: 'Minority government is all about building alliances on an issue by issue basis. ‘It’s about where can I find support across this parliament for the position I want to build upon.' Ms Sturgeon also pledged to form alliances with minor parties such as the Greens and Plaid Cymru . She confirmed she would like to see some sort of pact between Labour and the SNP; although she would not want a Coalition. ‘Minority government can be stable and effective and successful, and we know how can contribute to making a minority government work,’ she said. 'We have a vested interest as long as we are part of the Westminster system to make sure it works as well as possible. 'What I am trying to say is look, here is a hand of friendship and not be secretive about my support for independence.' Miss Sturgeon insisted a vote for the SNP did not mean a vote for a second referendum. She said: 'As the leader of the SNP I am saying very clearly to people that voting SNP in this election is not voting for another independence referendum. 'For there to be another ref people would have to vote for a party that had that as a proposal in a manifesto in a Scottish parliament election. 'For the SNP to put it into another manifesto there has to be a change of circumstances from last year.' The TNS poll, which showed the Liberal Democrats on 6 per cent and 13 per cent siding with the Tories, would see Labour losing dozens of seats in Scotland. This would make it almost impossible for him to get an overall majority in Westminster; increasing the chances of him having to reach a deal with the SNP to win power. The poll’s 28-point lead is nearly double last month’s figure, when the SNP and Labour scored 46 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. The Scottish nationalists’ surge in the polls comes amid signs of a split between Labour leadership in London and Jim Murphy, the Labour leader in Scotland. Mr Murphy has suggested that the party would not need to make ‘further cuts to achieve our spending rules’ in the next parliament. First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon receives flowers while on the General Election campaign trail at New Lanark World Heritage Site, Lanarkshire . The Scottish First Minister said the SNP would never form an alliance with the Conservative Party but could support Labour . But yesterday Chuka Umunna, Labour’s business spokesman, slapped him down; telling the BBC’s Daily Politics programme that cuts would have to be made throughout the life of the new parliament. ‘The leader of the Scottish Labour Party will not be in charge of the UK budget,’ she said. ‘The leader of our country, our next prime minister, Ed Miliband, will be in charge of the UK budget. And he was absolutely clear: there will be the need for further consolidation and cuts throughout the rest of the parliament.’ And, speaking to the BBC Radio 4 Today Programme, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘I can't say to Scotland that you're going to be exempt from spending cuts in the unprotected areas but they're sensible.’ Labour Party leader Ed Miliband speaks at train engineering company in Loughborough today, with just over three weeks until polling day . Mr Miliband has insisted that he is not concerned about the polls in Scotland and claimed people were still making up their minds . When asked at his manifesto launch in Manchester the state of the polls in Scotland, Mr Miliband said: ‘There is a really important argument now about what the SNP commitments are. ‘Let’s see what happens on May 7 in relation to Scotland, because I think there are many, many people still making up their minds.’ Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: ‘The choice at this election couldn't be clearer - investment in the future of young Scots and an end to austerity with Scottish Labour, or losing £1,400 per person for our schools and hospitals with Nicola Sturgeon's plans for full fiscal autonomy.’","The SNP leader also pledged to form alliances with minor parties .

"Nicola Sturgeon yesterday vowed to prop up Ed Miliband in Downing Street – even if he loses the election. In her most extraordinary offer yet the nationalist leader called on the Labour leader to help her ‘lock’ David Cameron out of Downing Street. And crucially, she said the offer stood ‘regardless of who is the biggest party’ in the House of Commons. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon (pictured) said she would try to 'lock David Cameron out of Downing Street' regardless of whether the Tories finished as the largest party next month . Her comments raise the prospect of Mr Miliband ending up in Number 10 as a result of nationalist support despite having fewer seats in the House of Commons than the Tories. Miss Sturgeon’s latest offer came amid continued fallout from claims she told a French diplomat she wanted David Cameron to remain as Prime Minister. The report of the conversation, on February 26, between Miss Sturgeon and Sylvie Bermann, the French Ambassador, was contained within a Scotland Office memo leaked to the Daily Telegraph. The claim was denied both by the French embassy and Miss Sturgeon. Miss Sturgeon also denied a separate claim in the memo that Mr Miliband is ‘not Prime Minister material’. It undermines the SNP leader’s claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with Labour to keep the Conservatives out of office. The SNP’s opponents say it would favour another Tory-led government, against which it could campaign in an attempt to make an ‘out’ vote more likely in another referendum. In an article for the Observer addressed to Mr Miliband she wrote: ‘If together our parties have the parliamentary numbers required after 7 May, and regardless of which is the biggest party, will he and Labour join with us in locking David Cameron out of Downing Street?’ Ed Miliband has ruled out going into Coalition with SNP but has not rejected the prospect of working with them . Chancellor George Osborne said the prospect of the SNP propping up the Labour Party in power was an 'alliance between a party that wants to bankrupt the country and a party that wants to break up the country' Her comments heaped pressure on Labour to rule out any deal with the nationalists. Labour has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP but has refused to say if it would enter a looser agreement on policy areas to stay in power. Tory chief whip Michael Gove said: ‘My concern is that if the SNP win the number of seats they are projected to, they could hold the balance of power and hold Labour leader Ed Miliband to ransom.’ Miss Sturgeon is calling for a £180billion debt-fuelled public spending spree and an end to the Trident nuclear deterrent. Former cabinet minister Peter Hain told Radio 4’s The World This Weekend he said: ‘It is a curious plea being made by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP: vote anything except Labour to get a Labour government. That makes no sense at all.’ A Panelbase poll released yesterday put the SNP, on 45 per cent, with Labour on 29 per cent. If repeated across Scotland, the poll findings suggest the SNP would win 29 of the 41 seats won by Labour in 2010. A BBC reporter said he suffered an onslaught of ‘vicious abuse’ from Scottish Nationalists simply for asking Nicola Sturgeon about the claims that she would prefer David Cameron to remain as Prime Minister. Scotland correspondent James Cook was called ‘scum of the earth’ and ‘lying scum’ by SNP supporters on Twitter. One wrote that Mr Cook was ‘in the gutter’ and trying to ‘hide his SNP hatred’, while another accused him of being a ‘typical BBC/Westminster mouthpiece’. On Saturday Mr Cook wrote on the site: ‘What an extraordinary level of vicious abuse I have received today for simply reporting the news. Is this the country we want folks? Is it?’ He added: ‘Of course there are some SNP strategists – I know, I’ve spoken to them – who say in private a Tory victory would hasten independence. ‘Of course I should ask tough questions of politicians. This is a democracy. This is my role in it. And finally if, despite my 23 years of reporting things straight, you think I simply make up conversations then do feel free to unfollow me.’ Miss Sturgeon later praised Mr Cook in an apparent attempt to calm the situation. She tweeted: ‘James Cook is one of the best journalists in Scotland. Tough but scrupulously fair and a consummate professional.’","SNP chief says she would work with Labour regardless of election result .

"An 18-year-old mother-of-one had two heart attacks before dying from multiple organ failure after taking M-Cat at a house party, her family have said. Abby Swinfield, from Castle Donington, in Derbyshire, was partying with friends when she was rushed to hospital in the early hours of March 30. Miss Swinfield, who is believed to have a son, three, was taken to Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, where she was placed in a coma, but died a week later. Abby Swinfield, 18, a mother-of-one from Castle Donington, in Derbyshire, was rushed to hospital in the early hours of March 30 after a house party in Tamworth where it is thought she took M-Cat . Following Miss Swinfield's death, police have arrested one girl for supplying drugs, but Miss Swinfield's cousin has claimed she didn't take the drug voluntarily, saying her drink was spiked . Neighbours say ambulances arrived at this property at 1am. After arriving at hospital Miss Swinfield was put into a coma, but died a week later . Police are still waiting for the result of the post-mortem but it is believed the teenager had taken the illegal Class B drug Mephedrone - more commonly known as MCat or Meow Meow. Miss Swinfield's mother Kay, 39, said: 'I'm devastated. It happened at [her friend] Lauren's house. 'Abby hadn't seen Lauren in three years but she kept contacting her and saying ""come to mine for a party. We got a phone call that night saying she was at the hospital. 'Doctors told me she died of multiple organ failure after suffering two heart attacks. 'They said she'd been lying in the same position for a long time because she had a big blister on her back.' Abby's cousin Lydia Moore, 18, added: 'We don't think she took it on her own accord. We think her drink was spiked. 'Abby was a perfect girl who would be there for you if you needed it. She had an amazing heart. She had so many friends. Miss Swinfield's mother, Kay, said she is 'devastated' over her daughter's death, saying she suffered two heart attacks before dying of multiple organ failure after taking the drug . Miss Swinfield has a son, who is believed to be three years old. Her cousin Lydia Moore, 18, said the youngster keeps asking for his mother . 'She had a beautiful son and she loved him. What's heartbreaking is her son keeps asking for his mom. Someone has taken his mom from him. The family has been torn apart.' Police have arrested a 20-year-old girl on suspicion of supplying Class B drugs, and she has been released on bail. Staffordshire police said they have arrested a 20-year-old girl on suspicion of supplying drugs, amid allegations Miss Swinfield's drink was spiked . Linus Pebliauskas, 29, who lives on Bridgwater Street, where the party was held, said: 'I didn't know who lived at the house but there were many young lads going in and out of there. 'There was drinking throughout the day and not just at weekends. It was a bit of a party house from what I could tell.' Yesterday a friend who was at the party, but did not want to be named, added: 'We are in absolute shock. 'There was a house party and there were loads of people there, I don't know how she got the drugs. 'She had a three-year-old boy, it is so tragic. 'Her mum Kay is absolutely distraught. She is really angry about what happened and the fact there were drugs at this party. 'She had come down to visit friends and have a good night out and now she is dead, I cannot believe it. 'She was a very popular girl and we are just completely numb at the moment. I can't get my head around it.' A spokeswoman for Staffordshire Police added: 'She has been released on police bail pending further investigation until a date in June. 'A post-mortem examination will take place in the coming days to help establish the cause of death. 'Anyone with information on the incident is urged to call Staffordshire Police on 101 quoting incident 790 of March 30.' Police had previously warned about the use of M-Cat in Tamworth after a raid two months ago during which 4lbs of the drug, worth thousands of pounds, was discovered.","Abby Swinfield, 18, collapsed in early hours of March 30 at a house party .

"Historian David Starkey has launched an astonishing attack on the 'victim status' of ethnic minorities and disabled people - and says women are only of average intelligence. The television presenter also gave his views on the current political class, claiming he did not believe any politician was equipped to be prime minister and the 'real talent has left politics'. The outspoken 70-year-old said evidence suggested women tended to be of average intelligence, whereas men were either 'very, very bright or very thick', but denied he is sexist. Scroll down for video . Outspoken: Historian David Starkey (pictured) says ethnic minority groups and disabled people should not 'assume the status of victim' In a wide-ranging interview with the Daily Telegraph, he hit out at Baroness Doreen Lawrence, the mother of race murder victim Stephen, for following what he claimed was the approach of US civil rights leaders after Martin Luther King's death by 'treating blacks as victims'. He said: 'They espoused victimhood and violence. And I think to a dangerous extent that has happened in this country. With all the praise that's been lavished on Doreen Lawrence, she's constantly treating blacks as victims. 'All forms of liberation, and I speak as gay and I was in all this when it wasn't fashionable, when you didn't get your CBE for being a prominent poofter, when there were actual penalties for doing it - all of them depend upon you taking control. About you refusing to be a victim. David Starkey also hit out at Baroness Doreen Lawrence (pictured), for following what he claimed was the approach of US civil rights leaders after Martin Luther King's death by 'treating blacks as victims' 'And I find it very, very sad the sway there is now this perpetual procession of people - group after group - wanting to assume the status of victim. It's catastrophic.' Starkey, who said he was 'born quite seriously disabled', added people with physical and mental disabilities should not be portrayed as victims. And he claimed fears of Islamophobia were victimising Muslims, making them 'therefore somehow privileged and exempt'. A recent poll showed many Muslims reported higher community tensions, with one in three saying they felt under greater suspicion in the last few years, while 44 per cent of non-Muslims reporting being more wary.","The presenter said disabled people should not be portrayed as victims .

Six years, one marriage and two children later, the Hollywood actor has revealed that he doesn't even notice the age gap because of his mature nature - he is so grown up that friends of the couple call him Benjamin Button after Brad Pitt's character in the 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, who ages in reverse.

In an interview in Saturday's Times magazine the co-star of the latest installment of Disney's superhero blockbuster Avengers: Age of Ultron says: 'I don't notice it now - we just instinctively gel ... People who know me call me Benjamin Button - they think I'm an old soul and she's a young soul.' Taylor-Johnson says he fell in love with Sam, the most commercially successful female film-maker in history after she directed Fifty Shades of Grey, which was released in February, on the first day they met on the set of Nowhere Boy in 2009. After a whirlwind romance, the pair announced their engagement at the film's premiere later that year. They married at Babington House in Somerset when Taylor-Johnson was 20, a move he says made 'perfect sense'. He tells the magazine: 'I knew I wanted to be with her. I wanted kids, we had kids and I was really into that, taking time off and involving myself in the bubble of her pregnancy.'

The couple's first daughter, Wylda Rae, was born in July 2010 followed by Romy Hero in January 2012. The family now lives in Los Angeles with Sam's daughters Angelica, 17, and Jessie Phoenix, eight, from her first marriage to the art dealer Jay Jopling, and the couple take on one project a year each so one parent is always at home. Aaron, who grew up in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, has been acting since the age of six when he starred in a Persil advert. When he was 12 he appeared in Hollywood action comedy Shaghai Knights, and when he was 15 he worked alongside Edward Norton in The Illusionist. Taylor-Johnson says he was a 'self destructive teenager struggling with success' before he met Sam. But after the two got together, she quickly became his best friend and a stable influence in the notoriously fickle Hollywood. He and Sam now focus most of their time on being parents, with school runs and extracurricular activities taking up the bulk of their days. They have a rule that they are only allowed to take on one project a year, meaning that someone is always around for the children. And although looking after four children at the age of 24 might seem like a hard task, Taylor-Johnson says he has never been happier. He told the newspaper: 'Being a father has been the happiest time of my life - it's what I live for, what I love doing - I have a real reason why I'm here, I'm not as proud of my acting; it's a job that I do ... I'm grateful, but I don't live for acting.'","Aaron Taylor-Johnson, 24, is so mature friends call him Benjamin Button .

"A member of the Armed Forces has received £709,000 in compensation for bullying, it emerged last night. The sum dwarfs payments for troops seriously wounded on the battlefield. Those who have lost both legs in combat are eligible for £570,000. Another soldier has received £411,000 after being left with psychological problems caused by harassment at the hands of senior troops. A member of the Armed Forces has received £709,000 in compensation for bullying, it emerged last night . The settlements are thought to be the largest paid out by Ministry of Defence as a result of bullying. Last year, the MoD gave a total of £81.9million in compensation to members of the Armed Forces for injury, death and property damage by the MoD, according to the Daily Mirror. Emma Norton of human rights group Liberty said: ‘This is much more than a financial headache for the MoD – it’s a problem that can cost a person their mental wellbeing or even their life. A new watchdog is to be created to investigate the way bullying and abuse cases are dealt with in the Armed Forces after Corporal Anne Marie Ellement (above) was found hanged in 2011 . ‘If a soldier is bullied, ignored, then ground down by an interminable and biased complaints system, it’s no surprise they feel legal action is their only option. ‘If the MoD wants to reduce its compensation bill, it must deal effectively with bullies – simply saying the Army has a zero- tolerance approach doesn’t make it so.’ The MoD said it was misleading to compare payouts from the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme with common law claims. A spokesman said that personal injury claims were based on ‘legal liability’, while the AFCS gives compensation ‘irrespective of fault, across a range of circumstances’ arising from service. A new watchdog is to be created to investigate the way bullying and abuse cases are dealt with in the armed forces, the Government announced last year. The case of Cpl Anne Marie Ellement, 30, who was found hanged at Bulford Barracks, Wilts, in 2011 prompted the commitment. An inquest found that psychological effects of an alleged rape and ‘work-related despair’ contributed to her death and the coroner called for the MoD to review its care for vulnerable soldiers.","Another soldier received £411,000 because of psychological problems .

"Sleepy kid: Brock Guzman, 8, was last seen inside his parents silver 2001 Toyota Corolla. Authorities said the Northern California boy fell asleep in the backseat of the car and was kidnapped when the vehicle was stolen . An eight-year-old boy who took a snooze in the backseat of his family's car, apparently slept through his own kidnapping after the car was stolen from in front of his home. Brock Guzman was found safe and well about two miles away from his Northern Californian home in the abandoned car following a frantic search for him. Police said a hapless car thief likely stole the 2001 Toyota Corolla after the boy's father left it running and briefly unattended in front of his home. But the car thief clearly didn't notice the boy curled up on the backseat fast asleep as he sped away with the vehicle. The boy's father said he had placed Brock in the Corolla at around 4:45 a.m., and started the engine. He then went back into the house in Fairfield to get some belongings and his older son, who attends school 40 miles away in Napa. However, when the father went back outside, the car was gone and an unfamiliar bicycle lay nearby. In a blind panic, he hopped into another family vehicle and sped off in search of the Corolla. The boy's mother frantically called 911, and authorities issued an Amber Alert. Less than four hours later, a resident called police and said the car was parked in their neighborhood. When officers cautiously approached it at around 8:15 a.m., the suspect was gone and Brock was still asleep. He was not injured. Fairfield police Officer Kathryn McCormick said: 'We don't know for sure if he slept through the whole thing, but it looks that way. We hope that was the case.' Police do not have a description of the suspect and say it appears that the thief did not know the child was sleeping in the backseat. 'At this point, we are investigating this as a crime of opportunity,' McCormick said.

"A former Playboy model is facing common assault charges for allegedly punching a young woman in a Queensland pub, despite the victim withdrawing her complaint. The model, Georgina Gosden, allegedly punched a 21-year-old woman at Townsville's Mad Cow Tavern in on December 7 last year. She carried out a similar attack on a 25-year-old woman in the same nightclub last April. Police are pursuing the charges against Ms Gosden, despite her most recent victim withdrawing the charges. Scroll down for video . Former Playboy model Georgina Gosden, 25, is facing charges for punching two women in the face at a pub . Both incidences took place at Towsnville's Mad Cow Tavern in north Queensland . The Townsville Magistrates Court heard Gosden was already at the Mad Cow pub when the younger woman walked in about 10.40pm. When she went to order a drink, Gosden allegedly got up from her seat, ran to the woman and punched her in the face. Court documents say the woman was known to Gosden,who told police 'she was going to find her [the victim]'. The model is said to have carried out a similar attack on a 25-year-old woman in the same nightclub last April . It is alleged Gosden punched both woman in the face at the Mad Cow Tavern . Ms Gosden has appeared in Townsville Magistrates Court to defend charges of common assault and being drunk and disorderly in a licensed venue . At the time of the incident, the Playboy model was already on bail, charged with assault occasioning bodily harm after she assaulted an old school friend at the same pub in April last year. The first victim said at the time that the model had come out of nowhere and punched her in the face. 'I walked inside the nightclub, I turned to my right and had only taken about three steps and was looking around. Then I saw someone in a long green fluorescent skirt coming ­towards me quickly from my left,' the victim told police, according to the Bulletin. That charge was later dismissed and replaced with a drunk and disorderly charge. Magistrate Cathy Wadley agreed to let Gosden out on bail, despite police prosecutor Erica Forde advising against because of fears the model would re-offend. Ms Gosden's Solicitor, Callum Argaet, said police had advised they would be proceeding with the most recent common assault charge, despite his firm applying for the charge to be dropped,  The Courier Mail reported. Gosden signed with Playboy last year and described herself as a 'tomboy' in high school in a video on its YouTube channel . April's incident allegedly involved her punching another woman several times in the face . In a video on the Playboy YouTube channel, Gosden said she was a horse riding instructor who grew up in Townsville and was born in England. She described herself as 'outgoing' and a 'fun-type of girl'. 'I teach young kids to ride horses. It’s very rewarding. I’ve been riding since I was 9, I try to ride horses every day,' Gosden said. The model was granted bail by the magistrate but police prosecutors feared she would re-offend . Gosden said she was a horse riding instructor who was not 'very girly' when she was in high school . Despite her budding career as a glamour model, Gosden confessed she was not 'very girly' when she was younger. 'The type of girl I was in high school, I was definitely a tomboy. I wore baggy shirts and board shorts,' she said. 'I wasn't very girly until a lot later on when I started to get those curves in all the right places.' Georgina Gosden has pleaded not guilty to the common assault charges.

"Less than a week since it smashed its previous speeds, the so-called Japanese bullet train has entered the record books once more. The seven-car Maglev - short for 'magnetic levitation' - hit a top speed of 375mph (603 km/h) and travelled for almost 11 seconds at speeds above 373mph (600km/h) during a test run near Mount Fuji. The run beat last week's speeds of 366mph (590kph), which in turn beat the train's previous 12-year record  of 361mph (581km/h). Scroll down for video . The seven-car Maglev (pictured) - short for 'magnetic levitation' - hit a top speed of 375mph (603 km/h) and travelled for almost 11 seconds at speeds above 373mph (600km/h) during a run near Mount Fuji. It beat last week's speeds of 366mph (590kph), which in turn beat the train's previous record of 361mph (581km/h) The  train is able to go this fast because it makes use of a charge to lift and move it above a guideway. It hovers four inches (10cm) above the tracks and is propelled by electrically charged magnets. The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail. Owner Central Japan Railway plans to have a train in service in 2027 to join Tokyo and the central city of Nagoya - a distance of 177 miles (286km). The speeds, however, won't be as high when the new line between Tokyo and Nagoya comes into service. Maglev trains use magnets to lift the carriages above the track. This eliminates the need for wheels and therefore reduces friction, providing a faster and quieter service. Acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains. And maglev also makes for much smoother journeys. Right now speeds are limited at up to 400 kilometres (250 miles) per hour due to the excessive air resistance encountered at these speeds. But vacuum tube designs could allow them to travel over seven times faster in the future. According to engineers, the trains will travel at 314mph (505km/h) - but this will still cut the journey time for the journey by more than half. For comparison, the UK's HS2 rail line will run at 224mph (360km/h). By 2045, Maglev trains are expected to link Tokyo and Osaka in just 67 minutes, slashing the journey time in half. The Maglev trains are expected to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time. Japan is well-established as the world leader in high-speed trains, having developed the first 'bullet train' in 1964. It is now hoping to bring the technology to the US and has outlined plans for a line between Washington and Baltimore, which will cut travel times between the cities to just 15 minutes. Maglev was first proposed as a method to propel trains as far back as the mid 20th century. The first commercial maglev train to come into operation was a relatively low-speed shuttle at Birmingham International Airport in 1984. This travelled at a rather mundane 26mph (42km/hr). It was not until the turn of the century, though, that high-speed maglev would come into commercial operation, mostly in Japan and China. Maglev trains (pictured) hover four inches (10cm) above the tracks and is propelled by electrically charged magnets. This eliminates the need for wheels and therefore any incidence of friction, providing a faster and quieter service. Acceleration and deceleration far exceeds that of conventional trains . China was the first country to have a commercially-operated Maglev service. The Shanghai Maglev opened to the public in January 2004, and has a top commercial operational speed of 268mph due to the short track length.It cost $1.3billion (£830million) to build. Manufacturers claim that Maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities. But not everyone is convinced that the technology is safe. Andy Kunz, president of the US High Speed Rail Association. told the Los Angeles Times that maglev trains have proved to be expensive, power-intensive, and potentially unsafe. 'The problem is if you have one tiny little settling of the Earth - which happens all the time because of plate tectonics - that can create little movements in the maglev system, which can send trains crashing into stuff,' he said. By 2045 maglev trains (example pictured) are expected to link Tokyo and Osaka in just one hour and seven minutes, slashing the journey time in half. The Maglev trains are set to eventually consist of 16 carriages and carry up to 1,000 passengers at a time .

The speeds, however, won't be as high when the new line comes into service. According to engineers, the trains will travel at 314mph (505km/h) - but this will cut the journey time by more than half . 'It's a very difficult system to make operational.' A new development called super-maglev could be set to push the limits even higher. Last year, China's first manned megathermal superconducting maglev was been tested successfully by the Applied Superconductivity Laboratory of Southwest Jiaotong University. The technology works by using a vacuum tube to decrease the speed limitations imposed by air resistance on regular maglev trains. 'ETT (Evacuated Tube Transport) systems might allow HTS Maglev trains to attain speeds in a new order of magnitude, such as super-high 3,000km (1,800 miles) per hour, which could be applied to some military or space launch systems,' the researchers write.

"A tortoise has been reunited with his owner after spending nearly a year on the run and even finding a new home - at the age of 109. Owner Wendy Stokes, 74, had given up hope of ever seeing Toby again after he escaped from her garden 11 months ago. But he has now returned home and after piecing together his escapades over the last year, it's become apparent he's had quite an adventure. Reunited: Wendy Stokes, 74, is delighted to have 109-year-old Toby back after his escape 11 months ago . He wandered through a gate in her garden and headed for the open road where he was picked up by a passing driver concerned for his safety and taken to a nearby animal rescue centre. Six months ago, he was re-homed with a couple living in Margate, Kent, 22 miles away from Wendy's farm in West Hougham. But the couple, who could just about make out the word 'Stokes' written in white paint on his shell, felt they needed to find out who Tony belonged to. With nothing else to go on, they decided to call every Stokes in Kent listed in the phonebook. Eventually came across a delighted Wendy, who immediately arranged to collect him. She's had Toby since the 1980s when he was given to her by her late great aunt. He was returned home last Sunday, a full 11 months after his amazing, if a little slow, adventure. Wendy has had Toby since the 1980s and wrote her surname, Stokes, on his back in white paint . Retired farm worker Wendy said: 'I had painted my name and number on the side of his shell but it had faded when he went missing so they couldn't read it. 'The people who found him could read Stokes but they couldn't make out the number. 'He had got out because I had left my gate open. It is normally closed because we have sheep in the paddock but they were in a different field. 'Toby just walked out and trotted towards the road where somebody picked him up and took him to a rescue centre. 'Everyone knows I have a tortoise and we always take him to the village fete so he is a bit of a local celebrity. 'I was devastated when he went missing and spent weeks looking for him in all the fields around the farm.' She added: 'I went all goosey when they told me they had Toby because I had really given up on him. 'It is brilliant having him back and I think everybody was keeping their eye out for him all this time.'","Toby escaped out the back gate from his Wendy Stokes' garden in Kent .

"Apple Inc has approached more than a dozen musicians, including British band Florence and the Machine, in an effort to sign exclusive deals for some of their music to be streamed on Beats, according to a new report. The company is in talks with Florence and the Machine to give Apple limited streaming rights to a track from their album set to be released in June, Bloomberg said. Apple has also approached Taylor Swift and others about partnerships, the report said. Beats-ing the competition? Apple Inc has approached more than a dozen musicians, including Taylor Swift and British band Florence and the Machine in an effort to sign exclusive deals for some of their music to be streamed on Beats . Apple declined to comment. Beats Music will be re-launched in coming months. There will be a $9.99-a-month subscription for individuals and a family plan for $14.99, according to sources, Bloomberg said. Apple bought audio equipment and music streaming company Beats for about $3 billion in May 2014, hoping to catch up in fast-growing music streaming industry. Music streaming service Tidal, launched last month by rapper Jay Z, is also trying to convince artists to sign exclusive deals for their content, to fend off competition from services such as Spotify and Google Inc's YouTube. Competitors: The Jay Z-backed Beats competitor Tidal has a slew of big name co-owners including Madonna, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna. Here, Beyonce and Madonna attend the Tidal launch in New York March 30 . Tidal isn't new, but it's getting a reboot from rapper Jay-Z, who bought the Scandinavian company behind it, Aspiro. Madonna, Rihanna and Beyonce are among the co-owners. That's notable because many artists complain about how little payment they get from other music services, such as Spotify. As owners, artists could insist on better deals. The membership-based service  will provide music and video content that users can stream on computers, tablets and smartphones or listen to offline. It is being offered at two price points: $10 for standard sound quality and $20 for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality.' SPOTIFY . One of the most popular music services, with 60 million active users worldwide, and a quarter of them paying subscribers. Just this week, Spotify launched an app on Sony's PlayStation game console. The two companies worked closely to make listening seamless, so music can be heard in the background while playing games, without losing the game's sound effects, for instance. Spotify offers unlimited listening and Internet radio. It's free with ads; on mobile devices, users are limited to Internet radio and can't choose songs. Paying $10 a month gets you an ad-free premium service that offers song selection and offline playback on mobile devices. PANDORA . Offers Internet radio only. More than 81 million active listeners. Free with ads, or pay $5 a month for an ad-free premium service and higher-quality audio over Web browsers. TIDAL . Unlimited listening. Among the few services offering high-fidelity songs, which many audiophiles prefer over MP3s and other formats that reduce quality in the compression process. Offers music video and curated playlists from experts. $10 a month for standard sound quality and $20 for high fidelity. There's no free offering. APPLE . Pay per song to download and own forever through iTunes. Free Internet radio through iTunes Radio on Apple devices. Also owns Beats Music, which offers unlimited listening for $10 a month, with no free version. Beats touts its playlists and other recommendations curated by experts, not computers. GOOGLE . Pay per song through Google Play. Google Play Music service offers unlimited listening for $10 a month, with no free option. Google also offers YouTube Music Key for selected music videos, free of ads, for $10. Paying for one gets you the other, too. AMAZON . Pay-per-song offering. Amazon's $99-a-year Prime membership comes with unlimited listening, though the song selection isn't as broad as what rivals offer. SAMSUNG'S MILK MUSIC . Offers free Internet radio like Pandora and others, but tries to make it easier to find music to match your mood.

"Pensions minister Steve Webb has now urged people to not make rash decisions . He is the Pensions Minister who famously said we should be free to blow our life savings on a Lamborghini. But after liberating a nation to spend their money as they wish, Steve Webb has now urged people to take their time rather than make rash decisions. Yesterday the biggest pension reforms in a century were launched, allowing over-55s to cash in their pension pots rather than being forced to buy a fixed monthly income. But as Pensions Freedom Day finally arrived, the Government appealed for caution, perhaps fearing that some people will quickly exhaust their funds and be forced to rely on the State. Mr Webb said over-55s ‘don’t have to rush this’ and insisted there was ‘a case for waiting and seeing’. He said April 6 was the ‘starting gun’ and not a ‘deadline’, adding: ‘We want people to make informed choices. This isn’t a mad scramble rush to do something this morning.’ Asked about his flippant remark last year that people should be able to buy a Lamborghini with their pension, he admitted ‘you will pay a hell of a lot of tax’ if you do. While the first 25 per cent of any withdrawals from pensions are tax-free, savers will have to pay income tax on the remainder. Those who withdraw their pension in one go face hefty bills if they are pushed into a higher tax bracket. Official forecasts show that the Treasury is set to receive an additional £370million of income tax in the next year as a result of the changes. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron has a bit of lunch with Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota as they eat lunch in the garden with people who have benefited from tax and pension changes that came into force today . And documents published alongside the Budget suggest this could reach £3.8billion by 2020. Research by consumer group Which? shows that buying a £228,000 Lamborghini Aventador would incur a £126,000 tax bill if you withdrew the cash in one go – enough to buy a Porsche 911 Turbo. But a study by insurer Aegon found that a third of over-55s were unaware of the tax implications of withdrawing all their money at once. Spokesman Kate Smith said: ‘People could lose out on thousands of pounds of their hard-earned savings.’ Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg - who was out campaigning with the Energy  Secretary Ed Davey in Surbiton, London, today - has hailed the pensions reforms . And yesterday Dr Ros Altmann, the Government’s champion for older workers, warned that people who withdraw their cash could be hit with a ‘triple tax whammy’ – on their withdrawal, on any new investment and because the money no longer had tax-free status. She urged caution, and said that right now she would advise pensioners to ‘do nothing’. The new reforms will allow 2.1million over-55s to withdraw all or part of their funds rather than being required to buy an annuity. Studies show many will use at least part of their money to go on holiday, pay off debts, renovate their homes or help their family financially. However it could take time for people to get their hands on their pension pot. While all firms must allow people to take their entire lump sum, many will not allow partial withdrawals. This means many customers will have to switch companies, incurring exit fees and involving time-consuming paperwork. Michelle Cracknell, of the Pensions Advisory Service, said she would advise pensioners ‘not to book the cruise right now’. Experts fear pensioners could be vulnerable  if they do not receive proper advice regarding pension plans now that over-55s can cash in their pensions and spend them  instead of being forced to buy an annuity (file image)","Over-55s are now able to cash in their pensions instead of buying annuity .

"Adam Leheup, 34, was cleared of rape and sexual assault by a jury at Blackfriars Crown Court . An architect who was wooing 35 woman online was cleared today of raping a blind date hours after they met. Adam Leheup, 34, had denied forcing himself on the 25-year-old telling the jury the woman 'freaked out' when he tried to comfort her about her saggy breasts. During the week long trial the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claimed Leheup ignored her cries of 'no' and afterwards said: 'In my experience girls say no, but they don't mean it'. But following their deliberations a jury at Blackfriars Crown Court found the University of Greenwich graduate, a technical co-ordinator on the £500million Nine Elms Point Development not guilty of rape and sexual assault. The self-confessed first date addict had spent nearly a year on police bail before eventually being charged and appeared emotional, emitting a slight gasp, as he was cleared. Leheup told the jury they enjoyed a night-long date, which included wine and cocktails, with the young woman responding to his physical advances and allowing him to remove her bra in her bedroom so he could massage her back with oil. ‘I noticed she had unusually saggy breasts, she seemed uncomfortable about that,' he told the jury. 'I tried to comfort her by kissing and touching them, then she freaked out.’ He had fought back tears as he told jurors he never had sex with the young woman and didn't do anything she did not consent to. Leheup of Hersham, Surrey, revealed he was communicating with thirty-five woman at the time and regularly having sex with six of them, but stopped short with the complainant. 'She said: 'Stop' once and I turned to my side and started to go to sleep,' he told the jury. 'When girls have said nothing is going to happen, I've ended up having sex with them,' he added. The pair had met her just hours earlier on  July 9, 2013, after the pair chatted on the 'Let's Date' mobile phone app. Leheup ended up returning to the woman's flat in the early hours of the morning after he missed his last train home. 'I told him nothing was going to happen, but he started to kiss me and I could tell he was naked,' the complainant told police, the court had heard. 'He took my clothes off and was on top of me and penetrated me and I was shouting: 'No' a lot, but he was not listening. Leheup appeared emotional after he was cleared of the charges following a week long trial at Blackfriars Crown Court . 'I was saying: 'No', but he thought it was a joke or something. Then maybe he realised I was serious and he calmed down. 'He said: 'Girl's say: 'No', but they don't mean it.' I just wanted him out. My flatmate said she was going to call the police, but he laughed at her and said it would just be a domestic.' Parkour and free-running fan, Leheup was arrested after he left the woman's flat. When questioned by police the architect said his date did not object to being touched intimately by him. Leheup walked free from court after the jury returned the not guilty verdicts.","Adam Leheup found not guilty of rape and sexual assault by jury .

"The Health Secretary promised a crackdown if the Conservatives are re-elected . Ending the ‘abuse’ of NHS money exposed by the Mail will be a priority if the Conservatives are re-elected, the Health Secretary said last night. Speaking as the Mail revealed how NHS managers were potentially dodging income tax by channelling huge salaries through personal companies, Jeremy Hunt promised an immediate crackdown if his party is in power after the election. He said: ‘The Mail’s campaign has exposed that off-payroll contracts are clearly being abused both at a management level and in the hiring of agency staff. So we will stop the abuse as a priority if we form the next government.’ His comments led a storm of reaction from all political parties, as well as health experts and medical professionals. The Mail yesterday revealed how hospital bosses had taken £35million in pay rises during the worst funding crisis in a generation. And today it can be revealed that some could dodge tax by channelling salaries through personal companies. The practice is being used by temporary executives – some of whom earn more than £2,000 a day – and allows them to avoid paying income tax and national insurance in the normal way. Dr Sarah Wollaston, former Tory chairman of the health select committee, said: ‘I was asked about the Mail’s investigation today at an open public meeting. People are right to be concerned about the best use of public money.’ Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham has also vowed that a Labour government would investigate the Mail’s evidence. And he said the astonishing pay rises should be ‘clawed back’, adding: ‘It cannot be right at a time when NHS staff have been asked to accept years of [pay] freezes to see this level of excess at the top.’ The extraordinary pay deals have also been condemned by the Royal College of Nursing, which branded them ‘shocking’, while health experts including the Royal College of Physicians and government health adviser Sir Brian Jarman demanded a review. Former Commons public accounts committee chairman Margaret Hodge, who investigated tax avoidance by public officials three years ago, said NHS trusts should be ‘hauled’ before MPs to be held to account. ‘This is a way of avoiding tax,’ the Labour MP said. ‘The reason the Treasury took action to stop public officials being paid through personal service companies was because my committee uncovered this was going on. ‘I’m cross the Government has not stopped this and a future government has got to sort it out. ‘They should make it a condition that if you are being paid with taxpayer money you have to be properly on the books.’ Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said the situation was ‘ludicrous’, adding: ‘There is no way of justifying it.’ Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said: ‘It’s sickening to see top NHS bosses using the tax rules for personal gain.’ Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham said his party would investigate the Mail's findings if elected .","The Health Secretary said the Mail's campaign exposed abuse of funds .

"He is about to turn 80 but self-confessed ladies’ man Albert Roux has evidently lost none of his charm. The legendary French chef has been wining and dining a string of glamorous blondes since divorcing his wife of eight years, Zimbabwean-born heiress Cheryl Roux, last year. The coterie includes a former flame, an artist, a hospitality manager and the woman at the centre of his bitter divorce – former cloakroom attendant Nataliya Lutsyshyna. Chef Albert Roux with his second wife,  Zimbabwean-born heiress, Cheryl Roux before their divorce last year . Sources close to the restaurateur say he is ‘smitten’ with Ms Lutsyshyna, a 41-year-old Ukrainian who used to work at the Roux restaurant in Westminster. But this has not stopped him rekindling his close friendship with Debbie Spivey Izo, an American divorcee in her 60s whom he dated before his marriage to Cheryl, 58. He has also been meeting up with British landscape artist Lynne Moore and Eastern European tea hostess Ljiljana Pavicevic. Last weekend Roux was reportedly due to be helping his son Michel Jr cook at tennis star Andy Murray’s wedding reception at the Cromlix House hotel in Scotland. Instead he whisked Ms Lutsyshyna off on a romantic getaway to the South of France where they dined at the Michelin-starred Joel Robuchon Monte-Carlo restaurant. ‘Albert went to a lot of trouble to treat Nataliya,’ a friend of the chef said. Nataliya Lutsyshyna (left) was whisked on a romantic getaway with the chef. Right, Ljiljana Cejovic Pavicevic, or 'Lily', has had dinners with Mr Roux . Debbie Spivey Izo (left), an American divorcee in her 60s whom he dated before his marriage and Lynne Moore (right) who says she has been invited to 'half a dozen dinners' Mr Roux, who once confessed to giving up on his childhood dream of becoming a priest due to his philandering, started stepping out with Ms Lutsyshyna last year after The Mail on Sunday revealed that his wife was divorcing him on the grounds of adultery. At the time, Mr Roux admitted he had seen Miss Lutsyshyna ‘a week, maybe ten days before the end of the marriage’. Mr Roux, who divorced his first wife Monique, the mother of his two children – Michel Jr, and Danielle – in 2001, is said to have spent thousands on his new girlfriend. Says a source: ‘Some of Albert’s friends are very concerned about the amount of money that he is frittering away.’ However, while he is in an exclusive romantic relationship with Miss Lutsyshyna, she is not the only woman in his life. Ms Spivey Izo reappeared on the scene soon after Mr Roux’s split with Cheryl. She flew to Scotland to see Mr Roux at his establishments there soon after he became a single man again. ‘Debbie has been on the scene for years,’ adds a source. ‘She was dating Albert before he met Cheryl and she never really went away. As soon as his marriage to Cheryl ended, Albert was back in touch with her.’ Lynne Moore, who met Albert Roux through Lib Dem peer Lord Sharman, admitted to The Mail on Sunday that they regularly meet up: ‘Albert has kindly invited me to about half a dozen dinners. 'He’s very nice, but we are not in a romantic relationship.’ Mr Roux has known Ljiljana Pavicevic, since 2008. She and Roux they often enjoy dinners together. When contacted by The Mail on Sunday, Ms Pavicevic, who is known as Lily, said: ‘I see Mr Roux with other colleagues, I have never had a dinner alone with him.’ Last night Cheryl declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr Roux said: ‘He has no comment to make on this. He tries to be extremely private.’","Albert Roux has been dating a string of ladies since divorcing heiress wife .

"A telescopic tube that scans the lungs for cancer is being used by NHS doctors, cutting diagnosis time from days to just 30 minutes. When tumours in the lungs are suspected, patients can face a raft of tests and even surgery to find out if they have the disease, often resulting in an agonising wait before they start lifesaving treatment. Now doctors at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) are able to start vital treatment much sooner using a single procedure. It even allows them to assess instantly the type and severity of the cancer. Scroll down for video . A finger-width flexible tube called an endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) allows doctors to see inside the lungs and take a tissue sample in one go. The procedure involves inserting the EBUS down the throat, guided by a tiny camera fitted to the tube. An ultrasound scanner attached to one end of the tube takes a scan while a small needle takes a tissue sample. Findings from a three-year trial at UCLH reveal that the method halves the time it takes between a patient’s first hospital appointment and for a decision to be made on the best course of treatment. EBUS patients wait an average of 14 days for a decision, compared with 29 days for those diagnosed via more conventional techniques. And as well as getting a quicker diagnosis, patients who have undergone EBUS survive for longer. Doctors at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (pictured) are able to start vital treatment much sooner using a single procedure . They survive for 503 days after diagnosis, compared with 312 days for people assessed through more traditional methods. This is probably due to the fact that EBUS can more accurately diagnose the type of cancer involved and therefore the type of treatment needed. Consultant Dr Neal Navani, who has been testing the technique, said the results had been so impressive that he now hoped the procedure would be rolled out across the NHS. ‘EBUS routinely prevents the need for scans, tests and operations and speeds up the route to the correct treatment,’ he says. He adds: ‘The trial showed that the new procedure is quicker and better – it halves the time to the start of treatment at no additional cost.’ BBC political editor Nick Robinson announced that doctors found a tumour on his lung earlier this year . More than 40,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK every year, yet the disease is notoriously difficult to treat as it is often spotted at a late stage. The BBC’s political editor Nick Robinson announced earlier this year that doctors had found a tumour on his lung, and he has since undergone a successful operation to remove the growth. Diagnosing lung cancer can be a challenge – X-rays are not always definitive as it is hard to distinguish between cancer and other lung conditions. A biopsy is the traditional way to check conclusively whether a patient has lung cancer. However, obtaining a tissue sample can be difficult as lung cancer often spreads to the lymph nodes in the chest and these are hard to reach. This means that surgery may be necessary before a doctor can be sure that the disease is present, resulting in a wait for results. The health of many cancer patients can deteriorate because these delays mean they are not started immediately on lifesaving treatments such as chemotherapy. By comparison, the EBUS allows doctors to look directly into the windpipe and breathing tubes, while the ultrasound scanner can check the lymph glands in the centre of the chest for cancer. One patient who received faster treatment thanks to the EBUS technique is retired sales worker Maureen Mullen. The 65-year-old from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, had already had a tumour removed from her lung in September 2013, and underwent a double mastectomy the following March after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Then in June last year, she began to feel breathless while on holiday in Spain. When she returned home to Britain, she was given the devastating news that she had a new lump behind her breastbone. Her doctors could not be sure what type of cancer it was without investigating further, so they recommended she have the pioneering EBUS procedure. ‘They said I was a very sick lady,’ reveals Maureen. ‘My consultant explained the procedure to me and I was taken into the operating theatre and sedated. It was all over so quickly – there were no side effects from the procedure, no dry mouth or sluggishness, and I felt really positive about the whole process.’ The EBUS revealed Maureen had small cell carcinoma, a form of lung cancer that can spread quickly, and she needed a course of chemotherapy immediately. She started treatment the next day, and after six months of chemo, the tumour was gone. ‘The EBUS was brilliantly efficient,’ adds Maureen. ‘By 4pm that day, my cancer had been diagnosed and the appropriate chemotherapy was ordered for me to start the next day. ‘Had I had a traditional biopsy, who knows where I’d be.’","When tumours in lungs are suspected, patients can face a raft of tests .

"Luca Railton, 11, was told he would never walk - but has now taken his first steps unaided . An 11-year-old boy told he would never walk has taken his first steps unaided thanks to pioneering treatment in the US. Luca Railton was born with bones missing from his legs, due to the rare condition bilateral tibial hemimelia. Doctors said the condition - which affects just one in three million people - meant he would to have his right leg amputated or fused straight. But his loved ones refused to accept these grim prospects, which would have left Luca severely disabled for life. Instead, they began desperately trying to find other suitable treatments, and eventually found an American surgeon called Dr Dror Paley, who assured Luca's parents his leg could be saved. Through tireless fundraising, Mr and Mrs Railton managed to raise £135,000 to take their son to the US for surgery. He underwent a series of operations – including one to break his right leg and start lengthening his femur (thigh bone). Now, Luca is walking unaided – without the stints he formerly needed - and can even play cricket and tennis. His mother, Teresa, 43, said: 'From the moment he was born our goal in life has been for him to keep his legs. 'We knew we would do everything in our power for him. Before we went to America, Luca was getting worse. 'He was in pain and reliant on his crutches. It was awful to see. 'We knew we had to raise £135,000 and our friends have been brilliant. We have had amazing donations. But if we hadn't our plan B was to re-mortgage the house.' Luca was born with no shin bone (tibia) and no knee in his right leg, and only a partial shin bone in his left leg. For the first year of his life, every doctor said that his leg would eventually be amputated. But his family discovered a German surgeon called Professor Weber who had been working on Luca's rare problem, and he agreed to come to England to perform a pioneering 10 hour operation on Luca's legs. The surgery was hugely successful and for the next few years, Luca was able to walk on his own and play with other children. Throughout his childhood years, Luca underwent over 60 hours of surgery as doctors tried to rebuild his legs over and over again as he has grew. But in February last year, when Luca was 10, NHS doctors told his parents there was nothing more they could do for him, and recommended he have his leg amputated, or fused straight. But his family refused to give up and combed the medical literature for alternatives, eventually coming across Dr Dror Paley, an orthopaedic surgeon in Florida. He claims to be the most experienced limb lengthening and deformity correction surgeon in the United States as well as internationally. Luca was born with bones missing from his legs, due to the rare condition bilateral tibial hemimelia. At 10-years-old doctors said nothing more could be done for him and he would need to have his leg amputated . Throughout his childhood years, Luca underwent more than 60 hours of surgery as doctors tried to rebuild his legs over and over again as he has grew . Dr Paley said he would be able to save Luca's leg and allow him to walk, so his parents began fundraising more than £100,000 to take their son to the US. They held karaoke night, Zumba night, cake sales, races, sponsored walks and convinced local companies to donate. Setting up social media accounts and a website meant people could donate directly to Luca's cause. They were able to raise the cash and Luca underwent his first lengthy operation on March 27. He then had three more operations between May and November. Each day for several weeks, his parents had to turn struts placed in their son's leg to allow the bone to grow. Since his return, Luca (pictured right with his mother) is now able to walk without crutches, play tennis, cricket and even hopes to drive cars. He is pictured, left, as a baby, after being diagnosed . After nine months, on December 19, Luca and his parents returned to their home near Malmesbury, Wiltshire. Since his return, Luca has made immense progress and over the last week has been able to walk without crutches. But while the Railtons are celebrating Luca's success, the ordeal is not over as he will need further surgery to lengthen his right leg in three years time. The rod inserted in his leg may also be removed and he will require a knee implant. Luca said: 'It's getting easier. It was difficult at times because of the pain. 'The highlight for me was when the frame came off on November 19. And it makes it a lot easier to get dressed in the morning without callipers [stints]. I can wear skinny jeans and I just wear regular shoes now.I can wear skinny jeans and I just wear regular shoes now.","Luca Railton was born with leg bones missing due to a medical condition .

"Patrick Bamford wants to lead the line for Chelsea in the Premier League – but before then he could be leading Middlesbrough to the top-flight after inspiring this vital victory over Wolves. Boro boss Aitor Karanka said before the game that his team had to win all four of their remaining matches to finish in the top two of a claustrophobic Championship. And thanks to Blues loanee Bamford – creator of one for Jelle Vossen and scorer of the other - the Teessiders remain on course for what would be a deserved return to the top division. Patrick Bamford (second right) scored Middlesbrough's second goal as they beat Wolves on Tuesday night . Middlesbrough (4-2-3-1): Konstantopoulos; Kalas, Woodgate (Omeruo 62), Gibson, Friend; Clayton, Forshaw; Adomah (Amorebieta 80), Tomlin, Bamford; Vossen (Nsue 74). Subs not used: Ripley, Whitehead, Ledesma, Kike. Booked: Clayton. Goals: Vossen 3, Bamford 11. Wolverhampton (4-4-1-1): Ikeme; Iorfa, Batth, Stearman, Hause (Golbourne 45); Van La Parra (Jacobs 77), McDonald, Price (Dicko 63), Sako; Edwards; Afobe. Subs not used: Kuszczak, Henry, Doyle, Ebanks-Landell. Booked: Stearman, Batth, Sako, Edwards. Goal: Sako 63. Referee: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire). Attendance: 20,520. Man of the Match: Patrick Bamford. Boro were relegated in 2009 and even the play-offs have been beyond them in the years since. This maximum at least guaranteed post-season participation, but they will want to avoid that scenario. And with the likes of Bamford in this kind of form they have every chance of going up automatically. Friday’s trip to Norwich, however, will go a long way to determining their fate in that respect. Karanka said: ‘We want more than the play-offs and the players showed that here. They were amazing in the first half. But this game demanded a lot of us mentally. We have to be ready for Norwich now, it is another huge game.’ Bamford, with 17, has now scored more league goals in one season than any other Boro player has achieved in the last 25 years. The 21-year-old makes no secret of his desire to one day return to Chelsea and challenge for a starting jersey. Karanka, though, could well be using his friendship with Jose Mourinho to secure another loan stay should they join the West Londoners in the Premier League. ‘For me, he is the best young player in the league. He is scoring goals and is showing he is mature, not just on the pitch but also in the changing-room,’ added the former Real Madrid assistant. Boro were good value for this win – Wolves boss Kenny Jackett called them ‘ruthless’ - and they were ahead inside three minutes. Adam Clayton loaded a ball forward from deep and Bamford gave chase. His presence was enough to unsettle dithering centre-back Richard Stearman and the forward stole in before squaring for the unmarked Vossen who rolled home for his eighth of the season. Bamford celebrates with Jelle Vossen after he teed up the Belgian for Boro's early opener . The goal owed everything to Bamford’s endeavour and he soon had one of his own on 11 minutes. Albert Adomah fed over-lapping right-back Tomas Kalas and he drove into the area before locating the feet of his Chelsea team-mate. Bamford took one touch to fashion a yard for the shot before swivelling and smashing beyond Carl Ikeme from eight yards. It was a classy finish and added to the dossier of evidence which suggests there is a first-team future at Stamford Bridge. Bamford neatly finishes Boro's second to put the home side in cruise control early in the first half . Bamford is mobbed by his team-mates including former England international Jonathan Woodgate (left) Boro continued to pour forward and Adomah came within a stroke of paint of netting a late goal-of-the-season contender. Weaving between two visiting shirts 25 yards from goal, the Ghanaian unleashed a rising drive which cracked the underside of Ikeme’s crossbar. As if Wolves’ task wasn’t stiff enough, they should have been reduced to 10 men when Stearman hauled down Bamford as he skipped clear on goal. That the offence occurred some 40 yards out perhaps spared him red. Boro now have three matches to play as they chase automatic promotion to the Premier League . Middlesbrough . April 17: Norwich (A), April 25: Fulham (A), May 2: Brighton (H). Wolves . April 18: Ipswich (H), April 25: Wigan (A), May 2: Millwall (H). The front-running Kalas wasn’t letting up with his offensive intent and another forward burst presented a chance for Vossen, the Belgian prodding over from 12 yards moments after the restart for the second half. Wolves had offered little at the other end of the park but a swift break brought them to within one on 53 minutes. Dave Edwards galloped through the middle and slipped a pass to Sako who smashed between Konstantopoulos and his near post. And they should have been level when Rajiv van La Parra steamed onto Scott Golbourne’s deep centre and rattled the crossbar with a first-time volley. Boro, though, held on. One down, three to go.

"The Obama administration stepped up its lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill today to try to persuade lawmakers not to pass any legislation that could hamper prospects for negotiating a final deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program. Administration officials as high up the rung as the president himself last week made calls to more than 130 federal lawmakers, urging them to support the deal Secretary of State John Kerry negotiated with Iran, and, at the very least, not to meddle in foreign affairs. The president's spokesman said a two-week break in congressional activity has meant 'that we have not been able to have as many face-to-face conversations as we would like - but that's going to change today.' With the newly returned lawmakers scheduled to tomorrow take the first in a series of votes setting the perimeters for a deal, the White House said administration officials would hold classified briefings with Members of Congress  aimed at 'helping' them understand 'commitments Iran has made so far, and how those commitments we hope will be finalized hopefully in the next two months.' Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama sits with National Security Adviser Susan Rice, left, and Energy Secretary Dr. Ernest Moniz at the start the summit with Caribbean Community last Thursday in Kingston, Jamaica. The trio, along with Secretary of State John Kerry and senior members of the intelligence community are this week lobbying Members of Congress and Jewish community leaders to support the nuclear pact with Iran . OPPOSITION: Senate Foreign Affairs Chairman Bob Corker, pictured here last Friday at the National Rifle Association's annual conference, is whipping support for a bill that would give Congress a say on a potential deal aimed at keeping Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. The White House 'strongly' opposes it . A Senate panel is set to vote tomorrow on an intensely debated bill authored by Senate Foreign Affairs Chairman Bob Corker that would give Congress a say on a potential deal aimed at keeping Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. On the House side, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said today that he will bring the bill to the floor if the Senate acts on legislation giving Congress the power to review any deal. 'It's my intention to bring it to the floor of the House and move it,' McCarthy said at a news conference as Congress was returning from its spring break. Republicans and Democrats maintain that Congress should have a say on an international deal with Tehran to curb its nuclear program and have lined up behind legislation. The White House has pushed back, threatening a presidential veto while warning that the bill could scuttle the delicate talks involving the United States, Iran and five world powers. 'Lines in the sands have moved back,' McCarthy said, claiming the U.S. has back-tracked on some of the demands it had at the beginning of the talks. 'A lot of the questions will be why have they moved back and will Iran ever be able to have the capability of having a nuclear weapon? That's a key question.' Under the bill, Obama could unilaterally lift or ease any sanctions that were imposed on Iran through presidential executive means. But it would prohibit him for 60 days from suspending, waiving or otherwise easing any sanctions that Congress levied on Iran. During that 60-day period, Congress could hold hearings and approve, disapprove or take no action on any final nuclear agreement with Iran. If Congress passed a joint resolution approving a final deal — or took no action — Obama could move ahead to ease sanctions levied by Congress. FIRST STOP: Energy Secretary Moniz, who was a key negotiator in the Iran nuclear deal, speaks to reporters in the White House briefing room last week.  This week administration officials, including Moniz, are holding classified briefings with Members of Congress aimed at 'helping' them understand 'commitments Iran has made so far, and how those commitments we hope will be finalized hopefully in the next two months' On the other hand, if Congress passed a joint resolution disapproving it, Obama would be blocked from providing Iran with any relief from congressional sanctions. The White House has said the president will 'absolutely' veto the Corker legislation if it comes to his desk not just because it would allow Congress to thrust itself into the deal-making process but also because it would require Iran to renounce its terrorist activities. Such a requirement would set up an unreasonable expectation that Iran would neither honor nor agree to, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest has argued, and could push Tehran to further embrace radical elements. 'The way the legislation is currently written is something that we strongly oppose,'  Earnest said today. 'But, again, we continue to have extensive conversations with members of Congress on Capitol Hill.' He later accused members of having their 'priorities backward' and took a shot at House Republicans' ability to whip votes. After a reporter asked him about McCarthy's claim that he is close to achieving a veto-proof majority of support for the bill in the House, Earnest said, 'It's his responsibility to count votes,' then snarked, 'I don't think anybody's battin' 1000 when it comes to countin votes up there.' Secretary of State John Kerry postponed a foreign trip to meet with members of the House to discuss the negotiations. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and senior officials in the intelligence community were also holding classified briefings Monday and Tuesday with members of the House and Senate. Earnest said some Republicans are 'rigidly partisan' and will reject any deal just because President Barack Obama supports it. And while he acknowledged there is some Democratic opposition, administration officials will continue to talk with members of his party, he said. 'I think there are some Democrats who will listen to this pitch,' Earnest said. 'I don't know if it will convince them all, but there is a strong case to make and it's one that we intend to continue making.' On the House side, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said today that he will bring the Corker bill to the floor if the Senate acts on legislation giving Congress the power to review any deal . At the White House, Obama today met with Jewish leaders in a separate attempt to woo their support for the shaky deal that appeared last week to be coming apart at the seams as Iranian leaders indicated that they wouldn't sign an accord unless it included the immediate lifting of nuclear-related sanctions -something the global community has said it cannot and will not agree to. Russia has since went rogue, saying it would begin allowing missiles told be sold to the country in an oil-for-goods swap. Secretary Kerry has spoken to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and raised the U.S.' concerns, Earnest told reporters, but declined to provide additional color on their chat. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is intensely skeptical that international negotiators can reach a verifiable deal with Iran, which has threatened to destroy Israel, while some American Jewish groups have backed the international negotiations. Obama and National Security Adviser Susan Rice are meeting with leaders of Jewish organizations such as the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League, as well as other 'influencers,' the White House. Put another way, the latter meeting will include major Jewish donors that will be key to the Democratic Party holding the White House beyond January of 2017. The administration will attempt to convince them that the deal under discussion is the best way to protect Israel's sovereignty. Iran says its program is for civilian purposes, but the U.S. and its partners negotiating with Tehran suspect it is keen to become a nuclear-armed powerhouse in the Middle East, where it already holds much sway. The bill giving Congress the power of review has led to a political tug of war on Capitol Hill, with Republicans trying to raise the bar so high that a final deal might be impossible, and Democrats aiming to give the White House more room to negotiate with Tehran. Senators of both parties are considering more than 50 amendments to the measure introduced by Corker and Democrat Bob Menendez of New Jersey.","Senate panel is set to vote tomorrow on an intensely debated bill that would give Congress a say on a nuclear pact with Iran .

"A husband has penned a moving essay celebrating his wife and everything she does for their family as a stay-at-home mother. Steven Nelms writes in the essay's introduction that he can't afford his wife to be a stay-at home. 'I don't at all mean to offend anyone with this post,' he writes. 'I'd like to explain exactly what that means so that no one thinks I'm in any way devaluing Stay-At-Home Moms.' Steven Nelms penned a moving essay celebrating his wife and everything she does for their family as a stay-at-home mother to their two-year-old son Ezra . 'On the contrary, I mean that I quite literally cannot afford my wife to be staying at home.' Nelms told the Independent Journal Review that his wife, Glorianna, stays at home with the couple's two-year-old son Ezra because of high child care costs. But Nelms said working has always been a part of Gloriana's life, who had been employed since she was 14 and was contributing to her family's income when she was 17. 'Getting a paycheck was significant part of feeling valued and appreciated for all the hard work she did to provide for herself and help her family,' he sad. So Nelms, from Plano, Texas, decided to write an essay, which was posted on We Are Glory, in which he would break-down the monetary value of everything his wife does to care for the family. 'Yes, my wife is my son’s mother and it is a natural result of being a parent to love and care for your own child,' he writes. 'There is also a very quantifiable dollar amount that can be attributed to the services rendered.' 'I am in no way trying to simplify, objectify, or devalue the priceless love of a mother for her child,' he wrote. 'But let’s be real. Pay day feels good for a reason.

Nelms said that he felt 'ashamed' for every time his wife felt she didn't have 'as much right to our income as I do' and that his income 'doesn't even come close to covering what she does for our family' Nelms estimates that the childcare his wife provides is worth $36,660 a year, the annual-salary for a full-time nanny. He also estimates this his wife does $5,200 worth of cleaning a year, $12,480 of cooking, and $13,520 for buying groceries and running errands. After adding that his wife helps deal with the family's finances and does the laundry, he concludes that his wife's annual salary should be $73,960. 'I would have to make over $100k to even begin to be able to cover my living expenses as well as employ my wife as a Stay-At-Home Mom!' he writes.

Nelms admits in the essay that he has felt 'ashamed' every time he has ever made his wife feel guilty of humored when she has bought something for herself. 'I am ashamed that she has ever felt like she doesn't have just as much right to our income as I do. The fact of the matter is that our income doesn't even come close to covering what she does for our family.' 'She loves me, loves our son, and loves our family, so obviously she isn’t doing any of those things for a paycheck or even for recognition.' 'But it certainly doesn’t hurt to know that as a Stay-At-Home Mom her appraised salary is nearly double my actual income.'

"From the outside, Anand Iyer seemed to have it all. A wife, an adorable two-year-old daughter, and a six-figure salary job with a leading tech company in San Francisco that he loved. But apparently the dream combination is not so perfect. The 36-year-old quit his job to be a house-husband - and now he couldn't be happier. Packed it in: Anand Iyer worked for fashion site Threadflip, but ditched his job to spent time at home . Speaking to Yahoo Parenting, he said: 'I started to ask myself, ""What am I working so hard for? Why are we trying to make our lives so great but aren't investing in time with our child?""' He 'felt terrible' about not seeing his little girl Ava, Iyer said, and struggled to flit between the roles of employee and dad. After working at Microsoft, he moved over to Threadflip to be their chief product officer. Though he had pushed himself to get there, he realized it might not be the goal he was aiming for. 'I wasn’t spending any time with her in the evening,' Iyer told the site. The playground, he told Yahoo, was the worst. 'I would look down at my phone a lot because I didn’t know how to socialize there. 'I didn’t know what to say. But I’m slowly starting to make my way into that circle. It’s about being there over and over again, I think. And now that I’ve done this a few times, and I’m recognizing people in the neighborhood, it’s gotten better.' So in January, he handed in his notice. Alongside Iyer's savings, his wife Shreya, 34, is supporting the family with her job as a recruitment manager at data analytics firm Splunk. He concedes that it feels uneasy at times: 'I've had occasional sleepless nights over our finances. 'But the reality is that I’m fortunate that I’ve been working nonstop for a long time so it wasn’t as difficult a transition for us financially as it could have been.' Iyer is part of a growing faction of men who are subverting the traditional parental set-up to spend more time with their children. According to a recent study by Pew Research, 46 per cent of fathers are dissatisfied with the amount of time they spend with their children. Though he may consider working part-time when Ava starts school, he has vowed to make sure she remains his focus. 'Seeing Ava grow from little girl to a big girl is so rewarding and I can’t say that I would have seen it this way if I’d been working all day, every day,' he told Yahoo. 'From that lens, if we can live like this a while, it’ll be totally worth it. It already think it is.'","Anand Iyer, 36, was earning six figures at Threadflip in San Francisco .

"Defiant Nigel Farage today insisted he did not 'lose my rag' after rounding on the audience of a live TV debate for being too left wing. The Ukip leader was booed by voters at Westminster's Methodist Central Hall as he faced claims he blamed all of Britain's problems on migrants. Pollster ICM, which was hired by the BBC to select the audience members, today defended its process 'using random location selection techniques'. Nigel Farage today insisted he did not 'lose my rag' after rounding on the audience of a live TV debate for being too left wing . Mr Farage, pictured today, risked alienating those watching at Westminster's Central Hall in London as he protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC' The BBC stressed that the audience was carefully selected by an process, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process. Asked whether he had lost his temper, Mr Farage told the BBC News Channel: 'I was very calm about it. I didn't lose my rag.' He said his protest had been sparked by the hostile audience reaction to his argument that high levels of immigration were increasing pressure on the housing market, something he said would be accepted by 'most rational people'. And he added: 'This is not the first time I've seen this. The night of the by-election that Douglas Carswell won in Clacton with a landslide, there was a Ukip representative - Patrick O'Flynn - on Question Time in Clacton and the audience were deeply hostile to him.' Asked if he blamed the BBC, Mr Farage said: 'Sometimes these things go wrong, sometimes you get groups who apply to be on programmes who perhaps aren't as truthful on their applications as they could be. 'In this case, the BBC gave the job to a polling company called ICM who are famous for getting everything about Ukip wrong and that I think was the mistake. 'Am I going to make a complaint? I've got an election to fight. What matters isn't the 200 people in the room, what really matters are the millions of people watching on television.' Mr Farage's outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching . Independent pollsters ICM were hired by the BBC to select the audience of around 250 people. After facing stiff criticism from Ukip, the firm today released a statement on how it chose the audience members. They were selected from a 20-mile radius of the venue in Westminster. The region was broken up into 30 small areas, and at least 8 people were chosen from each area. Each person was selected to reflect the 'composition of the UK population by gender, age, ethnicity, and social grade, and political protocols that reflected the balance as agreed between the broadcasters and the political parties', ICM said. A fifth of the people declared themselves to be 'undecided voters'. A 'small number' of SNP and Plaid Cymru supporters were brought in from Scotland and Wales. ICM added: 'The recruitment approach replicated those used by ICM at all the 2010 leader debates, both the Clegg vs Farage debates last year, and the recent ITV debate.' Mr Farage was widely considered to have won the debates against Nick Clegg last year, after which the Ukip leader made no complaint about the audience composition. Last night saw five opposition party leaders go head-to-head in a 90-minute live TV debate. Mr Farage appeared alongside Labour's Ed Miliband, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Green Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. During the earlier exchanges, the leaders on Mr Farage for his anti-immigration policies, attracting applause from the audience. Mr Farage was taken aback, and attacked a 'total lack of comprehension' from those watching and protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC'. His outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching. Mr Farage warned that foreigners arriving in the UK 'has directly contributed to the housing crisis'. But he came under fire for linking all of the countries problems to immigration. Green party leader Natalie Bennett took a swipe at Mr Farage: 'There is someone here on this platform who wants to totally demonise migrants and you know who I mean.' She hit back at claims migrants are causing a crisis in the health service: 'One in four doctors is foreign born, 40 per cent of NHS staff are foreign born. Mr Miliband said told Mr Farage: 'You abuse immigrants and those with HIV and then you complain that Ukip is being abused.' Miss Sturgeon won loud applause as she urged Mr Farage to 'put the bogeyman to one side'. She told him: 'We have a housing crisis across this country. You know what, Nigel Farage? It isn't caused by immigrants. In your world every problem is caused by immigrants.' But Mr Farage claimed the audience was biased against him: 'There just seems to be a total lack of comprehension on this panel, and indeed amongst this audience, which is a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC.' Mr Farage was heckled by members of the audience before David Dimbleby, who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say: 'Nigel, let me just say one thing. 'This is an audience that has been carefully chosen not by the BBC, but by an independent polling organisation to represent the balance between all parties.' Labour leader Ed Miliband gave the Ukip leader the advice: 'It's never a great idea to attack the audience, Nigel, in my opinion.' But Mr Farage retorted: 'The real audience are sitting at home.' Explanation: Mr Farage was heckled before David Dimbleby (pictured), who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say how the audience had been chosen . The BBC insists the audience was carefully selected by an independent pollster, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process . Unimpressed: Ukip voter Mike Cripps, 44 . A Ukip voter has insisted he is having second thoughts about backing the party after Nigel Farage attacked the studio audience. Security worker Mike Cripps, 44, of Bromley, south-east London, believed the Ukip leader had 'done a couple of stupid things'. The first was his comment on the audience and the second was raising his views on people with HIV visiting the UK for NHS treatment, Mr Cripps said. Asked if Mr Farage's remarks had put him off supporting Ukip, Mr Cripps said: 'It did a bit, yeah. I don't think he put himself across right. 'If we're just talking about the debate tonight - it's what we should be talking about, not what he's done six years ago or two years ago or yesterday - for me, Nicola Sturgeon was the best. 'She was slick, she was well prepared, she had been well briefed, that's my personal opinion. Ed Miliband - it was like he was reading off a script.' The BBC insisted the audience had been chosen by an independent polling organisation to reflect the supporters of all parties - not just those represented by their leaders last night. A spokesman for the corporation told MailOnline yesterday: 'ICM recruited an audience to give a cross section of political opinion.' ICM, a public opinion research company founded in 1989, was unavailable for comment last night. Ukip meanwhile was said to be pressing for an inquiry into how the audience was chosen. Asked after the debate about Mr Farage's criticism of the audience, Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'I am not sure whether we will complain. All I will say is I didn't think the audience was representative of the views of British people. 'I think Nigel Farage would have done very well with people sitting at home.' Mr Nuttall said he had spoken about things which had happened to him on Question Time, telling reporters: 'Who knows, may be some people are being disingenuous on their application forms.' Asked if adopting an attack on the audience was an easy get out clause for dismissing opposition to Ukip's views, he added: 'Oh no. People at home agree with us and that's what really matters - the millions of people at home watching this. 'We know, for example, on immigration, on the European Union they agree with where Ukip stands. What the audience in here really think is, I suppose, irrelevant.' Tweeting during the debate, Lord Ashcroft said: 'A minority view once again. Nigel Farage having a go at the BBC audience may well appeal to the viewers whose vote he is targeting.' And Sky News presenter Kay Burley tweeted: 'Farage having a pop at balance of audience. Dodgy ground there. Broadcasters jump through hoops to make sure studio is fair.' As the end credits rolled following the BBC debate last night, four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but Mr Farage just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand. As Miss Bennett and Miss Wood walked away, Miss Sturgeon then went to shake Mr Farage's hand - and Mr Miliband offered the Ukip leader a pat on the back. Then, all of the leaders went to the audience to shake their hands - with the exception, again, of Mr Farage. He shook hands with Mr Dimbleby before leaving without going up to the audience.

"An Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto was forced to divert to Shannon Airport in Ireland last night after an 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board. The pensioner, who was travelling in First Class on board the Boeing 777-300 jet, was allegedly restrained by cabin crew until the plane was forced into the unplanned landing. The flight crew alerted the pilot, who put a call in to the Irish Aviation Authority’s (IAA) North Atlantic Communications Service centre at Ballygirreen in Co Clare, who advised to land at Shannon. An 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board an Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto that forced a diversion to Shannon Airport . On touching down at around 8.15pm local time, Gardaí­ and airport police officers were standing by, and the woman was taken into custody. MailOnline Travel have been advised by Irish police that the woman has since been released without charge, and she will be undergoing a 'fit-to-fly- screening in the hope of continuing her journey. There is no indication from the police as to the actions of the woman on board at this time. The decision was taken to divert when the Air Canada flight ACA-877 was around 600 miles north west of Shannon, and the plane, carrying 211 passengers, turned around. The Irish Times report that 'airport emergency services were standing by at strategic locations along the runway so that they could follow the aircraft once it had landed.' On touching down at Shannon Airport, the elderly woman was met by Irish police and taken into custody . As expected with unscheduled landings, the plane was forced to dump fuel in advance of the descent over the Atlantic. A spokesperson for Air Canada told MailOnline Travel: 'Our flight, AC877 on Friday, April 10, Frankfurt to Toronto, diverted to Shannon due to a disruptive passenger, who was removed from the aircraft. 'It was a B777 with 211 passengers. It subsequently departed and completed its journey.'","Air Canada flight ACA-877 set out from Frankfurt Airport, Germany .

"Four very terrified puppies strapped in a cage to the roof of a van moving on the freeway were rescued after dozens of concerned drivers called 911 and police pulled over the car. Wendell Steiner, his wife, and their four children were stopped by police in Akron, Ohio during their 300-mile journey from Nova, Ohio to Pennsylvania. Although Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts and not the Buckeye State, the former presidential candidate famously came under fire during his 2012 run for the White House after it was revealed he once drove for 12 hours with his Irish Setter Seamus on top of his car in a carrier. Scroll down for video . Four very terrified puppies strapped in a cage to the roof of a van moving on the freeway were rescued after dozens of concerned drivers called 911 and police pulled over the car . Wendell Steiner, his wife, and their four children were stopped by police in Akron, Ohio during their 300-mile journey from Nova, Ohio to Pennsylvania . Mitt Romney (left)  came under fire when it was revealed he once drove for 12 hours with his dog on his car . Steiner's mixed-breed puppies were wind-battered and huddled together in the cage when they were rescued, but had no injuries, according to Sgt. Kris Beitzel. 'I didn't see any injuries. They would not leave each other,' she told WKYC. 'They had urinated all over the inside of the cage. When I tried to get them out, they were trying to crawl back in.' The cage was covered on three sides with a blanket but its rear was left exposed. Beitzel said that when she asked the father why the dogs were not riding in the car as well, he responded that there wasn't room because he had 'far more important things to put in the car, meaning his children'. Steiner told police the puppies belong to his father, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. He said they were transporting the dogs to his wife's family in Pennsylvania because his father could no longer keep them. Akron Police Sgt Kris Beitzel (left) tended to the four dogs in the cage while the two sisters closely kept watch . Beitzel said the Mennonite family 'had no idea what they were doing was wrong'. 'They couldn't understand what all the tension was about,' she told Buzzfeed. 'In that culture they just look at puppies as livestock. They don't look at them as pets the way we do.' The family, who said they had no idea it was illegal to transport animals on top of a moving vehicle, were let go with a warning. 'If I had known, I'd never agree to it,' Steiner told the Akon Beacon Journal. 'I would have kept them in Nova.' The family handed the puppies over to the police, and Beitzel said she believes the 'traumatized' puppies will come around 'with a little love and attention'. He said they were transporting the dogs to his wife's family in Pennsylvania because his father could no longer keep them . During the lead up to the election, a Dogs Against Romney Facebook group was created and he was mocked . The mixed-breed puppies were wind-battered and huddled together in the cage when they were rescued, but had no injuries . The puppies were taken to a local veterinarian hospital to be examined and will be placed with the Human Society of Great Akron to be put up for adoption. Romney's revelation about his 1983 vacation was an issue during his 2008 presidential campaign as well, but it was a much bigger issue for him in 2012. During the lead up to the election, a Dogs Against Romney Facebook group was created, 'Dogs Aren't Luggage' T-shirts were sold and Romney was lampooned by late-night hosts about the story on a nightly basis. Democratic strategist Chris Lehane told the Washington Post in 2012: '“It’s a signifier. 'There are certain events that happen over the course of someone’s life that play into a larger story line and feed into a caricature.

"After decades of snapping at the heels of rival Marks & Spencer, Next has overtaken the company on profits. And now the High Street giant appears to have come up with a foolproof plan for staying in the lead when it comes to womenswear. Britain's biggest fashion retailer has an impressive line in designer copies selling for a fraction of the price of the big labels. So if you love the Mulberry Bayswater tote, but wince at the eye-watering price tag, you can pick up a looky-likey from Next. Or if you fancy yourself in a Victoria Beckham-style armband shift dress, but wouldn't remortgage your home to pay for it, the Next version could be just the ticket. Scroll down for video . VICTORIA BECKHAM had a hit with this armband shift dress (victoria beckham.com). Next's compact cut-out shoulder dress is a fraction of the price . And it's not just designer clothes that the company is expert at emulating. It also does its own versions of high-end homeware that won't break the bank. Karen Kay, fashion and retail commentator, says one of Next's greatest strengths is identifying catwalk trends that will appeal to its target market: mothers aged 30 and over and women starting out in their careers. 'A perfect example is the Next tan washed saddle bag, which is very like the Chloe satchel,' says Karen. 'It's a classic shape that's also fashionable, a good combination for Next customers looking for grown up-style. 'What they don't do, unlike shops appealing to younger women, such as Zara and Topshop, is copy one-season wonders. 'Next customers are not looking for high fashion, but clothes to wear to an interview or at the office, and they have a much better line in these, including their designer copies, than Marks & Spencer.' THE Lot78 jacket (net-a-porter.com) is lamb's leather, while Next's cropped PU biker is made from viscose, polyester and cotton, hence the £700 price difference . A MULBERRY Bayswater tote (selfridges.com) is made from top quality leather, but at a saving of £900, Next's polyurethane bag is a dead ringer . It takes three to four months for designs on the catwalk to appear, in some shape or form, in Next. Zara and Topshop - whose younger customers are eager to get their hands on high fashion - have an even quicker turnaround of three to four weeks. Designer copycats have become a huge retail strategy in recent years, because while what appeared on the catwalk used to be kept under wraps until it arrived in the shops, now the runway attracts wide coverage, including online, and people expect to see versions on the High Street. And these great lines in designer lookalikes go some way towards explaining how Next reported a rise in annual profits of 12 per cent, to £695 million, last year and a further 12.5 per cent over the past 12 months, with profits totalling £782 million. The company is worth £11 billion, making it second only to Tesco in the retail sector. That's impressive in a market that includes 'pile-'em-high, sell-'em-cheap' stores such as Primark and H&M. But, says Karen Kay, older shoppers will pay more for the better-quality stitching, buttons and linings at Next. As well as 500 stores in Britain and Ireland, and 200 overseas, a substantial proportion of Next's turnover comes from online and catalogue sales. CHLOE'S medium Marcie satchel (harrods.co.uk) may have inspired Next's much cheaper washed saddle bag . Besides its designer copies, shopping online at Next provides almost instant gratification, as items ordered before 11pm are guaranteed for delivery the next day. Combined with an easy returns service - items can be collected from your home by a courier - this means that if you fancy yourself in a Stella McCartney-style lace dress, but fear it may not flatter your thighs, you can try one on at home with minimal hassle, then get the chain to take it back if you're not satisfied. Last year, Next began selling designer labels, including DKNY and Dolce & Gabbana, alongside its own brands, online and in the Next Directory. And this innovation, says Karen, may have fuelled the company's appetite for designer copies even further. 'Customers no doubt drool over a Joseph dress or Karl Lagerfeld blouse in the designer section, then spot something with the same sort of detail for a third of the price by Next's own label and decide to give that a go,' says Karen. 'The only note of caution I would sound is that Next fabrics can be disappointing, as they use a lot of synthetics such as viscose and polyester - though this, of course, keeps the costs down.'

"The Great Dying, which struck the Earth 252 million years ago, wiped out more than 96 per cent of the world's creatures. And while extreme volcanic eruptions are commonly blamed for triggering the event, research has found the majority of species on the planet were ultimately killed when the oceans became more acidic. In particular, they claim the volcanic eruptions released huge amounts of carbon dioxide which were absorbed into the oceans and changed their chemical compositions. The Great Dying, which struck the Earth 252 million years ago, wiped out more than 96% of the world's creatures. And while extreme volcanic eruptions are commonly blamed for triggering the event, research has found the majority of species on the planet were ultimately killed when the oceans became more acidic . The study, led by the University of Edinburgh, is the first to show that highly acidic oceans were to blame. And the researchers said that the amount of carbon added to the atmosphere to trigger the mass extinction was 'probably greater than today's fossil fuel reserves'. The Great Dying, also known as the Permian-Triassic Boundary extinction, took place over a 60,000-year period, and acidification of the oceans lasted for around 10,000 years. At this time, a single supercontinent called Pangaea covered the Earth. This huge landmass created extremely arid conditions and by the Late Permian, temperatures were at an all time high. These extreme temperatures already threatened many land and marine species, but this was made worse when large volcanic eruptions began to take place. Huge volumes of viscous basalt lava covered an area roughly seven times the size of France, explained the Natural History Museum, and sulphur dioxide from these eruptions caused vinegar-like acid rain to cover the Earth. During the Great Dying, a supercontinent called Pangaea covered the Earth. This landmass (illustrated) created hot and dry conditions .

Huge volumes of viscous basalt lava covered an area roughly seven times the size of France, explained the Natural History Museum, and sulphur dioxide from these eruptions caused vinegar-like acid rain to cover the Earth. As carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere, global temperatures soared and this caused oceans to get hotter. This also caused a lack of oxygen in the world's waters, killing off marine life and destroying food chains. But it was the acidification of the oceans that was the driving force behind the deadliest phase of the extinction, which dealt a final blow to an already unstable ecosystem, the Scottish researchers said. Researchers believe this acidification  lasted for around 10,000 years. As carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere, global temperatures soared and this caused oceans to get hotter. This also caused a lack of oxygen in the world's waters, killing off marine life and destroying food chains. But it was the acidification of the oceans that was the driving force behind the deadliest phase of the extinction, which dealt a final blow to an already unstable ecosystem, the Scottish researchers said. Oceans can absorb some carbon dioxide, but the large volume released - at such a fast rate - changed their chemistry. To make these conclusions, a team led by Dr Matthew Clarkson and Professor Rachel Wood analysed rocks in the United Arab Emirates (pictured) - which were on the ocean floor at the time of the extinction. From this they developed a climate model because the rocks preserve a detailed record of changing oceanic conditions . Similar analysis in Italy found evidence of vinegar-like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in 250 million-year-old rocks. The rocks were found to contain vanillin (shown) which is usually broken down by bacteria. This proved acid in the rocks protected the vanillin, as its low pH deactivated the destructive enzymes . To make these conclusions, a team led by Dr Matthew Clarkson and Professor Rachel Wood analysed rocks in the United Arab Emirates - which were on the ocean floor at the time - to develop a climate model to work out what drove the extinction. A huge impact event has been suggested as a possible cause of the mass extinction, based on the examination of grains of 'shocked quartz' and meteorite fragments in Antarctica, but no impact site has been found. One of the attractions of the theory is that it could have triggered other causes such as the Siberian Traps eruptions. Widespread ocean anoxia - a severe deficiency of oxygen - has also been blamed for the event in the Late Permian to the Early Triassic. The spread of toxic, oxygen-depleted water would have been devastating for marine life, producing widespread die-offs. Models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia - the presence of hydrogen sulphide - would have been closely associated with high levels of carbon dioxide, which suggests a combination of gases acted as a killing mechanism. The rocks preserve a detailed record of changing oceanic conditions at the time. 'Scientists have long suspected that an ocean acidification event occurred during the greatest mass extinction of all time, but direct evidence has been lacking until now,' said Dr Clarkson from the University of Edinburgh's school of geosciences. 'This is a worrying finding, considering that we can already see an increase in ocean acidity today that is the result of human carbon emissions.' The study is published in the journal Science and was carried out in collaboration with the University of Bremen, University of Exeter and the Universities of Graz, Leeds, and Cambridge. And the findings are now helping scientists understand the threat posed to marine life by modern-day ocean acidification. Dr Clarkson's research follows similar analysis  in Italy earlier this year by geologists from Imperial College London (ICL). They discovered evidence of vinegar-like acid rain caused by the sulphur dioxide in 250 million-year-old rocks from Italy's Vigo Meano region. 'For the first time, we can say that soils from this time had an acidity similar to that of vinegar,' Mark Sephton from ICL said. The Vigo Meano rocks contained vanillin - the substance that gives vanilla its distinct taste and flavour - and this was a surprise because vanillin is typically broken down by bacteria. In an attempt to explain how vanillin could exist in the rocks for so long, the researchers turned to the dairy industry, which sometimes uses vanilla in milk. Scientists recently used satellite data to map the alkalinity of the world's oceans for the first time. The image above shows the average level of alkalinity over the past five years with blue marking water that is more acidic. By using satellite data, scientists can obtain live information as the ocean changes . Acidifying the milk protects vanillin as the low pH deactivates the enzymes that would break it down. The same can be said for vanillin in ancient rock. 'Our data fits the idea that acid rain caused the microbes to cease functioning,' said Henk Visscher, a palaeoecologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. The findings follow a similar study in 2013 by US scientists who simulated the Great Dying. The MIT researchers found that sulphur emissions from massive volcano eruptions were significant enough to create extremely acidic rain, which would have affected plant growth. They believe such acidity may have been sufficient to disfigure plants and stunt their growth, contributing to their ultimate extinction. After the eruptions ended, the researchers found believe pH levels in rain bounced back, becoming less acidic within one year. Meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on Earth . Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82 to 88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, although it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79 to 87 per cent of all species. Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species.","Geologists studied rocks in the United Arab Emirates that would have been on the ocean floor during the Great Dying 252 million years ago .

"A mother whose two sons were mutilated by Boston bombers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev has said it is 'way too soon' for Mark Wahlberg to be turning the atrocity that maimed her family into a movie. Liz Norden's adult sons, JP and Paul, each lost their right leg when they were hit by the explosive mix of shrapnel and ball-bearings unleashing by the Tsarnaevs' primitive explosives in April 2013. The men, now in their mid-thirties, were received horrific wounds as they shielded friends from the second of two blasts which went off by the finish line at the Boston Marathon almost two years ago. Scroll down for video . 'Way too soon': Liz Norden, right, whose sons JP and Paul each lost a leg in the Boston bombings, has said a planned film by Mark Wahlberg, left, dramatizing the bombings is premature . Real life: Pictured are Norden's adult sons, Paul, left, and JP, right. They each lost their right leg when Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev detonated bombs by the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon . In response to the news that Boston-born celebrity Wahlberg is teaming up with CBS to make a feature film from the most harrowing day of her life, Norden pointed out that for many the pain is still visceral and real. She said: 'I don't think that could ever be re-created. I've sat in the courtroom with survivors and family members and seen what everybody is going through. 'It's been two years... but people who live it day in and day out, their lives are just coming back somewhat. 'For people dealing with putting legs on every day or people who lost loved ones, that doesn't go away.' JP and Paul, who both use prosthetic legs, now help run a charity alongside their mother dedicated to helping fellow amputees. Blast: Explosions at the 2013 Boston Marahton are pictured in the above security footage, released by fedreal prosecutors . Together: Liz is pictured above with her two sons, who now use prosthetic legs and are said to be living a relatively normal life again . At a recent fundraiser covered by local station WCVB, JP said he has now recovered enough to live a relatively normal life. He said: 'I'm starting to work and doing things as usual - I'm getting married in October. So I'm great.' However, the victims of the attack still contend daily with the toll taken on their lives by the fanatical brothers. Tamerlan, the elder Tsarnaev, was killed in a firefight not long after the attack. Dzhokhar was captured, and last week was convicted of all 30 charges leveled against him in connection with the bombing. Guilty: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, pictured left in an FBI handout photo and right in a courtroom sketch, was found guilty on 30 separate charges related to the bombing, 18 of which can carry the death penalty . More than half of those charges can be punished by death, and he is due to be sentenced in the coming weeks. JP and Paul have both declined to say whether they think Tsarnaev should be put to death, though their mother has said that he should be. Wahlberg announced his film, which will be called Patriot's Day, in the middle of the highly-publicized trial. CBS Films said the movie will be based on a firsthand account from former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis of the investigation and massive manhunt for the Tsarnaevs. After the announcements other Boston residents weighed in. Eileen McNamara, a former Boston Globe columnist, said: 'How does someone who markets himself as ""a Boston guy"" not see that it is far too soon, that the city is still far too sad for its trauma to be transformed into mass entertainment?' Charlie Wilder of Boston.com also weighed in, saying: 'The trial has served as almost a movie of the events itself, making the concurrent announcement of a fictionalized portrayal feel unnecessary and inappropriate. 'Maybe one day, even someday relatively soon after the trial, turning the events into a film worthy of the story would help the healing and honor the lives of those affected. 'But for now, Wahlberg — who plays up his Boston roots whenever he gets the chance — picked the wrong time to break the news.' Wahlberg's representatives did not return calls and emails seeking comment.","Liz Norden, whose sons Paul and JP each lost right leg, blasted plan .

"Hillary Clinton’s security detail arrived at a suburban Des Moines, Iowa fruit processing company on Tuesday with an added vehicle – a second Scooby. After her signature oversize black Chevy conversion van dropped her off at Capitol Fruit Company in Norwalk, Iowa, a visually identical GMC van drove up to the building with a nearly identical Secret Service escort vehicle. Both armored vehicles have raised roofs, deep-tinted windows and New York license plates. But while the original van – the one nicknamed 'Scooby' after the Scooby-Doo cartoon show – sports a mustard-yellow New York tag, the second has blue and white plates of a different design. Scroll down for video . WHY BUY ONE WHEN YOU CAN HAVE TWO AT TWICE THE PRICE? The first picture of both of Hillary Clinton's Scooby mobiles.

Clinton (right), a Democratic presidential hopeful and former secretary of state, posed for selfies with fans after meeting with members of the Iowa State legislature at the State Capital on Wednesday . It’s common for U.S. Secret Service to employ 'decoy' vehicles, identical in design, in order to inject some mystery into VIPs' travel plans, if for no other reason than to confuse and discourage would-be attackers. When President Barack Obama returns to the White House after long trips, his arrival on the Marine One helicopter can be a shell-game exercise when three identical choppers appear on the horizon. Only one, of course, lands on the South Lawn. A Secret Service spokesperson said the agency does not comment on security arrangements for dignitaries. FLASHERS: 'Scooby-two' forced an Iowa motorist to leave the roadway on Wednesday so it could go through a red light and rejoin the caravan . Mrs. Clinton enjoys constant protection at taxpayers' expense because she is part of a former first family, not as a result of her service in the U.S. Senate or the State Department. But at some point during presidential campaigns, front-runner status generally attracts Secret Service as a candidate’s profile is elevated and crowd sizes swell. On Wednesday, the two Scooby vans arrived at Clinton's appointed location separately, but left together in a seven-car motorcade.

"Crystal clear waters have revealed a number of haunting hulls belonging to ships that succumbed to the perils of Lake Michigan over the centuries. The unusual transparency has been caused by surface ice melting, unveiling the boat graveyard at the bottom of the Great Lake, before organisms like plankton conceal them once more. The soul-stirring images were snapped during a routine helicopter patrol by the U.S. Coast Guard, who had a perfect view of normally obscured wreckage in an area where many ships foundered in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Scroll down for video . Revealed: The 121-foot brig of the James McBride, which ran aground during a storm on October 19, 1857, has been revealed following ice-melt in Lake Michigan . Rising Sun: The 133 foot long wooden steamer stranded just north of Pyramid Point on October 29, 1917, and can be seen on the bottom of the Great Lake . Glory days: The Rising Sun was owned by a religious group called the House of David when it crashed in October 1917. Members of the group were returning from High Island, where they spend the summer, when it crashed in a sudden snowstorm . Graveyard: The above map shows the Manitou Passage of Lake Michigan, which is home to dozens of shipwrecks due to the unpredictable weather on the lake. The wrecks of the James McBride and Rising Sun were exposed this month after ice melted on the lake . Unpredictable weather makes Lake Michigan home to some of the most dangerous waters in the world with sudden storms, fire, and fog causing the destruction of these many thousands of vessels over the years. The pictures are taken of the shallow waters of the lake off the Leelanau Peninsula near Leland, known as the Manitou Passage, between the mainland of the northwestern Lower Peninsula and North and South Manitou Islands. This area alone is home to dozens of shipwrecks, most which were grounded shipping lumber at the turn of the 20th century. The Coast Guard wasn’t immediately able to identify the wrecks, but with help from fans on Facebook, they learned that two of them are the James McBride and the Rising Sun. The 121-foot brig James McBride ran aground during a storm on October 19, 1857. Her remains now lie in 15 feet of water near Sleeping Bear Point. The James McBride is believed to be the first ship to haul cargo from the West Indies all the way back to Chicago, when it completed a trip to Turk Island for salt in 1848, stopping at Nova Scotia on the way back for cod. Eerie: This unknown wreck was captured by the US Coast Guard from a helicopter during a routine patrol over the Great Lake . Rare sightings: Two wrecks can just be seen (top left and bottom right of picture) through the clear waters of Lake Michigan . Stunning scenery: A house can be seen on the edge of the lake which endures unpredictable weather and is home to some of the most dangerous waters in the world . It launched on April fool’s day in 1848 and sank nine years later after carrying a cargo of wood from the Manitou Islands. The Rising Sun was a 133-foot-long wooden steamer which stranded just north of Pyramid Point on October 29, 1917, because of an early snow storm. Lifeboats were scrambled and all 32 people on board were saved but she went to pieces. Her wreckage now rests in about 12 feet of water. The Rising Sun was actually first named the Minnie M, but it was renamed the Rising Sun when it was purchased by a religious group called the House of David in 1913. The commune was founded by Benjamin and Mary Purnell in Benton Harbor, Michigan in 1903. Benjamin claimed to be the younger brother of Jesus, and his group of about 900 followers called him King Ben. During the summer, the group lived on High Island - located about thirty miles northwest of Charlevoix, Michigan. In October 1917, Captain Charles Morrison was taking  passengers and crew members from the group back to Benton Harbor where they would spend the winter when a sudden snowstorm hit. The captain tried to make Charlevoix, but the ship pushed west into the Manitou Passage where it crashed into a set of submerged boulders. Everyone on board survived the crash, escaping on two sets of lifeboats. Protected: The wrecks of the stricken vessels are protected by law to stop divers trying to salvage anything from the sunken history . The U.S Park Service, which manages the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, announced last month that the wreckage of the Jennie & Annie was now visible again on the beach halfway between North and South Bar lakes. The schooner grounded off Empire in 1872 and is visible every few years. Beach erosion, waves, wind and variable water levels in the lake cause the wrecks to periodically become visible along the dunes shoreline. Since the shipwrecks are considered public property, they are not allowed to be disturbed. However, divers are allowed to explore the wrecks in warmer weather.

"Julie McKenzie thought scoliosis was the cause of her bad back . Julie McKenzie was assured by her GP that her nagging back pain was down to a mild curvature of the spine. She'd gone to see him three months after suddenly developing back problems and had been referred for X-rays. These revealed that her spine was slightly curved, a condition known as scoliosis. 'My GP said that as far as he was concerned, my pain was the result of the scoliosis and that I should try Pilates to build up my muscle strength'. But Julie, 53, felt there was more to it - she'd always been strong and active until the pain began in the spring of 2013. As she explains: 'I'd been doing a lot of gardening, and noticed my lower back ached afterwards,' she says. 'At first a hot bath would sort it out, but as the months passed I found the aching was bad after strenuous activity, such as DIY, and didn't go away after a bath any more.' Painkillers were of little help. 'If I made a sudden movement, I'd experience a sharp, pinching pain in my lower spine that would take my breath away and force me to stop whatever I was doing.' A month after seeing her GP, and feeling increasingly desperate, Julie, an administrator, who is divorced with two grown-up children, and lives in Bushey, Herts, used her private medical cover to see a spinal surgeon, Robert Lee. The consultant ordered an MRI scan, which showed that she did have some scoliosis and her discs had signs of wear and tear, suggesting arthritis. But crucially the radiographer spotted that Julie's coccyx - the bone at the tail of the spine - was slightly enlarged. It contained a tumour. Cases like Julie's are why some experts feel that too often back pain is written off as something that is to be endured, rather than investigated. 'Eighty per cent of people will experience an episode of severe back pain in their lifetime - but only 8 per cent of these go on to suffer chronic pain,' says Peter Hamlyn, a neurosurgeon at University College Hospital London and the Spine Surgery London. 'Many of these chronic sufferers are simply dismissed as having 'non-specific low back pain'. 'That term needs to be abandoned and early referral for investigation and diagnosis-based treatment should instead become the norm.' Back pain is 'very often under-investigated', adds surgeon Robert Lee, of the Spire Hospital in Bushey. 'This means that treatable conditions such as disc prolapses, osteoporotic fractures, deformity, infection and tumours can be missed.' She sought a second opinion from a private surgeon, who sent her for an MRI scan . He adds: 'Most back pain is the result of muscular strains, and is short-lived.'As long as there are no 'red flag' symptoms - such as numbness around the groin and difficulties passing urine or with your bowels - then painkillers and physiotherapy are good approaches. 'However, an MRI should be offered when back pain goes on for eight weeks or more so that you know what you are dealing with and can treat this accordingly.' For instance, arthritis may be relieved with a simple painkilling spinal injection. If the pain is being caused by a nerve being compressed, treatment may involve surgery. Around 1,000 people a year are diagnosed with tumours - benign or malignant - that start in the spine. In many cases, a growth on the spine will be a benign notochordal tumour. These are made of tissue left over from embyronic cells which help form a baby's spinal cord. By the time a baby is born, these cells should have disappeared - if they remain, and nobody knows why this happens, they can develop into tumours. It's estimated that 14 per cent of people have this kind of benign tumour on their spine and, in most, these are harmless. Much more rarely, spinal tumours are malignant. Sometimes these are secondary to cancer elsewhere in the body, particularly breast, brain or pancreatic cancer. Cancer cells often go to the bones with the greatest blood supply, which includes the spine. These, too, can cause back pain. Less commonly, the problem is a malignant tumour called a chordoma that originates in the spine. Typically, they occur in adults between ages 40 and 70, and often they are detected late - patients live on average just six years after diagnosis. A very observant radiologist spotted a tumour, which was removed . Chordomas can occur anywhere along the spine, and the later symptoms such as back pain, numbness, aching and tingling can be mistaken for more minor strains or disc problems. As they get bigger, they may also cause changes in bowel and bladder function, and weakness of the arms and legs. In up to 40 per cent of patients they spread to the lungs, liver, bones, and skin. Although it was apparent from her MRI that Julie had a tumour, it was impossible to tell if it was cancerous or benign. The only options were to remove the entire coccyx, or leave the tumour and scan every few months to see if it grew. Mr Lee recommended removing it. 'The coccyx isn't a necessary part of our anatomy. In fact, it's simply the remains of a tail from an earlier stage in our evolution,' he says. Julie had her operation in October 2013. Her coccyx was removed, complete with the 2cm tumour inside it. The tumour was sent for testing and was found to be malignant. However, it was surrounded by healthy tissue within the bone, which meant it had not spread. 'I asked Mr Lee to tell me the results over the phone,' Julie recalls. 'I didn't know what to feel as I was in the very strange position of not actually knowing I had cancer until I was cured.' Following the surgery, sitting hurt so much that Julie was off work for six weeks. She now has a three-inch scar, and will need scans every year for five years - 'But after that we would consider her cured,' says Mr Lee. 'If the tumour was found later, the outcome could have been much bleaker.' Ironically, after the operation, Julie still has back pain as a result of her arthritis. But she feels that dealing with the pain is nothing compared with what might have been. 'I'm so pleased I made a fuss instead of leaving things,' she says. brainandspine.org.uk .","Julie McKenzie, 53, from Bushy, Herts, had a nagging back pain .

"It's good to be Taylor Swift — and for 21-year-old Elizabeth Scarborough, it's good to look like Taylor Swift, too, particularly as the University of South Carolina student has been built a career on impersonating the superstar singer. Of course, it's not just her strikingly similar resemblance to 25-year-old Taylor that's helped Elizabeth book private appearances and live concerts where she performs the Shake it Off singer's greatest hits; the Charleston, South Carolina, native can also sing, dance, and act just like her lookalike. 'I first became a fan of her music, and it wasn't until, like, five or six years later when I realized, hey, I could really market this,' she says. Scroll down for video . Similar superfan: Elizabeth Scarborough, 21, impersonates Taylor Swift when she's not attending school in South Carolina . Before embarking on a career impersonating Taylor six years ago, Elizabeth was just a big fan of the star — until classmates at her all-girls school began telling her she looked like the Grammy winner. After Taylor's second album, Fearless, came out when Elizabeth was 15, the student asked her older brother to teach her how to play Love Story — a relatively simple song with only four chords. With looks and musical ability now in her arsenal, Elizabeth was able to start making money as a tribute artist. 'I started to hear the rumor, ""Taylor Swift goes to our school"", and moms would hire me out for birthday parties,' she told Good Morning Carolinas, and explained that early gigs would earn her about $30. 'I’d come, sing a few songs, and wear a sparkly dress and they loved it,' she told USA Today. Flattering immitation: Elizabeth started to learn to play Taylor's music when she was 15 after classmates told her she looked like the star . Copycat performer: Not only has Elizabeth, left, learned to sing and play music by Taylor, right, on the guitar, but she has also practiced copying the singer's facial expressions and way of speaking . Eventually Elizabeth learned Taylor's entire musical catalog, started designing corresponding costumes, and even studied the singer's mannerisms to improve her impersonations. She still works at parties and even nursing homes, but now her biggest gig is performing with Legends in Concert, a concert series that includes artists impersonating the likes of Whitney Houston, Britney Spears, and Tim McGraw. Last summer, Elizabeth performed with Legends in Concert for two month in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and when she graduates from college in May she'll go on tour with the show, starting in Branson, Missouri and ending in Las Vegas, Nevada. '[I'm] so excited to start designing outfits and song lists for future shows [sic],' she recently said on her Instagram account. Parallel careers: As Taylor releases new music and debuts new costumes on tour, Elizabeth adds new elements to her own impersonations . And while she looks forward to Taylor's new material first and foremost as a fan, the Blank Space singer's growing and evolving career also means Elizabeth gets to have more fun with her own career. 'I think she’s breaking boundaries and creating new genres,' she said. 'That gives me the opportunity as a tribute artist to do a lot of different things.' This isn't the first time that one of Taylor's lookalikes has come forward. Last month, the singer herself discovered another doppelganger online, posting a picture of her 'twin', Arizona resident Morgan Jensen, on Tumblr, while commenting: 'Lol I thought that was me.'","University of South Carolina student Elizabeth Scarborough performs as a Taylor Swift tribute artist .

"A mother was horrified to find a dead gecko stuck to the lining of a jacket she bought from Asda. Paula Dunican spent £25 on the baby blue coat at her local branch in Canterbury, Kent. But when the 49-year-old took it home to try on, she noticed a dark stain 'seeping through' from the its lining. Inside, a four inch-long gecko was flattened, its scales imprinted onto the fabric. Paula Dunican was horrified when she found the body of a crushed lizard on the lining of a £25 coat from Asda . 'I noticed the coat had a stain on the back seeping through, so I opened it and stuck to the lining was a shrivelled, squashed lizard,' said Mrs Dunican. 'I think it must have been ironed - it was disgusting.' The supermarket has offered her a refund and £40 voucher, adding that the reptile may have climbed into one of the boxes transporting clothes from Vietnam where they are made. Its quality control department said it was waiting for Mrs Dunican, who is a school learning support assistant, to return the garment. In 2012 another Asda customer found a dead cockroach inside a kettle she had bought to sterilise baby items. Mrs Dunican said the reptile looked as though it had been ironed onto the coat. A spokesman for Asda apologised and offered her a £40 voucher and refund . Carly Wintle bought the own brand appliance in Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, and found the insect inside after unwrapping it. Meanwhile in February a disgusted shopper found the severed head of a frozen rat in a bag of frozen spinach. Terri Powis, 33, was horrified when she opened the bag and found the rodent's decomposing body. The supermarket apologised and asked her to return the item to the store, acting, she said, as though it happened 'every day', the Mirror reported.","Paula Dunican paid £25 for the baby blue coat at her local branch of Asda .

"Reverend Andrew Dotchin, 58, a well-known local character popular with his parishioners, was celebrating the end of Lent . A wine bar banned its local vicar from coming in for a drink on Easter Sunday – because he was wearing sandals. The Reverend Andrew Dotchin, 58, a well-known local character popular with his parishioners, was celebrating the end of Lent when he was refused entry at The Wine Bar in Ipswich. He was told there were health and safety concerns, because a glass could fall on his foot. Rev Dotchin, who preaches at Whitton Parish Church, said: 'I was gobsmacked. I think the man on the door had had a rough night. I said, 'Trust me, I'm a vicar' and I was wearing the dog collar – but he wouldn't budge.' The bemused grandad, a massive Facebook and Twitter fan, grinned: 'It's their loss. 'I wasn't going to go in and tell everyone to go to hell or anything!' Mr Dotchin, who preached in South Africa for 16 years, strolled off instead to the nearby Revolution bar in the Old Cattle Market for a quick drink and a chat. 'I have been in The Wine Bar before and it's a lovely place - it's a bit of a giggle really and occasionally this sort of thing happens. 'I don't get served in sandals in golf clubs but women do,' said Andrew, the son of a Royal Navy submariner. It's silly really.' The bizarre run-in sparked a flurry of activity supporting him on Facebook, which he labelled 'hilarious'. Wine bar manager Luke Parkerson defended the decision to bar Mr Dotchin. He said: 'Unfortunately it's because we are a glass-led venue - a lot of venues in Ipswich use glass substitutes now. 'All it would take is someone to drop a glass on an exposed foot - that was our concern. 'It has happened once before and I am very aware of it and don't want anyone to have it again. 'My door team dealt with it and it's a shame I wasn't able to have a word with the gentleman personally.' The Wine Bar in Ipswich (pictured): Manager Luke Parkerson defended the decision to bar Mr Dotchin . But defiant Andrew, a clergyman for 31 years, vowed to carry on wearing his trademark footwear. 'I am infamous for only ever wearing sandals because I find socks devilish! 'I'll go back there again and hopefully they'll let me in next time,' he said. 'It's very tight on numbers and it can get really busy, so I imagine the door staff are more closed off but they are just doing their job.'

"Dozens more company bosses have signed a letter backing Tory economic plans – including a prominent former Labour supporter. By last night, a total of 150 business leaders have signed the letter warning against a ‘change in course’. Among the new signatories is Simon Woodroffe, the founder of Yo! Sushi and a former Labour backer. Dozens more company bosses have signed a letter backing Tory economic plans – including prominent former Labour supporter Simon Woodroffe, the founder of Yo! Sushi . Others also include executives from two FTSE-100 firms and 10 from the FTSE-250 index. Adding their names were Philip Aiken, the chairman of construction giant Balfour Beatty, Dr Tom Enders, boss of Airbus, and Simon Litherland, head of drinks group Britvic. All have signed in a personal capacity. The announcement of the new names will heap pressure on Labour, which has struggled to come forward with notable numbers of business supporters. Once a former prominent Labour supporter, Mr Woodroffe appears to have turned his back on the party despite appearing in a 2004 political broadcast. Earlier this year, he warned that Labour’s approach to business ‘scares’ him. He told BBC Newsnight: ‘What I worry about with Ed Miliband is that he is appealing to the popular by saying, “look at all these fat cats” making lots of money it should be for the workers.’ ‘Actually, I think the fat cats generally, sometimes it annoys me, but they pay their taxes, you know.’ By last night, a total of 150 business leaders have signed the letter warning against a ‘change in course’ The letter backs the lowering of corporation tax by David Cameron and George Osborne as it shows the UK is 'open for business' The letter states that the signatories believe the Conservative-led government ‘has been good for business and pursued policies which have supported investment and job creation’. They praise the cuts in corporation tax to 20 per cent, which they say is a ‘key part’ of the Tory economic plan. They add: ‘We believe a change in course will threaten jobs and deter investment. This would send a negative message about Britain and put the recovery at risk.’ When the letter was first published in a newspaper last week it sent shockwaves through the election campaign. Labour attempted to respond by positioning itself as the party of workers. It announced plans to ban 90 per cent of zero hours contracts and make it easier for staff to sue their bosses for wrongful dismissal. A poll of FTSE-100 chairman at the weekend showed seven out of ten think Mr Miliband would be a ‘catastrophe’ for Britain. The anonymous poll, published by the Sunday Times, showed widespread concern by businesses about Labour’s economic plans.","Yo! Sushi founder Simon Woodroffe is among new signatories of letter .

"Watch as this brazen thief allegedly steals a donation box ahead of ANZAC Day from an RSL club. CCTV footage has captured a woman cautiously standing by the concierge desk before she quickly grabs the box of ANZAC badges and money while covering it with her vest at the Caulfield RSL in Elsternwick, south-east of Melbourne about 8.00pm on Wednesday. The woman, who is donning a black-and-white striped top and a black vest, could be seen wandering her eyes around the room but walks away when a man strolls past with his blazer. She takes her reading glasses off and appears to clean them as she casually sits down on a seat before quickly pulling her black vest off. Watch as this brazen thief allegedly steals a donation box ahead of ANZAC Day at an RSL club in Melbourne . The empty room prompted the woman to make her way towards the desk before bringing her vest over the box and then casually walking out the glass entrance door. Caulfield RSL general manager Pete Frost told Daily Mail Australia he felt disgusted and disheartened after witnessing the incident on CCTV footage. 'I'm absolutely mortified,' Mr Frost said. 'You wouldn't think you'd have to keep a box of badges under lock and key. This person has no respect for the fine country we live in today.

"Charles Barnhoorn, who was found dead in his bedroom at the family home after a weekend of taking the drug nitrous oxide . A 20-year-old man killed himself days after inhaling hundreds of cans of so-called 'hippy crack' at a weekend-long party. Charles Barnhoorn, a telesales call handler, took hundreds canisters of nitrous oxide - a legal high party drug commonly known as Nos - before taking his own life. He was found dead in his bedroom at the family home in Kingsteignton in Devon by his heartbroken mother Susan. At an inquest into his death, Torbay Coroner Ian Arrow recorded that his death was self-inflicted after he died from asphyxiation. Detective Constable Sam Tressider of Devon and Cornwall CID, who investigated the death told the hearing that a computer was found switched on in Mr Barnhoorn's bedroom with a website 'appearing to make references to ways to commit suicide.' Detective Constable Sam Tressider, of Devon and Cornwall CID, investigated the death. He told the Torquay inquest that a computer in his room was on and a website ‘appeared to make reference to ways to commit suicide’. The hearing also heard that Mr Barnhoorn had been a recreational drug user from the age of 16, taking mephedrone, which had led him to being depressed. But by 20 he had turned his life around with his mother, Mrs Barnhoorn saying: 'He was fit and well and everything in his life seemed balanced. 'He had been to a party all that weekend and had been taking gas. 'This wouldn’t have happened if he had not taken all the Nos. He’d had his problems with recreational drugs in the past but he wasn’t depressed at the time. 'It was a spur of the moment decision, made under the influence of a legal high.' After the hearing she also spoke out about the dangers of nitrous oxide, calling for a crackdown on how easy it is to buy. She explained: 'I want to warn young people and mums and dads about the dangers. 'We need to address the issue of legal highs as soon as possible. They are killing our children. Mr Barnhoorn pictured with his mother Susan. She has now spoken out about the dangers of taking 'hippy crack' 'They are still too readily available. If Charlie had not been able to buy Nos gas canisters by the hundred online he would still be here smiling and laughing with us. 'I would like to see some sort of restrictions but I don’t know if that’s possible as anyone can buy vast quantities online. 'I just want people to stay safe and not go through what I have.' The use of hippy crack is widespread among partygoers around Britain and is the second most popular drug for young people after cannabis. It has a legal use in dentistry and medical procedures as an anaesthetic and also in the food industry for aerosol containers. Footballer Raheem Sterling has been filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - also known as 'hippy crack' Drugs charities have highlighted the dangers of so-called 'hippy crack' after footballer Raheem Sterling was filmed apparently inhaling the drug. Footage emerged yesterday which appears to show the Liverpool and England winger breathing in nitrous oxide before passing out as giggling friends look on. Drugs charity Re-Solv has called on the 'role model' player to condemn the use of the drug to deter young supporters from taking risks with their health. The anti-drugs organisation's spokesman, Stephen Ream, told MailOnline: 'It's very disappointing from our point of view. He is a big role model and we hate to see this kind of stuff from someone of his status. 'Players in similar situations in the past have come out and apologised and we hope he does the same. 'Nitrous Oxide is not the most dangerous drug out there but there are deaths attached to it. There are risks and we would urge anyone tempted to take it not to do so.' Drugs experts have warned revellers against inhaling nitrous oxide from balloons because it starves the brain of oxygen.","Charles Barnhoorn, 20, was discovered dead at the family home in Devon .

"The brave man who stood up against a neo-Nazi at an anti-Islam rally has spoken out about the poignant moment that was captured on camera. During the Reclaim Australia rallies on the Easter weekend, anti-racism protester Jacob King was snapped staring into the eyes of a bald man with a swastika tattooed behind his ear. Mr King, from Melbourne, told Daily Mail Australia he had his arms spread out because he thought the man was going to attack him and his fellow protesters at Federation Square. Anti-racism protester Jacob King, from Melbourne, had a face off with a neo-Nazi at the Easter weekend's Reclaim Australia rallies . Mr King was raised in Melbourne and says he lived in a multicultural part of the Victorian capital where he was exposed to racial tensions . The anti-racism protester said he learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to 'unlearn' these views' 'A few scuffles broke out as a result of those trying to push and fight their way through the picket lines,' he said. 'I remember looking at the bald man from the photo and it seemed to me that he and his group were there solely to be violent and express incoherent hatred, which took away from the already limited opportunities to engage in civilised discussion. 'I have however felt this kind of anger before, and this understanding produced in me a moment of unexpected compassion for him. 'I placed myself in between him and the anti-racism protesters. My arms were outstretched to keep people back and when the man got in my face I was expecting him to attack me. But he didn't. 'As he began to relax I told him there would be no more fighting today. I wasn't expecting him to comply so easily, but I respect him for doing so.' Mr King said he was born and had grown up in a multicultural part of Melbourne, where he had been on the giving and receiving ends of 'racial prejudice and bigoted views'. 'I learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to unlearn and re-learn enough to accept that many of my simplified views were irrational,' he said. 'I have learned that the vast majority of Australian Muslims have come to Australia to improve their lives, contribute to our society and are against the extremist interpretations of their faith which they are so often accused of holding. Mr King said he had spread out his arms to protect his fellow protesters because he thought the man and his group was going to attack them . Wearing a Harley Davidson sleeveless hoodie, which showed off his sleeve of tattoos, the bald man attempted to start a fight with the protesters against racism, who stood against him in defiance . 'I attended the anti-racism rally because I recognise that the issues raised by the rally co-ordinators are a direct result of the scapegoating and fear mongering of Muslims and other minorities by many in the corporate mainstream media and government. 'I firmly believe these divisions in our society are distracting us from the more immediate issues that should be of greater concern to all Australians.' Numerous images emerged showing fiery scenes around the nation, but the most striking picture was taken by photographer Kenji Wardenclyffe who captured Mr King during the Melbourne protest against the 'Islamisation' of Australia. The dramatic scenes occurred after Reclaim Australia, an anti-Islam group, organised protests at major cities across Australia, which were countered by anti-racism activists who held rallies in the same locations. The Reclaim Australia event in Melbourne was also crashed by neo-nazis, who spectacularly clashed with anti-racism groups. 'It was very intense,' Kenji Wardenclyffe told Daily Mail Australia. 'The neo-nazi definitely seemed to be instigating, trying to start a fight with the anti-racism group. The other man in the photo stepped in and was trying to keep the peace. 'He kept his hands open, he was trying to stop a fight from breaking out.' The violent intent of the bald man was proven elsewhere at the rally, when he was photographed with one fist gripping another protester's shirt and the other raised to punch the man in the face. Mr Wardenclyffe said he was pushed around by protesters throughout the day, and some of his camera equipment was broken by people attempting to stop him from taking photos. 'It was a very angry atmosphere - it definitely seemed some of the people on the Reclaim Australia side were there looking to start a fight,' he said. 'It was very tense.' Violent intent: At the rally, the man involved in the standoff was seen trying to throw a punch at another protester as the scene descended into violence . One man appeared to be knocked out cold in the melee and was left lying on the ground . The identification of Jacob King comes after a Federal Government MP reported a group 'socialist ratbags' who were seen burning the Australian flag at the rally to the Human Rights Commission. The trio were at a Reclaim Australia demonstration, the same rally where Mr King was photographed. George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' who burnt the flag while protesting against the Reclaim Australia group. 'I have asked the Racial Discrimination Commissioner to investigate the protests to see if they are unlawful under Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act,' Mr Christensen said. 'According to the Act, it is unlawful to perform any action in public that is likely to offend people of a particular race, religion, or national background. If sections of the Act can be applied to one race or nationality it must apply to all, whether a minority or the majority,' he also wrote. The rally was just one of a dozen which took place in cities across Australia on the Easter long weekend, organised by anti-Islam group Reclaim Australia.

George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland (left) revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' (right) In a video of the event, it also appears to show the moment a man throw a punch at the head of a female anti-racism protester. Despite Reclaim Australia's promise of a peaceful protest, a number of men with shaved heads and tattoos of the swastika appeared at the event and attempted to intimidate anti-racism protesters. Reclaim Australia describe themselves as 'patriotic Australians' who protest against Sharia Law, Halal tax and Islam. They say they want 'compulsory singing of our national anthem weekly in every school in Australia' and want the government to 'refuse entry to anyone who has fought overseas against our ADF or minimum 15 years jail term.' Police were forced to separate  supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country. Crowd numbers continued to grow throughout the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics after the ugly clashes. Police were forced to separate Reclaim Australia supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country . Speaking to Buzzfeed, photographer Wardenclyffe said one of the anti-racism protesters stood out in front of the rest to stop him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi appeared and pushed through the crowd and began to yell at the (left-wing protestors),' Mr Wardenclyffe said. 'The neo-Nazi then got in the face of the man in my photo with sunglasses who had moved into a position to prevent him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi yelled at him in a manner which seemed to be an attempt to start a fight, but the guy with sunglasses remained calm and didn't engage.' A clash of anti-Islam and anti-racism groups turned dangerous and violent during protests in Melbourne . Melbourne police formed a barrier between the separate rallies to attempt to disperse the protesters . It comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups has mocked protests . There was never a violent exchange between the groups however the men with the swastika's moved through the crowd taunting the anti-racism protesters. The clash comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups mocked  protests being held around Australia last week. However, organisers behind the Sydney protest were quick to disassociate themselves with the account. Crowd numbers grew during the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics . Across Australia, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, but Sydney and Melbourne drew the biggest crowd . 'It's not us,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Ours is @reclaim_aus.' Across the country, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, with events in Sydney and Melbourne appearing to have drawn the biggest crowds. About 500 people attended the rally held in Martin Place, Sydney, which included speeches from former Australia Defence League member Shermon Burgess and Rise Up! Australia Party NSW President Norm Bishop. Two people were taken away by police officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally . More than 100 police officers, eleven mounted on horses were used to form the separation wall . Several were injured during the violent rally that saw hundreds of people protest for anti-racism . There was a strong police presence throughout the protest, which included riot police. Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally.

"The daughter of Chicago socialite Sheila Von Wiese-Mack accused of brutally murdering her mother during a Bali vacation will turn over a 'significant percentage' of her $1.3million trust fund to care for her newborn daughter. Vanessa Favia, attorney for 19-year-old Heather Mack, has filed court documents for her client agreeing to turn over funds for the care of four-month-old Stella. CBS reports the petition asks for around a half a million dollars to be transferred to Stella, who was born in Kerobakan Prison and who has urgent needs, including clothing and baby wipes. Scroll down for video . Child care: A US-based attorney for Heather Mack, 19, who is accused of murdering her socialite mother in Bali, has filed for about half a million dollars to be transferred to Mack's daughter Stella from Mack's trust fund . Heather Mack smiles at her baby daughter Stella before her sentencing hearing in Denpasar, Bali, in March . Mack wept as prosecutors said she should be sentenced to 15 years - but spared her the death penalty . 'What ever your opinion of the adults in this case, I believe everyone would agree that the baby bears no culpability in this truly sad affair,' Favia said in a press release. Mack filed a claim in court back in February that her uncle, Wiese-Mack's brother and trustee of her estate, had blocked her access to the funds, according to NBC. A judge ordered $150,000 be released to pay for Mack's defense, along with another $2,240 for living expenses, but required that Mack not share the money with anyone. Indonesian officials accused Mack of helping her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, murder her mother at a luxury Bali hotel before stuffing her body in a suitcase last August. The pair are awaiting sentencing, with prosecutors having asked for a sentence of 15 years for Mack and 18 for Schaefer. Chief Prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya said Mack 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother,' but wanted her to be spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby.' The 21-year-old gazes at his baby daughter, held by a relative, before his sentence demand hearing . Mack claimed her daughter - who had to return to hospital shortly after her birth with jaundice - has six fingers on her left hand . Since being held in jail, the 19-year-old from Chicago has been keeping her newborn Stella with her in the crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison. In a bizarre comment from her holding cell last week, Mack said with a grin that Stella has six fingers on her left hand, saying, 'But don't worry, she's OK, thank you.' As she waited in the cell, nervously puffing on a cigarette, Mack added that she and her co-accused boyfriend were married 'in spirit.' She said: 'He has made us a ring each to wear from his side of the prison.' She held up a hand revealing a red plastic ring. 'Tommy's is blue,' she added. Jail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime. Schaefer has admitted to hitting Wiese-Mack with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the trunk of a taxi they had ordered. The couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit. They tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel. Mack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel. Mack, who said during an earlier court hearing that she did not wish her mother dead, said they panicked after Schaefer’s attack with the metal bowl. She said they thought about either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the US Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one. When the prison gates opened to allow the couple to exit last month, onlookers were surprised to see Schaefer carrying baby Stella - the first time he had been seen with her . Shortly after the baby's birth Mack was being accused by prison sources of failing to wash the child properly . Mack said she intended to continue breastfeeding for two years. The baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice. The child was later allowed to be taken back to the prison with her mother. Mack is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell - which she is sharing with eight other women - until the child is two years old. She revealed there was another prison baby, aged seven months, in a separate cell.","Heather Mack, now 19, is set to sign over a 'significant percentage' of her trust for the care of daughter Stella .

"A City of Charleston police officer committed suicide Thursday morning during a standoff at his home, authorities said. Sgt. George Hildebidle, who had been on the force since 2003 and was married with two children, barricaded himself inside his Grand Oaks home following a 911 call at 7am. Officials said the officer's wife made the call, which was listed as a domestic dispute. Local police called in the Charleston County Sheriff's Department, the crisis negotiations team, SWAT, and bomb squads to assume responsibility of the situation 'because we did not want to have our own folks dealing with this since they worked with this individual on a daily basis', Charleston Police Chief Gregg Mullen told Live 5 News. Scene: Charleston Police Chief Gregg Mullen speaks with local media following death of one of his officers,  Sgt. George Hildebidle, inside his Grand Oaks home on Thursday morning . Closed: Officers evacuated some surrounding homes as they addressed the situation. The deceased, Sgt. George Hildebidle, had barricaded himself inside the home . Domestic: Police say the 911 call that came through around 7am was listed as a domestic dispute . The neighborhood surrounding Hildebidle's house was evacuated as negotiations started. Chief Mullen said they knew Hildebidle was armed. Hours later, just before 1pm, a decision was made to enter the home. Police said Hildebidle was alone inside the house at the time. The whereabouts of his wife are not known. Upon entering the house Hildebidle was found dead. Hildebidle was married with two children. Chief Mullen described the incident as a tragedy, but it is not believed to be linked to be linked to the case of Michael Slager, the white South Carolina police officer charged with murder for shooting an unarmed black man in the back. 'I think police officers all over the United States constantly experience high stress and what's going on right now has just elevated that, but this situation today I'm focusing on what's happening with members of my department and that's my priority now,' Mullen told Live 5 News. According to Mullen, at 12:17 pm, a SWAT team from the sheriff's office entered the home and found the individual deceased in the residence . '(Hildebidle) served this community well and unfortunately like many situations we deal with, this particular one, he chose to end the situation in his way. 'He was a great officer, I've worked with him for almost nine years and he was a great sergeant to this community.

"A seven-year-old British boy has fallen 160ft to his death from a cliff in the Alps after becoming separated from his family on a skiing holiday. Carwyn Scott-Howell got lost on the slopes and left the piste before walking through a treacherously steep wooded area, according to a source. The Welsh schoolboy, who was formally named by police today, was holidaying in the French resort of Flaine with his mother Ceri, elder brother Gerwyn, 19, and nine-year-old sister Antonia when the accident took place. A seven-year-old British boy has died after getting separated from his parents on a family skiing holiday in the French resort of Flaine near Geneva (pictured above). He fell down a 160ft cliff after trying to find his parents . Police are still trying to piece together the tragic sequence of events, but they believe the little boy was killed instantly in the fall on Friday after leaving the marked ski slope to look for his family. Investigators are unsure how he came to be at the top of the steep 320ft-high cliff, which overshadows the Lac de Flaine. One theory is that he wandered away from a blue run to try to find his family, while there has also been speculation that he may have fallen off one of the ski resort's lifts. His frantic family began searching for him at around 4pm. They scoured the piste and, increasingly worried, alerted the piste patrol who launched a search. At around 6pm search and rescue workers discovered his tracks in the snow leading through woodland up to the top of the cliff, where they found his abandoned skis. He was then spotted by rescuers in a helicopter, and they recovered his body at around 7.30pm from the bottom of the cliff. The area was described as a 'dangerous, out-of-bounds area' by emergency services, who said rescuers had to be winched down from a helicopter to retrieve the body. The conditions in the French ski resort of Flaine (pictured) were clear and sunny but it is believed the boy ventured off-piste while trying to find his parents. Police found tracks in the snow which led to his body . Michel Ollagnon, an officer with the Bonneville mountain rescue service, told reporters that the boy had been skiing with his mother, brother and sister, but he had asked to ski alone for his last descent of the day. He said the boy had then fallen off a rocky outcrop after apparently losing his way. Police chief Patrick Poirot, the head of the mountain rescue division in Annecy, added: 'His family were on the piste and then they could not see him. 'They looked for him but couldn't see him anywhere on the piste. They went to the piste patrol and said: 'Our child has disappeared' and a search was started. 'At about 6pm some tracks were discovered in the snow. It was in a very dangerous, out-of-bounds area. The tracks led to the little boy's skis. 'They were there in the snow at the top of a cliff. It was very dangerous. The piste patrol could not go down the cliff. So they called a helicopter but it could not land. They spotted the boy and rescuers were then winched down but the child was dead. It was now about 7.30pm.' He added: 'Hypothetically we think that the little boy didn't know where to go and skied in the wrong direction. He's just seven years old. 'He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff. He then stopped, removed his skis, walked a little way and then fell. 'He fell 50 metres. Specialists are now at the scene to try and determine exactly what happened and understand every element that led to this tragedy.' Resort boss Sylvain Philippe, director of the Societe du Domaine Skiable de Flaine, said: 'The whole resort has been affected by the death of this young boy. We are thinking above all of his family. 'An enquiry into his death has started to find out the exact circumstances of what happened. Unfortunately and sadly they confirmed that his body was found off piste in an area of the resort called Aujon. 'He was very far from the piste, it's not a skiable area. He was unfortunately found in the middle of the cliffs, everyone has been very affected by it. 'We're working with the police and the family on this and we will be helping the family for as long as they need.' Carwyn's mother Ceri lives with her husband Rhys in the Brecon Beacons where the pair run the award-winning Coity Bach Farm near Talybont-on-Usk. The farm rents out its 'four-star gold award' self-catering cottages to visitors and is well known for its prize-winning speciality sausages. David Cameron was once pictured buying scotch eggs from the couple's stand at an agricultural show in Wales in July 2014. On the Coity Bach website it tells how ex-nurse Ceri and former butcher Rhys bought the farm to live out their dream of growing their own food and living 'the good life'. Last night, relatives at the farm were too upset to speak, but a neighbour told of the village's shock. 'It's extremely sad – they are a loving family and he was a smashing lad,' said one neighbour, who did not want to be named. They went on to say: 'I haven't even broken the news to my own children yet, it's just too shocking.' Another added: 'Ceri is a great mum and they're well-loved in the village. We will all rally round her when they return from France.' An assistant from Ski Set, a shop in the resort where the family had hired some of their equipment, said: 'They loved skiing. They said that they had been to lots of ski resorts before. 'They were a very nice family. The little boy seemed just happy to be on holiday. They had been on holiday for a week. He was good enough for a seven-year-old. He wasn't a beginner.'","Seven-year-old boy has died on family skiing holiday in Flaine, French Alps .

"An eighth grade student has been charged with a felony after he allegedly hacked into the computer of a teacher he didn't like and changed his desktop background. Domanik Green, 14, has been accused of accessing the staff member's laptop at Paul R. Smith Middle School in Holiday, Florida, without permission by using an administrator's password to alter the image to two men kissing. The Pasco County Sheriff's office have claimed he illicitly made his way into the encrypted system, had access to personal files and could have altered his classmates' grades, but the youngster maintains it was an innocent prank. He was arrested on Wednesday and detained at the Land O'Lakes Detention Center until he was released into the custody of his mother later the same day. Charged: Domanik Green, 14, allegedly accessed a computer at Paul R. Smith Middle School in Holiday, Florida, without permission by using an administrator's password to alter the image to two men kissing . According to the Tampa Bay Times Sheriff Chris Nocco said: 'Even though some might say this is just a teenage prank, who knows what this teenager might have done.' During an interview with ABC Action News, for which his mother said he could be identified, he said: 'I wasn't really thinking. I was just kind of annoyed at the teacher that day. He added: 'When I logged on and put the picture up, I was trying to annoy my teacher. Green managed to get into the teacher's laptop by sharing his screen. He then took a picture from Google images and enlarged it. 'But when logging onto the FCAT, I logged onto the wrong computer,' he added. 'I was trying to talk to my friend through another computer, that way I didn't get caught with my phone out or anything in class.' Green was also suspended for three days last year for a similar act.

"A New Jersey high school teacher who was indicted last month on charges that she had sex with one student and engaged in improper relationships with two others is now trying to avoid prison time by entering a diversion program. Nicole McDonough, 32, of Mount Olive, was arrested in December on suspicion of having sex with an 18-year-old student while employed as a teacher at Mendham High School. A subsequent investigation revealed that the married educator also allegedly engaged in improper 'communication' and 'fraternization' with two other 18-year-old male students. Looking for redemption: High school English teacher Nicole McDonough - seen here at her first court appearance in January - has applied for a Pre-Trial Intervention program in hopes of having the charges against her dropped . On Monday, McDonough applied for Morris County's Pre-Trial Intervention (PTI) program, which provides first-time, non-violent offenders with alternatives to traditional prosecution. The program requires a probationary period of one to three years and comes with a list of conditions that must be met. If McDonough is allowed to enter the PTI, she may have to undergo random urine testing, pay restitution, and submit to psychological, drug and alcohol evaluations. If she meets all the conditions and successfully completes the diversion program, all charges against McDonough would be dropped and her criminal record would be expunged, reported NJ.com. If she flunks out of the program, her case will be returned to the court docket. Denise Arsenault, with the Morris County Prosecutor's Office, argued that the disgraced teacher would likely be ineligible for the program because of the trio of charges against her. It will be up to a judge to decide on McDonough's application upon hearing arguments from prosecutors and the defendant's attorney. Strings attached: If McDonough, pictured in court in January, is allowed to enter the PTI, she may have to undergo random urine testing, pay restitution, and submit to psychological, drug and alcohol evaluations . Charged: Nicole McDonough (above) was arrested in December after reportedly having sex with an 18-year-old student. An investigation found she had 'improper relations' with two others, police say . According to The Daily Record, the alleged sexual relationship between the married mother of two and an 18-year-old boy occurred in April, May, and June of 2013. The relationships with the other two students then allegedly occurred in April, May, and June of 2014. Additionally, NJ.com have reported that McDonough does not face any sex charges because all three alleged victims were 18. The prosecution made it clear they believe she was only sexual with one of the boys. The indictment outlined that McDonough committed second-degree official misconduct because she 'did commit acts relating to her office, but constitutionally unauthorized exercises of her official functions'. McDonough did so 'with the purpose to obtain a benefit for herself, specifically emotional, mental and/or physical sexual gratification', the indictment said. Timothy Smith, McDonough's attorney, said Friday he would seek to have the indictment dismissed and called it a 'rogue prosecution' that incorrectly applies official misconduct laws. The 32-year-old pleaded not guilty to the charges against her in January. Last month, she was suspended from her teaching job without pay. Official misconduct is punishable upon conviction by up to 10 years in prison with a minimum of five years to be served before parole consideration. Scene: McDonough, a married mother of two, worked as an English teacher at West Morris Mendham High School in Morristown, New Jersey . According to NJ.com, McDonough 'teaches honors and International Baccalaureate-level English courses at the high school' and 'holds a bachelor's degree in English Literature from the College of St. Elizabeth.' Describing herself on the school's website she writes; 'Although teaching is one of my many passions, I am also a mom, a personal trainer, and a cross-fitter. I am a mother of two amazing girls. We also have a puggle named Tegan.' She closes by saying; 'The classroom is one of my many loves and I am excited to return to start a full year of school!'","Nicole McDonough, of Mount Olive, New Jersey, was indicted on three counts of official misconduct in March .

"Robin Williams spent his last days in a paranoid frenzy, aware that 'something else was wrong with him', a British television show will claim tonight. In a 'peculiar' incident just one day before his death, the Oscar-winning actor, who had been diagnosed with Parkinson's, stuffed his collection of watches  into a sock and took it to a friend for safekeeping. The 63-year-old, who had also been prone to episodes of insomnia and anxiety prior to his death, also spent his final 24 hours frantically looking up drugs online, convinced he had another illness. Scroll down for video . Suicide: Robin Williams with wife Susan Schneider in 2009, and the actor months before his death in 2014 . Feud: Mrs Schneider Williams, Williams' third wife, is in a battle with his three children from previous marriages – Zak, Zelda and Cody – over his £33million estate. Above, Mrs Schneider Williams with Williams and Zelda . The post-mortem examination later revealed that Williams had been suffering from Lewy body dementia - an undiagnosed illness would could have been the root cause of his bizarre behaviour. In tonight's episode of Autopsy, which will reconstruct the final hours of the actor's life, pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd explains how Williams' dementia probably triggered his paranoid tendencies. He says that Williams's insomnia and anxiety, as well as periods of confusion and impaired decision making, could also have been connected to the condition. But Dr Shepherd also tells the Channel 5 show - which has previously examined the unexpected deaths of Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley - that the actor may well have been aware of his undetected illness, something which could have exacerbated his paranoia in his final hours. He says that Williams's online activity suggested he knew 'there was something else wrong with him… something that he couldn't put his finger on'. Williams hanged himself in August 2014, a death which sent shockwaves through the celebrity world and led to an outpouring of grief from his worldwide fans. Tribute: Flowers and candles at the Oscar-winning actor's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The day before he hanged himself, Williams stuffed his watch collection into a sock and took it to a friend for safekeeping . Claims: Dr Richard Shepherd, a pathologist, pictured, told Britain's Channel 5 show Autopsy that Williams' online activity in the hours before his death suggested he knew 'there was something else wrong with him' His death was later ruled to have been suicide. The show reveals tonight how, on the day he died, Williams cleaned his bathroom of blood after cutting his wrists. According to the post-mortem report, Williams spent his last night at his Californian home with wife Susan Schneider. LBD is a common form of dementia - it affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the United States. The disease is caused by abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time . This leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning and independent function . The disease takes its name from Frederick H. Lewy - the neurologist who discovered the brain abnormalities  during the early 1900s . It shares symptoms with Parkinson's Disease - sufferers can experience motor control problems, such as hunched posture, rigid muscles and a shuffling walk . Those affected can suffer visual hallucinations, which generally take the form of phantom objects, people or animals  there . It is also linked to Alzheimer's disease as it is more common over the age of 65 and those affected often suffer from confusion and memory loss . Ms Schneider later described how her husband stuffed a number of his jewelled watches into a sock before driving to the house of a friend. Speaking about the incident on tonight's show, Dr Shepherd says: 'This is a very peculiar incident that his wife describes as typical of the increasing paranoia that he had been suffering.' Psychologist Anjula Mutanda also says the actor could have felt 'under threat'. 'Somebody experiencing paranoid feelings may fear that they are in danger and under threat,' she says. Whether it is physiological, physical or financial – harm could be coming their way.' After Williams's body was found, a bottle of quetiapine, a powerful drug used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, was also found unopened in his bedroom. He had been prescribed it a week before his suicide, suggesting his symptoms may have changed prior to his death. In the months before his death, Williams had also checked into rehab to 'fine-tune and focus' on his commitment to staying clean. But the documentary concludes there were no signs that drink or drugs were exacerbating his depression when he died. Blood samples taken after his death showed he had not taken cocaine or alcohol in the last 24 hours of his life. There was also no sign of damage to his liver from previous drinking binges. The show also describes how toxicology reports showed Williams' moods were being controlled by mirtazapine, which is used to treat depressive disorders. Comedy: Williams did stand-up while acting in such films as Good Morning Vietnam and Mrs Doubtfire, pictured . Critical acclaim: The actor found fame with his portrayal of a kooky alien in the 1970s sitcom Mork and Mindy, left with Pam Dawber. He was awarded an Oscar for best supporting actor in Good Will Hunting in 1998, right . Good Morning Vietnam: Williams' played a DJ on Armed Forces Radio during the Vietnam War (pictured) There was also levodopa in his system, which is used to treat Parkinson's. The forthcoming documentary, part of the third series of the show, has already drawn criticism from Williams's fans after it emerged that it featured a 'graphic' reconstruction of the actor's suicide. A Channel 5 spokesman previously said the depiction was kept to 'an absolute minimum' but that its inclusion 'is important in telling the truth'. They added: 'The film celebrates Robin’s career and talent, and within that the tragic details of his death are part of that story.' French actor Alain Poudensan plays Williams in the reconstructed scenes. While Alain has worked as a Robin Williams impersonator for a number of years, he has also starred in many adult films, under the name Alain L'Yle. Williams found fame with his portrayal of a kooky alien in the 1970s sitcom Mork and Mindy. But it was his role as an irreverent DJ with the US Armed Services Radio station in Good Morning, Vietnam in 1987 which won him huge acclaim. His roles ranged from serious and dramatic in films such as Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting, to comedy in Mrs Doubtfire. He was nominated for an Oscar three times before winning an Academy Award for his performance as a psychologist in Good Will Hunting in 1997. Mrs Schneider Williams, his third wife, is currently in a battle with his three children from previous marriages – Zak, Zelda and Cody – over his £33million estate. Zelda recently spoke out about her father's death. When asked why she believed her father took his own life, she said: 'I don't think there's a point. It's not important to ask.' In a statement released shortly after her husband's death, Susan Schneider said that Williams was struggling with depression, anxiety and the Parkinson's diagnosis when he died. Toxicology reports showed there was levodopa in his system, which is used to treat Parkinson's. The disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. It develops gradually, sometimes starting with a small tremor in one hand. The disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement. Actor Michael J. Fox, a long-time friend of Williams, is well-known for his efforts to fund research into finding a cure. He was just 29 years old when he was diagnosed with the disease. Robin Williams with actor Michael J Fox, who was just 29 years old when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's . Stage one sees a patient experience mild symptoms that inconvenience day-to-day tasks, including the presence of tremors or experiencing shaking in one of the limbs. Friends and family can generally detect changes in the patient including poor posture, loss of balance, and abnormal facial expressions. In stage two, the patient's symptoms start to affect both limbs and both sides of the body. They usually encounter problems walking or maintaining balance, and the inability to complete normal physical tasks becomes more apparent. During stage three, the disease becomes more severe, with some patients losing the ability to walk straight or to stand and a noticeable slowing of physical movements. Stage four is accompanied by severe symptoms of Parkinson's. Walking may still occur, but it is often limited and rigidity and bradykinesia are often visible. During this stage, most patients are unable to complete day-to-day tasks, and usually cannot live on their own. The tremors or shakiness that take over during the earlier stages however, may lessen or become non-existent for unknown reasons during this time. In stage five, the final stage, Parkinson's disease usually takes over the patients physical movements leaving them unable to take care of themselves and generally unable to stand or walk. A patient at stage five usually requires constant one-on-one nursing care.","Post-mortem examination showed the actor had undiagnosed dementia .

"John Truong thought he was helping his sister have a nice night out with her boyfriend. Instead, he ended up an unknowing accomplice to a bizarre abduction. Police arrested Truong's sister Alyssa Chang this week after she allegedly helped kidnap 2-year-old Ronnie Tran and his mother, with the child's grandmother, 65-year-old Vien Nguyen. Authorities say Chang and Nguyen incapacitated the child's mother at her home in Des Moines, Washington, bound her with plastic ties and then took the two to another home in Fife. Chang and the grandmother then took off the the toddler, leaving the mother locked in a cupboard. An Amber Alert was issued for the boy Tuesday night, after the mother managed to escape and find help. Scroll down for video . Babysitting: John Truong agreed to babysit 2-year-old Ronnie Tran (pictured) on Tuesday. He says his sister dropped off the boy, saying the toddler was her boyfriend's son and they wanted to go on a date night . That same night, Truong says his sister asked him to babysit the toddler he had never met before, saying it was her boyfriend's son and they wanted to go out on a date night. She promised to pick up the boy in the morning, but she never returned and eventually stopped answering her brother's messages. It wasn't until the next day that Truong realized he was harboring an abducted child when he read an Amber Alert on online. 'I'm eating my breakfast, I'm checking my Facebook, all of a sudden I see this Amber Alert for this child,' Truong recounted to KOMO. 'And it looks like this child in my bed, and I'm like, ""Oh my God! What's going on?""' Truong then called police to report that he was watching the boy, who they found safe, sound an unhurt at his home.

Truong's sister Alyssa Chang has since been arrested in connection to the bizarre kidnapping . He says the boy appeared fine the night before, enjoying a quiet night in watching movies and eating popcorn. 'He was a great kid. He didn't cry much or anything. He enjoyed my dog's company and my children's company,' Tuong said. Truong says he was completely taken aback by his sister's arrest in the bizarre kidnapping. 'I feel like she was just helping her boyfriend out and just got into this horrible situation,' he said. 'We're family people, this is definitely not like this. Honestly I'm at a loss for words right now. It's just crazy.' In the aftermath of the incident, Chang was arrested on charges of kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment and is being held on $250,000 bail. Nguyen later turned herself into police and was questioned for several hours. Detectives have yet to reveal a motive for the crime.

"Kanye West has revealed that he is sick of the notion that celebrities are controlling society as members of the secret group The Illuminati, in an essay that he penned for Paper magazine's American Dream issue. Less than a year after his wife Kim Kardashian posed nude for the magazine, the 37-year-old rapper stars on Paper's latest cover, donning a grey sweatshirt from his collection for Adidas and a necklace featuring his daughter North's nickname, Nori. In the April issue, Kanye explained his 'world dream' and noted that if there was an actual Illuminati, 'it would be more like the energy companies' - not Hollywood stars. 'I am tired of people pinpointing musicians as the Illuminati. That's ridiculous,' he said. 'We don’t run anything; we’re celebrities. We’re the face of brands.' Scroll down for video . American icon: Kanye West covers Paper magazine's April issue - less than a year after his wife Kim Kardashian posed nude for the glossy . Close up: Kanye penned an essay for the magazine, in which he discussed his 'world dream' After it was announced last month that Kanye, Madonna, Beyonce and other famous musicians were all co-owners of Jay Z’s new Tidal streaming service, rumors began to swirl online that everyone involved in the project is a member of the the top-secret Illuminati, but Kanye noted that musicians don't have that kind of power. He explained that celebrities don't even get the freedom to say and do exactly what they want, let alone 'run anything': 'We have to compromise what we say in lyrics so we don’t lose money on a contract. 'Madonna is in her 50s and gave everything she had to go up on an award show and get choked by her cape,' Kanye added, referencing Madonna's recent fall at the Brit Awards in February. He went on to say that the 56-year-old legend even gets 'judged for who she adopts', adding: 'F*** all of this sensationalism.' On the subject of children, the rapper said we should be thankful that we can raise kids, before noting that we should be trying to bring them up in a 'truthful world', not one that is 'based on brand and concepts of perception'. Star style: The 37-year-old rapper modeled a Kanye West x Adidas Originals shirt and vintage military pants for the photoshoot . Proud dad: The father also wore a necklace featuring his daughter North's nickname, Nori . Sunny day: Kanye put his had down as he posed in a field of wildflowers . 'When I look in North’s eyes, I’m happy about every mistake I’ve ever made,' the father-of-one said. 'I’m happy that I fought to bring some type of reality to this world we choose to stay in right now, driven by brands and corporations.' In addition to striving to bring reality to the world, Kanye said that he is a proponent of people following their dreams, advocating that a 'little self-belief can go a long way'. 'I think the scariest thing about me is the fact that I just believe,' he said. 'I believe awesome is possible and I believe that beauty is important.' And while Kanye said that beauty is 'undermined by our current corporate culture', he added that he also sees money as something that is 'equally important' - even though 'artists have been brainwashed to look at it as a bad thing'. Mentoring younger artists, such as Drake, A$AP Rocky, Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift, is of the utmost importance to Kanye because he said it will help 'make better music in the future'. Turn around: The musician was also photographed with his back to the camera . True artist: Kanye showed his Kanye West x Adidas Originals Fall 2015 collection (pictured) at New York Fashion Week in February . Fatherly love: Kanye said that when he looks into his daughter North's eyes (pictured) he is 'happy about every mistake' he has ever made . 'It’s funny that I worked at the Gap in high school, because in my past 15 years it seems like that’s the place I stood in my creative path -  to be the gap, the bridge,' he said. Kanye also candidly discussed the fashion industry, saying that while he was grateful that his collection for Adidas - which was shown at New York Fashion Week in February - was 'accepted positively', he found an article that asked: ''Should Kanye leave fashion to the professionals?' to be posing an 'ignorant' question. 'The second I sell my first T-shirt or my first shoe, doesn’t that make me a professional?' he asked before saying he finds it 'funny to be so famous and noted for one thing, and to have so many people try to box you out of another form of art.' When it comes to his love of fashion, Kanye explained he wants to be as close to as a kid as possible, because when children say that they like something, they aren't looking for a 'thumbs up' or a 'thumbs down', they are just sharing their admiration. 'Fashion is something that’s in my heart to do - in my spirit,' he said. 'There’s no world that can stop me from what I love. Not the rap world, not the fashion world, not the real world.'

"Notorious mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe, who has spent three decades in jail, is to be moved to a cushy low security unit, it has been claimed . The families of victims of Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe are furious at plans to move him from Broadmoor to a low-security Priory unit. Mass murderer Sutcliffe has spent more than three decades in Broadmoor for the savage killings of 13 women. But now, despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers, Sutcliffe may be moved to a cushy Priory unit set in Berkshire woodland. Sutcliffe is being lined up for the move after he expressed remorse and said he no longer hears the 'voices from God' which he had blamed for his killing spree at his 1981 trial. A report is being compiled which will be heard next month at a prison tribunal which will rule if the move goes ahead. But families of his victims are furious about the move. Neil Jackson, whose mother Emily, 46, became the Ripper's second victim in 1976, told the Sun: 'He should not be moved at all. 'As he's in Broadmoor, he should stay there and they should throw away the key. This just rubs salt into the wounds of families and I believe any remorse he has shown is fake.' A source at the prison told the newspaper Sutcliffe was optimistic about the move - despite being previously turned down for a transfer to the unit which boasts facilities such as a fully-fitted gym and music room. Plans of his referral follow allegations earlier this year that Sutcliffe, who used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England, was enjoying an easy lifestyle in jail. Scroll down for video . Potential plans to move Britain's most notorious mass murderer from the high security Broadmoor prison hospital to the Priory . Hospital: Broadmoor's corridors look ordinary, but it houses some of Britain's most disturbed individuals . He was said to be eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, as well as being privileged to receive visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours. It was claimed he is also given money to spend in the psychiatric hospital’s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions. It has been claimed that Sutcliffe is now a Jehovah’s Witness and was even given a baptism. In the evenings, he watches TV shows such as The X Factor and I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, the Sun on Sunday reported. A new image of a relaxed-looking Sutcliffe – the first for 20 years – supports the cushy lifestyle claim. There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard. He had ballooned with some reports estimating his weight at 19 or 20 stone, which is said to be down to a love of chocolate and burgers, and now sufferers from type 2 diabetes. Sutcliffe is currently said to enjoy a cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, it was claimed . The Priory Thornford Park set in Berkshire woodland . While officials refused to comment on the move, it is thought that Sutcliffe would be transferred to a unit such as the Priory Thornford Park. Based just 30 miles from Broadmoor, it is set in Berkshire woodland and offers a fully equipped gym and running track, a music room and occupational therapy suite. A 'rehab kitchen' and computer  and education rooms are also amongst the high-end facilities at the unit. The red-brick building houses 122 men with mental illness, compared to Broadmoor's 210, with a combination of low and medium secure beds. Past residents include dangerous criminal John Maguir, convicted for assault, who escaped by scaling a wall and child sex abuser Peter Pickering. Its website states its users are 'among the most vulnerable members of society and require sensitive therapeutic interventions delivered in a healing environment that encourages self-awareness, knowledge and empowerment.' The full list of facilities include: . The former trucker, who notoriously targeted prostitutes during his five-year killing spree, has seen his health deteriorate in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and was reported to have suffered a heart attack. The murderer, who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack, was also told  he could lose what remains of his sight within a year due to an eye condition. He had refused laser eye surgery as he fears it could cause him to lose his vision immediately. The claims about his lifestyle have angered victims’ families. Roofer Neil Jackson, 56, whose mother Emily was Sutcliffe’s second victim, said: ‘He tore apart our family and this just looks like he’s being rewarded. He’s getting an easy life and he’s clearly enjoying every minute. I hope the lifestyle kills him. ‘It doesn’t matter how many years go by, it doesn’t make the pain of what he did any easier.’ Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, after an attack by another prisoner in 1982 with a broken coffee jar . Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor since he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed, he tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree. The killer, who believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill sex workers, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984. He refused treatment until 1993, when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti-psychotic medication forcibly. He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left . It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell. Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected. In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. The Priory and the Prison Service declined to comment on the move while a spokeswoman for the Department of Health, which is responsible for the medical unit, said they would not comment on individual cases.","Serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, 68, was jailed for life for murdering 13 women .

"It is a decade to the day  that Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan's lives were changed forever after being arrested  for the Bali Nine drug smuggling operation. Friday is also Sukumaran's 34th birthday which could well be his last as the pair contemplate the prospect of facing a firing squad on Execution Island in Java. The talented artist's birthday is being marked in London where his cousin has organised an exhibition of his paintings at the Amnesty International headquarters. Meanwhile, the pair are in an isolated cell pinning their hopes on yet another legal quest for mercy which rests with a court that has previously recommended an option of a life sentence for reformed inmates. Myuran Sukumaran has put all of his energy into his art while spending 10 years in Kerobokan jail . His cousin Niranjela Karunatilake is currently holding an exhibition of his artwork in London . Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) await their fate on Execution Island in Java - exactly a decade after they were arrested . The pair were identified as leaders of the plot to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin, taped to the bodies of young mules, on April 17, 2005, and sentenced to death. Since they were refused clemency earlier this year, their lawyers have been desperate to show the courts their rehabilitation over the past decade. Chan is now a pastor and Sukumaran a painter, and both had a hugely positive impact on fellow inmates at Kerobokan jail. Sukumaran's skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives. Painting has proven a great sense of solace for Sukumaran during his time in jail and has even run art classes for fellow inmates as part of the drug rehabilitation program that he set up with Chan. His cousin, Niranjela Karunatilake, last visited her cousin on death row in February. Niranjela said it was: ' just too sad to think that could be his last birthday'. 'The death penalty is never the answer and I don't believe it deters crime, but in Myu's case, when he has done so much to repent and improve prison conditions, it would be a real tragedy if his life was cut short,' she said. 'We are not asking for Myu to be freed, all we ask is for mercy, that he keeps his life and continues his positive impact on the Indonesian prison system and other inmates.' Friday is also Sukumaran's 34th birthday which could well be his last as the pair contemplate the prospect of facing a firing squad on Execution Island in Java . Karunatilake said his skill has developed over the past four years and she can see him finding himself in his paintings . His cousin Niranjela said it was: ' just too sad to think that could be his last birthday' Sukumaran's skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives . Their Melbourne barrister Julian McMahon visited the men last week, and says they are well. As he waits for the constitutional court to respond to a new bid to challenge the clemency process, Mr McMahon recalls the court's 2007 recommendation on the death penalty. While it upheld its constitutional validity, the court recommended that death row prisoners who showed rehabilitation after 10 years had the option of being re-sentenced to a fixed term. 'There's absolutely no doubt my two clients have done a heroic job in reforming themselves and many others,' Mr McMahon said. 'I see that as an opportunity to enliven the constitutional court jurisprudence.' President Joko Widodo refused clemency to the men citing a 'drugs emergency' but has the authority to reverse the decision. No date has been fixed for the executions of the Sydney men and eight other drug offenders, but officials say they're considering a date after the Asian African Conference ends on April 24. 'We are not asking for Myu to be freed, all we ask is for mercy, that he keeps his life and continues his positive impact on the Indonesian prison system and other inmates,' Niranjela said . Sukumaran taught inmates how to paint as part of the drug rehabilitation program he set up with Chan . Niranjela said her cousin has done so much to repent and improve prison conditions, it would be a real tragedy if his life was cut short' “It’s clear painting has been a vital comfort for him on death row,' Niranjela said . 'I hope people will come to see the exhibition next week, and think of Myu and let Indonesia know that there are people all over the world calling for mercy': she said .","It's a decade to the day that Bali Nine pair were arrested for drug smuggling .

"A housekeeper who stole antiques and art treasures worth £500,000 – including a work by Picasso – from a wealthy countess was yesterday warned she was facing a lengthy jail term. Kim Roberts admitted to stealing the precious paintings, vases and silverware from Dowager Countess Bathurst’s Cirencester mansion and her London home. The 58-year-old worked for the countess, 87, and helped herself to the riches, which included a sketch by Picasso and pewter plates, Gloucester Crown Court heard. Roberts’ haul was said to be worth a total of £500,000 at an earlier hearing. Kim Roberts (left) admitted stealing antiques and paintings from her employer, the Countess of Bathurst (right) The Bathurst family home, Cirencester Park, houses artistic treasures stretching back more than three centuries to the first Earl Bathurst, who was a patron of art and literature and a friend of authors including Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope. Among the estate’s collection are portraits by Thomas Gainsborough, George Romney, Peter Lely, and Joshua Reynolds. The 3,000 acre grounds are also home to Cirencester Park Polo Club. Prince Charles has regularly played there over the years and his sons William and Harry have followed in his footsteps. Roberts, of Colyton, Devon, yesterday admitted three charges she had previously denied – including burgling the countess’s Kensington home in Lennox Gardens, where the average asking price is more than £4million. Roberts was working at Cirencester Park, the aristocratic country pile of the Bathursts, in the Cotswolds . Roberts admitted stealing antique vases between May and August in 2013 and stealing a 4x4 Volvo XC90 – worth at least £45,000 – from her previous employer interior designer Emily Olympitis in October 2012. She also admitted fraud after dishonestly telling a domestic household staff recruitment agency that she was born in 1958. At a hearing last year, Roberts admitted stealing art and antiques belonging to the countess between April and May 2013. But she had claimed she was guilty only because the property was put in her car by mistake. Yesterday her barrister Simon Burns said she had now abandoned that claim and fully accepted her responsibility. Roberts was told to prepare for a stretch in prison after she admitted stealing antiques and paintings from the Countess of Bathurst . Her victim – Gloria, the Dowager Countess of Bathurst – is the widow of the eighth Earl Bathurst, Henry, who died in 2011 aged 84. Their son Allen, formerly Lord Apsley, is now the 9th Earl and lives in the Cirencester Park mansion house with his wife Sara. The Bathursts are one of England’s oldest families, originating from Sussex where they owned Bathurst Castle until they were dispossessed of their lands by Edward IV in 1463, after siding with the Lancastrians in the War of the Roses. Roberts did deny three charges yesterday, including stealing antique silver hairbrushes from Lady Juliet Worsley, and another theft of items including a television and a DVD player. She also denied possession of stolen property including a Mont Blanc pen, items of clothing and several accessories. The Crown Prosecution Service has until today to accept her pleas and allow the charges she denies to rest. Roberts’ lawyer told the court he had spoken to the prosecution and believed her guilty pleas would be accepted and that the other charges would not be proceeded with. Judge Jamie Tabor QC gave the prosecution 24 hours to dispute this and released Roberts on bail until May 7 so a pre-sentence report can be prepared by the probation service. And he told Roberts to expect a prison sentence, saying: ‘I don’t want you to be under any illusions about the sentence you will receive. You should make arrangements prior to that date on the basis that you are going to be away for some time.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Kim Roberts worked as a housekeeper for Dowager Countess Bathurst .

"As a new fashion designer, cementing a place in the market can be tough ground work. Of course, a few celebrity endorsements and a business partner with a little black book packed with A-list contacts doesn't hurt. Kylie Gulliver, a former model and actress (with appearances on Neighbours, Offspring and Winners and Losers on her resume) from Melbourne had been toiling away at her small leather brand for three years, before a very modern encounter - via Instagram - changed her fortune. The 29-year-old's brand Elliott Label is suddenly the hit of Hollywood, and is adorning the backs of stars including Kourtney Kardashian, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and pop group GRL. Scroll down for video . Elliott entourage: Melbourne brand 'Elliott Label' is hitting the big time in Hollywood with Drew Barrymore a fan . Power of the Kardashians: Kourtney (pictured above) wore an Elliott leather cap and  the brand sky-rocketed . The recent projection into the big time comes with the addition of Robin Antin - dancer, choreographer and founder of The Pussycat Dolls and GRL - as Kylie's business partner. Gulliver admits that since Antin has come on board the brand has sky rocketed from being a 'small solely-owned start up' to a complete lifestyle brand that's reaching a mass market across Australia, the US, UK, Norway and Israel. The two met in what is fast becoming the 21st century norm - through Instagram. Antin, 50, initially contacted Gulliver to request samples for her pop group, GRL, and the rest is history. Doll to duo: Robin Antin, founder of The Pussycat Dolls has now joined with Gulliver as partner to Elliott Label . Aussie A-Listers: Mimie Elashiry is one of the brands biggest supporters and currently models for the brand . Luxe leather: Mimie models on the label's website - pictured wearing the Leather Puffer Vest, US$999 (left), and Desert Leather Tank US$239 (right) 'When we  finally met up for the first time, we got along so well it felt like we'd known each other for years,' Gulliver told Daily Mail over the phone from Los Angeles. 'But it wasn't until I came over to visit her in to LA - we'd been throwing around the idea of launching a lingerie brand, but then I saw her insane jacket collection, and I said: ""screw the lingerie line, come in on Eliot label"".' According to Gulliver, it was one of the best decisions she could have made. 'My biggest regret originally was that I didn't start the label with someone, and so when Robin and I decided to work together I finally had someone to do the whole process with me'. And lend her little black book of Hollywood contacts too. Antin who counts Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz as close friends, and has a wide network of A-listers she has been able to give items from the collection to. Charlie's Angels: Robin Antin and Drew Barrymore became friends on the set of Charlie's Angels 2 . Close with Cameron: Robin Antin wears Elliott  puffer vest after dance class with Cameron Diaz . Friendship on film: Robin first struck up a friendship with Drew and Cameron when The Pussycat Dolls featured in Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle . At their recent Elliott Label launch in LA, Barrymore made a red carpet appearance to support the duo. According to Antin, the two share a long history together since early days when Barrymore first spotted The Pussycat Dolls and roped them into starring in Charlie's Angels 2. Barrymore's favourite pieces from their label are said to include the a leather blazer (the one seen worn by Antin at their launch) and a motorcycle vest with a hood. Smouldering: The Moto jacket from Elliott Label collection costs US$750 from the website . High-end: Biker Shorts cost $389, and the silk shirt is $289 . Thousand dollar pants: These leather Biker Pants cost $999 . Diaz, not one to miss out either, also received 'a big bag of goodies' from Antin, 'who took them over to her house and dumped on her couch' and was suitably delighted. The girls know the power of celebrity endorsements, and reveal that  the 2013 paparazzi shots of Kourtney Kardashian wearing a Elliott leather cap was a massive boost despite it happening 'organically.' As is the power of their stockists, such as 'Kyle,' one of the busiest boutiques in Beverly Hills which happens to be owned by Kyle Richards of 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' fame (she is also the aunt of Nicky and Paris Hilton). Eclectic resume: Kylie, 29, from Melbourne, was previously a model and actress, before starting her own label . Yet aside from the big name stars showing their support,  Antin also has a long history in clothing design, with a family history of seamstresses. In the early days of The Pussycat Dolls she would also make the original costumes by hand. 'When  Pussycat Dolls began, I made every costume. So when Kylie came to America and we went through my closet and I showed her everything I had re-done and tailored my way (even clothing by Yves Saint Laurent) it was the perfect marriage.' Of the brand itself, Gulliver says Elliott Label is bold, edgy and has attitude that comes with classic and timeless pieces for the every day girl. 'My aim is to steal a place in the market for well tailored, classic, quality material items at a good price point,' says Gulliver. She likens the label to  Rag and Bone and Alexander Wang -  but with an Australian influence. Gulliver reveals that Elliot Label was originally born out of a period of feeling 'lost' and lacking direction, and so the label became her new motivation. Lady in leather: Gulliver wearing Elliott Label at the Kyle boutique in Beverly Hills . Lost to leather label: Gulliver admits her inspiration for starting Elliott was after a 'lost' period in her life . 'For me it was a lifestyle choice starting the label, I was in a ‘place’ when I started it, I thought, you can talk about it or whinge about life or you can just do it,' says Gulliver. 'I wasn't enjoying what I was doing anymore and when I was  on a holiday in Indonesia  there was only so much tanning I could do then I noticed all the tannery places in Indonesia and that's when the idea came to me.' Now those restless, tanning days are long behind her, the question is how is she adapting to the non-stop business life of a business owner? 'It's stressful at times, the production side of things, language barriers et cetera, but while it's busy and hectic but I do have a work life balance and I'm doing something I love that is rewarding,' she says. Melbourne model to LA label: Kylie Gulliver has grown Elliott Label from small start-up to LA lifestyle brand . So what's next for the leather label? A vegan leather line is their newest addition, which, according to Antin, is already gaining massive 'street cred' amongst the fashion scene in LA. 'I've been walking around in the non leather puffer vest and people are like where did you get that? And I say, ""It's our line"". Then there's  a sport luxe line in collaboration with the pre-existing Pussycat Doll's label. 'We are in the developing stage of sport luxe line, Pussycat Dolls sport. So it will come under the PussyCat Dolls name, but under the Eliott umbrella with Pussycat dolls as inspiration for the collection,' says Antin. The Elliot Label 'Sport luxe' range is hoped to be out for the US summer, as The Pussycat Dolls Vegas shows begin soon and they plan to style the group for the show season. Fashion vs Fallon: Antin and Gulliver  rub shoulder with stars such as Jimmy Fallon (pictured middle) Gulliver has also started consulting as a social media guru for their new joint venture - social media advisory brand - 'Trendsetters.' 'Kylie comes from incredible social media background and we wouldn’t be able to do the business or have met if it wasn't through social media,' says Antin. It seems, the sky is the limit for the growing fashion designer duo, with Antin even hoping for a brand collaboration in the future - 'Look how Tom Ford got started - Kylie and I are just as talented, we have the business sense and creativity to do that, exciting for what future holds for designers and young brand.' As for the lingerie brand they originally planned to do? ‘Oh my god, yes we probably will!’ Right now we're focusing on Elliot Label, but Robin and I are crazy so we might turn around in six months and say it’s time for that lingerie line and we’ll do it,' says Gulliver.","Melbourne based fashion brand Elliott Label makes it in Hollywood .

"TOWIE star Bobby Cole Norris has today thanked an anonymous donor who came forward to help his mother, in her fight against leukaemia. The reality star was left heartbroken last August when doctors revealed his 'best' friend' and mother Kym Norris had just one hope for survival - a stem cell transplant. Weeks earlier the dental receptionist was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. Overcome with emotion, Bobby, tweeted: 'Somewhere there is an amazing person that registered with @AnthonyNolan and was a match for my mum, I will never be able to thank you enough.' TOWIE star Bobby Cole Norris has today thanked an anonymous donor who came forward to help his mother, in her fight against leukaemia . Bobby, tweeted: 'Somewhere there is an amazing person that registered with @AnthonyNolan and was a match for my mum, I will never be able to thank you enough' Bobby launched the #savebobbysmum appeal to urge people to sign up as stem cell donors last August . It comes after the reality star inspired more than 3,000 people to sign the bone marrow donation register in one week, when he issued an appeal for help to save his mother's life. Stars of TOWIE, Made in Chelsea and Geordie Shore rallied behind the #SaveBobbysMum appeal, with tweets from Katie Price, Mark Wright, Joey Essex, Lauren Goodger, Sam Faiers, Lauren Pope, Stevie Johnson, Charlotte Crosby, Vicky Pattison, Antony Costa, Denise Van Outen and many more, mobilising their millions of young fans to sign up as potential donors and save a life. To Bobby's relief, the team at Anthony Nolan were able to identify a stranger on the register of potential donors whose tissue type matched Kym's and who was willing to donate their stem cells. Kym is now back at home while she recovers from the procedure, which took place at UCL Hospital. Bobby is now focusing on supporting his mother during her recovery but has vowed to carry on promoting the lifesaving work of Anthony Nolan. Bobby Cole Norris said: 'I can never thank my mum's donor enough. 'This amazing person hasn't just saved my mum, they've saved me too. 'My mum is my best friend and she's everything to me. 'Without the work of Anthony Nolan, and the hero who donated their stem cells, there would be little hope, it doesn't bear thinking about. 'I genuinely feel like there is an Angel on this earth, I hope one day I can thank them in person.' The reality star was left heartbroken last August when doctors revealed his 'best' friend' and mother Kym Norris had just one hope for survival - a stem cell transplant - after being diagnosed with leukaemia . In the wake of Kym's diagnosis Bobby inspired more than 3,000 people to sign the bone marrow donation register in one week, when he issued an appeal for help to save his mother's life . Reflecting on his appeal, he said: 'When my mum was diagnosed, I felt helpless. 'All I could do apart from being there for mum was to try to raise awareness of the Anthony Nolan register, particularly to young people who are much more likely to go onto donate and save a life. 'I was bowled over by how many people signed up as a result of #SaveBobbysMum, and it's amazing to think that any of these wonderful people could go on to save the life of someone just like my mum.' Ann O'Leary, head of register development at Anthony Nolan, said: 'We're over the moon that we've been able to find a suitable donor for Kym and that she's now on the road to recovery. 'We're so grateful to Bobby for spreading the word about the simple but life-changing act of donating stem cells and setting such an incredible and selfless example to young people. 'It's our goal to save the life of everyone who needs a transplant so it's wonderful that Bobby is now carrying on the fight against blood cancer and urging even more people to come forward and support the work of Anthony Nolan – in particular young men.' Men aged 16 to 30 are seriously under-represented on the Anthony Nolan register, making up only 15 per cent of potential donors -despite being far more likely to go on to donate and save a life than any other group. If you're 16 to 30 and in good health you can join the register online at Anthony Nolan's website here. Chloe Sims, Bobby's TOWIE co-star, was among dozens of celebrities that tweeted their support . And Charlotte Crosby, from Geordie Shore, also gave her backing urging her followers to sign the Anthony Nolan stem cell donation register .","Bobby Cole Norris launched his appeal #SaveBobbysMum last August .

"Tesco chairman John Allan claimed David Cameron's decision to promise an in-out referendum before knowing what powers can be clawed back from Brussels means the cart is very firmly before the horse' Tesco could quit London if Britain leaves the European Union, its chairman has warned in a swipe at David Cameron. John Allan claimed the Tory leader's decision to promise an in-out referendum before knowing what powers can be clawed back from Brussels means the cart is very firmly before the horse'. He suggested large firms like the supermarket giant could move their head offices from London to other sites in Europe 'relatively painlessly', should Britain exit the EU. The Tory election manifesto includes the promise of an in-out referendum by 2017, but only after reform of Britain's membership. It states: 'It will be a fundamental principle of a future Conservative Government that membership of the European Union depends on the consent of the British people – and in recent years that consent has worn wafer-thin. 'That’s why, after the election, we will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in Europe, and then ask the British people whether they want to stay in the EU on this reformed basis or leave. 'David Cameron has committed that he will only lead a government that offers an in-out referendum. We will hold that in-out referendum before the end of 2017 and respect the outcome.' But in an interview with the Independent on Sunday, Mr Allan warns this approach risks backfiring, because it commits to a referendum regardless of whether a better deal has been struck with Brussels. He suggested that a better approach would have been to lobby for reforms first, and then set a date for a referendum. He said: 'Logically, you would have started with 'these are the reforms we would like to see enacted within the EU' and then, at the end of the process, determine whether or not you've made enough progress and then decide if a referendum is necessary.' He said the idea that a referendum will be held in 2017 if a Conservative government comes to power next month could have a real impact on people's investment decisions. 'It's a question of weighing up the pluses and minuses. This issue of the EU referendum and the uncertainty that it creates and the possibility that it could lead to Britain leaving the EU is a particularly heavy kind of pebble to put in the scales,' he told the paper. David Cameron, pictured today, has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017 . Mr Allan, who described his political leaning as being 'pretty close to the centre', was not among the more than 100 senior business leaders who signed an open letter last month praising the Tory Government and warning that Labour could 'put the recovery at risk'. He said he did not think it was advisable to 'choose sides' as firms will have to work with whichever party or parties form the next Government. Mr Allan also warned the political parties to be careful in their approach in dealing with the issue of immigration, saying they had been 'spooked' by Ukip into making declarations on the issue. 'There are problems ... that need to be sorted out, but I think the answer is not to lock the door and throw the key away,' he said. Labour leader Ed Miliband issued a plea to Tory voters worried about leaving the EU to back him instead. In an interview with The Observer he said: 'I am a politician of the left, but I am positioned where the mainstream of politics is positioned. I am on the centre ground of politics,' 'I want to reach out to Tory voters, to Liberal Democrat voters, to Ukip voters, to non-voters ... to people who feel that David Cameron can't answer the challenge of our time, who worry about our place in the European Union, who really think to themselves, 'we can do a lot better as a country'.'","John Allan suggested Tesco could easily move its HQ out of London .

"The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has been caught on camera knocking back drinks with a high-class call girl. But sadly for scandalmongers, the chance encounter between Danny Alexander and Brooke Magnanti – better known by her former alias Belle de Jour – was innocent. The two were snapped at Bar One in Inverness on Friday as part of the Nip festival, which celebrates the gins and whiskies of the Highlands. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander pictured drinking with call girl Brooke Magnanti . Mr Alexander was snapped with Ms Magnati - also known as Belle de Jour - at the Nip festival . It comes as David Cameron faced a growing revolt last night over his 'flat-footed' General Election campaign. Several MPs pointed the finger of blame at the Prime Minister's Australian Election guru Lynton Crosby. And a former Conservative Cabinet Minister criticised George Osborne's 'Dickensian' message on 'Austerity Britain'. The first signs of a Tory wobble emerged after last week's polls suggested that instead of leaving Labour trailing, as Tory chiefs had expected, Labour is slightly ahead. And far from collapsing under the weight of massed Tory attacks, Labour leader Ed Miliband's ratings have improved. In an outspoken intervention, retiring Conservative MP Brian Binley said: 'With the Election campaign well under way, Mr Cameron still appears to be standing apart and aloof, almost like a spectator.' He added: 'Flat-footed and lame, we already look as if we're running to catch up.'","Chief Secretary to the Treasury caught drinking with high-class call girl .

"A commuter is fighting for his life after reportedly bending down to pick up his bag and being hit on the head by a rush-hour Tube train as it pulled into a station. Other passengers watched in horror as the man, said to be in his 20s, was struck by a Northern line train at Stockwell station this morning. The station, which also serves the Victoria line, was shut while medics tended to the passenger who was later taken to hospital. Emergency services were called to Stockwell station in south London this morning after a man sustained life-threatening head injuries while bending down to pick up his bag from the platform . Graphic designer Lesia Biloshytska, who was at the station, told how passengers screamed when the young man was hit. She said: 'A girl who witnessed the whole thing said he had been picking up a bag. 'He must have not realised how close he was to the edge as he bent down and his head bowed too far forwards at just the wrong moment. 'I was standing only maybe five metres away and he was hit by the front of the train as it came into the platform. The train was slowing down but we were at the end where people get into the back carriages. 'There were a lot of people on the platform when it happened, and some were screaming. At first we did not know if he was under the train or not.' She added: 'I could only see his legs. I did not see his injuries because staff were gathering around. It was very frightening. 'At this time of morning the platform is always very crowded. You have to let two or three trains go before you get on one and there is sometimes a little pushing with people trying to get on and off.' Commuters told of their shock after witnessing the accident, which happened shortly before 9am today . A man was rushed to hospital after he was hit in the head by a train at Stockwell this morning. File image . Isabelle Zonderland said: 'I was on the tube when it happened. He got hit only metres from our carriage. 'When we were let off the tube I saw him lying there. Someone who I believe was on the platform was checking for a pulse. His face was covered in blood.' Others went on Twitter to tell of what they had seen. One man posted: 'Just saw a poor guy get his head pretty much sliced off by the tube @ stockwell as he bent over to get his bag. Poor guy. Hoping he's ok.' Chris Duncan tweeted: 'Was on this train. Awful. Man hit in the head by oncoming Tube train in horrific accident.' Nick Brown, London Underground's chief operating officer, said: 'A passenger on a Northern line platform was struck by a train entering Stockwell station. 'Our emergency response team and the London Ambulance Service attended the scene. We are investigating the incident to understand exactly what happened but we have already established that while the station was busy, the platform was not overcrowded.' The accident was witnesses by scores of commuters, who told of their horror on Twitter . The London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called at 8.53am to Stockwell Tube station to reports of an incident. 'We sent an ambulance crew, a paramedic on a motorcycle, duty station officer and London's Air ambulance to the scene. 'We treated a man reported to be in his 20s for head injuries and he was taken as a priority to Kings College hospital.' The accident comes after last month's tragic incident in which Londoner Nick Mann, 35, died of severe head injuries when he attempted to save his 32-year-old brother Robert from being struck by a train at Old Street Tube station. Robert Mann remains in hospital. Earlier in the month, on March 12, a rush-hour passenger was dragged along at Clapham South Tube station - three stops from Stockwell - after getting her coat caught in a train door. The woman ended up falling into the gap between two carriages of the Northern line train and was taken to hospital with serious arm and head injuries.","Man in his twenties said to have bent down to pick up his bag at Stockwell .

"A mother, father and their eight-month old baby boy were killed on Monday when a concrete barrier fell onto their truck as they were driving under an overpass in Washington State. The tragic accident claimed the lives of Josh and Vanessa Ellis and baby Hudson, who were crushed when the 50-foot-long concrete slab slammed down on top of them, according to Bonney Lake Police. The barrier weighed 'tons' according to investigators and the damage to the family's pickup truck was so great that it took them hours to extract the bodies. Scroll down for video . Tragic accident: Josh and Vanessa had been married for five years and their baby boy Hudson was only eight months old at the time of the crash . Community: Josh and Vanessa were both youth pastors at the EastPointe FourSquare Church in Bonney Lake . Demolished: This picture show the complete devastation the concrete block wrought on the family pickup truck . Clean-up: A car drives on Angeline Road under the state Route 410 overpass, Tuesday, April 14, 2015, the day after a young couple and their son were killed when a concrete slab fell from the overpass . Poignant: A cross, a stuffed animal and flowers are shown at a makeshift memorial for Josh and Vanessa Ellis and baby Hudson who were killed on . Scene: Josh, Vanessa and baby Hudson were crushed to death after a concrete slab fell from a construction site on a Washington state bridge and landed on their truck. Above, the crushed vehicle . Fatal: The married couple and their baby were driving underneath the state's Route 410 overpass in Bonney Lake - where workers were installing a sidewalk - on Monday morning. Above, the scene . Shockingly, authorities thought that only one person had been killed by the impact, but discovered to their horror that an entire family had been crushed to death according to KIRO TV. While America once had the world's best road and transportation network system, but now it is crumbling. Indeed, according to a former US Transport Secretary, Ray LaHood said there are 70,000 bridges that have been deemed structurally deficient across the nation. LaHood made this damning statistic abundantly clear when he told CBS News, 'I don't want to say they're unsafe. But they're dangerous. I would agree with that.' Moreso, every four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) releases its comprehensive assessment of the state of US infrastructure. In its most recent one, from 2013, it gave the nation a grading of D+. Across the United States there are 607,380 bridges according to the ASCE and they have an average lifespan of 42 years. Out of those bridges, one in nine is considered to be structurally problematic. Chief among those are the Storrow Drive Bridge in Boston, which has cement too thick for its steel structure to continue supporting and the US Route 1/9 Bridge over the Passaic River in New Jersey, which is rusted. One of the reasons why things have got so bad is due of course to dwindling investment. From 1950 to the 1990s, the investment in infrastructure across the nation stood at two percent of GDP. That fell to 1.5 percent in 2012. As a comparison China spends seven percent of its GDP on infrastructure and India, five percent. So large is the problem, that experts have said that either an upsurge in money to rebuilding the nation is needed, or the country will begin to suffer huge problems over the next generation. Source: The Week/CBS . Bonney Lake police Officer Todd Green told the New York Daily News that the Ellis family would likely have died on impact and not known much about the accident. He said he was confident about this assessment because they found no break marks under the bridge, leading him to believe they had no warning. 'This is a very unfortunate and sad circumstance, especially in a town this size,' Green said. 'This is something that will hit our community big time.' The couple celebrated their five year wedding anniversary in early March and were pastors at their local church. At the time of the incident, construction crews were working on the sidewalk installation project, it is reported. When they finally managed to reach the damaged truck, they found the victims inside. 'We were just heading down the street ... and I could hear three snaps and down it went on top of the truck,' witness Dawn Nelson, who was riding in a car behind the pickup, told KING-TV. She added: 'There was nothing anyone could do. It was just surreal.' It remains unknown what caused the 'very heavy' concrete structure to fall, King 5 reported. City spokesman Woody Edvalson said the material that fell in Bonney Lake - situated around 30 mile southeast of Seattle, Washington - was part of the original span, which was built in 1992. It has a sufficiency rating of 95.3 out of 100, according to The News Tribune. Investigation: A worker takes photographs under the state Route 410 overpass on Tuesday, the day after a young couple and their son were killed . Workers on-site: As the family drove under the overpass, a chunk of concrete fell onto the roadway, crushing their pickup truck. Above, workers are pictured at the scene, shortly after the family of three were killed . Press conference: Above, Todd Green, center, of Bonney Lake Police Department, is seen talking to reporters on Monday . Construction for a $1.8 million city sidewalk project to improve pedestrian access along the highway started about a month ago. The contractor WHH Nisqually had crews on the scene on Monday. 'The project was to add a pedestrian walkway along that overpass on SR 410,' Mr Edvalson told reporters following Monday's tragedy, adding: 'This accident occurred as a result of that effort.' The project included rebuilding the north side of the bridge, adding a sewer line, widening SR 410 between the bridge and 192nd Avenue, and adding bases for future street lights, it is reported. Bonney Lake police, the state Department of Transportation and WHH Nisqually are investigating.

"The Duke of York has made his first public appearance since lurid sex claims made about him were struck off the public record by a Florida judge. A visibly relieved Andrew was visiting the offices of AkzoNobel, a paint firm based in Slough, and smiled broadly as he chatted to employees. The 55-year-old, who was at the factory as part of his work with the Outward Bound Trust, has always denied that he had any sort of relationship with Virginia Roberts. Relieved: The Duke of York made his first public appearance since sex claims against him were thrown out . Today, it was business as usual for the royal, who arrived in a chauffeur-driven racing green Bentley and was shown products from AkzoNobel's best-known range, Dulux Paints. The Duke also spent 40 minutes in a private meeting with Matt Pullen, the company's UK managing director, and other senior staff members. The trip to Slough comes less than five days after claims that Andrew had sex with an under-age teenager were removed from civil court records following a federal judge’s ruling. The allegations were made by Miss Roberts, now 31, who had claimed she was the sex slave of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein - a former friend of Andrew's. Prince Andrew has always vehemently denied the claims - as has Buckingham Palace which took the unprecedented step of issuing a denial shortly after the allegations came to light. Smiling: A visibly relieved Andrew could barely keep the smile off his face during the visit to Slough . Denied: The Duke has always denied the lurid accusations made by Virginia Roberts, now 31 . Speaking after his meeting with the Duke, Mr Pullen brushed off suggestions that his company might by tarnished by association with Andrew and instead emphasised the 'fantastic relationship' between the two. 'To be honest this is a long-standing engagement and he’s the patron of the Outward Bound Trust, who we have a fantastic relationship with,' said Mr Pullen, adding: 'It's great to have him here.' The allegations were part of submissions made by lawyers acting for Miss Roberts, who wanted to join an existing civil lawsuit. It was launched by two women, also alleged Epstein victims, against US federal prosecutors’ handling of the financier’s conviction for a sex offence. He was sentenced to 18 months in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution but lawyers for the women claim a secret plea deal he struck with prosecutors, granting him and any potential co-conspirators immunity from further prosecution, violated their clients’ rights. Listening in: Prince Andrew used the visit to meet senior staff at paint firm AkzoNobel . Shown around: Andrew was shown many of the firm's products, including their Dulux paint range . Speaking out: Andrew used the occasion to make a speech about the Outward Bound Trust . US District Judge Kenneth Marra refused Ms Roberts permission to join the lawsuit, and said in his written judgement that the sex abuse details had no bearing on the lawsuit’s goal of reopening the Epstein non-prosecution agreement. During the visit to Slough, the Duke was told about the research project AkzoNobel staff are conducting in a bit to find effective ways of using colour to enhance the learning environment for children in schools. Along with Dulux, the firm produces paint under the Cuprinol and Hammerite brands, as well as performance coatings for F1 McLaren cars and supertankers. It has also long been involved with the Outward Bound Trust, on whose board the Duke of York sits, and has raised more than £1m for the charity. The charity aims to boost the life skills and confidence of young people via outdoor activities. In a speech to AkzoNobel staff, Andrew highlighted the importance of the trust’s work: 'We need to encourage young people today, to understand there is a need for leadership and there is a need for teamwork and that’s different to management,' he said. 'This is about actually encouraging young people to recognise they have more in them then they ever realised before.'

"A woman has become the latest victim of violent anti-immigrant protests sweeping South Africa after she was left covered in blood when rocks were thrown through her car window. So far six people are believed to have been killed in the violent protests which started two weeks ago in Durban, a key port on South Africa's Indian Ocean coast, spreading to Johannesburg. In the latest show of violence around 200 protesters, shouting that they wanted immigrants to leave the country, pelted passing vehicles and the police with rocks. Scroll down for video . Victim: Carol Lloyd was left injured and covered in blood after rocks were thrown at and shattered her car window in the latest wave of anti-immigrant protests near Johannesburg in South Africa . Armed: South African police were called in to help foreign nationals as violent protests spread to Johannesburg, threatening more killings . People run for cover from a stun grenade and tear gas after a skirmish between locals and foreign nationals in Durban, South Africa, today . A group of foreign nationals threaten to defend themselves as police get between them and South Africans after a peace march in Durban . Carol Lloyd was forced to stop her car as she drove close to Jeppestown after she was injured when a rock smashed through her car window. South African police responded to the wave of protests, which are motivated by the large number of immigrants and high unemployment rates, by firing rubber bullets and tear gas today to disperse the crowds. Protests began two weeks ago and six people have been killed, and dozens of foreign nationals have emptied their shops and fled over fears of attacks. Violence flared days after Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini said in remarks reported by local media that foreigners should leave South Africa. He has since said his comments were misinterpreted. Addressing parliament in Cape Town on Thursday, President Zuma reiterated his condemnation of the violence, calling it a 'violation' of South Africa's values. Ms Lloyd stopped her car near Jeppestown, close to Johannesburg, after her window was smashed (left) and she was left bloodied (right) In Actonville, South African men were seen singing, armed with clubs and pieces of wood, as they called for foreign shop owners to leave .

Raid: Anti-riot police today raided a hostel in Benonu where local residents are suspected have taken part in the large scale protests . Weapons: Police in Benoni have been looking for guns in the homes of protesters, who have been throwing rocks at trucks carrying supplies . 'No amount of frustration or anger can ever justify the attacks on foreign nationals and the looting of their shops,' he said. 'We condemn the violence in the strongest possible terms. The attacks violate all the values that South Africa embodies.' He also said the government was taking steps to secure its porous borders and making progress in setting up a Border Management Agency, announced last year and scheduled to be up and running in 2016. The ruling African National Congress party has condemned the attacks as 'shameful' and branded them 'criminal acts against vulnerable people'. In the past two weeks, shops and homes owned by Somalis, Ethiopians, Malawians and other immigrants in Durban and surrounding townships have been targeted, forcing families to flee to camps protected by armed guards. Foreign nationals living near Johannesburg were today seen removing items from their shops and shutting up their stores because of fears they could be targeted by protesters.

Shop owners fearing for their lives have been seen emptying their stores while armed police officers stand guard to protect them . Another officer is seen standing guard as locals empty their shops and officials struggle to contain the violence sweeping the country . They fled after a mobile phone text message was apparently sent to shop owners, warning them to shut their premises, claiming that 'Zulu people are coming to town... to kill every foreigner on the road'. In Primrose, near Germiston and about 15km out of Johannesburg, dozens of shops have been left empty and owners were seen transporting their wares on trucks today. And in Durban, where many of the attacks began, thousands of people have been seen marching through the streets calling for an end to the violence. Durban's impoverished townships have been at the heart of the recent clashes between locals and immigrants, following a similar spate of attacks on foreign-owned shops in Soweto, near Johannesburg, earlier this year. More than 1,000 foreigners in Durban have fled their homes and are now living in makeshift camps under police guard. Hundreds of people took part in a peace march today after anti-immigrant violence flared in Durban. Meanwhile, foreigners fled their homes .

Police have repeatedly clashed with protesters who are threatening violence, looting stores and setting fires in KwaMashu and Umlazi . Threatening: Streets have been destroyed by gangs of protesters keen to intimidate and scare immigrants to leave the country . Safe camps have been established in the coastal city of Durban for fleeing immigrants whose shops were looted and burned down. The fear felt by many was palpable as dozens of foreigners sought refuge at a police station outside Johannesburg and stayed there overnight, according to police spokesman, Col. Lungelo Dlamini. Patrick Gaspard, the US ambassador to South Africa who was born in Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Haitian parents, spoke in defence of the immigrants. 'As an immigrant to my own country, my heart goes out to those who have been attacked for being different,' Mr Gaspard said in a statement. In a statement, Tina Ghelli, spokesman for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said the Minister of International Relations, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, will on Friday meet with diplomats from several African countries to discuss the government's efforts to protect immigrants. The governments of Malawi and Zimbabwe have begun efforts to repatriate citizens affected by the attacks.

South Africa has a population of about 50 million, but an estimated five million immigrants and its high jobless rate, widespread poverty and glaring income disparities make it a ripe candidate for outbreaks of anti-immigrant violence. Unemployment is officially around 25 percent but economists say in reality it is much higher. Johannesburg was the epicentre of the 2008 xenophobic attacks that killed more than 60 people and saw violence spread through the area.

"Cosmetic surgery is often done in secret - patients hiding out at home until the bruising and swelling goes down while friends' suspicions are waylaid with a new haircut. But one Australian woman is making her nose job so public, it even has its own hashtag.

Miss Langley is currently in Bangkok recovering at a hotel post-surgery, but has remained active on her social media accounts, posting videos on Snapchat and sharing snaps on Instagram. She informed her followers of her impending surgery via the latter one week ago. 'I've always wanted this since I was a lot younger, and I decided why not, if it makes me happy and improves my self esteem then I'm doing it!' she wrote. 'Yes plastic surgery is a controversial thing to do but this is my life and it's something I've wanted to do for so long and especially before my wedding.' Post-op selfie: Langley is currently in a Bangkok hotel recovering from surgery, but has remained active on social media . Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia from her hotel in Bangkok, Miss Langley explained her motivation for going public further. 'I have quite a big following on social media and I don't want to lie about it,' she said. 'I think people are more accepting of the decision if you own it. 'I've seen so many other girls on social media get things done and then try and hide it. 'I have been a bit scared about getting negative feedback,' Rhiannon added, revealing that she kept hitting 'refresh' on her phone to read the comments coming through after she posted the announcement on Instagram.

She also revealed to DMA that the results of the surgery will be 'quite drastic,' with changes made to the shape and length of her nose. But the true results won't show for another six months, when post-surgery swelling has gone down completely. Miss Langley wanted to share her experience with her followers, having found no one in her friendship circle to turn to for guidance on what the surgery and recovery would be like. 'None of my friends have had nose jobs, so I was searching on the Internet and couldn't find anything useful,' she said. 'I'm owning my decision': Rhiannon says  that she decided to be honest rather than hiding it from her followers . 'So I decided to post about my experience, post photos, share how I feel, how I look, and what I've gone through.' Miss Langley is sharing videos and pictures day-by-day on her Snapchat and Instagram accounts respectively, and is planning blog posts as well as filming a video diary throughout her 'journey'. The trip to Thailand started out as a relaxing beach holiday for Langley and fiancé Jody Abrahams, before the couple travelled to Bangkok for the surgery. Her sunny vacation snaps and videos have been replaced with confronting, raw glimpses of Langley in recovery, sporting a swollen face and bruised purple eyes. Nuptials: Langley says her Thailand medical tourism package holiday was financially motivated, as she cannot afford surgery in Australia with her upcoming wedding to fiancé Jody (pictured) to pay for . Rhiannon says her motivation to take her surgery overseas was financially motivated. 'The price difference [between Australia and Thailand] is huge,' she told DMA. 'I'm getting married in a year, so I couldn't afford to have the surgery in Australia.' Her trip to Thailand is a $5,190 'Bangkok Nose Job' package with CosMediTour. The Medical Tourism Agency has confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that while they have assisted the social media influencer with finding accommodation, Langley paid the full rate for her surgery package. The packages include four to five star accommodation and meals, as well as the full cost of hospitalisation and surgery. Dream: The hair dresser has wanted the nose correction since she was a teenager . 'Rhiannon had been considering Rhinoplasty for a long time and she approached CosMediTour after being referred from a friend who previously had surgery through CosMediTour. We are very happy to have her as a client,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Rhiannon has a loyal Instagram following and she wanted to Blog about her Rhinoplasty experience as it was something that she didn't want to hide. 'We use fully accredited hospitals with internationally trained and highly skilled Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons and have CosMediTour personnel in all destinations. We create four and five star packages which include surgery, accommodation, transfers, meals and don't charge any additional agency fee for our services.' Langley said she has wanted nose correction surgery since she was a teen, and wanted it done before her wedding to Abrahams in 2016. 'He likes me as I am now, but he supports my decision and is here taking care of me,' Rhiannon said. And she wasn't put off by recent criticism of the industry following the death of Gold Coast woman, Evita Nicole Sarmonikas, in Mexico after a reported buttock implants, or the story of Courtney O'Keefe, from Perth, who contracted a life-threatening infection following breast enlargement surgery in Thailand. 'I have had a lot of friends use Cosmeditour for boob jobs and tummy tucks, and have seen such good results,' so I didn't hesitate for a second,' said Langley. Langley started her blog and Instagram accounts two years ago as a way to promote her home hairdressing business. Her following has grown to over 189,000, and the pretty brunette has capitalised on her popularity, launching a body oil business and working on a swimwear line.","Rhiannon Langley, from Melbourne, is undergoing Rhinoplasty in Bangkok .

"The Clinton Foundation will continue to accept donations from foreign governments despite the risk of a conflict of interest now that its founder is running for the White House. The charity announced on Wednesday that it has decided to continue to look abroad for millions of dollars while limiting donor nations to a select group of six. The change in policy comes as former board member Hillary Clinton undertakes her presidential campaign. The foundation's reliance on funding from several Middle East governments that suppress dissent and women's rights — concerns that the State Department focused on during her stint as secretary of state — sparked criticism and gave Republicans a new offensive against the leading Democrat. Clinton resigned from the foundation's board last week. Scroll down for video . Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, pictured on Tuesday, meets with local residents at the Jones St. Java House in LeClaire, Iowa. She resigned from the board of the Clinton foundation last week . The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation's board said on Wednesday night that future donations will only be allowed from the governments of Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom — all nations that previously supported the charity's health, poverty and climate change programs. Longtime U.S. allies, the six maintain relatively uncontroversial ties to the U.S. While direct contributions from other governments would be halted, those nations could continue participating in the Clinton Global Initiative, a subsidiary program that encourages donors to match contributions from others to tackle international problems without direct donations to the charity. Donations greater that $25million . Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada) Fred Eychaner . Frank Giustra, The Radcliffe Foundation .

The Hunter Foundation * . Kingdom of Saudi Arabia * . The Victor Pinchuk Foundation . Cheryl and Haim Saban & The Saban Family Foundation * . The ELMA Foundation . Theodore W. Waitt . However, the foundation will stop holding CGI meetings abroad — a final session is scheduled for Morocco in May — and most foreign governments will no longer be allowed to sponsor programs. Clinton Foundation donations between 2001 and 2015 showed governments and agencies from 16 nations previously gave direct grants of between $55 million and $130 million. In addition to the six nations that will be allowed to continue donating, the others were Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Kuwait, Italy, Brunei, Taiwan and the Dominican Republic. The foundation also will begin disclosing its donors every quarter instead of annually — an answer to long-standing criticism that the foundation's once-a-year lists made it difficult to view shifts and trends in the charity's funding. Former President Bill Clinton and other foundation officials have long defended the charity's transparency, but the new move signaled sensitivity to those concerns, particularly as his wife begins her race for the White House. Hillary Clinton's campaign referred questions about the board's action to the foundation. Last month, while she was still a board member, Clinton defended the family charity to questions about its reliance on donations from foreign governments, saying the foundation had 'hundreds of thousands of donors.' Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said that under the new disclosure policy, 'the Clinton Foundation is reinforcing its commitment to accountability while protecting programs that are improving the lives of millions of people around the world'. But he also insisted that the old annual disclosure policy went 'above and beyond what's required by voluntarily disclosing our more than 300,000 donors on our website for anyone to see'. Hillary Clinton had previously agreed with the Obama administration to limit new foreign donations to the foundation while she served as secretary of state, but at least six nations that previously contributed still donated to the charity during her four-year stint. Bill and Hillary Clinton address the audience during a Clinton Global Initiative event last September in New York. Donations to their foundation between 2001 and 2015 showed governments and agencies from 16 nations previously gave direct grants of between $55 million and $130 million . Bill Clinton in Saudi Arabia for the Global Competitiveness Forum in 2011. Saudi Arabia has been a generous donor to the Clinton Foundation - but will not be allowed to donate while Hillary makes her bid for the White House due to criticism over Middle East governments which suppress dissent and women's rights . In one case, the foundation failed to notify the State Department about a donation from the government of Algeria. Clinton Foundation officials had hinted in recent weeks that the organization was considering new limits on foreign government donations after several media accounts this year raised questions about the foundation's reliance on those practices. The foundation's board began discussions over the past two days about altering some of the charity's procedures in an effort that officials said was aimed at improving transparency without harming fundraising for critical programs. Potential problems may exist among some of the six governments that will be allowed to continue providing direct donations to the foundation. For examples, the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, which has already given the foundation between $250,000 and $500,000, has pushed for the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. The project is a domestic flashpoint in the climate change debate as well as a contentious issue regarding its impact on jobs and oil supplies. President  Obama has yet to decide whether to approve the pipeline, which would span several U.S. states, but he has already vetoed one bill aimed at swiftly approving the plan. Foundation officials said the charity is not involved in the Keystone XL issue and has a 'strong program' aimed at curbing reducing carbon emissions.","Future donations will only be allowed from the governments of Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom .

She wore her hair in a half up-do, with a Sixties-style beehive - perhaps in reference to her grandfather's heyday. Her chic dress had white flower detail embroidered on the bodice, while layers of tulle gave the skirt extra volume. Among the guests were Poppy's mother Sara and her grandmother Tina, Bobby's first wife. Poppy was only 18 months old when her famous grandfather died in February, 1993. The England and West Ham legend who captained the 1966's World Cup winning side was only 51 when he lost his battle with bowel cancer. She and Bobby's two other grandchildren Freddie and Ava marked the 20th anniversary of his death in 2013 by placing the ball on the spot for a West Hame home game, the club he captained for ten years.

Her mother Sara told The Mirror: 'Bobby would’ve been very proud of his granddaughter and very happy. She is a beautiful young lady and a credit to us all. 'It was a very special day, it was lovely. Her father Dean would have been so proud of her, too. It’s such a shame that he couldn’t be with us.' The Moore family experienced tragedy when Poppy's father Dean died young. Poppy, who was just 19 at the time, paid an emotional tribute to 'the best man in my life'.

"A Formula One fan was arrested on Friday after he ran across the track during practice for the Chinese Grand Prix. The man is believed to have scaled the 10-foot grandstand fence before sprinting across the start-finish straight in between cars and then climbing the pit wall. It was reported that the fan then walked into the Ferrari garage expressing his desire to race a grand prix car. The man scaled the grandstand on the start-finish straight before running across the track during practice . After darting across the start-finish line during the second practice session he then made a bid for the pit wall . The man then climbs on to the pit wall and hauls himself over before heading to the Ferrari garage . The man was later said to have been waving his entry ticket and shouting: 'I want a car. I've got a ticket' Waving his entry ticket, it is believed the local man shouted: 'I want a car. I have got a ticket.' He was promptly handed over to the authorities and taken away from the circuit. Bystanders say he seemed a bit crazed, but not obviously drunk. The escapade will alarm Chinese officials, said to be embarrassed by the incident, with entry on to the circuit where cars reach speeds in excess of over 200mph, strictly prohibited. Motorsport's governing body, the FIA, is currently looking into the matter, alongside the promoters and circuit officials. Neil Horan, wearing a kilt and waving a religious banner, took on a gaggle of cars at the 2003 British GP . The incident, which took place during the second practice session at the Shanghai International Circuit, will have evoked memories of the 2003 British Grand Prix when a protester stormed the track. Drivers were forced to take evasive action as fanatic Neil Horan, wearing a kilt and waving a religious banner, took on a a gaggle of cars at the 200mph Hangar Straight. The safety car was deployed before Horan was tackled by a race marshall and arrested. Friday's incident also comes a year after the chequered flag at the Chinese Grand Prix was waved a lap early. 'I thought I was starting my last lap and I glanced up and saw something waving, and realised it was the chequered flag,' race-winner Lewis Hamilton said of the embarrassing gaffe by a circuit marshall. 'I lifted and lost about a second and a half but the team said ""keep going"". They told me the race stopped there. If the radio had failed and I had slowed down and Nico came past, that would have really sucked. Thank God, it didn’t.'

"Four-month-old baby Evan Summerfield, who died from meningitis, just hours after laughing for the very first time . A family have been left devastated after their four-month-old baby died from meningitis just 12 hours after laughing for the very first time. Evan Summerfield from Devon had just learned how to giggle and take his dummy out by himself but just hours later he was fighting for his life. The youngster had woken from a nap with a rash stretching from his head to his belly-button. And when his great-grandmother carried out the 'glass test', she saw that it didn't fade under pressure. He was rushed to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth but despite doctors and nurses battling to save him, Evan was diagnosed with meningoccal septicaemia and died soon after. His death has devastated his parents Shannon Summerfield, 17, and Kris Adams, 19, who have been left confused as to how he could fall ill so quickly. Evan's grandmother Sarah Summerfield, 38, said: 'We're so confused how fast this horrible, nasty illness just takes hold. 'One moment he was laughing and smiling and then, it seems like in a heartbeat, he was so cruelly taken away.' Evan was born on November 3 last year and was just four-months-old when he took ill with a high temperature while staying with his great grandparents. His grandmother explained: 'They took him to the doctors and that was the first and last time he laughed. It's like he left it for us. 'The doctor said he had a virus and gave him Calpol and Nurofen, and said if it gets worse he should come straight back. 'They went home and put him to bed and he was fine, but in the morning he had a rash from the top of his head to his belly button. 'My mum did the glass test and called 999 - she was so quick-thinking - it would be easy to think it was chicken pox. The death of Evan, pictured, has devastated his family, who are unable to comprehend how quickly he fell ill . Doctors at the Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, pictured, battled to save Evan but he later died . 'I just remember him having doctors and nurses all around him. But he was pronounced dead at 10.15am. 'I’m 38 and I never thought I would have to sort out a funeral, never mind for my 17-year-old daughter having to organise one for her four-month-old son. Meningitis Research Foundation estimates that there are around 3,400 cases of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK and Ireland. This means that every day nine people become ill with the disease. With one in ten people dying, a death will occur almost every day. A further two people will be left with life-altering after effects as severe as brain damage, deafness and multiple amputations. Symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia: . Source: Meningitis Research Foundation . 'It’s not right. I should have gone first before my grandson. 'He was so loved by everyone around him and everyone who saw him would comment on his gorgeous big, blue eyes. He was such a content baby. 'He had just learnt a new trick of taking his dummy out, and he loved the Simpsons, Iggle Piggle and 64 Zoo Lane - and even used to watch MASH with his great grandad. 'Everyone said what a brilliant mother Shannon was and Kris was a brilliant father. Even if Shannon just left the room for a second when she came back he would say ""muh"" and his big eyes would be beaming.' Now family friend Charlie McManus has set up a fund-raising page to help pay for Evan’s funeral, and help ease some of the family’s heartbreak. The family wanted to thank everyone for their donations, and have seen more than £1,000 given for Evan’s funeral. All extra money will be donated to the Meningitis Research Foundation in the hope it will help stop other families going through the same thing. Mrs Sumemrfield added: 'We’re not looking to give him a king's funeral, just what he deserves. We’re so grateful to everyone, people have been so kind. 'We also want to warn people to be vigilant - it’s just shocking. There is a vaccine available now which hasn’t been licensed yet because there are debates over price. 'But how can you put a price on life, it’s sickening. “We should be protecting younger generations not having pharmaceutical companies holding them to ransom and arguing over price.'

"Friends of a British backpacker who drowned during a diving trip on the Great Barrier Reef claim staff deleted photos that were taken shortly before the doomed young woman left the boat. Bethany Farrell, 23, from Essex, died on February 17 while in Queensland's Whitsundays, a week into her dream gap-year when she went scuba diving for the first time. Two people who were on the boat when Ms Farrell died have taken to TripAdvisor to slam Wings Diving Adventures for the way they handled the tragic circumstances. While one of the reviews criticises the way people on the boat were treated amid the panic, a friend makes the shocking claim that photos of the backpacker shortly before she died were deleted. The backpacker's father is devastated that picture evidence, which may have been able to explain some of the mystery behind the drowning, was discarded before police could see it. British backpacker Bethany Farrell, 23, died on February 17 while scuba diving in Queensland's Whitsundays . 'There is no excuse,' Bethany's father Patrick Farrell, 47, told the Courier Mail. 'Grave mistakes have been made. Ultimately her life was in their hands. Now she’s dead.' Ms Farrell drowned on her first ever scuba dive after she became separated from her instructor while swimming on the Great Barrier Reef, a week after beginning her gap year. She was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay, a beauty spot popular with divers. A post mortem determined the cause of death was drowning. Last week a number of reviews from distressed fellow travellers - who were on the charter when Ms Farrell died - emerged, slamming the tour guides' handling of the situation and claiming photographs were deliberately deleted. 'What was supposed to be a dream trip turned into the worst possible nightmare,' one user wrote. The same traveller claimed the crew had taken photographs of Ms Farrell with others before the dive, but when they contacted Wings Diving Adventure to try and get hold of the images they had been deleted. Scathing reviews have been posted to TripAdvisor slamming the Wings Diving Adventures charter boat operators and claiming they deleted photographs of Ms Farrell . The young woman was just one week into gap year in Australia when she tragically drowned . Ms Farrell was on her first scuba diving trip when she tragically drowned near Blue Pearl Bay (pictured) 'We got in contact with wings solely because they had pictures their staff had taken of the three of us before the dive. Wings deleted these pictures to make way for pictures of their next trip.... despite the likelihood of the police wanting those pictures as evidence,' the review also read. 'Wings have made no effort in contacting our friend's family to express their condolences, we feel they are an absolute disgrace.' Another diver also on the same boat made similar claims, saying the people on the boat were left without any information for a number of hours after the incident which claimed Ms Farrell's life. 'The girl who had the accident was found dead, and what's worst is that I now know that they deleted all of the pictures that had been taken on the boat before they could give it to the girl's family or police,' another review claimed. 'This is destruction of evidence, and I want to make sure that Wings does not get away with this,' the traveller continued. This report was written by a distressed woman who was on the boat when Ms Farrell drowned. Wings refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Australia . Ms Farrell (not pictured) was found 11 metres down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay in the Whitsundays . When contacted by Daily Mail Australia, Wings Diving Adventures declined to comment on the incident, or whether any photographs had been deleted. Queensland police said they could not comment on specific elements of the investigation. Ms Farrell's father said he was not going on a 'witch hunt' but was desperate to get the truth about his daughter's death and the photographs. 'I don’t want to go on a witch hunt. But this will go to an inquest. We’re heartbroken and will do anything to get to the truth,' he told the Courier Mail. The former soldier, who lives in Colchester, Essex, last spoke to his daughter on Skype two days before her death. Mr Farrell, who is divorced from Miss Farrell’s mother Caron, said at the time: ‘The instructor had three students, one of them was Bethany. One of the students decided she did not want to dive but we have not got the exact reasons why, so she remained on the boat which left the instructor, Bethany and one of her friends. ‘At some point, the diving instructor lost sight of Bethany, then realised he could not locate her, returned the other student to the surface, sought help and went back down, presumably with some other people to help. ‘They found Bethany dead 11 metres down. They were meant to be diving to a depth of 5 metres.’ The family has been told it could be months before the events leading up to Miss Farrell’s death are fully understood. Ms Farrell, who studied English literature and media at Southampton Solent University, had been in Australia for a week and met up with some friends who were already there. She had been planning to work in the country for a year and posted a series of images to her account on photosharing website Instagram in the days before her death on February 17. The case is still being investigated by Queensland Police, who will hand a report over to the coroner.","Bethany Farrell, 23, died during a scuba diving trip on February 17, 2015 .

The illustrator is hoping to send out a more serious message with his latest work, as he asks women to share their thoughts on gender violence by writing them on pairs of pants and sharing via social media . And Palombo says the response has been 'immediate and powerful'. He said: 'Gender violence is a serious problem that can only be overcome through cultural and social education. 'Men must rebel against machismo and fight strongly gender violence. We must do it constantly and relentlessly. 'We need stronger law to fight violence against women.' The #briefmessage campaign to fight violence against women is an opportunity for women - and men - to share their feelings about machismo and violence in 2015 . Palambo says the response has been 'immediate and powerful' The messages, written by Italian women in a combination of English and Italian, range from the rather cheeky 'My balls [sic] bigger than yours' to the very simple 'No Rape'. Some are statements of defiance, lots focus on the perpetrator being weaker than the victim. One woman holds out her pair with the phrase, 'I'm not an object I'm a subject', another reads, 'I teach my son respect'. Another participant, making a stand against domestic violence, holds the statement: 'Never let the hand you hold, hold you down.' Other stark messages include: 'Weak men beat women', 'violence is weakness disguised as strength, and 'women are warriors, lose the abuser'. He says: 'Gender violence is a serious problem that can only be overcome through cultural and social education . 'Men must rebel against machismo and fight strongly gender violence. We must do it constantly and relentlessly,' says the artist . Many men have joined the social media campaign holding up their pants with phrases such as 'I'm a feminist' and 'women are not objects' emblazoned on them. AleXsandro Palombo is a contemporary artist known for irreverent and colourful art that often draws attention to controversial issues.

"A hero pilot pulled his plane out of a terrifying North Sea nosedive with just seven seconds to spare. The plane began to plunge after it was struck by lightning, but autopilot ignored the pilot’s commands to climb and tried to crash the plane into the sea. The airliner pitched down, falling at 9,500ft a minute, and fell to just 1,100ft above the ocean before its commander wrestled back control just moments before it was about to crash into the icy water. The Loganair flight was just seconds from crashing into the north sea before its commander saved the day . The 42-year-old pilot put out a Mayday emergency signal before regaining control and saving his 30 passengers and three crew just moments before the plane plunged into the sea. The island-hopping Loganair flight from Aberdeen to Shetland was put off its approach by thunderstorms, snow, hail and 70mph winds on the evening of December 15. A ball of lightning then appeared outside the cockpit and a lightning bolt struck the Saab 2000 plane’s nose, and then travelled the full length of the aircraft before leaving its tail. The aircraft landed safely in Aberdeen with only minor damage and no injuries. An AAIB probe discovered that the autopilot on the Loganair Saab 2000 G-LGNO had remained engaged and the pilot’s actions were countered by the system, causing the dive. No technical problems were found with the aircraft, which is now back in service, and pilot training is now included simulations of the incident according to the AAIB report.","Loganair Aberdeen to Shetland flight struck by lightning on approach .

"A 16-year-old girl sobbed in court as she faced the parents of three classmates who died after the SUV she was driving crashed last August. Julia Ware, who was 15 at the time of the accident, appeared at Wayne County Court in Honesdale, Pennslyvania, on Wednesday. The families of Shamus Digney, Cullen Keffer and Ryan Lesher  - who were all 15 - watched her admit to five of the 12 counts she was charged with by prosecutors. After the hearing was over, a grieving father branded Ware, of Pleasantville, New York, a murderer. Scroll down for video .

Lisa Lesher held a picture of her son Ryan as she entered the Wayne County Courthouse on Wednesday . The tenth grader accepted responsibility for three felony counts of homicide by vehicle and  two misdemeanor counts of accident involving death or injury. She struggled with her emotions throughout the proceedings and tried to avoid eye contact. Her father, Michael Ware, is awaiting trial on three counts of involuntary manslaughter, endangering the welfare of children and other charges for allegedly allowing Ware to drive, the Bucks County Courier Times reported. A written statement from Ware claimed the man gave her permission to drive so she could go pick up breakfast, according to the Times-Tribune. No trial date is set for the 53-year-old. Ware will be back in court within a month for the juvenile equivalent of sentencing and there are some who feel she should be treated as an adult. Ware was speeding when she lost control and her SUV rolled over in Paupack Township back in August . The father of one of the dead boys, Ed Lesher, said: 'She knew she was wrong. 'She knew she shouldn't have been driving. She knew she was going fast. 'The boys were telling her to slow down. She didn't slow down. 'She thought it was funny to go faster. She murdered three boys, one of them my son Ryan. 'She should be punished like her father.'

During the crash, which occurred over Labor Day weekend in Paupack Township, two other passengers in Ware's 2001 Chevrolet Suburban were injured, WNEP reported. Police think the unlicensed driver was speeding when she lost control of the SUV. It rolled over several times during the deadly accident. John Stieh, who represented Ware, said: '[The Ware family has] done nothing but express the deepest of sorrows since this happened. 'You saw the torment that girl had today. You saw the upset.'

"Meet the woman who's given Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money when it comes to walking down the aisle. 39-year-old Lianna Barrientos married ten men in eleven years - and married six of them in one year alone, it's been revealed. Barrientos, however, was nabbed by authorities after saying her 2010 marriage - the tenth time she tied the knot - was actually her first, the New York Post reported. According to reports, all of Barrientos' marriages took place in New York state. Bride: Liana Barrientos, pictured, has been married ten times.

Barrientos' first marriage took place in 1999 to Mohamed Gerbril, followed by a 2001 marriage to Ahmed Allam, then a second 2001 marriage to Habibur Rahman, the Post reported. According to the newspaper, Barrientos married six men in 2002 - namely Davit Koridze, Duran Goktepe, Aliaksandr Paharelau, Vakhtang Dzneladze, Rashid Rajput, and Kakhaber Khorbaladze - and her last marriage was in 2010 to Salle Keita. Authorities reportedly slapped her with offering a false instrument for filing felony charges in November 2014. Quoting court documents, The New York Daily News said '[Barrientos] ... stated in sum and substance that she did marry Mr. Keita and that was her first and only marriage.' The newspaper reported that Barrientos could be sentenced to a total of eight years stemming from her two charges.

"The ornate Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is so spectacular that more than 400,000 devout worshippers make the pilgrimage to Abu Dhabi to pray during the annual Eid celebrations. And British photographer Julian John is equally as captivated by the incredible interiors of the biggest mosque in the Middle East. Now living abroad, John visits the intricately designed prayer halls as frequently as possible to snap photographs of what he believes to be 'the jewel in the United Arab Emirates' crown.' Scroll down for video . The breathtaking Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, is the biggest in the Middle East . British amateur photographer Julian John has long been fascinated with the impressive structure and its incredible interiors . Teaching assistant Julian, originally from Brighton, Sussex, but living in the UAE capital for the last four years, is planning an exhibition of his epic photos. Julian said: 'For me, it is the Jewel in the United Arab Emirates' crown. 'It has been described as a masterpiece of Islamic architecture and is truly a modern wonder of the world. 'It is beautiful and serene and the attention to detail is breathtaking with craftsmen from all around the world instrumental in making it so spectacular.' Calling the Grand Mosque the 'jewel in the United Arab Emirates' crown,' John has been snapping photos of it for four years . While the interiors are beautiful, the courtyard is a sight to be seen in and of itself, featuring the world's largest marble mosaic . As well as the stunning courtyard, which features the largest marble mosaic in the world at 180,000 square feet, Julian has also snapped the impressive exterior. The four 350-ft tall minarets, which can be seen across the Abu Dhabi skyline, are lit up in dramatic style against the cloudy skies in one of the photographer's incredible shots. Julian, who uses a Nikon D800 camera with Nikon 24-70mm and the Tamron 70-200mm lenses, was inspired to take up his hobby four years ago when he first moved to the Middle East. He has since set up a photography class at the international school where he works. The mosque's four 350-ft tall minarets, another of John's favourite features, look incredible lit up along the Abu Dhabi skyline . 'There are so many photographic opportunities that you're almost spoiled for choice,' the amateur photographer and teacher explains . The gorgeous structure took almost 10 years to build - and more than 30,000 workers - and was only completed in 2007 . Julian said: 'There are so many aspects to the Grand Mosque from stunning interiors to domes and minarets and fountains to the beautiful pillars with inlaid flowers. 'There are so many photographic opportunities that you are almost spoiled for choice. 'As long as I live in Abu Dhabi, I will always visit the Grand Mosque and continue to photograph it.' The towering structure took almost 10 years to build with more than 30,000 workers starting work on the site in 1996. It was not completed until seven years after the millennium in 2007.","The largest mosque in the Middle East, the Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi is as stunning on the inside as the outside .

"Hillary Clinton's astroturf candidacy is in full swing in Iowa. Her Tuesday morning visit to a coffee shop in LeClaire, Iowa was staged from beginning to end, according to Austin Bird, one of the men pictured sitting at the table with Mrs. Clinton. Bird told Daily Mail Online that campaign staffer Troy Price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him Tuesday morning at a restaurant in Davenport, a nearby city. Price then drove them to the coffee house to meet Clinton after vetting them for about a half-hour. The three got the lion's share of Mrs. Clinton's time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a 'roundtable'– the first of many in her brief Iowa campaign swing. Bird himself is a frequent participant in Iowa Democratic Party events. He interned with President Obama's 2012 presidential re-election campaign, and was tapped to chauffeur Vice President Joe Biden in October 2014 when he visited Davenport. 'What happened is, we were just asked to be there by Troy,' Bird said Wednesday in a phone interview. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . STAGED: Clinton sat to talk with three young Iowans at a coffee shop on Tuesday – all of whom were driven to the event by her Iowa campaign's political director . NOT SO ORDINARY: Austin Bird is a Democratic Party insider who chauffeured Vice President Joe Biden around Davenport, Iowa in October during a pre-election campaign trip . 'We were asked to come to a meeting with Troy, the three of us, at the Village Inn.' The other two, he confirmed, were University of Iowa College Democrats president Carter Bell and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland employee Sara Sedlacek. 'It was supposed to be a strategy meeting,' Bird recalled, 'to get our thoughts about issues. But then all of a sudden he says, ""Hey, we have Secretary Clinton coming in, would you like to go meet her?""' 'And then we got in a car – Troy's car – and we went up to the coffee house, and we sat at a table and then Hillary just came up and talked with us.' Bird said 'we all were called.' 'I mean, Troy asked us all to do – to go to a meeting with him. And we didn't really know what it was about. I mean, he did. He knew.' It's unclear how many Iowans featured in photographs with Clinton that rocketed around the country on Tuesday were planted. 'The mayor of LeClaire was there, and his wife was there,' Bird said, recalling the scene at the coffee shop. Price was executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party until a month ago. Clinton's team tapped him last week to be its political director in Iowa. He did not respond to a request for comment. Bird is a government and community relations coordinator at Genesis Health System in Davenport, Iowa, according to his LinkedIn profile. A coworker at Genesis said Wednesday that Bird is 'basically a lobbyist in training. That's what he wants to do.' Bird disagreed, saying his role was 'more public relations.' He's also an outspoken progressive whose Facebook wall shows he ordered a 'Hillary For President' bumper sticker 22 months ago. 'Is it 2016 yet?' he wrote in May 2013. Clinton's nascent campaign has carefully coordinated her image as a spontaneous, handshaking populist in her first days as a candidate, posing with Pennsylvanians at a gas station and venturing into an Ohio Chipotle restaurant for lunch. When no one recognized the former first lady – she was wearing sunglasses – the campaign leaked information to The New York Times so its reporters could get security-camera footage to prove she had tried to mingle with voters. Scripting supposedly off-the-cuff appearances is common in presidential politics but could hurt Clinton especially hard since her gonzo road-trip journey to America's broad midwest is designed to counter her image as cold, calculating and politically venomous. And planting party insiders in place of typical Iowans won't go over well in the Hawkeye State, where pressing the flesh and collecting caucus votes is a quadrennial full-contact sport. ASTROTURF: Setting up faux events for news cameras is nothing new in politics, but Iowans take presidential contests seriously and could punish Clinton for the deception . THE FIXER: Bird said Troy Prince (left, pictured with VP Joe Biden), who was executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party until he left last month to help Clinton's statewide political effort, recruited him and others to attend the 'spontaneous' coffee meeting . Clinton's campaign has already taken heat for depicting at least three people in her campaign launch video as 'everyday' Americans who were actually partisans with political connections. One was even a former campaign manager for Wendy Davis, the Texas Democrat who mounted a failed bid for Texas governor last year. In LeClaire on Tuesday, Bloomberg and other outlets referred to Bird as a 'student' at St. Ambrose University, not as a hospital government-affairs staffer with Democratic party street-cred. He does study at St. Ambrose – part-time. But Bird's ties to the party are deep enough that his Facebook wall includes a photo of him standing in front of Joe Biden's limousine in Davenport. 'I was driving the Vice President when he was in town in October,' Bird noted in a Facebook comment. Biden was not there on official government business, but for a campaign stop in support of Democrat Bruce Braley. 'The Vice President will attend a grassroots event for Braley for Iowa with Representative David Loebsack,' according to White House press guidance for his October 27, 2014 schedule.","Austin Bird sat for coffee on Tuesday morning in the town of LeClaire, Iowa, chatting with Hillary Clinton as photographers snapped pictures .

"Nearly one out of six NFL players will declare bankruptcy within 12 years of retiring from the league, a shocking new study has revealed. The rate of bankruptcy, 15.7percent - remained the same no matter how long the players were in the league or how well they were paid, according to researchers from the California Institute of Technology, George Washington University and the University of Washington. Despite earning millions of dollars - sometimes tens of millions - former players go broke at about 1.1percent per year, the same rate as the rest of Americans. Bleak future: Despite NFL players earning millions - sometimes times of millions - over the course of their careers, nearly 16percent of players are bankrupt within 12 years . Vince Young earned a reported $64million in salary and endorsement deals - but was bankrupt before he even finished his NFL career. Widely reported rumors say he spent $5,000 a week at Cheesecake factory . Though bleak, the 15.7percent figure found by the researchers, is dramatically lower than a widely quoted statistic that 78percent of retired players are bankrupt or under 'financial stress' within two years of leaving the league. The figure comes from a 2009 survey by Sports Illustrated. Often, when athletes go broke, it's because of unimaginable extravagances, bad investments and massive child support payments.  This, despite the fact that the average player makes $3.2million over the course of a career. Defensive tackle Warren Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL and made more than $82million. He retired in 2007 and filed for bankruptcy in 2012 - citing several failed business ventures. Bankruptcy remained at similar rates even among players who had long, profitable careers in the sport - though it was highest for those who stayed in the league for five years - and lower for those who were in it for more than a decade . Michael Vick, who made more than $130million, is still playing has he attempts to pay off his $18million bankruptcy debt from 2008 . When his estate was sold at auction, he had a lionskin rug and 240 pairs of sneakers. He also owed more than $75,000 a month in child support for his six children (with five different women,) Quarterback Vince Young's played his last NFL game in December 2011. He filed for bankruptcy in January 2014 - despite earning $34million in salary and another $30million in endorsement deals. Widely reported rumors that emerged after he first began having financial trouble in 2012 claim that he spent up to $5,000 a week at Cheesecake Factory and racked up a $6,000 tab at TGI Friday's. Young also blamed investment advisers who he claimed took advantage of him. Quarterback Michael Vick filed for bankruptcy in 2008 - in the middle of his high-profile career and legal troubles that sent him to prison. He was still paying off his $18million in debts in 2014 - despite making $130million from the NFL and millions more from endorsement deals. 'We've known that it can be very difficult for the average family to save,' Cal Tech finance professor Colin F. Camerer, one of the researchers, told the Washington Post. 'But this is one group that you might think ought to be able to avoid bankruptcy. They're in a position to buy some good advice if they need it. But even for them, with all these millions, it's a challenge.'","High-profile bankruptcies include Warren Sapp, Vince Young and Michael Vick - all of whom earned tens of millions of dollars .

"When it comes to travel, there are a lot of things that affect the trips we book - and one of them could be the way we vote. While Conservative supporters love a good trashy plane read, it seems Liberal Democrats prefer to opt for the window seat for flights, while UKIP supporters are the most likely to want to save money on holiday. The unusual statistics were revealed as part of a Travelzoo survey into voters and their holiday habits, revealing the Greens love a long-haul trip and Labour are the most likely to try out their dance moves on holiday. Conservative Party supporters are more likely to take on some light reading such as Fifty Shades of Grey rather than some more refined reading (file photo) Voters for the Scottish National Party are more likely to bring out the Speedo swimming trunks . Interestingly despite their belief that pulling out of the EU is necessary, UKIP supporters still have a lot of love left for warmer climates as they are the biggest sun lovers of all the parties with 90 per cent requiring this as standard. Cutting down on emissions and pollution is a mainstay of the Green Party's manifesto, however almost half of their supporters (49 per cent) are likely to travel on long haul destinations, preferring an aisle seat on the plane. They are also most likely to rent a car on holiday, with 60 per cent voting to do so. Green Party supporters are also most likely to take the toiletries home with them, while UKIP are the least likely to swoop for the free shampoo and shower gel in hotel rooms.

Spokesperson for Travelzoo Louise Hodges said: 'While some of the political party stereotypes where upheld – such as Conservative supporters being the biggest fans of luxury holidays and à la carte dining – we were interested to see some less expected holiday preferences.

"Battleground: Esther McVey, who won her Wirral West seat in 2010 with a majority of just 2,436, has demanded that Ed Miliband condemns the attacks . Tory minister Esther McVey has called on Ed Miliband to condemn the ‘scurrilous’ campaign against her after she was branded ‘murderer McVey’ in graffiti. The employment minister also had an election song written about her by  rivals claiming she was going to hell. Miss McVey has been one of the party’s most prominent rising stars, but is the Tory Cabinet minister most at risk of becoming a casualty on election night with a fierce battle to cling on to her marginal Wirral West seat. Yesterday the former GMTV presenter, who won in 2010 with a majority of just 2,436, insisted that she would not be cowered by the ‘misogynistic and sexist’ attacks that she said showed what the Labour party really thinks of women. ‘If they think by coming in the dead of the night and scribbling on a wall and by being anonymous on Twitter that they will intimidate and bully me they are picking on the wrong person,’ she said. ‘I believe it is right that we have a Conservative MP up here who is sitting at the table at Cabinet, so their underhand tactics won’t bully and intimidate me.’ Miss McVey, who was given a job in the Cabinet by David Cameron last July, said that she is one of a number of women sat around the table who knows how to have her voice heard and shows the party is not solely made up of women in ‘twin-sets and pearls’. She also revealed how the network of female Tory ministers, including Home Secretary Theresa May, support each other with text messages, phone calls and by taking each other out for drinks. Miss McVey, who is the only Conservative MP on Merseyside, said her political opponents are trying to create ‘an atmosphere of fear’ in her seat. Local trade union activists launched their ‘Sack Esther McVey’ campaign last year on her birthday and a song with the same name has been recorded and posted on the internet. The vile lyrics claim that Miss McVey ‘torments the sick and poor’, ‘is going to hell’ and that ‘the wicked witch of the Wirral’s had her day’. Last year Labour MP John McDonnell joked that her constituents want to ‘lynch the b*****d’ and last week John Prescott accused her of being ‘heartless’. At a Labour rally in her constituency, the former Labour deputy prime minister claimed to forget her name and said he only remembered her because of the dress she wore into Downing Street when she was promoted. The job centre in Hoylake, at the centre of her constituency, was also targeted with graffiti at the end of last month that read: ‘McVey murderer.’ Miss McVey said: ‘Of course it’s hurtful, not just to me, but more so sometimes for your family and friends. ‘I have to say, John Prescott has never been good with words. He doesn’t know my name and he has shown he knows a big fat zero about me as well. ‘I am totally driven by my heart and my head. You cannot give away what you have not got, but you have got to have the right motives. I wouldn’t believe in social mobility if I didn’t have a heart.’ Message: Graffiti on Wirral job centre accusing MP Esther McVey of being a murderer in one of a number of attacks . Defiant: The former GMTV presenter, pictured yesterday with Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers, right, and her campaign team spoke out about being targeted in offensive graffiti and songs . Miss McVey said that despite the personal attacks she is not afraid to go out canvassing by herself. She said: ‘Oh yeah of course I do. I live here. I walk down here. I go canvassing by myself all the time. ‘They’re trying to paint a very ugly picture and trying to create an atmosphere of fear, but that is not the case. The people of Wirral West are not like that.’ She added: ‘The attacks have been misogynistic and sexist and I find it rather mystifying how the Labour party purports to be a party for a woman and yet have run this scurrilous campaign against me and at no time has it been condemned by Ed Miliband. ‘I think this myth that they’re for women is only a myth and the reality is the campaign they have run against me shows what they truly think about women.’ Miss McVey, who was one of only five ministers to make it onto the front page of the Conservative manifesto alongside Mr Cameron, hit back at suggestions she was only there as a ‘token woman’. She said: ‘I believe I was there because as minister for employment we have seen a record number of jobs created in the economy, two million jobs.’ After earlier this year revealing her ambition to one day become prime minister, Miss McVey said she hopes that another woman will become Tory leader in her lifetime. She said: ‘Every time requires a different leader and hopefully in our lifetimes there will be time when another woman is needed as leader.’ As she hosted a women business leaders event in her constituency yesterday alongside Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and Lords Leader Baroness Stowell, Miss McVey talked about the support she has received from other women in the Cabinet behind the scenes. She also denied that the Tory party is predominantly made up of women in twin-sets and pearls. ‘No. For me I have never have thought that because the Tory women I knew were not like that,’ she said. ‘The Tory women in this room are just people running a business, looking after a family, there is not anybody here in twin-set and pearls, they are just regular people who understand you cannot spend what you have not got.’ Support: Miss McVey was flanked by Ms Villiers and and felow Tory Grant Shapps on the campaign trail yesterday . Asked if it was easy being only one of only a few women in Cabinet, she said: ‘You have got to look at it from both sides of the table, we might be in lesser numbers but sometimes that can make you more visible and your points more pertinent too. ‘I’m the sort of person who doesn’t look at what could be the difficulties and “oh say I give up”. Look at the difficulties, rise to the challenge and make sure your voice is being heard.’ Miss McVey said that the female Tory ministers exchange text messages, phone calls and go out for drinks together. She said: ‘Of course you are busy doing what you do but there is a support behind the scenes. ‘People like Justine Greening will say “let’s go out for a drink”. ‘Theresa May was chairman of the party when I came in. She was very good at giving the realities of the job, what were the expectations, what support can you have, is there anything else you need to know. ‘Obviously there are phone calls that you have with one another – “how do you deal with that?”, “what do you do?”, “what would your advice be on this?”. ‘There’s personal support and professional support and Theresa May has given both.’ Miss McVey said that she was pleased to see Nicola Sturgeon, Natalie Bennett and Leanne Wood representing their parties in the televised leaders debates even though she disagrees with them politically. She said: ‘Obviously their policies aside, for women to get to the top of their profession, that’s what I have fought for all of my life, I think that’s fantastic.’ Tory chairman Grant Shapps, who also visited Miss McVey’s seat yesterday, condemned the campaign against her. He said: ‘I think it’s completely unacceptable and it has to stop. I call on the Labour leadership locally and nationally to reign it in because it is not the sort of civilised debate we should be having.’ Last year the Labour Party said Mr McDonell’s comment did ‘not represent the views of the Labour Party’, but refused to withdraw the whip from him. The local Labour Party has condemned the ‘murder McVey’ graffiti and said it was the council leader who reported the vandalism and ordered its immediate removal.","Esther McVey will not be cowered by 'misogynistic and sexist' attacks .

"Adele Sarno (above) has been living in her two-bedroom apartment for more than 50 years . An Italian-American grandmother is facing eviction from her $820-a-month apartment in Manhattan's Little Italy neighborhood. Adele Sarno, 85, who has lived there for more than 50 years received a letter seeking to increase rent to the market rate of $3,500 a month, far more than the retired shopkeeper can afford. Her landlord is the Italian American Museum which is dedicated to the legacy of Italian-Americans and is situated below her home. The fight over her two-bedroom apartment began five years ago. 'Why would you want to throw me out when I lived here all my life?' asked Sarno, a feisty, raspy-voiced woman who proudly tells how she once even served as queen of the annual Feast of San Gennaro, Little Italy's most well-known event. 'This is my neighborhood.' She has been living in the apartment since 1962 when rent was only $150 a month, according to CBS. The spat is the latest involving the museum to cause a commotion in Little Italy, a neighborhood of former tenement buildings and narrow streets in Lower Manhattan that was once a bustling center of Italian immigrant life. An Italian restaurant that had been open for decades closed its doors last week in a separate rent-related dispute. 'The negative press that this has caused is so detrimental to the spirit of the Italian immigrant,' said Lou Di Palo, whose family has run an Italian specialty foods shop in Little Italy for over a century. 'I'm upset over it.' Scroll down for video . The grandmother tried to go through the courts to see if the city's rent regulation laws could help, but it was determined that her apartment wasn't covered (Adele pictured above in her Little Italy apartment) Her landlord is the Italian American Museum (above) which is dedicated to the legacy of Italian-Americans and is situated below her home. They sent her a letter five years ago seeking to increase rent to $3,500 . But in recent decades, the character of Little Italy has been transformed by waves of gentrification and wealthy newcomers. The latest Census data from 2013 shows only 554 out of 7,816 residents, about seven per cent, in the Census tract encompassing Sarno's street identify as having Italian ancestry. Museum president Joseph Scelsa told The New York Times that even after all Italian-Americans had gone from the area, 'the legacy would still remain because we have an institution that does that.' Neither the museum's president nor its spokesman replied to multiple emails and phone messages from The Associated Press seeking comment. But they have said the museum is looking to expand its space, or sell the properties to a developer and remain there rent-free. Sarno, who has a daughter in Wisconsin and a granddaughter on Staten Island, believes the museum is just after more money, pointing out that her upstairs neighbors pay several thousand dollars a month in rent. The grandmother tried to go through the courts to see if the city's rent regulation laws could help, but it was determined that her apartment wasn't covered. Still, she is hopeful she can fight through the courts to forestall the eviction order. A judge has given her lawyers until April 13 to find some kind of solution. Il Palazzo, the shuttered restaurant, was evicted after being in business since the 1980s. Adele Sarno poses for picture in her apartment in the Little Italy section of Manhattan on March 31, 2015 . Sarno believes the museum is just after more money as her neighbors pay several thousand dollars a month in rent she said . Perry Chrisciatelli, who ran the restaurant with his wife, said they had been late with a $17,000 rent payment in February, and were told they would have to go unless they were willing to pay almost twice that per month. 'Now another piece of Little Italy is gone,' he said. Truthfully, there's not a lot of Little Italy left, mainly a couple of blocks of Mulberry Street, populated with Italian restaurants and tourist stores featuring trinkets and 'Kiss me, I'm Italian' and 'Fuggedaboutit' T-shirts. 'The sort of everyday lived experience of the place as a residence of Italian Americans for all intents has been over for decades,' said Joseph Sciorra of the Italian-American Institute at Queens College. But for a museum dedicated to that history, turning Sarno out shows 'a lack of vision,' he said, suggesting it could have tapped Sarno as a speaker or in some other capacity. Sarno, he said, 'is literally the living embodiment of the living history of Little Italy.' On Saturday, a rally was held in support of Sarno keeping her apartment as protesters gathered outside of the museum to protest. The grandmother was due to be evicted on Monday but a judge has given her lawyers until April 13 to find a solution.","Italian-American tenant Adele Sarno, 85, received a letter from her landlord, Italian American Museum, seeking to increase rent to market rate of $3,500 .

"A Washington State lawmaker has proposed the idea of connecting two cities on the Puget Sound with a military tribute bridge made of retired United States Navy aircraft carriers. Representative Jesse Young wants to use two or three carriers to link Bremerton and Port Orchard across the Sinclair Inlet. A proposal put forth by Young which would use money from the state's highway budget to fund a feasibility study about the bridge passed in the Washington House on Thursday. The idea is intriguing because the US Navy is storing three retired carriers just a few hundred yards from the proposed site of the bridge. This 2012 shot of the Puget Sound shipyard shows two potential bridge parts, the USS Independence and the USS Kitty Hawk. There are currently three retired carriers parked at the shipyard - (left the right) the Independence, the Kitty Hawk and the Constellation. The Ranger (farthest right) has recently been towed to Texas to be cut into salvage . State Representative Jesses Young wants to use two or three carriers as a bridge across Sinclair inlet. Three carriers are stacked end-to-end in the graphic and the four mothballed carriers can be seen to the right . A Navy spokesman said the USS Independence and the USS Kitty Hawk are not 'currently available.' They are in the Navy's 'reserve fleet' and could potentially be brought back into service if need arises . Young wants to either use three carriers connected end-to-end or two connected carriers with ramps on either side, KUOW reported. State Representative Jesse Young has attempted to secure $90,000 to study the aircraft carrier bridge . He said: 'I know that people from around the world would come to drive across the deck of an aircraft carrier bridge, number one. 'Number two, it's the right thing to do from my standpoint because this is giving a testimony and a legacy memorial to our greatest generation.' The two carriers Young was thinking would work for the project are housed in the Puget Sound Navy Yard. The distance across the inlet is less than seven tenths of a mile - 3,700 feet. The USS Independence USS Kitty Hawk are both 1,070 feet long. The USS Constellation, which is also at the nearby Navy base, is 1,080 feet long. Unfortunately, a Navy spokesman said the USS Independence and the USS Kitty Hawk are not 'currently available'. Young's spokesman Kevin Shutty said the bridge would relieve pressure in the 'bottleneck area', Maritime Executive reported. He said: 'This would definitely be a unique way to tackle some of those problems, but at the same time it would serve as a floating memorial to veterans and the sacrifice they have given to our country. 'It's a novel concept. 'I think there's a lot of public support at least for exploring the idea.' Young's spokesman Kevin Shutty said: 'I think there's a lot of public support at least for exploring the idea' The $90,000 feasibility study has a deadline of December 1 for submission back to the state Legislature. According to the test of the budget proposal: '$90,000 of the motor vehicle account—state appropriation is for a study of the feasibility of constructing a military tribute bridge that spans Sinclair Inlet and that incorporates one or more decommissioned aircraft carriers. 'As a part of this study, the joint transportation committee must: (i)Determine the cost and process associated with the state's acquisition of a decommissioned aircraft carrier; and (ii) Identify potential engineering options for incorporating decommissioned aircraft carriers into a bridge. A report on the study must be submitted to the transportation committees of the legislature by December 1, 2015.'","The bridge would link Bremerton and Port Orchard across the Sinclair Inlet .

"An unnamed hit band from the 1960s attended the same paedophile brothel as shamed BBC star Jimmy Savile. The group were identified in a secret police intelligence report from 1964 in a four-page document. The document related to a notorious flat in Battersea, South West London which was used by paedophiles. Scroll down for video . Top of the Pops star Jimmy Savile, pictured, was known to frequent a paedophile brothel in Battersea . It is not clear whether the band and Savile attended the brothel at the same time, but they have all been linked to the property. Savile was known to be a regular visitor in the 1970s. The senior officer responsible for Operation Yewtree , Detective Superintendent David Grey began investigating the brothel in 2013 when it was mentioned in another police report. Det Supt Grey said a woman came forward in 2003 and reported that Savile had abused her during the 1970s following an appearance on Top of the Pops. The DJ died in 2011 when his terrible secret life became public knowledge. Details of the alleged assault were never put on the police computer. Det Supt Grey told the Daily Mirror: 'Although Savile and a pop group were known to frequent, that does not in itself show linkage  or grounds to investigate further except with the benefit of hindsight.'

"An Army major and his wife engaged in 'a regimen of abuse and neglect' with their three young foster children over a period of years that left the toddlers with broken bones and numerous other health problems, a federal prosecutor told a jury at the couple's child abuse trial Monday. John and Carolyn Jackson also forced some of the children to drink hot sauce or eat hot pepper flakes and weren't exposed until one of their biological children reported the abuse to someone outside the family, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Shumofsky said in his opening statement. That child, now in his teens, is expected to provide key testimony for the prosecution. The trial marks the second go-round for the Jacksons, whose previous trial last fall ended in a mistrial when a prosecutor inadvertently referred to the fact that one of the children had died. Cruel: Army Major John Jackson (left) and his wife Carolyn (right) are currently on trial for abusing their three foster children. Pictured above in May 2013 . The judge had previously ruled that the boy's death could not be introduced during the trial since the defendants were not charged directly with his death. Second trial: The Jacksons first child abuse trial was ruled a mistrial when a prosecutor mentioned the death of one of their sons - a detail that was not supposed to be mentioned in the proceedings. The Jacksons had three biological children and three adopted children. They have only been charged for abusing the foster children . The Jacksons, who live in Mount Holly, were stationed at Picatinny Arsenal, a military installation about 40 miles west of New York City, when the abuse occurred between 2005 and 2010, according to a 15-count superseding indictment. They had three biological children who showed no signs of abuse, Shumofsky said. But they disciplined their three foster children by withholding food and water as punishment and by hitting them with different objects, he added. The treatment left them with bruises and injuries including, for one child, a skull fracture and spinal fracture, and for another, a broken arm. The children were well under normal weight when they were removed from the Jackson home, Shumofsky said, including one who weighed less at nearly three years old than he did when he joined the family at 11 months old. One of the girls had scars, marks and infections and had a dangerously high level of salt in her body that doctors said they'd never seen before in a two-year-old, Shumofsky told jurors. Attorneys representing the Jacksons conceded that though the Jacksons' child-rearing methods may be objectionable to some, they didn't rise to the level of criminality. 'You might think, `I would never raise a hand to my child,'' said attorney Rubin Sinins, representing Carolyn Jackson. 'But that doesn't make it criminal. Because what Carolyn Jackson was doing was acting in good faith in her role as parent.' Jackson would have had to have known that her actions would cause harm to be considered guilty, he added. 'If you're a crappy parent, you're not a criminal,' he said. Countering photos shown by Shumofsky that showed the children with visible marks and scars, Sinins showed jurors pictures of the two girls smiling with their parents or friends in pictures taken weeks earlier. Sinins and David Holman, representing John Jackson, both mentioned in their opening statements that while the government's experts concluded abuse had taken place though they hadn't treated the children, the children's treating doctors did not reach that conclusion.","Army Major John Jackson and his wife Carolyn are facing 15 counts of child abuse .

"Sleepy shoppers in China have had a rude awakening – after being banned from napping in furniture store IKEA. The Swedish retailer has been forced to take action to stop visitors kicking off their shoes and going to sleep on their beds and sofas. The problem has got so bad that nappers had taken over more than half of beds and sofas in the Xihongmen IKEA shop in Beijing, The People’s Daily reported – with some even getting under the covers for a snooze. Scroll down for video . Managers at Swedish furniture store IKEA have now banned shoppers from sleeping in their beds and sofas . Sleepy shoppers have taken to kicking off their shoes and catching forty winks on the display furniture . The practice has become widespread in IKEA stores - with shoppers coming in especially to take a nap . One weary woman said she had come into IKEA especially to grab a quick forty winks in one of their ‘comfy’ beds. She said she didn’t think it was a big issue, saying: ‘Yes it may affect customers who were shopping in the store but it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.’ Another customer said: ‘Sleeping on the furniture will definitely affect other customers. I can understand the need to take a rest however if you are really having a sleep then that’s not very appropriate.’ One shopper said: 'Yes it may affect customers... but it shouldn't be too much of a problem'. Ikea disagree . IKEA employees said the problem is difficult to manage, because so many Chinese shoppers do it . But long-suffering staff at IKEA said the problem has become widespread across China – with management vowing to clamp down on the practice. Under the new rules customers will still be allowed to try out the sofas and beds, but the removal of shoes to sleep in the beds is banned. One anonymous IKEA assistant warned, however, it will be difficult to enforce the rules. ‘There are old people sleeping and many others are children, what can we say?’ they said. Another employee explained that they currently wake up shoppers if they have been sleeping for an extended period of time – but when they move them on, another quickly fills their place. By banning people from taking off their shoes, IKEA hope to stop Chinese shoppers falling asleep in the stores . Workers at IKEA shops regularly wake up exhausted shoppers - but another napper quickly takes their place . They added: ‘There are too many people doing this, it’s not possible to stop it.’ The MailOnline previously reported on the trend, which commentators saying their Beijing store is particularly popular for a nap because of its air-conditioning during the sweltering summers. It is not the first time IKEA has had to deal with over-familiar customers in China. One Shanghai Xuhui store was inundated with pensioners who would spend their time drinking the free coffee – and on the prowl for a new partner for their children. The practice became so popular that telling people you were going to IKEA became a euphemism in China for ‘going to a matchmaking event’. Genuine shoppers have been unable to see the furniture on sales because of the sleeping people on top of it . IKEA opened up their first shop in China in 1999 and the country is now home to three of the top five largest IKEA stores in the world, only beaten by one in Stockholm. After the first shop opened in Beijing, pictures emerged of shoppers camping out on the sofas with their families, reading newspapers and eating biscuits. The flat-pack chain was founded by 87-year-old Ingvar Kamprad in 1943 and it is now the world’s largest furniture retailer. IKEA first opened in Beijing in 1998, and shoppers were pictured camping out on their sofas with newspapers .","Exhausted shoppers regularly fall asleep in IKEA stores across China .

"Sandra Garratt was in constant agony after undergoing two operations before her death . A grandmother racked with constant pain jumped from the top of a multi-storey car park to end her suffering, her devastated husband has said. Sandra Garratt, 56, went through two years of agony following two back operations for a slipped disc and not even morphine could dull the pain. Last month doctors told the housewife there was nothing more they could do ease her suffering and this was the 'final straw', according to her husband Steve. On Good Friday, the mother of two left her home in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after telling her husband she was 'just popping out'. But he became anxious for her welfare and he called the police. At 2.35pm, police and ambulance crews were called to the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen, where they discovered Mrs Garratt's body. She had fallen more than 50ft from the top of an Asda supermarket multi-storey car park. Mr Garratt, 57, told how he gave up his job as a community transport driver last year to care for his wife. He said her suffering had intensified in the last 18 months of her life and the pain had spread to her legs, feet and fingers. He added: 'She was in pain every minute of every day. She was a happy lovely person but withdrew from her happy family life. 'Before there had been hope but when there was nothing they could do, it was the final straw. 'Everybody says the same – she is now free from the pain. That's the only bit of comfort. 'The doctors and GPs, within the scope of the NHS waiting lists and everything that goes on, did everything they could.' Mrs Garratt leaves behind daughter Lucy, 37, son Jonathan, 26, and two grandchildren, Joshua and Jessica. The coroner has been informed of her death. Mrs Garratt told her husband she was 'popping out' on Good Friday.

"An frail elderly woman lost five kilograms in five days when she was being treated at Perth's new Fiona Stanley Hospital (FSH), but the West Australian health minister said doctors did nothing wrong. Joyce Tabram, 82, was 39 kilograms when she was admitted to FSH on March 30 with swollen abdomen but left weighing just 34 kilograms. She was told to fast for five days while waiting for tests to be performed on her. Joyce Tabram, 82, lost five kilograms in five days while she being treated at Fiona Stanley Hospital in Perth . Ms Tabram told the ABC her test was put off until April 3 after she became fed up with no action being taken. She has called for the hospital to be shut down. 'Fiona Stanley Hospital, I think it stinks that's all I can say,' Ms Tabram said. While Opposition leader Mark McGowan said it was a form of torture and gross incompetence at FSH, Health Minister Kim Hames defended FSH doctors' treatment of Ms Tabram. Mr Hames said the 82-year-old had a medical condition that required her to fast and she was given fluids intravenously. He said a planned medical test was delayed but her condition improved and she was still expected to have the test this week. Doctors at Fiona Stanley Hospital in Perth asked Ms Tabram to fast for five days after arriving at the hospital on March 30 with a swollen abdomen . 'Even if that test had been undertaken, she still would not have been able to have food and water by mouth because of the medical condition, so her treatment was correct,' Dr Hames told reporters. 'It wasn't that she was having to continue to fast waiting for the test - she had to fast because her medical condition required that to occur.' Dr Hames said there had been miscommunication between staff and the patient and her family. 'Either they haven't understood, or haven't been given the full amount of information,' he said. 'It's unfortunate they believe she's been terribly treated when in fact the review of the medical notes suggests that that's not the case.' Dr Hames was confident based on the medical notes and his own treatment of patients with the same condition that Ms Tabram was cared for appropriately. He also apologised to the family for the incident. 'Clearly they don't feel they've been managed well and that means there's been a communication issue,' he said. But Mr McGowan said this was 'part of a pattern of behaviour of the management of Fiona Stanley Hospital', adding: 'She could easily have died.' Dr Hames said the matter would be followed up with the specialist.","Perth's Joyce Tabram was admitted to Fiona Stanley Hospital on March 30 .

"Nick Clegg's arch-rival for the leadership of the Liberal Democrats was at the centre of a bitter row last night over the death of one of the party's councillors. Tim Farron was accused by the dead man's widow of 'betrayal' after an inquest found that Jo Stephenson jumped from the roof of his house while suffering 'intense stress'. Mr Stephenson, deputy leader of Cumbria County Council, fell from the three-storey property in Windermere after being vilified over new parking charges in Mr Farron's Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency. Now Mr Stephenson’s widow Hilary has angrily accused Mr Farron – a former party president dubbed ‘Saint Tim’ because of his religious beliefs – of reneging on a deal to support her late husband over the policy. Tim Farron (left) was accused by Jo Stephenson's (centre) widow Hilary (right) of 'betrayal' after an inquest found that he jumped from the roof of his house while suffering 'intense stress' Mr Stephenson initially survived his fall and was coherent enough to tell the paramedics that he had intended to kill himself. He died of his injuries three weeks later. The shocking sequence of events unfolded after Mr Stephenson led controversial Lib Dem plans to boost the council's income by ending free street parking in Cumbria. Local sources claim that Mr Farron – favourite to replace Mr Clegg if the party flops in the Election – promised to support the charges in return for the exemption of Liberal Democrat-dominated parts of the county. But, according to Mrs Stephenson, when the plan provoked a furious backlash from local residents, Mr Farron stayed quiet as 59-year-old Mr Stephenson was bombarded with aggressive messages on Facebook and Twitter. 'They'd negotiated a deal but Tim reneged on it and shoved Jo into the forefront to take the wrath,' she told The Mail on Sunday. 'Jo would just say, 'it's not what gentlemen do, is it?' But it is what politicians do. I don't know the details of it [the deal]. I just know Farron reneged on it and it left Jo in a very uncomfortable position. He felt betrayed. 'When I found out that Tim Farron happened to be on holiday on the date of Jo's funeral, I was very pleased. Would I have barred him? Let's just say I was very happy that the date coincided with his holiday.' Kendal coroner's court heard last month that in the run-up to the day on which he jumped off his roof, Mr Stephenson had been under 'considerable political pressure', and 'preoccupied by a culmination of matters'. Nick Clegg's arch-rival for the leadership of the Liberal Democrats Tim Farron (pictured) was at the centre of a bitter row last night over the death of one of the party's councillors . He dialled 999 himself, telling the operator: 'Come quickly. I threw myself off the roof, I tried to kill myself.' The deputy coroner ruled that the fall was 'no accident' but stopped short of ruling Mr Stephenson committed suicide. Mrs Stephenson, who had two children with Mr Stephenson, does not believe her husband was suicidal but that he was so distressed by the personal attacks on him, he was not thinking properly. She recalled: 'I looked out of the bedroom window and saw an ambulance outside. I found Jo propped up against a chair talking to the paramedic on the phone.' Last month, Mr Farron launched a thinly-veiled leadership challenge to Mr Clegg, saying he would bring the party 'back from the dead'. The committed Christian brushed aside claims by enemies in the Clegg camp that he was a 'sanctimonious, God-bothering, treacherous little s***', and vowed to revive the Lib Dems. Mrs Stephenson questioned Tim Farron's 'saintly' image, saying: 'He wants everyone to love him and do what he says but he is just a typical modern politician who likes to whizz around the Lakes from one photo opportunity to another. 'He may see himself as a future leader of the Lib Dems but he's not the sort of character I would like to see in that job.' Mrs Stephenson said her husband was 'absolutely delightful,' adding: 'Jo didn't seek political glory, he wasn't like that.' Last night, Mr Farron, 44, said: 'I'm really saddened by these comments which are completely false and I strongly refute them. 'That does not change the fact that I have immense compassion for Hilary. Jo was an outstanding servant to our community and he is hugely missed.'","Jo Stephenson's widow accused Tim Farron of betraying her late husband .

"In Game of Thrones, the secret to forging super-light and strong Valyrian steel swords was said to have been lost with the Doom of Valyria. But, despite its fictional basis, a scientist has investigated whether it would be possible to make a similar weapon using bona fide chemistry. By studying the composition of modern steel, welding techniques and assessing all the characteristics of Valyrian steel, he concludes  it isn't a steel at all, but instead is a metal matrix composite. Scroll down for video . According to the Game of Thrones books, Valyrian steel is a form of super strong and light metal forged when the Valyrian Freehold governed Essos and covered more than half the known world. Ned Stark, played in the HBO adaptation of the books by Sean Bean, had a Valyrian sword called Ice (pictured) The findings and conclusions were made by materials scientist Ryan Consell in the latest Reactions video for Washington-based American Chemical Society. According to George R. R. Martin's books, Valyrian steel is a form of metal forged when the Valyrian Freehold governed Essos, and covered more than half the known world. It reigned for 5,000 years before a disaster struck the empire, known as the 'Doom of Valyria'. A lot of the empire's military strength came from its ability to forge Valyrian steel, renowned in the fictional kingdoms as being incredibly sharp, light, strong, super heat-resistant and dark in colour with a very distinct ripple patterns. The fictional Valyrian steel was renowned in the kingdoms as being incredibly sharp, light, strong, super heat resistant and dark in colour with a very distinct ripple patterns. It was reportedly forged using Westerosi magic and the secret to forging it was said to have been lost with the Doom of Valyria . In the latest Reactions video for the American Chemical Society, materials scientist Ryan Consell (pictured) studied which materials could create a similar sword. He began by looking at standard steel. Steel is an alloy made mostly of iron, but also includes around 2% of carbon . According to George R. R. Martin's books, Valyrian steel is a form of metal forged when the Valyrian Freehold governed Essos and covered more than half the known world. It reigned for five thousand years before a disaster struck the empire, known as the 'Doom of Valyria'. A lot of the military strength came from having Valyrian steel weapons, renowned in the fictional kingdoms as being incredibly sharp, light, strong, super heat resistant and dark in colour with a very distinct ripple patterns. It was reportedly forged using Westerosi magic. Ned Stark, played in the HBO adaptation of the books by Sean Bean, had a Valyrian sword called Ice. Kingslayer Jamie Lannister gave his 'Oathkeeper', made from Ice to Brienne of Tarth. A dagger used by an assassin in an attempt to kill Bran Stark was also made from Valyrian steel and had been lost in a bet by Petyr Baelish to Tyrion Lannister. It was reportedly forged using Westerosi magic. Ned Stark, played in the HBO adaptation of the books by Sean Bean, had a Valyrian sword called Ice. King slayer Jamie Lannister gave his 'Oathkeeper', made from Ice to Brienne of Tarth. A dagger used by an assassin in an attempt to kill Bran Stark was also made from Valyrian steel and had been lost in a bet by Petyr Baelish to Tyrion Lannister. As Mr Consell explained in the video: ‘In order to make ""magic"" steel we first need to know about real steel.' Steel is an alloy - a combination of metal with one or more other elements. It is mostly iron, but also includes carbon - up to about 2 per cent. A small change in the quantity of material in an alloy can dramatically change the properties of the end material. 'The characteristics of Valyrian steel can give us a lot of clues as to its composition,' continued Mr Consell. 'Strength and sharpness is going to require a bit of a balancing act. In order to hold an edge, a blade has to be really hard which is no problem for a high-carbon steel. 'The problem is the harder something is, the easier it will shatter, which is no good for a king slayer.' Mr Consell first looked into whether spring steel could be a contender for a modern, real-life version of Valyrian steel. It has 0.6% carbon, with silicon and manganese. This would provide a balance of properties including a sharp edge, but a spring steel sword couldn't handle high temperatures . He then moved onto the option of using air hardened steel. It is cooled off in the open air when it’s forged and doesn't lose its properties when heated up. Air hardened steel uses a 'cocktail of elements' but as Mr Consell added, Valyrian’s colour, pattern and weight make this option unlikely . He first looks into whether spring steel could be a contender for a modern, real-life version of Valyrian steel. It has 0.6 per cent carbon, with silicon and manganese. This would provide a balance of properties including a sharp edge, it would bend without breaking and be really hard to shatter. But a spring steel sword couldn't handle the high temperatures alluded to in the books. He then moved onto the option of using air hardened steel. It is cooled off in the open air when it’s forged and doesn't lose its properties when heated up. As an alternative, Mr Consell suggests Valyrian steel isn’t steel at all. Instead, the 'best possible match' might be a metal matrix composite. This is a modern super material with a metallic framework embedded with ceramics, and one of these could provide all of the extreme characteristics needed for Valyrian steel . He said itanium silicon carbide might be the 'perfect fit' because it has the strength, weight and colour needed for Valyrian steel. And if the matrix wasn’t  consistent, it might have swirls of grey running through the blade . Author George R.R. Martin was said to have been inspired by Damascus steel (pictured) steel used during the crusades in Europe . Air hardened steel uses a 'cocktail of elements' and as Mr Consell added, ‘you better believe it would require magic in the medieval world to get these materials working together.' But Valyrian’s colour, pattern and weight make this option unlikely. For example, steel can always be polished to a grey, but Valyrian is supposed to be nearly black. On top of that, the weight of steel can't be changed as it's mostly heavy iron. Additionally, Mr Consell said the patterns of Vlayrian steel suggest it has been pattern welded, and folded. 'This isn’t a sign of superb quality and strength, it’s actually a way of compensating for poor materials and trying to make a good steel out of two bad ones,' he said. 'If the folding is done correctly, you don’t have visible ripples so that’s kind of out.' As an alternative, Mr Consell suggests Valyrian steel isn’t steel at all. Instead, the 'best possible match' might be a metal matrix composite. 'This is a modern super material that has a metallic framework embedded with ceramics and one of these could provide all of the extreme characteristics needed for Valyrian steel,' he continued. 'A titanium silicon carbide might be the perfect fit. 'It has the strength, weight and colour needed for Valyrian steel and if the matrix wasn’t perfectly consistent, it might have swirls of grey running through the blade.' There is also the opinion that Valyrian is similar to Damascus steel. Mr Martin was said to have been inspired by the patterns and properties of the legendary Damascus steel used during the crusades in Europe across the 11th century for the books. It is made from iron ore steel called wootz and, like with the fictional Valyrian, the forging techniques used to make the distinctive blades were believed to have been lost in the mid-18th century.","In Game Of Thrones, Valyrian steel was forged during the Valyrian Freehold .

Feathery: This elaborate piece of headgear was sported by Doris Watlington at the Fifth Avenue parade on Sunday . One woman wore a large ship with blue sails on her head, while another sported an elaborate diorama based on the policies of Mayor Bill de Blasio. As well as Christians emerging from the service, led by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Jews, Hindus, agnostics and atheists joined the masses for a walk on the mild, sunny day. Roses, industrial-style black goggles, as well as moving rabbit puppets also featured in the display, which didn't just involve humans. Mary Ann Smith, a local hatmaker who wore the ship-shaped hat, said: 'It's all about versatility'. Explaining the design, she said: 'It's about sailing to new heights,' said Smith. She also created headpieces for two friends, one topped with a massive butterfly and another with a tropical umbrella dripping with felt balls and anchored to a bird's nest. Just feet from the parade, the trio was tending to last-minute finishing touches, adding bobby pins to make sure the contraptions didn't topple. Kirsten Lee Sergeant, who wore the butterfly, said: 'It's Easter and I didn't want to be too garish. But then again, I do have a huge butterfly on my head!' Ship-shape: Hat-maker Mary Anna Smith wears an Easter bonnet featuring a blue ship, which she fashioned from an elaborate kite .

The 2015 Easter Parade bore little resemblance to the first one, which started in the 1880s as a strolling display of what prosperous New Yorkers wore to Fifth Avenue churches. In recent decades, the street gathering has morphed into a sort of costume circus - including pet dogs. A sizable subsection of dogs also sported elaborate Easter costumes, painstakingly designed by their owners - although some were so heavy they animals had to be carried around rather than walk. Carmen, a 4lbs Chihuahua, was not exactly happy with her getup. 'She didn't love this one because it's kind of heavy, and she won't walk in it. But if I carry her, she's fine,' said owner Melissa Mejias. A consultant to the city's Department of Education, Mejias dabbles in dog attire. She used a Simplicity pattern to sew Carmen's coat from one of her old shirts, adorning it with a flowery headband plus a necklace purchased from a company that makes accessories for tweens. And to make sure she didn't run off into the dense crowds, Mejias kept her on a bejeweled leash. As for Mejias, she wore her mother-in-law's old Easter hat to the parade, a dark red velvet one she'd pulled out of a closet. 'I'm carrying on that tradition,' said Mejias.

"An Ohio woman discovered that her biological mother worked at the same company as her and lived only six minutes away. The Ohio Department of Heath released birth records for people born between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, last month, allowing people their first access to the information. After receiving her records in the mail, La-Sonya Mitchell-Clark, 38, of Youngstown, finally got the answers she's wanted almost her whole life. She looked up her mother's name, Francine Simmons, on Facebook and found out she worked Infocision - the same call-center operation company she works at. La-Sonya Mitchell-Clark (left) of Youngstown, Ohio, found out her birth mother was Francine Simmons (right) after the Ohio Department of Heath released birth records for people born between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, last month . 'Ever since I found out that I was adopted I wanted to know who my biological mother was,' Mitchell-Clark told WYTV. And after connecting the dots, she realized her mother was closer than she could imagine. 'There's a Francine that works at my job,' she said after finding the woman on Facebook. 'She works in VR and she works at the front desk.' She reached out to friends on social media who knew Simmons and the next day she got a phone call from her birth mother. 'She called me and I said, ""Is this Ms. Francine?"" She said, yes. I said, ""I think I'm your daughter"",' Mitchell-Clark said about the first time the women spoke. And, as it turns out, the mother and daughter live just six minutes away from one another in Youngstown. Simmons said she was 'still in shock' from finding out about her daughter, who she always wanted to contact but never knew how. Mitchell-Clark (left) reached out through social media to speak with Simmons (right) and they eventually decided to meet after a phone call. They found out they work at the came call-center operations company and live six minutes away from one another . Mitchell-Clark also found out that she had three biological younger sisters. Two of the sisters, Kamala (left) and Maisha (right) Cummings, said that the reunion was 'a relief' and 'amazing' for their family . 'I got pregnant when I was 14. I had her when I was 15. I was put in a home, a girl's home. Had her. Got to hold her. Didn't get to name her, but I named her myself in my heart all these years,' Simmons told WYTV. Mitchell-Clark also found out that she has three younger sisters she didn't know about. Simmons's daughter Kamala Cummings said that meeting Mitchell-Clark has been 'a sense of relief' for  her family, particularly for her mother. 'It's just amazing that all this time we're thinking about her and trying to find her and she was trying to find us, too,'  Maisha Cummings, another daughter of Simmons, told WYTV. Mitchell-Clark said that her adoptive parents have been very supportive of her search for her biological parents. '(They've) always encouraged me to look for them. They're going to be a part of this, too,' she said.","The Ohio Department of Heath released birth records for people born between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, last month .

"Prehistoric humans living in a cave 14,700 years ago were cannibals and made cups from the skulls of the dead, a new study has found. Researchers at the Natural History Museum in London and University College London have found evidence that the human bones found in Gough's Cave in Somerset had the flesh cut from them before being chewed and crushed. They found tooth marks on many of the bones, which were discovered in the cave during excavations between 1880 and 1992. Scroll down for video . This skull found at Gough's Cave in Somerset had been carefully shaped into a bowl around 14,700 years ago . Human skulls found in the cave had also been extenisvely shaped to create cups or bowls. The archaeologists behind the study say the findings suggest people living in the late Ice Age indulged in ritual cannibalism, perhaps as a macabre way to revere their dead kin. Simon Parfitt, an archaeologist from University College London, said: 'A recurring theme of this period is the remarkable rarity of burials and how commonly we find human remains mixed with occupation waste at many sites. There is growing evidence from around Europe that suggests preshistoric humans living at the time engaged in widespread cannibalism and other macabre rituals when dealing with their dead relatives. Stone Age farmers in Italy cut the flesh from the bones of their dead before burying them, a recent study found. Researchers at the University of Cambridge discovered cut marks on 7,000 year old human remains buried in a cave in Puglia, south eastern Italy. These cuts and scrapes, made with stone tools, suggest the skeletons had their flesh carefully removed in rituals before being placed in the cave. Archaeologists leading the research believe cleaning of the dead was probably the culmination of a protracted multi-stage burial process. Farmers from villages up to 12 miles away are thought to have brought their dead to the Scaloria Cave in the Tavoliere region of Italy . 'Further analysis along the lines used to study Gough's Cave will help to establish whether the type of ritualistic cannibalism practiced there is a regional phenomenon, or a more widespread practice found throughout the Magdalenian world.' Using modern radiocarbon techniques, researchers found the bones discovered in Gough's Cave were deposited over a very short period of time around 14,700 years ago - perhaps over just a few seasons. The humans who lived at the cave were a group of Cro-Magnon hunter-gatherers known as Magdalenians. It is thought these modern humans spread from southwest Europe and entered Britain from Belgium as the climate began to warm 15,000 years ago. The cave, which lies within Cheddar Gorge in Somerset, is around 295 metre deep. Human remains were first discovered there in the 1880s and in 1903 the remains of Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, known as Cheddar Man, was found there. A carving of a mammoth was also found in the cave along with thousands of flint tools. In the latest study, published in the Journal of Human Evolution, the researchers used three dimensional imaging techniques to examine the human remains found in the cave. They found scratches made by a stone cutting tool along with human teeth marks along the bones. The skulls also showed signs they had been stripped of their flesh before being broken and carefully shaped into a bowl. Several skulls and other bones (above) found at the cave showing distinctive human bite marks and cuts . Professor Chris Stringer holds the skull of Cheddar Man - the oldest most complete skeleton found in Britain . Dr Silvia Bello, who led the research at the Natural History Museum, said: 'We’ve identified a far greater degree of human modification than recorded in earlier. 'We’ve found undoubting evidence for defleshing, disarticulation, human chewing, crushing of spongy bone, and the cracking of bones to extract marrow.' She added: 'We find (cut marks) all over the skull and all over the face. 'We suspect that what they were doing was maticulously removing every single soft tissue on the skull. 'We have signs that indicate cutting of the lips, exctraction of the eyes and cheek and possibly cutting of the tongue as well. Skull fragments and facial bones found in Gough's Cave showed extensive cut marks that suggest the flesh was carefully cut away and now scientists believed the inhabitants in the cave indulged in ritual cannibalism . 'Once that was done it was possible to break and remove the facial bones and then very carefully going all the way along the skull doing some percussion or banging using a stone. 'It was a very careful process - they were really trying to create an object.' The gruesome treatment of human corpses at Gough's Cave mirrors similar finds at other ancient sites in central and western Europe. The researchers believe cannibalism may have been part of the customs of disposing of the dead. Professor Chris Stringer, an anthropologist who was involved in excavations at Gough's Cave during the 1980s and 1990s, said despite practicing cannabilism, these people were not much different from us today. He said: 'These people were Cro-Magnons - the people who lived in Europe in the last ice age. 'They were modern people, physically very like us, a bit more strongly built.'","Human bones found at Gough's Cave in Cheddar Gorge, Somerset, bore cuts  and bite marks proving the people there engaged in ritual cannibalism .

"A woman who spent 30 years of her life believing that she suffered from cerebral palsy, only to learn that she had in fact been misdiagnosed and almost all of her symptoms could be cured with just one pill, insists she feels no resentment or anger about her doctor’s life-changing error. Jean Sharon Abbott, 38, from Plymouth, Minnesota, was told she had spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy, when she was just four-years-old, she explained to The Mighty. But after three decades of suffering from muscle spasms, weakness, near immobility, as well as undergoing painful surgical procedures, she learned at the age of 33 that she actually had dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), a rare, yet treatable, muscle disorder. 'Honestly, I’ve never had any negative thoughts about what I went through,' Jean told Daily Mail Online of her misdiagnosis, which saw her confined to a bed for much of her childhood. Scroll down for video . Life-changing error: Jean Sharon Abbott can be seen recovering from surgery when she was 12-years-old. The 38-year-old has now discovered she was misdiagnosed with spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy . Different life: Jean, who is pictured with her husband (L) and by herself (R), used a mobility scooter before she was diagnosed as having dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), a rare, yet treatable, muscle disorder . While Jean admitted that there 'plenty of times' she wished she didn't have to deal with the physical symptoms associated with condition, including her dependence on others to complete everyday tasks, she noted that she still had a 'fantastic childhood' - thanks in large part to the unwavering support of her family and friends. 'Even though I had challenges, my parents were so good with dealing with my disability and didn’t “baby” me,' she explained. 'Also, I had true friendships that I never had to question. All of my life experiences made me who I am today - and I like me.' When Jean was first diagnosed with spastic diplegia, she was considered a textbook case, even though her MRIs and CAT scans didn’t show any typical symptoms of the disorder. And because her neurologist was considered one of the best in the field, second opinions never yielded any other conclusions. 'I had been seen by one of the best in the country, if not the world, and my parents even took me to the leading hospital in the US for a second opinion,' she recalled. 'They confirmed the spastic diplegia diagnosis and said that my doctor taught all of them.' Jean said she never questioned her original diagnosis and instead chose to accept her physical struggles and focus on living her life to the best of her ability. 'I was never one to dwell on my disability or to think about it too much, other than when I was at these doctor appointments,' she said. 'I guess I was too busy trying to live a normal life and having fun with my friends and family.' By the time she was 12-years-old, Jean underwent a 'very painful' muscle transfer to prevent her knees from knocking together when she walked. Miracle drug: Jean, who was once nearly immobile, completed a 10-mile hike with her husband (pictured) four months after she started taking her DRD medication known as L-Dopa . Happy family: Jean is pictured with her husband and their three children following her correct diagnosis of DRD . Although she compared the physical agony to open heart surgery, she said she was glad her parents encouraged her to have the procedure, which helped her a great deal and helped to prevent her from tripping over herself when she walked. Jean, who said she 'still can't get her knees to touch', noted that she was 'happy that it was a permanent procedure', although she would have done it again if needed. When she was in her late twenties, the mother-of-three had a pump implanted in her body to distribute medicine, but when she ended up over-medicated she visited a specialist who would eventually change her life forever. Jean's new doctor questioned her original diagnosis and sent her to another neurologist. Her new neurologist told her she had actually been living with DRD, noting that most of her symptoms would improve or disappear with a daily dose of a medication known as L-Dopa. The neurologist explained that the symptoms of DRD, including the involuntary muscle contractions and tremors, are often mistaken for cerebral palsy or other disorders. But Jean 'couldn't imagine having anything other than spastic diplegia' and confessed that she wasn't even going to fill the prescription until her husband persuaded to her to try it. 'When I began taking it, I was the biggest skeptic,' she said. 'I was expecting no results whatsoever and couldn’t imagine a life any other way.' Jean was given what she now knows to be her correct diagnosis on Good Friday in 2010 and just two days later, on Easter Sunday, she stood for the first time without assistance. New world: Jean can be seen using trekking poles during one of her hikes . True love: The happy couple posed for a photo when Jean still believed she had spastic diplegia . It soon became clear that the medication was working better than Jean could have ever imagined. As she got stronger, her husband began working with her to increase her walking distance and fourth months later, they celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary by traveling the 1,200 mile road around Lake Superior - the location of their first honeymoon. And not only was Jean able to walk to the touristy locations that she previously had to be carried to, she was actually able to complete a 10-mile hike along with her husband. While Jean said that they took their time and had snacks along the way, she was amazed by her physical accomplishment. 'I was so proud of myself and thought that there are so many people in the world that physically can do stuff like this but choose not to,' she said. 'And I began to think of all the places I would love to travel with my family that wouldn’t have been an option before.' And while Jean realized that there are so many things she wants to try now that she can, she still insists that she doesn't have any regrets about receiving her diagnosis so late in life. As someone who believes that everything happens for a reason, she noted that if she hadn’t been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, she probably would have chosen a different college, meaning she never would have met her husband and had three children with him. 'All I know is, I’ve never been one to live with regrets and I wasn’t about to start that thought process as the result of a new diagnosis,' Jean explained. 'Plus, I can do things that I never would have even considered before, so I have no reason to be angry or upset. I’m just so darn happy!' Night out: Jean was wearing heels six months after she started taking L-Dopa to relieve her muscle spasms and tremors . I began to think of all the places I would love to travel with my family that wouldn’t have been an option before . Although L-Dopa has drastically changed her life, Jean still has to make sure that she gets plenty of sleep and remains as stress free as possible, or she can suffer from incredibly sore muscles and cramps, as well as issues with balance and tremors in her hands. 'I work really hard to make sure I get the rest I need and not put too much pressure on myself. And I exercise every day,' she said. 'But it’s still way better than the alternative.' She added: 'I’m so lucky to have this “miracle drug”. It has not only changed my life but the lives of my husband and kids.' Five years after her proper diagnosis, Jean has become an advocate for raising awareness for DRD, which is often misdiagnosed. And eight months ago, she decided to wean herself off of L-Dopa for a week so she could film herself walking, both on and off her medication, in order to help others recognize the symptoms of DRD. Jean posted the video to YouTube in September 2014 and has since received emails from people who said her video helped them recognize DRD in either themselves or their loved ones. She is also blogging about her journey on her website. 'I feel that my story is so important because I’m sure there must be others out there who too are misdiagnosed with [cerebral palsy],' she said. 'If this story helps just one person I will be thrilled.'","Jean Sharon Abbott, 38, from Plymouth, Minnesota, was told she had spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy, when she was four-years-old .

"A federal judge has sentenced former Blackwater security guard Nicholas Slatten to life in prison for his role in a 2007 shooting that killed 14 Iraqi civilians and wounded 17 others. Three other guards - Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard - were each sentenced to 30 years and one day in prison for charges that included manslaughter, attempted manslaughter and using firearms while committing a felony. U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth announced the sentences after a day-long hearing at which defense lawyers had argued for leniency, and prosecutors asked that those sentences - the minimums mandatory under the law - be made even harsher. Scroll down for video . FILE - In these various file photos, Blackwater guards, from left, Dustin Heard, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Nicholas Slatten. A years-long legal fight over a deadly mass shooting of civilians in an Iraq war zone reaches its reckoning point, when four former Blackwater security guards are sentenced for the rampage. Three of the guards, Dustin Heard, Evan Liberty and Paul Slough, face mandatory decades-long sentences because of firearms convictions. A fourth, Nicholas Slatten, faces a penalty of life in prison after being found guilty of first-degree murder. (AP Photo/File) Sentencing: Former Blackwater guard Nicholas Slatten (bottom right) was convicted of first degree murder and on Monday be sentenced to life in prison for his role in the 2007 Nisour Square slaughter that left 14 dead and dozens more maimed and injured. Dustin Heard, Paul Slough and Evan Liberty (clockwise from top left) were received the 30-year minimum sentences plus one day for their multiple manslaughter convictions . U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth on Monday rejected a defense motion to impose lesser sentences on the four, as well as a motion by prosecutors to increase the penalties. Lamberth deferred formally imposing the sentences while hearing arguments from both sides on the sentencing. Defense lawyers argued for mercy but prosecutors said the men have never shown remorse or accepted responsibility. All four were convicted in October for their involvement in the killings that caused an international uproar in Nisoor Square, a crowded traffic circle in downtown Baghdad. The legal fight over the killings has spanned years. Prosecutors have described the shooting as an unprovoked ambush of civilians, though defense lawyers countered that the men were targeted with gunfire, and shot back in self-defense. Dozens of Iraqi witnesses to the bloody September day in Baghdad volunteered to travel to Washington to testify against the former guards, the New York Times reported. They described to jurors a scene of absolute horror, one that came as if out of the clear blue. They said they took cover after hearing machine-gun fire start ring after four American armored vehicles rolled into busy Nisour Square. A traffic officer who was on the scene described watching a woman cradle her dead son in her arms before she, too, was murdered by Blackwater guards. Mandatory minimums: A man caring a poster that reads 'approximate locations of victims around Nisoor Square' enters the E.

Former co-workers: Former Blackwater security guards stand in line to enter the E. Barrett Prettyman federal courthouse in Washington in support of the men awaiting sentencing . ‘There was a lady. She was screaming and weeping about her son and asking for help,’ Sarhan Deab Abdul Moniem said through an interpreter. ‘I asked her to open up the door so I could help her. But she was paying attention only to her son.’ Majed Salman Abdel Kareem al-Gharbawi, 55, described being shot in the gut and slumping to the ground alongside another wounded man. ‘He was screaming and praying to god, for Allah to save him from this calamity,’ Gharbawi testified. ‘So I told him, let’s do that together.’ Gharbawi stayed down as the other man decided to make a run for it—a decision that cost the man his life. ‘His body was shaking violently as the bullets were piercing him and hitting the sidewalk,’ Gharbawi said. According to the Times, the Blackwater guards continued shooting into the man’s body well after he was clearly dead. The defense argued for mercy Monday by saying that decades-long sentences would be unconstitutionally harsh punishments for men who operated in a stressful, war-torn environment, and who have proud military careers and close family ties. The firearms convictions alone carry mandatory minimum sentences of 30 years in prison. The government sought sentences far beyond that, partly because it said the men have never shown remorse or accepted responsibility.

Unimaginable: Hair is seen on the bullet riddled and blood stained windshield of a car of two women shot dead. One witness said he watched a man bolt for his life only to be riddled with bullets before guards continued to fire at his clearly dead body . The sentencing is unlikely to bring an end to the legal wrangling, which began even before the guards were first charged in 2008. A judge later dismissed the case before trial, but a federal appeals court revived it and the guards were indicted again in October 2013. Even before the trial began, defense lawyers had identified multiple issues as likely forming the basis of an appeal, including whether there was proper legal jurisdiction to charge them in the first place. The statute under which they were charged, the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, covers the overseas crimes of Defense Department civilian employees, military contractors and others who are supporting the American war mission. But defense lawyers note that the Blackwater defendants worked as State Department contractors and were in Iraq to provide diplomatic, not military, services.

"William Shakespeare may indeed have been the original author of the play Double Falsehood after all . A play discovered nearly 300 years ago and said to be a Shakespeare forgery was really written by the Bard himself, new research has revealed. The work titled Double Falsehood was presented by theatre impresario Lewis Theobald in the 18th century as an adaptation of a Shakespeare play about a Spanish nobleman's ignoble pursuit of two women. Theobald, a known scholar of Shakespeare, mounted his play at Drury Lane Theatre in London on December 13, 1727, claiming that it was a re-working of an original by the Bard and that he had three original texts. His claims were greeted with widespread scepticism in the eighteenth century, including from the great poet Alexander Pope, who had considerable clout. But a new study of its language to build up a psychological profile of the writer 'strongly identifies' the legendary playwright as the true author. Dr Ryan Boyd of the University of Texas said: 'Research in psychology has shown some of the core features of who a person is at their deepest level can be revealed based on how they use language. 'With our new study, we show you can actually take a lot of this information and put it all together at once to understand an author like Shakespeare rather deeply.' The study applied psychological theory and text analysing software and goes beyond confirming authorship by word counts and linguistic regularities. Mr Boyd explained: 'This research shows it is indeed possible to start modelling peoples' mental worlds in much more complete ways. 'We do not need a time machine and a survey form to figure out what type of person Shakespeare was - we can determine that very accurately just based on how he wrote using methods that are objective and easy to do.' Results showed the author of Double Falsehood was likely to be sociable and fairly well educated, findings that do not fit with accounts of Theobald as rigid and abrasive. Theobald published Double Falsehood in 1728 and claimed it was based on three original Shakespeare manuscripts which have since been lost, presumably destroyed by a library fire. Yet the authorship of the play has been hotly contested ever since. To get to the bottom of the mystery 33 plays by the Bard, twelve by Theobald and nine by Shakespeare's collaborator John Fletcher, were examined in the study published in Psychological Science. Jacobean dramatist John Fletcher (left) most likely collaborated with Shakespeare on Double Falsehood (right), which was long thought not to have had anything to do with the Bard . Software evaluated 'function words' including pronouns, articles and prepositions and words belonging to various content categories such as emotions, family, sensory perception and religion. They also looked at 'categorical writing' which tends to be heavy on nouns, articles and prepositions and indicates an analytic or formal way of thinking. People who rate high on this are likely to be emotionally distant, applying problem solving approaches to everyday situations while those who rate low tend to live in the moment and are more focused on social matters. By aggregating dozens of psychological features of each playwright, the researchers were able to create a psychological signature for each individual and compare them with that of the writer of Double Falsehood. Every measure but one identified Shakespeare as the likely author with Theobald identified as the best match only when it came to his use of content words. But when the texts were analysed across individual acts, they found a more nuanced picture. The first three continued to point the finger at Shakespeare, but for the fourth and fifth the measures varied between him and Fletcher. Again, Theobald's influence appeared to be very minor. Boyd said: 'Honestly, I was surprised to see such a strong signal for Shakespeare showing through in the results. 'Going into the research without any real background knowledge, I had just kind of assumed it was going to be a pretty cut and dry case of a fake Shakespeare play, which would have been really interesting in and of itself.' Tangled relationships, women disguised as men, intrigue laced with tragedy and comedy - some might say Double Falsehood has all the hallmarks of Shakespeare. Set in the province of Andalusia in Spain, a love rat called Henriquez Angelo courts a beautiful peasant girl, Violante, and forces himself upon her when she rejects his advances. Stricken by a guilty conscience he nevertheless seduces Leonora, the future wife of his absent best friend Julio. She accepts Henriquez's marriage proposal against her will, because her father Don Bernardo wants a family connection with nobility. Leonora writes a letter to Julio who returns to interrupt the wedding, causing her to faint. Her father discovers a dagger and suicide note on her person, revealing her determination not to be forced into marriage. But for the best part of three centuries the play was dismissed as a falsehood in more than just title. That was until 2010 when Professor Brean Hammond, of the University of Nottingham, put forward his thesis that the play originates from a collaboration between Shakespeare and Jacobean dramatist John Fletcher. He claimed the versification was very similar to other works by Shakespeare and that Double Falsehood contained words never seen before and not previously used by Theobald. Dr Boyd's new study is the latest to support this revisionist view.","Double Falsehood was presented by Lewis Theobald in the 18th century .

"A husband accused of trying to murder his cheating wife was ready to let her have sex with another man once a month as long as she stayed with him, his trial heard yesterday. A close friend told how Joseph O’Riordan, 74, had confided in him about the extraordinary plan for his 47-year-old wife Mandy. O’Riordan, a councillor and former nightclub owner, stabbed her eight times in a jealous rage after finding out she had been having an affair with a postman. Extraordinary deal: Joseph O'Riordan stabbed his wife of ten years Amanda (left) with a seven inch kitchen knife eight times - yesterday Brighton Crown Court heard he was considering allowing her to have affairs . She suffered life-threatening injuries after being knifed in the torso, chest, arms and back. The jury was also shown dramatic footage of the moment police arrived at the couple’s home to be greeted by a ‘calm’ O’Riordan opening the door. The revelation of his proposal for keeping his wife of ten years came from Alfred Harris. He told how O’Riordan had confided five days before the attack that he believed she was having an affair. O’Riordan was ‘choked up and emotional’ when he said: ‘I think Amanda is playing away. She’s getting her nails and hair done more regularly, she’s been on a diet and doesn’t want sex.’ Asking for a suit: O'Riordan sent his wife this letter from his prison cell . The following day, added Mr Harris, the men met for a pub lunch in O’Riordan’s home village of Polegate, East Sussex. ‘I saw Joe and he told me that Amanda had been seeing someone else – a guy who drove a van. Joe said he loved Amanda to bits and if she wanted to have sex with someone else once a month that would be okay as long as she stayed with him.’ In a statement read to Brighton Crown Court, Mr Harris also described the couple as ‘loving and close’. He was ‘so shocked’ to learn that O’Riordan had attacked his wife at their flat on a residential care home estate. The jury saw images of four police officers, one of whom was wearing a lapel camera, arriving shortly before 10pm last October 22 after racing to the scene. PC Dave Catt said they drew their ‘incapacitating’ sprays fearing the knifeman would be still holding his weapon. They were greeted by O’Riordan wearing a blood-spattered light blue shirt and holding a cordless phone on which he had phoned for an ambulance. Mr Catt said O’Riordan admitted: ‘I found out that she was having an affair and I lost it.’ Mrs O’Riordan was moaning and lying on a bed, holding a towel to her stomach with a deep chest wound and serious wounds to her hand and back. Paramedics arrived moments later and took her to hospital. Jurors looked at two screens as images of her husband’s arrest and subsequent detention at a police station were shown. Growing suspicion: Giving evidence yesterday Alfred Harris – a friend of the couple for more than six years – told how O’Riordan had confided in him that he believed his wife was having an affair . Yesterday, jurors at Brighton Crown Court (above) were shown dramatic footage of the moment police arrived at the couple’s home to be greeted by a ‘calm’ Mr O’Riordan opening the door . PC Stuart Kenway told how, as O’Riordan had opened the door, he ‘appeared calm and composed and the situation was surreal’ as he then said: ‘She is in the bedroom – do you want the knife?’ Officers were directed to a 7in blade with a black handle which was in the kitchen. Dr Stephen Drage, an intensive care consultant with Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, told the jury how seriously Mrs O’Riordan was hurt. ‘It is quite clear she was bleeding to death,’ he said. ‘She underwent life-saving surgery which took six hours.’ O’Riordan denies attempted murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Joseph O'Riordan, 73, stabbed wife eight times after discovering her affair .

"A woman who was arrested and charged with manslaughter for a crash that caused the death of a 5-year-old child showed no remorse for her actions according to court records. Aaronessa Keaton of Phoenix, Arizona was eight months pregnant and had marijuana and Benzodiazepines in her system when she collided head-on with a car carrying two children in February 2014, and one of the children later died from their injuries. When told of this after her arrest, Keaton, 24, said; 'Sh*t happens.'

Keaton hit another car head-on (above) while she was eight months pregnant and had marijuana and Benzodiazepines in her system . Keaton, who was also on probation for marijuana possession charges at the time, was indicted by a grand jury in February, and taken in Monday after she was pulled over for a traffic stop. According to CBS 5, Keaton was driving southbound on February 28, 2014 when she swiped a car going north, and she then continued across the northbound lane until she struck a 2007 Nissan Frontier. That car contained the child whose injuries were so severe they later died. The other child in the car was in serious condition, but later made a full recovery, and both adults in the front seat suffered only minor injuries. Keaton was also rushed to the hospital where an emergency C-section was performed. The baby, which had diazepenes and THC in their system as well, was in extremely critical condition after it was delivered.","Aaronessa Keaton was arrested Monday and charged with manslaughter for a 2014 accident that resulted in the death of a 5-year-old child .

"They say the couple who trains together, stays together - and that's certainly the case for super fit Ali Gordon and his girlfriend, Lydia Millen. In fact, this gorgeous twosome, who met on Instagram and live in Milton Keynes, could easily be contenders for the UK's fittest couple. Especially after Ali, 26, helped to teach his girlfriend - who works as a full-time blogger - how to train hard and eat clean, getting her to ditch her unhealthy habits and focus on getting fit. Scroll down for video . Lydia Millen and Ali Gordon met on Instagram after he liked one of her pictures, the pair have now been dating two years and could easily be the UK's fittest couple . Lydia, 27, explained: 'I was so unhealthy [before I met Ali]. I smoked up to 20 cigarettes a day, binge drank at weekends and my diet was just awful I didn't have a clue and was majorly under eating. 'I saw that Ali looked at his body a completely different way than I did and I almost felt a little jealous, I wanted to look at mine that way. 'So he started schooling me on training, nutrition and I fell in love with the lifestyle. I've now been smoke free for two years and I can't remember the last time I had a drink.' The couple met two years ago after Ali 'liked' one of Lydia's Instagram pictures. Both of them have large followings on the site with Lydia boasting 194,000 followers and Ali has 109,000. The pair quickly got chatting, and after meeting at a party, ended up moving in together. Lydia and Ali both have large followings on Instagram and keep their fans updated with pictures of themselves . Lydia shared this sweet snap of her and her boyfriend on Instagram as the pair enjoyed a day together . Ali had started training seven years ago. He said: 'I was coached into fitness by my friends one Easter weekend back in 2008 and I haven't looked back since. 'It brings me so much energy and I feel so much better in myself for smashing out a gym session.' He continued: 'When I first met Lydia she didn't lead the healthiest of lifestyles mainly due to a lack of guidance. 'I think it's so easy for people to assume starving yourself of food is the best way to stay slim when in fact more of the right food is more important due to the importance of health inside and out. 'After a few conversations, we soon had her hitting the gym and eating on regular intervals she seems so much more satisfied now she is eating more than one meal per day.' Lydia and Ali show off their impressive muscles as they have an arm wrestle in the gum . Lydia is a full time blogger, she often shares pictures of her stylish outfits with her Instagram fans . And Ali, who is an ambassador for PhD Nutrition – a range of sports nutrition products - explained that helping Lydia train isn't about making her a 'better looking' person. He said: 'I think looking good and feeling good for yourself is the most important thing. 'Of course I love having a partner with a killer body, however, her happiness is more important than my ideal. 'So if Lydia decided fitness wasn't her thing and wanted to lay off the intensity, I would be cool with that she would still be the same Lydia I know.' Lydia explained that the couple first got in contact after Ali 'liked' one of her photographs on Instagram. Ali and Lydia pose in their work out gear, the couple say they don't always train together but they do enjoy an abs session once in a while . She said: 'Ali's friend showed him a picture of a girl that I'm friends with and he found a picture of me with her on her Instagram and went onto my page. 'He liked a picture of my iPad mini (yes I still remember) and when I saw his picture I was instantly intrigued so I followed him. 'Then he found me on Twitter and we started direct messaging there. As for love at first like, the attraction was definitely instant and I followed him straight back but in actual fact we didn't get into an official relationship for about four months after.' Ali said that after chatting on the social media site the pair arranged to meet up at a party that weekend after realising that they had friends in common. Ali said: 'Even though we lived an hour apart we had quite a few mutual friends unbeknownst until we began talking. 'So within the week Lydia was heading up to my city for a friends party and asked me to come and join for the celebrations, so it was really nice relaxed and easy way to meet for the first time.' Ali posted this cute picture of him and Lydia both wearing their exercise gear on his Instagram . Lydia, who is an ambassador for PhD Woman, said that the pair will train together sometimes, often enjoying an ab workout together. She said: 'We do [train together] but not all the time because he trains so differently to me as our goals are different. 'He wants to put on muscle mass and lose body fat whereas I'm just training to stay slim and healthy so sometimes it's just best that he trains with his friends. 'Although we do enjoy an abs session together. It's good to have a gym buddy! Ali continued: 'We love an ab circuit. Lydia really puts me through my paces, abs aren't my strong hold. 'When it comes to other body parts we tend to split up as my training style doesn't match Lydia's, it's nice to be in the gym together though she rocks a gym outfit very well.' Lydia will often share her fashion finds with her Instagram followers, whilst Ali poses on some steps . Ali and Lydia both admit that sometimes it's hard to get yourself to the gym but they train hair to keep themselves in shape . But the couple aren't immune to having off days. Lydia said: 'Sometimes you can even have an ""off month"" but for me it's all part of the process, some days will be better than others and that's natural. 'Just as long as you get back on and keep going, don't give up. I also like to pin pictures of Victoria's Secret models to the wall in my office, that always helps! She continued: 'I'd be lying if it didn't take a lot of work, knowledge and motivation. 'Knowing what to put in your body as well as knowing what to do with your body is just as important. As well as prepping meals for the week, I also take nutrition supplements from PhD woman.' Ali said: 'The days you feel weakest and have zero motivation are the days that you need to show your true strength push through the boundaries and work your a*** off, the feeling after finishing is just as much if not more satisfying as any other.'","Ali Gordon and Lydia Millen met when he liked her picture on Instagram .

"The tranquility of a high-priced inner-Sydney suburb has been shattered as a transport war has broken out between locals and commuters. A fed up resident of Cammeray, a wealthy North Shore suburb, stuck a note to the windscreen of car parked near a school they believed belonged to an outsiders. 'Dear Northern Beaches Parasites and car dependent Tragics,' it read. This controversial note was left on the windscreen of a car by a fed-up resident of Cammeray . 'If you can't afford to park in the CBD don't come here!! Cammeray is not a Parking Lot for Losers. Get out of your cars stop clogging up the roads and annoying local residents. 'Go back to your insular peninsular... after all what do you do once you get here? Head straight for the BUS STOP.' Dijana Wolffram, a local who is friends with the woman who found the note, said the letter created a few laughs among other residents when she posted it to a community Facebook page. One reply read: 'We laughed. But we were horrified that such a nimby (Not In My Backyard) culture existed in Cammeray. After all they are really lucky to be in such a transport hub, that has such a wonderful bus service. Share the love! Jason will park there again next Wednesday, so watch this space.' The North Shore suburb was split on the parking issue, with other locals 'horrified' by the letter . A local woman, who only wanted to be known as Lauren, did not agree with the tone of the note, but said it was a real issue. 'Not a fan of the way they wrote it, but we have this problem in our street,' she said in a Facebook post. 'Every Tom dick and harry park there cars in our street all day and then walk to Roseville station. It's really annoying... They park up your a***, sometimes taking up 2 spots. It's really difficult for those that live in the street to park!' However, Marina Daillecourt did not agree with the letter. 'No one has anymore right to park on the road than any one else,' Ms Daillecourt said on Facebook. 'You don't own the off street parking on your street.

"A man who passed out at a friend's party woke up with more than a hangover when he discovered a guest had tattooed his back. While Josh Darnbrough, 24, slept, his mate Rob Gaskell, also 24, inked the words 'If found face down call an ambulance' on his back, using a DIY kit. Josh, from Mossley, near Ashton, only discovered the prank the following day after looking in a mirror - and said his partner went 'absolutely bonkers' when she saw it. Josh Darnbrough awoke after a party to find that his friend had tattooed his back . Josh (centre) was tattooed by his friend Rob Gaskell (right) who was taking revenge on his mate after Josh had attempted to tattoo Rob with an at-home kit and it went horribly wrong . Rob said he carried out the practical joke on Josh, who had passed out at a New Year's Eve party, in revenge for a tattoo Josh did on Rob's leg two years ago - which had gone horribly wrong. Starting off with a design for a lizard, Josh tried to turn it into a cross, then some hands and a gun - leading to one almighty, permanent mess on Rob's leg and causing his partner to go 'bonkers'. So when he saw Josh passed out at the party, Rob - who is a father of three - said he 'couldn't resist' the opportunity to execute revenge - and spent 30 minutes etching his own design into his mate's back. Amazingly, the prank hasn't harmed the pair's friendship - and the childhood friends, who are both having their tattoos removed, still see each other every day. But Rob does admit to regretting the prank once he had sobered up. He said: 'The opportunity presented itself and I couldn't resist. 'I didn't feel guilty when I was doing it because I'd had a few drinks myself but I was quite remorseful afterwards and asked everyone not to tell Josh who had done it.' Josh, who is a support worker, said although it was a shock, he has managed to see the funny side. 'I was pretty astonished when I looked in the mirror - I thought, ""I didn't go to bed with a tattoo""', he said. 'I didn't know when I'd got it and no one would tell me who'd done it. But since I found out it was Rob it hasn't affected our friendship at all - we still see each other every day. It's just practical jokes between mates.' Rob, also a support worker, added that he would advise anyone against at-home tattoos. 'We had bought a DIY tattoo kit online and originally it was a well-intentioned exercise,' he said. 'Then when it didn't turn out right it dawned on me this was forever and I was stuck with it. The pair are both getting their tattoos removed by laser technician Maria Patricia (right) and say the incident hasn't affected their friendship . 'Josh started off doing a lizard, then a cross, then some hands and a gun - he did an abomination of a job and every time he tried to touch it up it got worse. 'When my partner saw it she went absolutely bonkers. If anyone is thinking of trying their own DIY tattoos - I would just say, don't.' The pair are now getting their tattoos removed with laser treatment - carried out by technician Maria Patricia at the clinic she runs based at her Ashton home. Maria, 47, who started her business four years ago, says she has seen an increasing number of people seeking help after getting DIY tattoos. 'We are not against tattoos here at all, but DIY ones can lead to problems,' she said. 'Sometimes people come in and it's scarred because they have pushed the needle too far in and dragged it. 'You can also get infections or what we call 'blow out' when the needle is pushed in so deep there is nowhere the ink can go and it just spreads, looking like a bruise. 'No laser can get that out when it happens, you just have to get a cover-up tattoo.' Surprisingly enough Maria would also advise on going to professional rather than doing your tattoos yourself. 'We've definitely seen an increase in people coming to us with home made tattoos since we opened. 'We're just trying to say to people if you want a tattoo done, go somewhere professional, do not use one of these DIY kits.'","Josh Darnbrough only noticed the tattoo on his back the following day .

"Exposure to a wide range of bacteria is necessary to prime the immune system early in life, according to the hygiene hypothesis . Western diets and an emphasis on sterile, germ-free food has made us more likely to allergies, new research suggests. A lack of bacteria in the gut means we are less equipped to deal with germs - meaning that our bodies often overreact when we come into contact with bugs, dust or pollen. The findings bolster the theory that modern obsession with hygiene and cleanliness has driven a boom in allergies and health problems. According to the ‘hygiene hypothesis’, exposure to a wide range of bacteria is necessary to prime the immune system early in life. Many scientists believe that modern society, with its mania for sanitation and easy access to antibiotics, makes us hypersensitive to harmless allergens. The latest work, published today in the journal Cell Reports, compared the bacteria in the guts of people from the US and Papua New Guinea - one of the least industrialised nations on Earth. The research, by Canadian and Australian scientists, found that people in the US had far smaller collection of bacteria - called the ‘microbiome’ - than people from Papua New Guinea. Study author Jens Walter, of the University of Alberta in Canada, said: ‘There are several aspects of western lifestyle that have been hypothesized to alter the gut microbiome and decrease diversity. ‘These include diet, sanitation, and clinical practices such as antibiotic use and caesarean sections, but we lack a conceptual understanding of how our microbiomes are altered.’ The research team found that Papua New Guineans have vastly different compositional profiles compared with US residents. Americans lacked 50 different bacterial types present in most Papua New Guineans. Professor Walter said: ‘These findings suggest that lifestyle practices that reduce bacterial dispersal - specifically sanitation and drinking water treatment - might be an important cause of microbiome alterations. ‘We propose a model based on ecological theory that fits the data and provides an explanation for the decline of microbiota diversity in urban-industrialized societies.’ The scientists insisted that treating food and water is still vital - reducing the number of illnesses and deaths from bacterial infections. A lack of bacteria in the gut means we are less equipped to deal with germs - meaning that our bodies often overreact when we come into contact with bugs, dust or pollen (file photo) But they said that Western diets may have contributed to increases in some chronic diseases. Asthma, peanut allergies and hayfever are examples of allergic conditions that have been linked by previous research to the problems caused by insufficient bacteria in the gut. Co-author Andrew Greenhill, a senior lecturer in microbiology at Federation University Australia, said: ‘We can think about how we can reduce the collateral damage of modern lifestyle practices on the gut microbiome without jeopardizing the benefits. ‘The findings from this study provide information that could be used to develop strategies to prevent and redress the impact of westernization and potentially support the dispersal and transmission of microbes that have been eradicated.’ The more bleach used in the home, the more likely children were to become ill, a study found . Bleach could leave children more susceptible to catching flu, tonsillitis or other infections, according to a study published earlier this month. Researchers found a link between a weekly use of bleach in the home and the frequency of infections, particularly respiratory ones. They concluded that passive exposure to bleach was associated with a 20 per cent increase in the risk of flu in the previous year. It was also linked with a 35 per cent rise in the risk of recurrent tonsillitis. In light of the findings, experts said the use of bleach in the home was a 'public health concern.' The study looked at the potential impact of exposure to bleach among more than 9,000 schoolchildren between the ages of six and 12 in the Netherlands, Finland and Barcelona. Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire on the number and frequency of flu, tonsillitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis (inflammation of the ear canal), and pneumonia infections their children had suffered in the preceding 12 months. They were also asked whether they used bleach to clean their homes at least once a week. The study took into account factors such as passive smoking at home, parental education, household mould and use of bleach to clean schools. The findings indicated that the number and frequency of infections were higher among children whose parents regularly used bleach to clean the home in all three countries. As well as being statistically significant for flu and tonsillitis, the risk of any recurrent infection was 18 per cent higher among children whose parents regularly used bleach. One possible explanation was that the irritant properties of compounds generated during the cleaning process may damage the lining of lung cells, sparking inflammation and making it easier for infections to take hold.","Lack of bacteria in the gut means we are less equipped to deal with germs .

"Wanted: Police in Maryland have issued a warrant for the arrest of 26-year-old karate instructor Alexander Soumbadze who has been charged with eight counts of child pornography . Police in Maryland have launched a manhunt for a 26-year-old karate instructor who has been charged with possessing child pornography. The Montgomery County Police Department said Friday that Alexander Soumbadze faces eight possession of child pornography counts. Soumbadze has recently admitted to trading and receiving child pornography, after which police say the Georgian national fled the country. An investigation also uncovered videos of the martial arts expert inappropriately touching and engaging in sexual acts with adolescent males at a Maryland karate studio where he was co-owner and instructor. Officials say the videos were taken before October 2011 and that they are attempting to locate victims to determine possible additional charges. According to Montgomery County police, the 26-year-old, a native of Tbilisi, Georgia, fled the US after confessing to the crimes. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of the Bethesda resident. According to a press release put out by the Montgomery County police Friday, in December 2014, the agency was tipped off by colleagues in South Dakota that a Maryland resident was uploading child pornography. Vile acts: Police have recovered videos showing the martial arts teacher (far right) molesting boys at the On The Mat Sports International in Chevy Chase, formerly known as DC Martial Arts . Fugitive: The Tbilisi, Georgia, native admitted to trading child pornography videos earlier this month. Two days after his interview with police, he fled, possibly returning to his native country . Armed with court orders, detectives in Maryland were able to obtain subscription information corresponding to the suspect, which led them to Soumbadze. On April 1, 2015, police executed a search warrant at Soumbadze’s home in Bethesda, seizing several electronic devices that yielded eight pornographic videos featuring children. Other recordings recovered by police allegedly showed the suspect molesting boys at his karate studio on Wisconsin Avenue in Chevy Chase. Soumbadze has been affiliated with the On The Mat Sports International karate studio, formerly known as DC Martial Arts, since he was a young child and took classes there as a martial arts student. During an interview with police, the 26-year-old sensei admitted to trading and receiving child porn. Close ties: Soumbadze has been affiliated with karate studio (pictured) since he was a young child and took classes there as a martial arts student . Two days after Soumbadze was questioned by police, he fled the country, possibly returning to his native Georgia. Police spokeswoman Rebecca Innocenti told Bethesda Magazine that Georgia has an extradition treaty with the US, but their goal now is to complete the investigation and identify the victims in the videos before setting the diplomatic process in motion. In a profile of the On the Mat studio in February, Soumbadze told BethesdaNow.com that his parents, both Georgian diplomats, brought him to the US when he was 5 years old. He graduated from Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in 2006.","Arrest warrant has been issued for Alex Soumbadze, 26, a karate instructor from Bethesda, Maryland .

"A report suggests that carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels could be captured and used to produce the fizz in Cola (stock image shown) We may be told that fizzy drinks aren’t good for our health, but there's a chance that they could be beneficial to the planet. An Australian government report suggests that carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels could be captured and used to produce the fizz in Cola. Many nations are looking into Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies as a way to cut their greenhouse house emissions, of which carbon dioxide plays a large role. CCS refers to the process of capturing carbon released by burning fossil fuels and storing it in porous rock layers in areas such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs. The technology has the potential to reduce the emissions of a typical coal-power plant by up to 90 per cent, but there are concerns over storing such huge amounts of carbon underground. The government’s Energy White Paper has an idea of how to overcome this. After noting that industrial processes, which rely on the combustion of fossil fuels, are responsible for a significant proportion of Australia’s carbon dioxide emissions, it says: ‘If the CO2 can be captured before it is released to the atmosphere it can either be utilised in other products or permanently stored in deep geological formations. ‘Australia has worked closely with other countries which rely heavily on fossil fuels to investigate opportunities to utilise CO2 in products such as carbonated drinks and plastics or to enhance the growth of oil-rich algae in solar bioreactors to produce biofuel.’ This implies that as well as investigating the production of biofuels, carbon dioxide could be stashed in fizzy drinks. However, the report goes on to note that: ‘While these processes are promising, there is no commercial CO2 re-use in Australia, largely reflecting the high cost of capturing the CO2 from a flue gas stream.’ Of course, cans of fizzy drinks emit gas when they are opened, as shown by the sharp hissing noise, and there is no mention of how this gas could be captured too. The Register obtained consumption data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics that suggest 944 million litres of fizzy drinks are consumed in Australia in a year. It’s previously been calculated that there are 2.2 grams of carbon dioxide in a typical can of Coke, which means that just over 2,000 tonnes of carbon emissions could be saved if the gas was captured in cans – and not released again. It's estimated that 3,299 tonnes of carbon dioxide are released every day from people drinking Coca Cola alone, according to an article in the Herald Sun. So if the gas came from a recycled source, it could play a small role in helping the environment. Last April, an IPCC report highlighted a number of barriers to using CCS, including fatal CO2 leaks, transport issues and operational risks, such as seismic tremors. But geologists came to the defence of the controvertial method of mitigating global warming. The report said: ‘Barriers to large‐scale deployment of CCS technologies include concerns about the operational safety and long‐term integrity of CO2 storage as well as transport risks.’ But Stuart Haszeldine, a professor of CCS at Edinburgh University, told MailOnline that with regard to carbon capture, the IPCC report was 'inherently conservative' and 'outdated.' Although there are concerns about burying billions of tonnes of CO2 underground, engineers have been doing something similar for decades. Since the 1930s, the oil and gas industry has been injecting various fluids underground, and since then, researchers have been attempting to understand the risks this poses to human safety. Last April, an IPCC report highlighted a number of barriers to using CCS, including fatal CO2 leaks, transport issues and operational risks, such as seismic tremors. A CCS storage facility in Schwarze Pumpe, Brandenburg, Germany, is pictured . One of the main concerns over CCS is the pressure that it can exert on the porous rock deep underground. ‘It’s like putting more air into your car tyre,’ explained Professor Haszeldine. ‘Because you’ve got a volume of air in there already, when you increase pressure you can crack rock.’ But he added that the oil and gas industry has the technologies to monitor this pressure and prevent subsurface cracks from appearing. ‘The other type of risk is there are geological faults underground, and if you increase the pressure, then that can lubricate that fault and create a small tremor on it,’ said Professor Haszeldine. ‘That hasn’t happened with carbon dioxide disposal, but it has happened with dams on a tiny scale.’ If a tremor is large enough, it could cause CO2 to leak back to the surface and into the atmosphere. This would be a hazard because CO2 at high concentrations is an asphyxiant and fatal to humans. In 2010, a study by Duke University found that leaks from carbon dioxide injected deep underground could bubble up into drinking water aquifers near the surface, driving up levels of contaminants in the water ten-fold. Professor Haszeldine, however, said their more recent studies have placed the risk level to humans dying from a CCS leak at one in 30 million. Last year, the UK government said it will fund a multi-million pound project to design a carbon capture and storage plant at the Peterhead power station in Scotland. Meanwhile the U.S. has 19 large-scale CCS projects in operation or in various stages of development – the greatest amount for any country.","Australian  report suggests ways carbon dioxide could be captured .

"George Kidd, the chief commissioner of The Direct Marketing Commission, said it would be investigating two firms . Two firms exposed by the Daily Mail as selling private information are to be probed by the industry watchdog. B2C Data sold our undercover reporters the financial data of 15,000 people – including details about their pension pots, incomes and investments. The second firm – Data Bubble – supplied our team with health details on 3,000 patients – such as whether they suffered from high blood pressure, arthritis or even bladder problems. The Direct Marketing Commission said it would probe both companies over claims that they had breached the rules on the sale of private data. It confirmed it was ‘formally investigating two companies following allegations in the Daily Mail that personal data was shared inappropriately and without the consent of users’. George Kidd, the chief commissioner, said: ‘The allegations in the Daily Mail are serious. People must be able to trust those with whom they share their data. We will look carefully at the roles and conduct of these two companies and advise the Direct Marketing Association on our findings quickly.’ The firms are already at the centre of a major probe by the Information Commissioner’s Office, which said the sale of such details was ‘on the face of it, a very serious breach of the Data Protection Act’. In meetings covertly filmed by our reporters, bosses at B2C Data were seen boasting of how they held thousands of details on every family in Britain. One, Gareth Doran, boasted: ‘We know what clothes they buy, what health products they buy, where they go on holiday, how many times they go on holiday, what income they’ve got, whether they have children.’ Data Bubble bosses offered to provide our reporters with the names of people with ‘different ailments’ for around 16p each. When asked how the information was obtained, the firm’s owner, hypnotherapist Joanne Clayton, said: ‘It could be people who bought mobility products from a catalogue … or even if they’ve been on holiday and they’ve ticked to say that they are needing help on the flight with regards to that, we can then identify that they actually have problems with mobility.’ Data Bubble owner Joanne Clayton, pictured, said that they obtained information from people who brought products in a mobility catalogue . Both companies sold the records despite not carrying out checks on the Mail’s bogus cold calling firm. Had they done so they would have quickly discovered it was simply a website and was not registered or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The announcement follows calls – led by David Cameron – for a clampdown on companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent. The Prime Minister suggested on Monday night that the law would be tightened if loopholes were being exploited by unscrupulous cold callers.","The Direct Marketing Commission probing B2C Data and Data Bubble .

"Britain faces a 'coalition of chaos' under Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon, David Cameron warned today. The Prime Minister, who travelled to Glasgow this morning to unveil the Tory Party's Scottish manifesto, accused the SNP and Labour of posing a 'clear and present danger' to Britain. He said the two parties were pretending to 'slug it out' ahead of next month's poll – but insisted they were both working to ramp up spending regardless of the deficit. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister, who travelled to Glasgow this morning to unveil the Tory Party's Scottish manifesto, accused the SNP and Labour of posing a 'clear and present danger' to Britain . Mr Cameron said Ed Miliband could now only become Prime Minister with the support of the SNP. He told activists: 'We meet here in Scotland in the middle of a massive political fight. We've got Labour and the SNP on opposite sides – slugging it out – but if you take a step back they're really on the same side. 'You have a weak Labour party, who want more spending, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes. And the people who will prop them up, the SNP – who want even more spending, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes.' Mr Cameron said together, the SNP and Labour 'pose a clear threat to the future of our United Kingdom', adding: 'A coalition of chaos.' He said: The SNP acting as the chain to Labour's wrecking ball, running right through our economic recovery - and it will be you who pays the price. With jobs losses, massive tax rises and an economy back on brink of bankruptcy.' Mr Cameron's blistering attack comes ahead of tonight's live TV election debates between the main 'challenger' parties - including Mr Miliband and Ms Sturgeon, alongside the leaders of Ukip, the Greens and Plaid Cymru. Mr Cameron walks with the leader of Scottish Conservatives as they launch the Tories' election manifesto today . David Cameron and Nick Clegg are not taking part because they have been in power for the last five years. Mr Miliband is expected to use the BBC debate to issue a warning to Scottish voters that success for the SNP north of the border could deliver a Conservative government in Westminster. The Labour leader has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP in a hung Parliament, but he is likely to face calls from Ms Sturgeon to join a 'progressive alliance' to bring an immediate end to austerity, which is also backed by Plaid and the Greens. Nicola Sturgeon has called on Ed Miliband to work with the SNP to 'lock out' David Cameron from Number 10 . Conservatives are hoping that the debate would give added bite to their claim that a Miliband administration would be 'in the pocket' of the SNP. Tory deputy chief whip Greg Hands said: 'Will we see the alternative to David Cameron in the Challengers Debate? A Frankenstein coalition to bankrupt and break up Britain.' Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in the north-west, said he asked to take part in the debate, but was 'denied the opportunity' by broadcasters. The Liberal Democrat leader told LBC radio: 'David Cameron, I know, didn't want to participate in it, but I don't see why I should have been denied the opportunity to put the side of the story of what the coalition government has done, even if he didn't want to. 'I find it very odd that the debate tonight doesn't have anybody from one of the parties that have actually been trying to govern our country.' Ms Sturgeon said the debate was 'a fantastic moment of opportunity to deliver the positive change that people are looking for'. 'The SNP will be a positive and constructive voice at Westminster, ready to join others in a progressive alliance to end austerity and protect vital public services like the NHS.' Calling on Mr Miliband to 'change direction', Ms Wood said: 'We're calling for an end to austerity and instead balancing the books through job creation and infrastructure investment. 'It's time weapons of mass destruction were confined to history and we divert funds to improve standards of living and prospects for people.' In the debate, each of the five leaders will be allowed a short opening statement before Dimbleby invites questions from 200 voters. Mr Miliband will be positioned to the far left next to Ms Wood and Mr Farage to the far right next to Ms Sturgeon with Ms Bennett in the middle of the group. The 90-minute programme will cover five subjects. Each question will see one-minute opening statements followed by 10 minutes of free debate.","The PM said the SNP and Labour presented a 'clear and present danger'

"Murder plot: Dr. Anthony J. Moschetto is accused of hiring someone to kill his rival . A Long Island cardiologist had the office of another doctor torched, then hired someone who turned out to be an undercover police officer in a failed attempt to have the doctor hurt or killed, authorities said on Wednesday. Dr. Anthony J. Moschetto allegedly used drugs, guns and blank prescriptions as currency while trying to have the other doctor harmed amid a professional dispute, investigators said. Moschetto first allegedly hired two men to set fire to the man's office; it happened beneath a sprinkler and damage was minimal, prosecutors said. 'He was willing to pay $5,000 to have him beaten and put in the hospital for a couple of months and pay $20,000 to have him killed,' Nassau County Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly said of Moschetto's intentions. 'He wanted to put him out of business so he could get his business.' Moschetto worked with the rival cardiologist at a Great Neck practice on Northern Boulevard before setting up his own practice also in Great Neck, said Assistant District Attorney Ann Donnelly. Acting District Attorney Madeline Singas said 'luckily for this victim,' Moschetto was stopped. Investigators who went to Moschetto's home in Sands Point on Long Island's Gold Coast - one of the nation's wealthiest areas - found a weapons cache in a secret room that was accessed through a motorized bookshelf, they said. The weapons, which included dozens of knives, guns and a hand grenade, were displayed at a news conference Wednesday. The investigation into Moschetto started with his purchase of Oxycodone pills, heroin and two fully loaded assault weapons. Prosecutors said Moschetto had paid the undercover police officer $500 to perform a hit before getting arrested. He was caught on undercover video discussing the alleged plot. Attempt to kill: Cardiologist Anthony Moschetto, 54, pictured on Wednesday after he was arrested on charges he had another doctor's office torched, then hired undercover officers to have the doctor hurt or killed . Press Conference: Acting Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas announces the arrests of Anthony Moschetto, James Kalamaras and James Chmera during a news conference in Mineola on Wednesday . Moschetto faces a maximum sentence of 8 1/3 to 25 years in prison, prosecutors said. Newsday reports that Moschetto's charges include conspiracy, criminal sale of a controlled substance, arson, burglary, weapons possession, criminal sale of a firearm, and criminal solicitation. Two other defendants are charged in the case, accused of their involvement in the office fire, which occurred before the undercover investigation began. They, along with Moschetto, had been arrested Tuesday. Co-defendants James Chmela, 43, of Selden, and James Kalamaras, 41, also were scheduled for arraignment on Wednesday. 'Dr. Moschetto is a hidden monster living in the North Shore area who has no respect for law and life,'  said Nassau County Police Department Acting Commissioner Thomas Krumpter. 'He had enough weapons to provide a small army means to wreak harm.'

Co-conspirators: James Chmela (left) and James Kalamaras (right) were arrested for arson in a related scheme to allegedly destroy the rival doctor's office building, authorities said . Evidence: These knives were allegedly found by authorities in a secret room behind a bookshelf in the doctor's home in Long Island . The Drug Enforcement Administration also was involved in the investigation, which began in December. In asking for $500,000 bond, his Manhattan attorney, Randy Zelin, said Moschetto's attorney asked for a $500,000 bond and said that Moschetto was a 'well respected cardiologist.' 'My client has a wealth of roots in the community and has absolutely no reason to leave his family, to leave his children, and to leave what he has built in this community,' Zelin said. Weapons: Dr. Anthony Moschetto, 54, of Sands Point accused of trying to have an unidentified former business partner killed, had these guns confiscated from his home by the authorities .

"A man who has two failed marriages with Gambian women is hoping it will be third time lucky now that he is engaged to another woman he met in the country that he now calls home. David Tungate, 58, was left devastated after the marriage to his first Gambian wife broke down shortly after he brought her to the UK. He then remarried, but his second wife, also from Gambia, turned out to be a serial bigamist who conned him out of £24,000 of his retirement money and left him close to bankruptcy. David Tungate with his fiancee Isatou Jarju . Determined not to let the experiences put him off, David is now dating a third Gambian woman and is convinced his latest lady will prove to be third time lucky. The former van driver said: 'I know people reading this might think I'm the most gullible man in Britain but I'm not bothered. 'I may have been left with nothing from the last Gambian woman I fell in love with, but my new girlfriend is different. 'She is wonderful and I feel blessed. It may be stupid but I always follow my heart.' David with his last wide Ndey, who was a bigamist . After divorcing his British wife of seven years in 1992, the father-of-two never imagined he would find love again. With the help of his sons from his first marriage, David slowly overcame the heartbreak and put his life back together. It wasn't until 1998 when he visited Gambia on holiday that he fell in love with Nyima Sye. Converting to Islam and marrying her that year, David brought his beautiful new wife back to the UK but five years later their marriage ended and the pair divorced. David said: 'Nyima was too young for me and eventually the cultural differences tore us apart. 'We split amicably but looking back now, she could have been after me for a British passport. I would never bring another Gambian woman over to the UK because of that.' David swore off women but 15 years later, everything changed when he joined a friend on another holiday to the West African country. Just a few days into his stay, David met Ndey, then 22, a waitress who could speak good English. Ndey in the town centre close to her home in Gambia . The pair started talking and after she explained she was recovering from Malaria and had lost her job in the restaurant, he offered to help. David started sending her £50 a week and even paid a cafe owner to give his new love a job, bank rolling her wages of £30 a week, unbeknownst to Ndey. Finally in June 2011 David had saved up enough money from his job as a van driver to fly back out to Gambia to be with his love. He said: 'I booked another two-week holiday and packed my suitcase full of clothes and jewellery for Ndey. 'I couldn't wait to start our relationship and when I got there and she met me at the airport, it was more than I had ever dreamed of. 'Leaving her to go back to the UK was heart breaking, I was already counting down the days until I could come back and see her.' In October 2012, 16 months later, David flew out to Bakau in Gambia with yet another suitcase of expensive gifts for his girlfriend. As well as securing a date for their wedding, David rented a flat out for her so they would have somewhere to stay whenever he returned to the country. In June 2013, the pair wed at Kanising Islamic Court in front of Ndey's sister and uncle - sadly none of David's family made the trip for the wedding. David with Ndey, who became pregnant with another man while they were married . Returning to see his wife as often as he could afford, David planned to stay living in the UK until he retired from his job as a newspaper delivery driver. In February 2014, Ndey asked him if he could pay the £60 a month lease on a fashion shop she planned to open, which he agreed to do. Even though she became pregnant with another man's baby, David agreed to care for the child as if it were his won . On top of this, David paid £2,000 up front on clothes stock and began working overtime to pay for everything. But in October 2014, he received a worrying text message from an unknown number which read: 'Your wife has married a Gambian man, is pregnant by him and living in his family compound in the town of Bakau.' David said: 'I was devastated. Through tears she admitted she had cheated on me while I was back in England. 'She said she was now four months pregnant with his baby.It was heart breaking but at the end of the day, she was my wife. I agreed to raise the baby as my own.' David bought maternity clothes and baby bits for Ndey and in November 2014 he moved to Gambia to live with his wife, but his happiness was short lived. Later that month he received another anonymous text saying: 'Your wife has three husbands, two white and one black.' In the final moments of their relationship, suspicious David hired a private investigator to unearth the truth about his beloved wife who kept disappearing for weeks on end. Within 48 hours they had tracked Ndey down and discovered she was living in a compound with an illegitimate husband and his family. David added: 'Words cannot explain how distraught I was. I couldn't believe she would do this to me, after everything I had done for her. My trust was completely shattered.' In January this year David contacted the police and Ndey was arrested and charged with bigamy and fraud. David with Ndey on the day of their wedding . She was fined 15000 Dalassi - ten years' salary - and will face two years in prison if she fails to pay by the end of April. Betrayed, David is now desperate to recover the £24,000 he spent on Ndey over the last four years. He said: 'I refuse to divorce her until she pays me back every last penny. I have been left with nothing - no home in England, no pension, no savings, just £45 a week to live on. 'I can't even move back to the UK because I can't afford it. 'As they say, love is blind. After all those years I finally found love, and it totally backfired. 'Our whole relationship was a lie, and I had no idea. The fact that she so willingly took my money as well is just heartless. The text David received telling him that his wife was pregnant with another man's baby . 'Looking back now, I should have seen the signs but I was a fool. A fair few people tried to warn me but I was having none of it. Gullible doesn't even cover it.' Despite everything he's been through, David is now dating Isatou Jarju, 30, a cafe owner who he met when Isatou was working in a cafe with Ndey. As Isatou's British husband had just left her, the pair bonded over their misfortune and although the relationship is still in the early stages, he says marriage 'isn't off the cards.' He said: 'She is different to Ndey and I can only hope it works this time. She seems trustworthy and never asks me for anything. 'She has her own business, home and is beautiful. Above everything, she makes me laugh and has brought a smile to my face while I've been dealing with everything. 'She is very special to me.' Not bothered by warnings from family and friends, David is hoping to prove them wrong with his third Gambian lover. He said: 'My loved ones who know what has happened are absolutely disgusted that she would treat me like this. 'They think I'm mad for dating another African lady but at the end of the day, they want me to be happy. 'Although I'm still angry and full of hatred for Ndey, I just feel so lucky that I can finally have my happy ending.'","David Tungate, 58, from Norwich, is engaged to a 30 year old from Gambia .

"Pretty spot: Queen Victoria spent her holidays in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight . 'It is impossible to imagine a prettier spot,’ Queen Victoria said of her holiday residence, Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. It was at the beach there that she would take to the sea in her wooden bathing machine, and that all of her children learned to swim. But, however pleasing her days at Osborne House, Victoria’s journeys there were never easy. She would travel to Portsmouth by train and then by ferry to Ryde. From Ryde there was a railway line that passed not far from Osborne House but the nearest station was at Wootton, more than two miles from the property. So, in 1875, a station was built at Whippingham, the closest point on the line to Osborne House – just to serve the Royal residence. Accommodation was built for the stationmaster, as well as waiting rooms with toilets for both ladies and gentlemen. The building is now a five-bedroom family home, currently on the market for £625,000, while the track has become a cycle path. Victoria died in 1901 and the station went into public use in 1903. However, services ended in 1966, after which the station was converted into a home. The current owners, retired electrician Tony Vickers, 69, and his 70-year-old wife Sue, a retired hairdresser, are selling because they want to move to a smaller bungalow. ‘We were very excited when we knew we would be able to own the station that was built for Queen Victoria, and we have maintained many of the original features and some of the fireplaces,’ says Sue. Royal connection: The home that was once a railway station built to serve the monarch . ‘We are very sad to leave our unique home and its gardens, which have given us many years of pleasure. It’s been a lovely family home.’ It is thought that Queen Victoria, who, famously, would not allow herself to be conveyed at more than 40 miles per hour, would wait at Whippingham station in the room that is now used as a sitting room. Victoria, and those who visited her on the Isle of Wight, would be taken by horse and carriage from Whippingham station to Osborne House. In 1900, Whippingham station made another piece of history, with the appointment of a stationmistress, rather than master – almost unheard of at the time. Emily Merwood took over the role from her father-in-law. Immensely proud of being in sole charge of the station, she would dress in a white starched apron over a black dress, and would sport a straw boater hat. Spacious: The large, open-plan kitchen in the Isle of Wight property, which has five bedrooms . The part of the house now used as a sitting room used to be the station’s waiting room, while the main bedroom used to be the points room, where the signalman would pull levers to control trains on the track. Where the main platform once stood there is now a lawn that leads down to an Italian garden, with raised beds, a rockery, an orchard and a small woodland beyond. Price £625,000 .

Unique features Former train station built for Queen Victoria to reach Osborne House; sitting room that Victoria used as a waiting room; main bedroom that used to be a points room. There are also two plum trees (naturally, they are Victoria plums, the type named after the monarch) and a quince tree. To the left of the driveway is a common meadow with wild orchids. The property is also very versatile: alongside its five bedrooms, it has four reception rooms, a conservatory, a kitchen/dining room, a utility room, three shower rooms, a family bathroom and a downstairs cloakroom. ‘This is a wonderful home which holds a great deal of character and warmth, as well as its own slice of history,’ says James Shelley, sales manager at Fine & Country Isle of Wight. ‘It could meet a number of needs: it could be a home to serve the requirements of two or even three generations of the same family; a holiday home; or a combination of the two. ‘One thing is for certain here – the choices are plenty within this amazing property, and it certainly delivers substantial levels of charm and appeal.’ Fine & Country Isle of Wight, 01983 520000 .","Queen Victoria's holiday residence was Osborne House on the Isle of Wight .

"Abraham Lincoln and George Washington were gay, says a new book by a gay activist and award winning writer. Larry Kramer, 79, says he believes what's written in his history book is true though he is selling it as fiction to avoid legal troubles. In Volume One of his two part book 'The American People,' Kramer says that Abraham Lincoln was gay and his killer John Wilkes Booth was actually Lincoln's spurned gay lover. 'We know that Abraham Lincoln was gay,' Kramer told CBS in an interview about the book which came out this month. Were they gay?: Writer and gay activist Larry Kramer claims that Abraham Lincoln (left) and George Washington (right) were gay . The American People: Volume one of the two part book by Larry Kramer explores prehistoric America's unwritten gay history up to the present day . Abraham Lincoln . According to Larry Kramer, Abraham Lincoln slept with several men including actor John Wilkes Booth who later fatally shot him in a theater on April 14, 1965. Kramer claims that the motive for murder was not Booth's anger over the Civil War but was his unrequited love for the former president. Another indicator that Lincoln was gay is that he would share beds with other men, especially when his wife Mary left town. One such man was Captain David Derickson who would visit Lincoln at a retreat from the White House called the Soldier's Home. Lincoln has been quoted as saying of Derickson, 'The captain and I are getting quite thick.' George Washington . Larry Kramer says that historians just don't have 'gaydar' when it comes to studying historic figures and that George was was 'basically a big queen.' Larry Kramer said in an interview with Sirius that George Washington loved decorating battle gear and that he was a bit of a dandy in his love of showmanship. 'In the case of Washington, he was a big queen, basically,' Kramer said. 'He decorated everything. He designed all the uniforms, the buttons. The correspondence exists with all the dealers he dealt with in England to make everything. And then there was a man called Baron Von Steuben, who was German, who designed all the maneuvers for all the troops of all the great armies in Europe. And he kept getting thrown out after he made the armies real – like Rockettes . He got kicked out and he came to George. And he and George hit it off like nobody’s business.' Alexander Hamilton . According to Kramer, Alexander Hamilton was in love with George Washington claims the pair had an erotic father and son attraction. Alexander Hamilton was also supposedly involved with a young officer named John Laurens to whom he wrote 'love letters. ' 'You should not have taken advantage of my sensibility to steal into my affections without my consent. But as you have done it, and as we are generally indulgent to those we love, I shall not scruple to pardon the fraud you have committed, on condition that for my sake, if not for your own, you will always continue to merit the partiality, which you have artfully instilled into me,' said one of those letters to Laurens. In another letter to Laurens, Hamilton calls himself, 'a jealous lover.' Men of Jamestown . Even though sodomy was considered taboo at the time, Larry Kramer says that a lack of women in Jamestown led many men to experiment with one another in their absence. 'It's only natural that men would sleep with each other, when there are no women around for months on end,' said Larry Kramer of the initially all male settlement. 'Why is that not in the history books? Because all history books are written by straight people, and they don't wanna either admit that, or they wouldn't know how to recognize what we call 'gaydar.' According to Kramer, Jamestown was a mecca of gay sex where men chose to sleep with men because there weren't any women around. 'It's only natural that men would sleep with each other, when there are no women around for months on end,' said Kramer. Kramer says it took him 40 years to write his 800 page history book that spans from pre-historic america all the way to the 1950s. 'It's called a 'novel,' but that's just to keep the lawyers away from me,' Kramer said. 'I believe everything in the book is true. Everything in there happened,' said Kramer who has long wanted to write a book on gay history. Spurned lover: Larry Kramer claims John Wilkes Booth, who murdered Abraham Lincoln, was one of Lincoln's spurned male lovers . The writer: Larry Kramer, 79, is an HIV positive American writer and gay rights advocate who spent 40 years writing his most recent book . 'It may look like fiction, but to me, it’s not,' Kramer told the New York Times. 'Most histories have been written by straight people. There has never been any history book written where the gay people have been in the history from the beginning.It’s ridiculous to think we haven’t been here for ever.' Kramer says that John Wilkes Booth's murder had nothing to do about the outcome of the Civil war, rather Bookes felt spurned by the president. Kramer's book doesn't only touch on the gay history of politicians but it also talks about the about the HIV crisis in the nation which will be the book's second volume.

"For one determined Texas teen, accomplishing a goal on a list of things to do before turning 21 was caught in a touching moment. As Ben Sunderman, 19, who has Down syndrome waited to find out whether he got a spot on the special education internship with Embassy Suites, the anticipation was overwhelming for the family. In the video filmed by his mother, he thoroughly looks over the letter on April 10 as she anxiously interrupts him wanting to know the decision - which he does not reveal until the end shouting 'I get it. I get the job!' With hugs, laughs and excitement all around, the priceless reaction left him and his family with big smiles. Scroll down for video . For Texas teen Ben Sunderman, it was a proud moment (above) last week when he ticked a goal of getting a job off his list of things to do before turning 21 that was captured on video . During the three-minute video posted onto Facebook by his dad Scott Sunderman, Ben reads the letter and his mom eagerly interrupts asking if he got it which he quiets her several times (left). Once he finishes reading it, he freezes with shock as he takes in the news (right) During the three-minute video posted onto Facebook by Ben's father, Scott Sunderman, the family is in their kitchen while his mother Sharon Sunderman is filming the moment. As Ben begins to read the letter, he is heard saying 'congratulations' to which is mom says 'Ben what does that mean?' He quiets her by putting up his hand and continues to read the letter but hilariously she cannot contain her excitement and keeps stopping him as he reads. Ben shouts 'I get it, I get the job!' as he rushes over to his dad and leaps into his arms as they embrace in a big hug . Ben's mom, Sharon (pictured above with her husband Scott) said they always encouraged their son to do everything he could do . Once he finishes reading the letter in its entirety, he puts it down and freezes with shock as he takes in the news. He then looks at his parents and shouts 'I got a job' as he rushes over to his dad and leaps into his arms as they embrace in a big hug. His mom is heard cheering loudly as they all celebrate over his acceptance letter for the internship. Ben puts up both of his fists as he finally has accomplished one of the things on his list before turning 21 - which also includes building his muscles and finding a girlfriend. But for the 19-year-old, this achievement comes behind a line of others. Last year, his mom said he won the title of prom king by a landslide, according to ABC. Last year, Ben's mom said he won prom king by a landslide at school (pictured above) Ben was one of 12 students with special needs who earned a spot on the internship which will begin in August . 'We just always encouraged him to do everything he could do,' she told ABC. 'He does his laundry like his siblings, makes his bed like his siblings.' His internship - which he applied for through Project Search, a program that helps children with disabilities progress from high school to the working world - will begin in August. Ben will travel from his home where he lives with his parents in McKinney to the hotel via public transportation, working eight hours for the internship. Only 11 other students with special needs received an acceptance letter for the placement that will teach them skills in administrative services and housekeeping at Embassy Suites, Nicole Buvari from the company told News 8. And following the news, the family continues to take in the excitement from their son's latest accomplishment. 'Everyone sees him as Ben and loves him for who he is, which is great,' Mrs Sunderman told ABC. 'Just the joy that Ben has at the fact that he is able to get a job and be part of the community. That's what every parent wants for their kid.'","Ben Sunderman, 19, of McKinney, Texas learned he got the job on April 10 .

"Gifted: Schoolgirl Elspeth McKendrick was depressed after being diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome . A gifted schoolgirl hanged herself  just weeks after scoring a string of GCSE A stars because she was depressed at being diagnosed with a mild form of autism, an inquest heard. School prefect Elspeth McKendrick, 16, was left shattered in 2012 when doctors diagnosed her with Asperger's syndrome. The Doctor Who and Sherlock fan, who was described by her mother as 'geeky', had desperately wanted to fit in at school and had built up a small circle of friends. Her parents said  she was 'happy to be odd and eccentric' but was 'very much in denial' about her condition and  felt unable to discuss  it with anybody. Last August, just a week after going on a school trip as part of the National Citizen Service, the teenager was found hanged in her bedroom after leaving a note apologising to her family and telling how she wished she could open up to friends. The inquest in Heywood, Greater Manchester, heard how Elspeth, from Bury, had been an artistic and creative pupil at Tottington High School. She was an avid reader who always had a novel in her school bag and had already won a place at Manchester College of Art to study A levels. But her mother Rebecca Jackson, 47, told the hearing. 'She had told of problems socialising and making close friends. 'Although she had a lot of friends she also wanted to have a close best friend and she did not have that. 'There were behavioural issues and tantrums that were beyond my experience of normal teenage tantrums because, for Elspeth, things were black and white. Elspeth was very tech savvy and she enjoyed using the computer. 'It caused an awful lot of problems. We got woken up in the middle of the night at 2am when she was on the computer or at 4am when she was not sleeping. She was existing on four hours a night then. It was Elspeth's way or the high way.' In 2011 Elspeth went to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in Bury and was upset to be diagnosed with Asperger's the following year. Mrs Jackson said: 'She was very geeky and enjoyed a lot of things like Albert Einstein and she loved films and cinematography. 'There are a lot of film directors with Asperger's so it doesn't mean there is anything mentally wrong with you, just a difference in the way you think. 'I tried to present it in a positive light to her and was recommended a book about Asperger's and teenagers and it was really positive. 'I bought it for Elspeth and she tore it into shreds and then was very sorry and tried to sellotape it back together. She was very much in denial.' Elspeth poses with a cardboard cut-out of Tom Jones. She was described as an artistic and creative pupil  and had already won a place at Manchester College of Art to study A levels . Elspeth's father Euan, 43, told the inquest: 'She was not happy about her diagnosis and she wanted to be Elspeth and felt the diagnosis was a waste of time. CAMHS she saw as toxic and not about her and more about her mother's needs and not her needs. 'When she was good she was fantastic, when she lost it she really did. Most of it was stropping and slamming the door. There were a few bad ones that were horrific - shouting, swearing and calling names, saying the most terrible things.' 'She did feel an awful lot of pressure. She felt she was being observed. I am afraid she did not like being watched or observed. Part of the CAMHS problem was that she was convinced they were taking notes about her and sharing it with her mother. 'Alone': The inquest heard how Elspeth struggled to discuss her condition with friends . 'She kept her choice of college secret. She didn't want people to know what she was doing or where she was going. She felt she was in a fish bowl all of the time. 'She did not want the diagnosis - she just wanted to be a bit odd. She was happy being odd, a bit eccentric.' Det Insp Denise Pye of Great Manchester Police said a note had been found on top of Elspeth's laptop apologising for what she had done as well as a notebook containing school work and comments about her feelings. DI Pye said: 'She felt she was alone and wanted to tell friends how she felt but felt she couldn't do so. 'Some of the positive stuff seems to refer to the challenge she went on and the negative stuff was that she felt she did not have contact with people she should after the challenge because she made such good friends and felt so good about that.' Elspeth's clinical psychologist at Bury CAMHS, Neil Wilson, told the inquest: 'Elspeth was at the subtle end of the autism spectrum. Someone who might meet her for the first time would not probably regard her as having a developmental disorder but as shy and cautious.' Headmaster at Tottington High School, Paul Greenhalgh, said: 'Elspeth was an A star student and had a lovely small group of friends. Elspeth was amazingly creative and artistic. 'But she struggled with the diagnosis of Asperger's and wanted more than anything to fit in. She loved reading and always had a novel in her school bag. 'She was asked to be a prefect in year 11 and did a fine job upholding school rules and requirements. She was a talented student with a depth of intelligence and capability beyond her years.' Assistant Coroner Catherine McKenna recorded a conclusion of suicide and said: 'I am conscious that Elspeth was a very private young woman and would probably not be happy that we've had this Inquest. She was a bright witty talented young woman and she had much to look forward to in her life.'

"Today marks 81 years since the notorious 'Surgeon's Photograph', which claimed to show evidence of a monster living in Loch Ness, was published in the Daily Mail. And to celebrate, Google has launched its latest Street View experience that lets you virtually explore both above and beneath the water in the iconic Scottish waterway. The tech giant has also released a Google Doodle to commemorate the anniversary and changed the yellow Pegman to a Nessie peg-monster. Scroll down for videos . Google partnered with Catlin Seaview Survey and Adrian Shine from the Loch Ness and Morar Project to capture the Street View images (Loch Ness and Urquhart Castle pictured). The site has launched to mark the 81st anniversary of the 'Surgeon's Photograph' - an image of the mythical monster from 1934 - and it lets people virtually explore above and beneath the water of the attraction to the southwest of Inverness . To collect the images, Google partnered with Catlin Seaview Survey and Adrian Shine from the Loch Ness and Morar Project -  a project set up to explore the loch and investigate all alleged sightings. 'Like the world's best legends, the Loch Ness Monster transcends the everyday and exists at the edges of possibility,' said Google in a blog post. 'Whether or not you believe, most people hold a romanticised vision of the creature that, legend has it, plumbs the depths of the loch. 'In 1934, the 'Surgeon's Photograph' was released, claiming to show the monster in the misty waters of the lake. It's the most iconic photo in the history of Loch Ness - and may be one of the most elaborate hoaxes of our age.'

Formed of a series of interrelated bodies of water, including the River Oich to the south and the Bona Narrows to the north, Loch Ness stretches for 23 miles (37 km) southwest of Inverness. Although it's neither the largest Scottish loch by surface area nor depth, it is the largest by volume, containing more freshwater than all the lakes of England and Wales combined and is almost 800ft (243 metres) deep. The Surgeon's Photograph (pictured) was taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson and published in the Daily Mail on 21 April that year. It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed the pictures were staged . The tech giant has also released a Google Doodle (pictured) to commemorate the anniversary and changed the yellow Pegman to a Nessie peg-monster . The Loch Ness Monster has been the subject of many sightings in the Scottish Highlands. Most, however, have been dismissed as hoax or fantasy. Some experts believe the beast represents a line of long-surviving plesiosaurs, a type of carnivorous aquatic reptile from millions of years ago, while one of the most accepted explanations is that the monster is in fact a giant sturgeon, which can grow up to 12ft (3.7 metres) long. Others include eels, bird wakes, seals, trees, logs, submarines, dogs with sticks - and even an elephant. Loch Ness stretches for 23 miles (37 km) southwest of Inverness.

This image was taken beneath the waterline at the southern edge of the loch near the River Oich and shows Fort Augustus Abbey. From the late nineteenth century to 1998 the abbey was a Benedictine monastery . Adrian Shine has been carrying out fieldwork in the Highlands since 1973 and has logged 1,000 Nessie sightings. He said: 'The Google project was so cloaked in secrecy, when people asked about the ripples in the loch during the expeditions,  I had no opinion' The Loch Ness Monster has been a subject of intrigue and debate since it came to the world's attention. William Jobes took what appears to be a close-up of theMonster in 2011 (pictured) The Loch Ness Monster has been a subject of mass intrigue and debate since it came to . the world's attention in 1934. Scientists have widely written off the idea as a modern-day myth, with continued sightings claimed to be set ups and wishful thinking. But it has remained a contested phenomenon for 81 years. Perhaps the most famous picture of . Nessie was taken by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson, a London gynaecologist. It . was published in the Daily Mail on 21 April 1934 and showed what looked like a long neck and head rising from the water. However, . it turned out to be a toy submarine bought from Woolworths with a head . and neck made of wood in an elaborate hoax by big-game hunter Marmaduke . Wetherell in an act of revenge on the newspaper that had ridiculed him . over his hapless search for the beast. The . earliest report of a monster in the vicinity of Loch Ness appears in . the Life of St Columba by Adomnán, written in the 7th century. St . Columba, an Irish monk, had sent a disciple into the loch to prove . there was nothing there. But the monster rose and chased the man . snapping at his heels. But it fled in terror 'as if pulled back by ropes' when St Columba made the sign of the cross and commanded: 'Go no further. Do not touch the man. Go back at once.' In November 1933, Hugh Gray was the first to picture a creature splashing in the water. Four . stumpy-looking objects on the bottom of the creature's body appeared to . look like appendages, such as flippers, but it was later suggested the . creature was a dog, possibly holding a stick. In 1938, G. E. Taylor, a South African tourist, filmed something in the loch for three minutes on 16mm colour film. His picture was declared 'positive evidence' by a famous biologist and cryptozoologist. In 1960, aeronautical engineer Tim Dinsdale filmed a hump crossing the water leaving a powerful wake. Mr Dinsdale allegedly spotted the animal on . his last day hunting for it, and described the object as reddish with a . blotch on its side. In May 2007, Gordon Holmes, a . 55-year-old lab technician, captured video of what he said was 'this jet . black thing, about 45ft long, moving fairly fast in the water'. The film, though, has been cast into . doubt. Mr Holmes has been criticised for claiming the existence of . fairies and another expert later claimed the film actually shows otters . swimming in the loch. William Jobes took what appears to be a close-up of the Loch Ness Monster in 2011. In February 2012, a sonar image of a . large mystery object deep below the surface of Loch Ness netted boat . skipper Marcus Atkinson the Best Nessie Sighting of The Year Award - the . first time in several years it has been presented by bookmaker William . Hill. The sonar picture, that shows a large . unidentified living object deep underwater, was recorded by Loch Ness . boat skipper Marcus Atkinson. Mr Atkinson’s . sonar fish-finder device records the width of objects in the depths . directly below his tourist boat every quarter of a second. An online register lists 1,067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club. But the Surgeon's Photograph is among the most famous. A diver from the Catlin Seaview Survey is shown collecting imagery of the loch . It was taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson and published in the Daily Mail on 21 April that year, but was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed the pictures were staged. The image turned out to be a toy submarine bought from Woolworths with a head and neck made of wood in an elaborate hoax by big-game hunter Marmaduke Wetherell in an act of revenge on the newspaper that had ridiculed him over his search for the beast. Adrian Shine has been carrying out fieldwork in the Highlands since 1973 and has logged more than 1,000 Nessie sightings. He said: 'The Google project was so cloaked in secrecy, when people asked about the ripples in the loch during the special diving expeditions, for once I had no opinion. 'I'm so proud to have been part of this initiative and I hope people worldwide enjoy exploring Street View to have a look and then be inspired to travel to Scotland to discover this area of magical beauty and natural intrigue.' VisitScotland chief executive Malcolm Roughead added: 'The Street View project is hugely exciting and we are delighted the team at Google have been as inspired about our monster as the hundreds and thousands of visitors who travel to Loch Ness every year hoping to catch a glimpse.' Research carried out 20 years ago estimated the Nessie phenomenon having an economic impact of £40 million ($59 million) to the Scottish economy. With inflation, this figure would have risen to £60 million ($89 million) by now. And Google said there are more searches for Loch Ness than there are for other UK institutions like Buckingham Palace and the Peak District. 'Wherever you stand on the Nessie debate, the legend lives on - even in the digital era. Sail across the freshwater lake and take in its haunting beauty, made darker still by the peat particles found in its waters,' the site continued. 'Let the Loch unlock the spirit of your imagination, where the rippling water, tricks of the light, and drifting logs bring the legend of Nessie to life. 'You can imagine Nessie nestling within these dark, peat-filled waters, waiting for the right moment to breach the surface into the Scottish sunlight above.","Google partnered with Catlin Seaview Survey and the Loch Ness and Morar Project to capture the Street View shots .

"A Florida man believed to be high on Flakka, a designer drug stronger than crystal meth, attacked a police officer after being shocked with a Taser twice while claiming he was God, police said. Police were called after Kenneth Crowder, 41, was seen by a witness on Friday running naked through a neighborhood calling himself God. He was also spotted committing an undisclosed sex act on a tree. Crowder was arrested in Melbourne, facing charges of battery on a law-enforcement officer, resisting with violence, and assault with a deadly weapon on a law-enforcement officer. Kennth Crowder was arrested in Melbourne, Florida, on Friday after being spotted running naked through a neighborhood claiming he was God . When police arrived on scene, he had put on jeans and a T-shirt and walked toward the officer in an aggressive manner as he called himself God, police told WKMG. A police officer shocked him with a Taser twice, but each time he pulled the probes out of his body and attempted to fight the officer. The officer then punched Crowder in the face and he fought back, claiming he was Thor and attempting to stab the officer with his own police badge. More officers eventually came to the scene and helped handcuff and shackle Crowder. He was booked into Brevard County Jail Complex and later posted bond to be released. Flakka, which can be injected, snorted, smoked, swallowed or taken with other substances like marijuana, is usually made from the chemical alpha-PVP. That's the synthetic version of the stimulant cathinone, the same type of chemical that is used to make bath salts. Crowder was arrested on charges of battery on a law-enforcement officer, resisting with violence, and assault with a deadly weapon on a law-enforcement officer . Flakka resembles a mix of crack cocaine and meth and it has a noticeably foul smell, according to WPBF 25 News. Once ingested, the drug causes a feeling of euphoria, hallucinations and sometimes psychosis or apparent superhuman strength. The high lasts for a couple hours and users are left with a strong desire to use again. Users have nicknamed the drug '$5 insanity' because hits often cost less than $10, according to the Sun-Sentinel. There were more than 670 Flakka occurrences in Florida in 2014, up from 85 in 2012 and zero in 2010, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.","Kenneth Crowder, 41, was arrested on Friday in Melbourne, Florida .

"'Plus-size' model Laura Wells has revealed the extreme dieting measures taken by her model roommates to prepare for Fashion Week. The size 14 beauty lived with a group of standard 'skinnier' models during her stint working in New York, and says that their agents instructed them to stick to a diet of 'one cracker and a couple of glasses of water'. 'It goes to the extremes,' Wells told the Australian Women's Weekly. 'No food being eaten, prescription dietary pills, agents telling girls that they're only allowed to have one cracker and a couple glasses of water leading up to fashion week per day.' Scroll down for video . Shocking: Laura Wells (left) spoke to Australian Women's Weekly about the pressure put on her 'skinnier' model room mates to not eat ahead of Fashion Week . 'It's completely unhealthy, not only for their body but mentally as well.' Laura told AWW editor Helen McCabe that her model friends would then compare themselves to her, who was working non-stop despite eating what she likes. 'These girls are going to extremes to look like that, and then not being booked for any jobs,' she said. 'And then living with a plus size model who's working every single day and comparing themselves to me. 'I eat healthy, I work out, but I'll let myself have a treat every now and then and have a glass of wine. Healthy and happy: Wells says her room mates, who struggled to book jobs, compared themselves to her as she was highly in-demand despite allowing herself treats . 'They couldn't fathom the fact that they were putting themselves through so much stress and I was so happy with myself.' Wells' comments comes days after France passed legislation banning excessively thin models from participating in Paris Fashion Week. Agents and fashion houses that hire them could also face fines under the new law, which was passed on April 3. The move by France, with its fashion and luxury industries worth tens of billions of euros, comes after a similar ban by Israel in 2013, while other countries, like Italy and Spain, rely on voluntary codes of conduct to protect models. Diet: Laura (pictured with Sarah Wilson, right) revealed that there was 'no food being eaten, and prescription dietary pills' being consumed by her model friends in New York . The measure is part of a campaign against anorexia by President Francois Hollande's government. Lawmakers also made it illegal to condone anorexia and said any re-touched photo that alters the bodily appearance of a model for commercial purposes must carry a message stating it had been manipulated. 'The activity of model is banned for any person whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is lower than levels proposed by health authorities and decreed by the ministers of health and labour,' the legislation says. The lawmaker behind the bill previously said models would have to present a medical certificate showing a BMI of at least 18, about 55 kg (121 lb) for a height of 1.75 metres (5.7 feet), before being hired for a job and for a few weeks afterwards. Dangerous: Wells' comments come days after France passed a law banning excessively thin models from the catwalk, with agents and fashion houses to face fines and imprisonment if they don't comply . The law, voted through the lower house of parliament by Hollande's Socialist majority despite opposition by conservative parliamentarians, envisages imprisonment of up to six months and a fine of 75,000 euros ($82,000) for any agency contravening it. In the AWW video interview, Laura Wells recalls wanting to 'punch' a model scout when they suggested she could get work as a plus-size model. The 177-centimetre beauty was studying science and law when she was spotted in New York City by talent scouts in 2005. She said she felt insulted the first time she was asked to be a plus-sized model because of her misconceptions about the term. 'I thought they were calling me fat': Laura also revealed that she was initially insulted by the suggestion she should be a plus-size model, and admits she wanted to punch the model scout . 'I wanted to punch everyone in the face... [I thought] basically they were calling me fat,' Wells said. 'That was my perception of the word 'plus size', that people were calling me 'fat'.' Wells said while she was a plus-sized model who was defined as someone who was 'four to six sizes bigger than a standard model', she was not 'plus-sized in reality'. Since then Wells has gone to model for Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Myer, David Jones, Berlei and ASOS. Despite her career breakthroughs, she thinks people's perception of body image still has a long way to go. 'It's slowly changing but not to the extent where it needs to be,' Wells said. 'It needs to be at the point where it's celebrated anymore... Why isn't it just seen as normal?'

"Britain's five highest-earning NHS dentists are paid average salaries of £690,000 a year. The sum is almost five times the Prime Minister’s £142,500 pay packet – and comes as thousands of patients struggle to get on the books of NHS practices. A further 11 dentists were paid between £400,000 and £500,000 and a total of 177 received more than £200,000. More than 1,600 pocketed £100,000-£200,000. The figures lay bare the huge amounts of taxpayers’ money paid to dentists for NHS work, following Labour’s introduction of controversial contracts in 2006. Scroll down for video . Lucrative: Some dentists earn from multiple NHS contracts, as well as private patients . Campaigners said the payments were ‘scandalous’ and ‘unacceptable’. Under freedom of information laws, the NHS Business Services Authority was asked about the pensionable pay of dentists who do NHS work. In 2012/13, the latest figures available, five practitioners were paid more than £500,000. They shared a total of about £3.4million – an average of £690,000. This comes on top of any money they take from treating patients privately. Another 11 earned £400,000 to £499,999 from the NHS, 30 received £300,000 to £399,999, 131 pocketed £200,000 to £299,999 and 1,617 received £100,000 to £199,999. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the rates of pay were ‘exorbitant’. Yesterday's Daily Mail . She added: ‘Investment is urgently needed on the front line where there is a desperate shortage of nurses [and] patients waiting for hours in A&E … when the NHS is under such huge financial pressure, this type of spending on huge salaries is unacceptable.’ It follows revelations in Thursday’s Mail that millions of pounds was being wasted on NHS prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Yesterday, the Mail also exposed a £2,700 charge for cataract surgery at some hospitals – treble the cost to the health service – raising suspicions that patients are being ripped off. Patient Concern’s Roger Goss said: ‘This is scandalous. People will be shocked to hear the sums lining dentists’ pockets when it is almost impossible to find dental care on the NHS in some parts of the country. ‘There is something strange going on when the NHS will pay for gastric bands, suncream and hangover tablets yet it is so difficult to get dental treatment on it. It is almost perverse.’ Jonathan Isaby of the Taxpayers Alliance, which the Mail commissioned to carry out the research, said the salaries show a ‘shameless public sector elite taking taxpayers for a ride’. He added: ‘It is outrageous that these telephone-number salaries have been hidden from the people who pay them … Taxpayers expect the money they put in to the NHS to be spent on patients, not on bumper pay packets.’ The contracts brought in by Labour were designed to improve access to NHS dentistry. But patients are still struggling to get an appointment. The pay deals gave practitioners a fixed sum for a set amount of work agreed at the start of the year, rather than separate incomes for the number of patients treated or procedures done. Thursday's Daily Mail . Treatments are divided into three bands, from a simple check-up earning the dentist £25, to procedures such as fitting dentures and crowns, for roughly £300. The value of a contract can run to millions of pounds, and some dentists run more than one practice so hold multiple contracts. According to the Health and Social Care Information Centre, 21,500 dentists did NHS work in 2012/13, but most also do substantial amounts of private work. The British Dental Association’s Mick Armstrong said the top-earning dentists ‘most likely own a group of practices’ or are specialists in their area. But Tory Charlotte Leslie, who sat on the health select committee of MPs, said: ‘Most people will be absolutely stunned individual clinicians are getting such astronomical salaries on the NHS.’ A spokesman for NHS England said it contracts the vast majority of dental services from self-employed individuals or companies, some of whom ‘earn income from a number of contracts’.","Highest-earning NHS dentists earn almost five times more than Prime Minister’s £142,500 pay packet .

The enthronement ceremony of Prince Abdul Malik, 31, and Dayangku Raabi'atul 'Adawiyyah Pengiran Haji Bolkiah, 22, took place in the lavish settings of 1,788-room palace, Istana Nural Iman in Brunei . The happy couple: The bride clutches a bouquet of crystal flowers, and sports a breathtaking three-piece jewellery set, with sizable emeralds . The Prince is the youngest child of the Sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah, and his wife, Queen Saleha, and is second in the line of succession to become the next Sultan of Brunei. Today's 'bersanding' or enthronement ceremony is usually the highlight of the wedding festivities, and saw the bride and groom seated next to each other, dressed in opulent traditional attire on gilded thrones in the Throne Chamber of the Istana Nural Iman palace. According to The Brunei Times, also in attendance were seven Malaysian state rulers and the governor of Saudi Arabia, and this is the first time that the couple have appeared together since the festivities started on 5 April. The couple wore matching traditional Malay dress, with the bride's veil constructed of swathes of intricate lace. The 22-year-old bride, who worked as a systems data analyst and IT instructor, sported a breathtaking diamond tiara studded with six teardrop-shaped emeralds. A diamond necklace with a central pendant of three emeralds the size of grapes, glittered around her neck, while a matching brooch of two egg-shaped emeralds dangled from a diamond setting.

The newlyweds sat side by side praying during a section of the ceremony, and at one point, the Sultan was seen caressing the arms of his son's hand while the blessing of his new wife occurred. The Sultan has 12 children - five sons and seven daughters - from three different marriages. Prince Abdul Malik is the sixth child of the Sultan and his current wife, Queen Saleha, who wed in 1965. Part of the ceremony also saw royal guards entering the hall carrying ceremonial shields and spears. After the ceremony, there is expected to be a luxurious banquet in the palace's hall, which can accommodate up to 5,000 guests. The wedding is taking place over a period of 11 days, and started on Sunday, 5 April, with the royal marriage proposal ceremony. During this time, a representative of the groom approached the bride's family with the groom's intention of seeking the bride's hand in marriage. This signalled the beginning of the ceremonial events, and has been followed by a 'powdering' ceremony - when members of the families from both sides anoint the couple with powder and scented oil on the palms of their hand - and a gifting ceremony. Royal guards stood in large numbers in the Throne Hall, carrying ceremonial shields and spears . In attendance were also Ragad Kurdi Taib, wife of Sarawak's former Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud (pictured left), and Saudi Arabia's Prince Saud bin Abdul Mohsen bin Abdul Aziz (pictured right) Friends and family, people of nobility and international dignitaries attended the ceremony, as the couple sat beneath in their gilded thrones .

The location of the wedding, the dazzling Istana Nural Iman palace is situated in Brunei's capital, Bandar Seri Begawan. It is considered the largest residential palace in the world, with 1,788 rooms, five grand swimming pools, 257 bathrooms, and a 110-car garage.

She added a diaphanous veil, which was topped with another stunning diamond tiara, set with rubies and a scarlet gem at its centre the size of a 20-pence piece. A matching necklace featuring a twisted diamond and ruby rope design glittered with tens of rubies, while a huge diamond and ruby brooch was party hidden by her veil. On her right hand was a large diamond ring in a platinum setting. She also changed her make-up, sporting red lipstick rather than the bridal pink at today's ceremony.

"In one of the classic games of their long and illustrious rivalry, the first meeting of the season between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees lasted nearly seven hours - becoming the longest game in team history for both. Boston took a 6-5 lead in the 19th inning on Saturday morning on a sacrifice fly by Mookie Betts. Xander Bogaerts scored after reaching on his fourth hit of extra innings. Chase Headley and Mark Teixeira hit tying home runs for the Yankees in a game interrupted by a power outage for 16 minutes in the 12th.

Fans hold up their cell phones after a bank of lights went out in the 12 inning during the game causing a 16-minute delay . David Ortiz hit a solo homer for Boston to break a three-all deadlock in the 16th inning. But then Teixeira, who turned 35 on Saturday, batting from the right side against right-handed knuckleballer Steven Wright, led off the bottom half with a no-doubt drive to left field. Pablo Sandoval put the Red Sox back in front with an RBI single in the 18th only to see Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran hit doubles in the bottom half to tie it again at five. The longest game in the history for both teams and the new Yankee Stadium, which opened in 2009, pushed past 2am on the East Coast.

"A man who murdered a mother and daughter in their own home by bludgeoning them with a hammer and repeatedly stabbing them with scissors will spend at least 32 years behind bars. Lesley Jonathon Cameron was jailed for life on Tuesday for the horrific December 2013 murder of Maureen Anne Horstman, 67, and her 26-year-old daughter Tamara Alexandra Horstman in broad daylight at their Warwick home, in Perth, WA. Cameron, who was 19 and at the time, also raped Tamara but it is not known if she was alive or dead. A used condom with DNA evidence was found after the incident, The West Australian Supreme Court heard. Maureen Anne Horstman (left), 67, and her 26-year-old daughter Tamara Alexandra Horstman (right) were bludgeoned with a hammer and stabbed to death with scissors in their own home in December 2013 . Prosecutor James MacTaggart said Cameron's behaviour was 'sadistic' and he went on a 'killing spree'. 'It's violence for violence's sake,' he said. Mr MacTaggart said while it may have started out as a burglary, Cameron was aroused and then 'sexually violated' Tamara. The court heard Cameron first entered Tamara's bedroom where he hit her over the head twice before going into Maureen's bedroom and striking her once to the head. He then returned to Tamara's bedroom and raped her. Lesley Jonathon Cameron has been jailed for a minimum of 32 years for the horrific crime. He described himself at the time as a 'walking time bomb' Cameron's lawyer Dominic Brunello said it was an unplanned and chaotic attack and Cameron panicked. Mr Brunello said his client had a troubled childhood and was 'drug-addled' at the time but was now sorry. 'He makes no excuses for his conduct,' Mr Brunello said. The court heard Cameron described himself at the time as a 'walking time bomb' and that he told police he had taken ice and speed. Justice Eric Heenan noted Cameron had a criminal record that was 'virtually without interruption' since he was 10 years old. In a victim impact statement, Tamara's twin brother Nicholas Horstman, who discovered the bodies, said his sister was a dedicated student, loyal friend and widely loved. Maureen and Tamara are seen here in a family photo with Tamara's twin brother Nicholas. Tamara's father said he has suffered many sleepless nights and was 'internally wrecked' He and his father accepted Tamara's university graduation certificate the day after her funeral. Tamara's father said he suffered many sleepless nights and was 'internally wrecked'. Justice Heenan said the women were going about their lives peacefully at home and the crime showed the vulnerability of the community. 'This is one of the worst types of murders one can imagine,' he said. 'It is the kind of offence which every member of the population dreads because it shows the insecurity and vulnerability of everybody in the community to random crime,' he added. Justice Heenan noted there was a possibility Cameron would remain a threat if he did not address his mental health and substance abuse issues. He said just because Cameron was young did not make him any less dangerous but there was a possibility of rehabilitation. Outside court, Nicholas Horstman said he was very happy with the sentence. 'However, no sentence will ever be long enough,' he said. 'To my family, close friends and the wider community, thank you for your support over the last 16 months. I'm truly thankful.'","Lesley Jonathon Cameron was just 19 when he committed the crimes .

"Amazon has pulled a controversial computer game where players are encouraged to feed a cartoon character battling anorexia. The game is based on children's favourite Whack-a-mole but instead of hitting the mole with a mallet players are invited to throw food a the cartoon girl. It was marketed by SmartTouch media and sold on the Amazon and Android platforms until it was withdrawn following a string of angry complaints. Rescue the Anorexia Girl was available to download on Amazon until they removed it following complaints . If the player misses the girl, she starts to lose weight until she eventually dies. According to the game's instructions, which have now been withdrawn: 'It’s your time to become a real hero with this new amusing game Rescue The Anorexia Girl! 'You know, heroes are not just superheroes, flying in the skies, throwing rocks and fighting villains with supernatural powers. Anyone can be a hero, if he is willing to help others from the bottom of his heart. Start saving the day now!' Gamers have to throw food at the girl who appears in one of nine holes before she disappears again . The game's designers continue: 'Anorexia is a serious disease and fatal if not cured in time. When you have anorexia, the desire to lose weight becomes more important than anything else. For example a girl from new Rescue The Anorexia Girl game has started to renounce meals and even tasty cakes cannot save the situation. But now you have come, brave hero and you can save her. We believe in you!' However, social media users reacted with horror when they first saw the game on the internet. Kelly Bradley said: 'You don't throw air at someone with cystic fibrosis, so don't throw food at someone with anorexia.' Others claimed the game further stigmatised people suffering from a mental illness. Brian Cuban, who suffered from eating disorders wrote on his blog: 'The science of eating disorders is firm. They are biologically based and not a choice. Simply feeding “anorexia girl” isn’t going to cure anything; . 'Eating Disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness.

"Airline rivals Ryanair and Aer Lingus have locked horns once again on Twitter. In not-so-subtle posts on the social networking site, the two carriers reignited their feud by posting tweets concerning their operation at Dublin Airport. Ryanair, run by Michael O'Leary, shared a photo of two of its staff by an advertising banner in Terminal 2, along with the words: 'Low Fares have come to @DublinAirport T2 at last. 'Fly from T1 for the lowest fares made simple.' Ryanair took to Twitter for a cheeky promotional photo in Terminal 2 in Dublin  - where Aer Lingus fly out from . In response to Ryanair's post, Aer Lingus had a dig at where Ryanair fly their passengers out too . Ryanair flies out of Terminal 1 at Dublin Airport, whereas Aer Lingus flies from Terminal 2, so it was clear the tweet was a joke at its rival's expense. However, without directly responding to the sly dig, Aer Lingus responded in fine form. Ireland's national airline tweeted: 'Fly from T2 at @DublinAirport to central locations across Europe. T1 gets you nearly there, we get you really there.' The words appear to be a reaction to Terminal 1-based Ryanair often using smaller and former military bases throughout Europe, often away from the central point of the destination city. Ryanair have been accused by rivals Aer LIngus of getting their customers 'nearly' to central locations . This isn't the first time the two have taken to Twitter to engage in some light-hearted banter. Back in January a row erupted when Aer Lingus tweeted photos and claimed one of its planes was featured in the background of an online advert for Ryanair’s ‘business plus’ service. With a smiley face emoticon for good measure, Aer Lingus gleefully wrote to its 89,000 followers: ‘Epic #photobomb by EI-DVM on Ryanair’s website! Even they know we’re Best for Business’. Aer Lingus took to Twitter to point out that Ryanair had used an Aer Lingus plane on some of its promotional material . Aer Lingus’ attempt to publicly embarrass Ryanair didn’t sit well with its low-cost rival. Ryanair responded with an affront of its own: ‘Even @AerLingus is talking about @Ryanair Business Plus. FYI, he’s smiling cos he saved a fortune & avoided another late @AerLingus arrival!’ As their Twitter followers weighed in and encouraged more banter, the Dublin-based airlines traded a few more tweets before calling it quits. Ryanair, in typical fashion, responded to Aer Lingus' post as only they would . The UK Court of Appeal is set to rule Ryanair’s 29.82 per cent stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair is the largest individual shareholder and it is set to find out if it will be forced to comply with competition regulators and sell down to no more than five per cent. Ryanair has predicted British Airways-owner IAG will return with another tilt at Aer Lingus as soon as this week. The budget airline said it is ‘actively’ seeking a buyer for its stake in Aer Lingus, which it has to sell due to competition requirements, and expects IAG to make a third offer to the group imminently. Aer Lingus and Ryanair have often taken to social networking for subtle digs at each other .","Ryanair post promo photo in Terminal 2 - where Aer Lingus fly out from .

"These are the albino men and women put under police and army protection in a desperate bid to stop the cruel East African black market trade of their body parts. Police across Malawi have been ordered to shoot anyone caught attacking albinos, while Tanzania's prime minister has urged citizens to kill anyone found with albino body parts. And in nearby Burundi, albino youngsters from across East Africa are being housed in special accommodation under army protection in a bid to deter attackers. Scroll down for video . Dorothy Mausen, a 22-year-old Malawian albino woman, poses for a photo in the country's Machinga district . Malawian police have been ordered to crack down on those trading in albino body parts, with orders recently given to shoot anyone caught attacking them . The drastic developments come as the United Nations reports at least 15 people with albinism, mostly children, have been killed, wounded, abducted or kidnapped in East Africa in the past six months. Body parts of those with albinism are prized in black magic and witchcraft, as it is believed spells based on their body parts will bring luck, love and wealth. Nearby Burundi has also taken steps to safeguard albinos by accommodating them in housing under protection. The latest order came from Malawi's Inspector General of Police Lexen Kachama who instructed police to shoot any 'dangerous criminals' caught abducting albinos, according to local media reports. 'Shoot every criminal who is violent when caught red-handed abducting people with albinism,' said Kachama, adding that he was ordering police to use weapons in proportion to the crime. 'We cannot just watch while our friends with albinism are being killed like animals every day. 'We do realize that these people are ruthless, have no mercy and therefore they need to be treated just like that.' His comments came just a month after a Malawian man was arrested for trying to strangle to death a 16-year-old albino boy. Catherine Amidu, 12, sits in her home Malawian home, in a region where six albinos have been killed since December . Femia Tchulani, 42, lives in constant fear of attackers who target and kill albinos in order to sell their body parts on the black market . Village chief Mariam Witness stands in a graveyard where the grave of an albino person was recently desecrated. Body part traders are known to exhume graves in order to obtain body parts in the cruel trade . A similar remark was made by Tanzania's Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda in 2009 when he urged citizens to kill anyone on the spot if they were found with the limbs or organs of albinos. Albino rights group have called for greater protection of albinos but said killing suspects was not going to deter criminals offered large sums of money for securing body parts as they were likely to still take the risk for the promised reward. Witchdoctors will pay as much as $75,000 for a full set of albino body parts, according to a Red Cross report. Vicky Ntetema, executive director of Under The Same Sun, a Canadian non-profit organization defending albino rights, said campaigners wanted justice for those people kidnapped, mutilated and murdered. 'But we have to remember that all those goons caught red-handed ... are small fish - agents and executors of the big sharks out there,' she said. 'Killing them on the spot is not going to help us catch the inducers, those with money to hire these gangs who continue to terrorize innocent people with albinism and their families.' An albino boy sits between his two parents at their home in Malawi . Ntetema urged police in Tanzania, Malawi and Burundi to quiz suspects to get information about the witchdoctors who use albino body parts and their clients. 'We all need to unite and find the culprits who are hiding behind the killers ... Why would people kill albinos if they were not asked to get their organs by someone?' she said. The plight of people with albinism has worsened in East Africa in recent years, according to U.N. and police figures, with concerns that an election in Tanzania this year will prompt more attacks as politicians seek luck at the ballot box. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Said Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein last month urged African governments to combat impunity for crimes against people with albinism. Albinism is a congenital disorder which affects about one in 20,000 people worldwide, according to medical authorities. It is more common in sub-Saharan Africa and affects about one Tanzanian in 1,400.

"These shocking pictures show a young bear being chained to a tree and attacked by dogs as part of a baiting competition to hone hunting skills in Yakutsk, eastern Russia. The controversial contest, held in the forests of the diamond-rich Sakha Republic, is celebrated in the region as a way of recognising the best canine bear hunter. Attacks by brown bears on humans are a danger in many parts of Russia, particularly at this time of the year as they awake hungry following the long winter hibernation. Brutal game: The picture shows a young bear chained to a tree while several dogs undergo 'hunting training' with the predator . Under attack: Masha, a five-year-old bear, can be seen attacked by a number of dogs as she is chained to the tree by her neck . Tradition: Once the dogs have found their way to Masha, they have to bark as loudly as they can with their cajoling scored out of 100 points . Many have to be killed when they encroach into built-up areas looking for food, often with dogs trained to stalk them in order for hunters to shoot them. But the images of the five-year-old chained up bear being attacked and bitten are likely to anger animal rights and anti-hunting groups in the West. In Russia, hunting of many kinds is a respected and mainstream activity and such contests as shown on these pictures raise few eyebrows. The pictures were taken by photo-journalist Spiridon Sleptsov during a visit to the Bayanay Hunting Club, near Yakutsk, where he captured competitors taking part in the 6th Republican contest to find the best individual hunting dog, and the best pairing of dogs, reported The Siberian Times. The 'sporting event' sees the dogs released about 100 metres(330ft) away from the bear, and they have to rely on scents and traces of the animal to find it within two minutes. Once they have found their target chained to the tree, the dogs have to bark as loudly, and as menacingly, as they can with their cajoling scored out of 100 points. The more fearsome the harassment, and the greater the number of bites on the bear, the higher the score for the dog. Face to face: Masha the bear growls at one of the dogs she faces during the cruel 'hunting competition' near Yakutsk, eastern Russia . Dog training: The 'sporting event' sees the dogs released some 330ft away from Masha and they have to rely on scents and traces of the bear to find it within two minutes . Having fun?: The dog owners said Masha has been used in the 'hunting contests' for a number of years, even claiming she enjoys them and has grown to understand the dogs . The pictures were taken by photo-journalist Spiridon Sleptsov during a visit to the Bayanay Hunting Club, near Yakutsk, . Mr Sleptsov said: 'Ideally after bursting into a loud bark the dog must attack the beast from behind, constantly twisting it around, thereby keeping the bear in one place and giving the hunter an idea of where to go. 'Rating the work in pairs took into account the coherence and mutual assistance between them. 'If only one of the dogs attacked the bear actively, the score was reduced and if the second dog did not pay attention to bear at all, the pair was disqualified.' The dogs also have to show how well they can stop a bear from running away, replicating what would happen in the wild if they were waiting for a hunter to come and kill it. The photographer added: 'It was rather hard to calm the over-heated dogs. 'Seeing that their owner was approaching, the dog began to bark at the beast with renewed energy and it took a lot of effort to pull them back from the bear.' Cruel: The dogs' owners stand ready to leash their animals after they have had their go at 'hunting' Masha . Just within reach: The young bear reaches out in an attempt to get hold of a white dog . All over? Masha the bear appears to have decided to take a time out from the fighting, seemingly lying down on her back . Unusually warm weather across Russia has prompted bears to awake from hibernation early with warnings that they could attack people as they forage for food. A number of sightings of the animals has been made in parts of Siberia and the Far East in recent weeks, much earlier than normal. In the southern Siberian region of Tuva - where about 3,500 bears live - two men were savagely attacked, suffering serious head and arm injuries, with one of them losing an eye. It is thought that the dogs taking part in the competition in Yakutsk were not experienced hunting animals but were instead only there for 'sporting purposes'. The bear, called Masha, has been used in the contests for a number of years with claims she enjoys them and has grown to understand the dogs. Mr Sleptsov said: 'To aggressive dogs capable of painful bite, Masha's attitude was different. 'Despite her apparent slowness, her attacks, like any wild animal, were extremely sharp and unexpected. 'To be fair, it should be noted that in all the years of holding such events, no dog has been injured by her paws and teeth.'","Bear seen chained to a tree for baiting competition to hone dogs' hunting skills in eastern Russia .
