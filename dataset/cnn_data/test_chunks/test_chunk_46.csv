"A five-year-old boy who battled cancer has been given the all clear by doctors - after creating a superhero mask to help him through his treatment. Harley Renshaw was diagnosed with cancer in his kidney, neck, lungs and bones. But his Ninja Turtle mask helped him feel stronger while he was having radiotherapy. Hospital staff were amazed when the youngster, from Stretford, asked if he could decorate the protective mask that holds him still while having his treatment. Harley Renshaw has been told he is cancer-free after battling an aggressive form of the disease for a year. He donned a superhero costume during his radiotherapy treatment, to help him feel brave . Harley asked if he could decorate the protective mask that holds him still while having his radiotherapy treatment like a Ninja Turtle . After Harley's story made headlines around the world, staff at children's TV channel Nickelodeon even sent Harley a box full of Ninja Turtle presents for Christmas. And now doctors given Harley's parents Oliver, 25, and Stacey, 23, the news they had not dared to dream of - he is free of cancer. He will undergo regular check-ups over the coming years to make sure he stays free of the disease. Mr Renshaw said: 'We're chuffed to bits. Harley is doing great. It was just over a year ago that he was diagnosed and he has been through it. 'He's been running about everywhere and we're hoping that he will soon be back at school full time.' Mr and Mrs Renshaw were given Harley's devastating diagnosis after taking him to see a doctor when he complained of a pain in his stomach. He was diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a rare and aggressive childhood cancer which affects fewer than 100 children in the UK. Harley was diagnosed with cancer in his kidney, lung, bones and neck after mother Stacey took him to a doctor with a stomach pain . Harley's story became famous after it was reported in the local paper in December last year. The children's TV channel Nickelodean even sent him a whole box of Ninja Turtles presents for Christmas . Neuroblastoma is cancer of specialised nerve cells, which are involved in the development of the nervous system. The tumours usually start in one of the adrenal glands found above the kidneys, or in nerve tissues that run along the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. As in Harley's case, the cancer can also spread to other areas of the body. After doctors diagnosed his tumour, Harley faced 80 days of intensive chemotherapy and an operation to remove his kidney tumour. A month later, he was back at hospital for a stem cell transplant – also called a blood or marrow transplant - where healthy stem cells were injected into his body to replace damaged or diseased stem cells. He suffered complications as a result of the procedure, but battled through them to return home for his fifth birthday. He also had weeks of radiotherapy at The Christie clinic in Manchester. Finally, he and his parents were given the incredible news that he was cancer-free. Harley's father said he is 'so chuffed' his son is cancer-free. 'Harley is doing great,' he said. 'He's been running about everywhere and we're hoping that he will soon be back at school full time' His bravery caught the attention of doctors in the hospital and he was awarded one of Cancer Research UK's Little Star Awards. He has also become the face of the charity's Kids and Teens Campaign, which aims to raise funds for research into child cancers. Mr Renshaw said Harley's family are overjoyed to be told he is free of cancer. He added: 'We're just really excited and looking forward to the future.'

Fewer than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year with the disease. Most children diagnosed with the disease are younger than five years old. It is the second most common solid tumour in childhood, and it makes up 8 per cent of the total number of children's cancers. Neuroblastoma commonly occurs in either one of the two adrenal glands in a child's tummy or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. The cancer can spread to tissues beyond the original site, including bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver and skin. As with most cancers the cause of neuroblastoma is unknown. A neuroblastoma cancer cell in the brain is pictured under the microscope. Fewer than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year with this form of cancer . The symptoms vary depending on where a child's tumour is. The first signs can be vague, and include tiredness, a loss of appetite and pain in the bones. If the tumour is in a child's tummy, it may be swollen and the child may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine. Where a tumour is growing in a child's chest, they may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing. Tumours growing in the neck can be visible as a lump, and a child is likely to complain of breathing and swallowing problems. In cases where a tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, children can experience a weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily. A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose neuroblastoma. Treatment depends on the age of the child, as well as the size and position of the tumour and whether the disease has spread. Children can have surgery, chemotherapy, as well as antibody treatment and radiotherapy.

"David and Victoria Beckham have won a planning battle against their next-door neighbour over proposals to install air-conditioning at his new mansion. The A-list couple want to install air-con in five rooms including the luxury gym and large wine cellar at the £31.5 million west London home. But one neighbour was furious with the proposals, claiming it 'will affect the historic character of the Victorian house of the streets, my house included'. Another Beckham victory: David and Victoria have won a planning battle against their next-door neighbour over proposals to install air-conditioning at their new mansion in west London . Portfolio: The couple, pictured, have won planning permission to improve their mansion, which will become their main UK residence. They already have homes in California, France and Dubai . The neighbour expressed 'deep concerns' about the impact of noise, vibration, dirt, pollution and dust from the construction. But other locals gave their support to the Beckhams and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council has approved the plans subject to minor conditions. A report from the council said the air-conditioning would have minimal impact on the significance of the listed building and the noise from the units would comply with the borough's criteria. Jonathan Bore, the executive director for planning and development, said: 'The proposals would safeguard the special architectural and historic interest of the listed building, would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area, would preserve the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, and would have an acceptable impact on trees.' The Beckhams bought the grand property in Holland Park for £31.5 million in cash in 2013. With the help of designer Rose Uniacke, they are restoring the Grade II listed mansion to its former glory. It is a slow process with photos sent to the council last year showing the house had been stripped ahead of its overhaul. Plans: The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. The house will include rooms for hairdressing, manicures and make-up, as well as separate rooms for 40-year-old Victoria's shoe collection . Architect's impression: When ready, the property will have six-bedrooms, a gym, study, office, playroom, cinema and large drawing room.

One local described the plans as a 'prudent and sensible set of alterations which will add to the value of the property over the long term'. A neighbour nearby added that councils should be encouraging the likes of the Beckhams to 'restore these beautiful houses to their former glory'. Estate agents have estimated the property could be worth as much as £42 million when completed.

"The pursuit of journalists for paying public officials was in ruins last night after prosecutors dropped a raft of cases. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was forced into a humiliating climbdown after a jury threw out yet another Old Bailey case. She abandoned the trials of nine reporters accused of illegally paying public officials for information, finally admitting there was little appetite among the public for journalists who expose matters of public interest to be jailed. Former Mirror reporter Graham Brough talks to media as he leaves the Old Bailey court in London after he and three other tabloid journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories . Her decision sparked an ugly blame game as the architects of the £20million ‘politically-motivated witch hunt’ turned against each other. Prosecutors and police pointed the finger at the Leveson inquiry and MPs for whipping up a storm of hysteria over the work of the Press. And Scotland Yard highlighted how their inquiries were possible only thanks to millions of confidential emails released by News International. The man in charge at the start of the tainted Met Police probe into tabloid journalists – Operation Elveden – was former DPP and now Labour parliamentary candidate Keir Starmer. Last night campaigners questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was still putting three journalists in the dock for the same supposed offences. One senior figure said ‘enough is enough’, adding: ‘It was always wrong for journalists to have been prosecuted for doing their jobs.’ The landmark U-turn came yesterday after a jury threw out the case against three Sun journalists and one former Daily Mirror reporter. Lucy Panton, former News of the World crime reporter, had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal after being the first to be found guilty . Brandon Malinsky, Neil Millard and Tom Wells, as well as their Fleet Street rival Graham Brough, were cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. They were accused of funnelling cash to public officials in exchange for leaks from inside some of Britain’s most secure jails. But the jury found that exposing how taxpayers’ cash was wasted on bingo games for illegal immigrants and lavished on child killer Jon Venables was not a crime. Within hours, the CPS threw in the towel on nine other cases, including fresh prosecutions and retrials. The decision followed a review sparked by the Court of Appeal quashing the conviction of the first journalist to be convicted. It can now be revealed for the first time that ex-News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton was found guilty of bribing officials only for her conviction to be overturned. Some of the most senior judges in the country criticised how the archaic law of misconduct in public office – under which prosecutions were brought – had been applied, fatally undermining other cases. The CPS move leaves Operation Elveden in tatters. Of the 27 journalists charged, 23 have been cleared, had their cases dropped or seen their convictions quashed or founder at the Court of Appeal. In addition, 14 journalists were investigated, including many left on bail for many months, but not prosecuted. Three Sun journalists – news editor Chris Pharo, crime reporter Anthony France and reporter Jamie Pyatt – still face trial. A decision must be made within a week over whether Tom Wells should be retried on one charge on which the jury could not reach a verdict. By contrast, 21 of the 28 public officials – including police, prison officers and Ministry of Defence staff – charged under the inquiry have been convicted. Prosecutors faced a furious attack in the wake of yesterday’s decision. Media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was ‘remarkable’ that prosecutors were still pursuing three Sun journalists, adding: ‘Enough is enough.’ The Sun newspaper reporter Tom Wells (left) leaves the Old Bailey court with colleague Neil Millard (right) The Sun's night news editor Brandon Malinsky (left) had his case dropped today. The jury could not decide on one count against former Serco immigration detention centre official Mark Blake (right) Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Malinsky said he had endured ‘two years of torture’. He added: ‘I think the police and CPS have been a disgrace bringing my case and other cases to court. It’s a disgraceful waste of public money.’ The nine journalists whose forthcoming cases have been dropped include ex-Mirror reporter Greig Box-Turnbull and Stephen Moyes of the News of the World. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and royal editor Clive Goodman will not face retrials because prosecutors said it was no longer in the public interest. Sun reporter Vince Soodin, former deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll and former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman will also not be prosecuted. The final two reporters to be told they face no further action are Panton and Ryan Sabey, who has been convicted but has leave to appeal, something the CPS said it will not contest. Mrs Saunders said the original police inquiry was ‘inevitable’ and left prosecutors with a ‘duty’ to act.

"The fatal shooting of an unarmed black man fleeing from a police officer has stirred outrage around the nation, but people in this South Carolina city aren't surprised. They call it inevitable in a police department they believe focuses on petty crimes and fails to keep its officers in check. There is almost nothing in Michael Thomas Slager's police personnel file to suggest that his bosses considered him a rogue officer capable of murdering a man he just pulled over for a broken tail light. People in the community he served say this reflects what's going wrong with policing today: Officers nearly always get the last word when citizens complain. Scroll down for video . Residents of the Charleston, South Carolina, have said the shooting of unarmed black driver Walter Scott was preceded by previous unheeded complaints about the police.  Above, a friend of Scott's at a memorial . The officer who shot Scott, Michael Slager, had little in his file to suggest excessive force. Above, two men pray at the memorial . 'We've had through the years numerous similar complaints, and they all seem to be taken lightly and dismissed without any obvious investigation,' the Rev. Joseph Darby, vice president of the Charleston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Thursday. The mostly black neighborhood in North Charleston where Slager fired eight shots at the back of Walter Lamer Scott on Saturday is far from unique in this regard, said Melvin Tucker, a former FBI agent and police chief in four southern cities who often testifies in police misconduct cases. Nationwide, training that pushes pre-emptive action, military experience that creates a warzone mindset, and legal system favoring police in misconduct cases all lead to scenarios where officers see the people they serve as enemies, he said. 'It's not just training. It's not just unreasonable fear. It's not just the warrior mentality. It's not just court decisions that almost encourage the use of it. It is not just race,' Tucker said. 'It is all of that.' Both Slager, 33, and Scott, 55, were US Coast Guard veteran. Slager had the dismissed excessive force complaint and Scott had been jailed repeatedly for failing to pay child support, but neither man had a record of violence. Video captured by a bystander to the shooting showed Slager fire eight shots at the back of Scott as he ran away . Original statements from Slager said that he felt threatened by Scott, though video released appears to contradict the police account of the incident . A dash cam video from police shows Scott running away from his car during a traffic stop for a broken tail light . Slager consistently earned positive reviews in his five years with the North Charleston Police. His new attorney, Andy Savage, said Thursday that he's conducting his own investigation, and that it's 'far too early for us to be saying what we think.' Slager's first attorney said he followed all proper procedures before using deadly force, but swiftly dropped him after the dead man's family released a bystander's video of the shooting. The officer, whose wife is eight months pregnant, is being held without bond pending an August 21 hearing on a charge of murder that could put him in prison for 30 years to life if convicted. A steady crowd left flowers, stuffed animals, notes and protest signs Thursday in the empty lot where Scott was gunned down. Many said police in South Carolina's third-largest city routinely dismiss complaints of petty brutality and harassment, even when eyewitnesses can attest to police misbehavior. Scott (left) and Slager (right) were both Coast Guard veterans. Slager is being held without bond on a murder charge . POLICE VERSION . Police officer Michael Slager said in a statement earlier this week that his encounter with Walter Scott began at around 9.30am on Saturday. He said he pulled Scott's Mercedes over as a routine traffic stop for a broken brake light. He said Scott then ran away into a vacant grassy lot where, at some point during the chase, the victim confronts Slager. The officer then tried to use his Taser to subdue Scott, but claims the suspect grabbed the stun gun during the struggle, according to the statement. According to police reports, Slager fired the stun gun, but it did not stop Scott. At that point, the officer fired at Scott several times because he 'felt threatened,' Slager's statement said. He added that his actions were in line with procedure. Police then said Slager reported on his radio moments after the struggle: 'Shots fired and the subject is down. He took my Taser.' His department said the officers then performed CPR and delivered first aid to the victim. WHAT THE VIDEO SHOWS . Slager's account has been called into question after the video appears to show him shooting Scott in the back. The footage begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body. Footage then appears to show Slager jogging back to the point where the Taser fell to the ground, bringing it over to Scott's body around 30 feet away and dropping it next to him. It is only after two-and-a-half minutes that Slager is seen placing his hand on Scott's neck in an apparent attempt to check his pulse. A black colleague then arrives and puts on blue medical gloves before handling the body, but is not seen performing first aid. They are joined by a third officer, who also does not appear to tend to the victim. The result, they say, is that officers are regarded with a mixture of distrust and fear. Slager's file includes a single excessive use-of-force complaint, from 2013: A man said Slager used his stun gun against him without reason. But Slager was exonerated and the case closed, even though witnesses told The Associated Press that investigators never followed up with them. 'It's almost impossible to get an agency to do an impartial internal affairs investigation,' Tucker said/ . 'First of all the investigators doing it are co-workers of the person being investigated. Number two, there's always the tendency on the part of the departments to believe the officers.' Mario Givens, the man who accused Slager of excessive force in 2013, told the AP that Slager woke him before dawn by loudly banging on his front door, and saying 'Come outside or I'll tase you!' 'I didn't want that to happen to me, so I raised my arms over my head, and when I did, he tased me in my stomach anyway,' Givens said. Mario Givens (pictured) filed an excessive force complaint against Slager in 2013, but he was not interviewed and no witnesses were questioned . 'They never told me how they reached the conclusion. Never. They never contacted anyone from that night. No one from the neighborhood.' Givens said he's convinced Scott's death could have been prevented if Slager had been disciplined in his case. 'If they had just listened to me and investigated what happened that night, this man might be alive today,' he said. Darby also wonders if Saturday's fatal shooting might have turned out differently had the department thoroughly investigated the 2013 Taser complaint. 'I think he would have been rebuked instead of fired,' Darby said. 'But maybe it changes the way he sees things.' Darby and other civil rights leaders want North Charleston to create an independent citizens review board to review complaints against police, since 'law enforcement is going to almost always give itself the benefit of the doubt.' Such boards are few and far between in South Carolina. North Charleston police spokesman Spencer Pryor said Wednesday that the department now plans to review Givens' complaint, although he wouldn't say what difference that could make now.","Officer Michael Slager's file has little to suggest use of excessive force .

"Genealogists have made an error in compiling the family tree of Hillary Clinton and she is in fact linked to a poor Welsh mining family, an expert claimed . As she kicks off her bid to enter the White House, Hillary Clinton could claim that her path to the presidency began some 160 years ago in the little-known Welsh parish of Ystradyfodwg – if she can pronounce it, that is. For while the US Democrat has previously spoken of her British ancestry, a definitive family tree has revealed her links to a poor mining community in the Welsh Valleys. Ystradyfodwg, pronounced Ust-rady-vod-ug, was the home of Mrs Clinton's great grandmother - a woman who showed a determination, similar to that of the former First Lady, to struggle through poverty and eventually emigrate to America with her family. In fact Mrs Clinton's steely resolve to get to the White House and make history as the first female president, can be seen in the actions of her female ancestors, who even defied social conventions through the years. US genealogy expert Megan Smolenyak has  traced Mrs Clinton’s roots to a mining family from Ystradyfodwg, a small community in south Wales. It is named after Dyfodwg, or Tyfodwg, a sixth century Welsh saint who some believe may have been a Breton Monk. The district, known for its reliance on coal mining and poverty, has since been abolished and is now part of Rhondda. Mrs Clinton's great-grandmother Mary Griffiths was born in Merthyr Tydfil in the Welsh Valleys, and from an early age supported her widowed mother. Official records show she was working as a servant by the age of 12 but in reality she may have been working even earlier. Ms Smolenyak said: 'Born around 1850 in Merthyr Tydfil – at that time, the largest town in Wales – she [Mary Griffiths] can be found in the 1851 census living with her widowed mother and three older siblings. 'Fatherless by the age of one, Mary Griffiths had already been dealt a tough hand.' Scroll down for video . She went on to marry William Jones, a coal miner from Neath, in 1871 and the couple settled in Ystradyfodwg. In a bid for a better life the family made the lengthy journey via Ellis Island to Scranton in Pennsylvania, another mining district where they would continue their trade in the early 1880s. Shortly after they arrived Hannah Jones was born, sometime between 1882 and 1883. Mary Griffiths Jones continued as the head of the family, her husband mostly absent. Hannah Jones was one of just four children out of 14 born who survived - an indication of the poverty her traditional mining family lived in. Mrs Clinton's grandparents Hannah Jones (left) and Hugh Rodham eloped to wed in Binghampton, New York, and are pictured with their granddaughter, former First Lady Hillary Clinton . It was in America that Hannah Jones - who was to become Mrs Clinton's grandmother - met Hugh Rodham, part of the Rodham family who had travelled to America two years earlier from Northumberland. But the circumstances of their marriage reveal the poverty the Jones family endured and the wide social gulf between the Rodhams and Joneses at that time. The pair eloped to Binghampton in New York to get married - a place akin to Gretna Green where people would often go to wed because regulations were less strict. Hannah Jones' family hailed from a poor mining district which is now part of Rhondda in Wales . Mrs Clinton's family were from Ystradyfodwg, close to Neath and Merthyr Tydfil, and now part of Rhondda . From the family histories of the Jones and Rodham families, it appears the pair may have been forced to elope because the Rodhams were unlikely to have approved of their son marrying a woman from such a poor family when they had managed to become moderately wealthy after emigrating to America. Ms Smolenyak revealed that the Jones family were all miners while the Rodhams - who were to become Hannah Jones' in-laws - had left the trade after arriving in the US, and one even became a physician. Ms Smolenyak said: 'When Hugh Rodham found himself smitten with Hannah Jones, he had fallen for a girl who was regarded as being from “the wrong side of the tracks.” Mrs Clinton announced she was running for president last week and toured the Whitney Brothers factory . If Hillary Clinton is successful she could make history as the first female president of the United States . 'If he hadn’t been bold enough to wander across the state line to marry his sweetheart, Hillary’s father wouldn’t have born, erasing her from the scene. 'And if [Hillary] Rodham Clinton recalls her grandmother Hannah as a strong-willed woman who “ruled everyone within her reach,” it may have been a reflection of her determination to escape the circumstances that left her the sole survivor of her birth family of 16 by her early forties.' Hannah Jones Rodham, frequently described by Mrs Clinton as a 'strong willed woman' gave birth to Mrs Clinton's father Hugh E Rodham in 1911 and died in 1952 when Mrs Clinton was just five. 1850s - Mary Griffiths born in Merthyr Tydfil in Wales to poor family. 1851 - Miss Griffiths was living with her widowed mother and three siblings in Wales and by the age of 12 was working as a slave. 1871 - Miss Griffiths married William Jones, a coal miner from Neath near Swansea. They settled in Ystradyfodwg, near Merthyr Tydfil. 1880  - The Joneses moved to Scranton. 1882-1883 - Hannah Jones was born, one of 14 children - of which only four survived. 1902 - Hannah Jones eloped to Binghampton to marry Hugh S Rodham. He had been born in Northumberland and travelled to America with his family where he met Hannah Jones. 1911 - Hugh E Rodham  born to the couple in Scranton, Pennsylvania. 1942  - Hugh E Rodham married Dorothy Howell Rodham, originally from Chicago. 1947 - Hillary Rodham, the eldest of the couple's three children was born. She later went on to marry Bill Clinton. 1952 - Hannah Jones Rodham dies, when Hillary is just five years old. The account appears to be the first definitive family tree for Mrs Clinton which traces her Welsh roots to an area of the Valleys. Previous versions appear to have been drawn incorrectly due to a mix-up over her grandmother. Ms Smolenyak claimed she discovered a key flaw in how genealogists previously compiled Mrs Clinton's family tree in misidentifying Hannah Jones. She said the mistake was made after two children of the same name were born in Scranton in Pennsylvania between 1882 and 1883, and experts previously 'latched onto' the incorrect Hannah Jones. Ms Smolenyak discovered the error while doing research for a piece about Mrs Clinton for Irish America and managed to trace the correct woman using marriage records and obituaries. She identified a woman born shortly after her family arrived in the US in the 1880s, Hannah Jones, who then went on to marry Hugh Rodham in 1902. The revelations come after Mrs Clinton herself appeared to make a mistake regarding her ancestry last week when she suggested all her ancestors were immigrants. She was later forced to correct the error after it was proven that Hannah Jones was born in the US in the 1880s.","A definitive family tree of Hillary Clinton reveals her Welsh ancestors .

"A Florida woman, 21, has been charged with driving under the influence manslaughter after she allegedly hit and killed a 13-year-old girl who was sitting in the street in February, police said. When Mackenzi Sue-Rose Miller allegedly struck and killed Trinity Backmann on February 28 in Apopka, her blood alcohol content level was over the legal driving limit, police revealed after a month-long investigation. Her BAC levels were 0.114 and 0.110, lab tests showed. The legal limit in Florida is 0.08. Mackenzi Miller (left and right), of Apopka, Florida, was charged with DUI manslaughter and DUI while causing injuries after allegedly hitting and killing 13-year-old Trinity Bachmann. Miller's blood alcohol content levels were 0.114 and 0.110, while Florida's legal driving limit is 0.08 . Trinity Bachmann was sitting in the middle of the road arguing with her mother when both of them were struck by the car . Miller was booked into the Orange County Jail on Thursday after turning herself in and is out on a $3,500 bond, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

"A hit-and-run driver who killed a pregnant 21-year-old woman, her husband and their unborn child  has been sentenced to life in prison. Julio 'Wemo' Acevedo, 46, was found guilty of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide after driving away from the scene of an accident that instantly killed Nachman and Raizel Glauber in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The driver, who was convicted in February, is thought to have been traveling in his BMW at 70mph, twice the speed limit, when the incident occurred just after midnight on March 3, 2013. Julio Acevedo (left) 46, was given 25 years to life in prison on Monday after driving away from the scene of an accident that killed a young Hasidic Jewish couple and their unborn child . Acevedo was convicted of manslaughter in the deaths of 21-year-olds Nachman and Raizel Glauber (right). Nachman and Raizel Glaubers, who were 7 months pregnant at the time of the crash, were heading to the hospital in this Toyota Camry livery cab when they were killed . The car the Glaubers were riding in was T-boned by this BMW at an intersection in Williamsburg, Brooklyn . He repeated that the crash was an accident as he was sentenced on Monday and said that he was remorseful, according to CBS New York. The 21-year-old Glaubers, who were married in 2012, were not wearing seat belts when the Toyota Camry they were riding in was T-boned by Acevedo at an intersection. Acevedo did not get out to help the young family and a witness said that he looked inside their livery cab before leaving on foot. Doctors at Bellevue Hospital were able to deliver the 21-year-old Glauber's baby boy, but the child died the next day. Acevedo's criminally negligent homicide conviction stemmed from the death of the baby. The family's Orthodox Jewish community, which had thousands of members gather to mourn the couple, offered a $15,000 award for information leading to the arrest of Acevedo, who left the scene and could not be found in the days after the crash. He was eventually taken into custody four days after the accident, when he surrendered himself to police after arranging to meet them in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Acevedo has a history of felonies, including a 1987 murder conviction that was overturned in 1997 because of new evidence showing that he was under duress when he killed Kevin '50 Cent' Martin, who inspired the name of rapper Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson. He later accepted a plea deal combining a manslaughter charge in the same case with a charge for a robbery he committed 12 days after being released. There are also gun and drug convictions on Acevedo's rap sheet, and he was awaiting an April court date for drunk driving when he hit the Glaubers. Acevedo, pictured after his Pennsylvania arrest in 2013, has a long rap sheet including previous convictions for manslaughter as well as gun and drug offences . Acevedo, pictured after arrest, was said to be going 70mph, twice the speed limit, when he ran into the Glaubers . The judge at Monday's sentencing said that because of his criminal pas  Acevedo was receiving a harsher sentence than the normal 15 year maximum for manslaughter. The criminal told reporters after his hit-and-run arrest that his illegal speeding was because he was afraid of being shot by someone who pulled out a gun and said, 'Nothing is ever forgotten.' The alleged incident may have been connected to his  killing of  Martin, according to the Daily Beast. The BMW driver said that he was not going 70mph and had not been drinking before the crash. The Glaubers' cab driver Pedro Nunez Delacruz, 32 at the time, sustained minor industries but survived, the New York Post reported. Relatives of the Glaubers were emotional as the verdict came down on Monday. 'There are no words that can adequately express the pain and anguish that we have endured in the last two years,' Nachman's mother, Henny Glauber said.

"A couple who were reunited with their lost wedding ring after it was discovered by a scuba diver in Mexico have renewed their vows in an intimate ceremony - alongside the man who found and returned the precious piece of jewelry. Martin and Jessica Castillo, from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, lost the ring, which belongs to Mr Castillo, while they were scuba diving during their honeymoon in Playa del Carmen in February 2013, and had all but given up hope of finding it when they were told that it had been found by Massachusetts resident Daniel Roark, who picked it up from the ocean floor over a year after it was first lost. Now, in honor of the lucky reunion with their ring, Mr and Mrs Castillo have renewed their vows - and even asked Mr Roark, 22, to serve as their 'padrino de anillo', or 'godfather of the ring' for the ceremony, which took place in the same town as their original honeymoon. Scroll down for video . The happy trio: Martin (L) and Jessica (R) Castillo invited Daniel Roark to play a role in their vow renewal ceremony after he reunited them with their lost wedding ring last year . Special occasion: Before a cousin of Mrs Castillo's alerted them to Mr Roark's Facebook campaign, the couple had all but given up hope of ever finding the lost wedding band . 'On a sunny day Daniel and Martin waited under the chuppah for Jessica,' the couple's photographer, Matt, wrote on his website. 'She approached the altar on the beach in her white bridal gown and greeted her husband with a kiss. Daniel was the “padrino de anillo“, “godfather of the ring”, returning the wedding band to the couple and having it placed on Martin’s finger [and bringing] closure after a two-year journey. 'Jessica and Martin renewed their vows, embraced their “angel” and celebrated their love, the success of #thelostweddingband campaign and the goodhearted young man behind it (sic). 'Jessica and Martin also shared a preview of the sequel to this story, they are expecting their first child and will name it after Daniel! 'New friends, new adventures and a fresh start with the ring they thought was gone forever, a fairytale come true and a “happily ever after” for all.' Sun-filled fun: The couple returned to Playa del Carmen, in Mexico, where they had their honeymoon, in order to renew their vows . Special role: Mr Roark was invited to serve as the couple's 'padrino de anillo' or 'godfather of the ring' Lucky find: Mr Roark, an enthusiastic scuba diver, discovered the ring in September 2014, more than a year after it was lost . Meaningful: The ring is engraved with 'Jessica 16-02-13 TYYJCEM'. TYYJCEM stands for 'Tu y yo juntos contra el mundo' or 'You and I together against the world' After discovering the lost wedding band, which been lying under seven feet of water for over a year, while scuba diving on holiday in September 2014, Mr Roark sent out a message on his Facebook page in the hopes of returning the ring, which is engraved with 'Jessica 16-02-13 TYYJCEM'. TYYJCEM stands for 'Tu y yo juntos contra el mundo' or 'You and I together against the world'. The Facebook campaign quickly attracted attention and support from hundreds of thousands of people around the globe, sparking a viral social media search for the couple - who were eventually told about Mr Roark's efforts by Mrs Castillo's cousin. Although Mr Roark admits he was slightly skeptical about the legitimacy of the cousin's claims - he had already received more than 50 messages from people falsely claiming that the ring belonged to them - he was soon convinced after she sent him a series of images of Mr Castillo wearing the band on his wedding day. 'We had no idea that someone was looking for us,' Mr Castillo said at the time. 'You have no idea what this means.' Guardian: Mr Castillo described Mr Roark as the couple's 'angel' True love: The couple were overjoyed to be reunited with the wedding band . Mr Roark admitted when he first found the ring that he had no idea whether its owner would actually want it to be returned - or whether it had been cast into the water on purpose, in a willing attempt to ensure it remained lost. When he launched his initial campaign on Facebook, Mr Roark posted a picture of the ring, before writing: 'OK, so while scuba diving around Playa Reef, Playa Del Carmen last week, I happened to find this ring. 'Unfortunately there is no way for me to know whether it was lost or intentionally thrown into the ocean. 'Assuming it was not the latter, I'd like to find the owner so I can send it to them.' 'If you know a couple who was married on February 16th, 2013, who lost a wedding band (likely while diving) near Playa Del Carmen Mexico, please have them contact me at thelostweddingband@yahoo.com. Precious: Mr Roark posted this picture of the ring on his Facebook page shortly after finding it . Helping hand: Mr Roark was scuba diving off the coast of Playa del Carmen in Mexico when he found the wedding ring on the sea bed . Found: A cousin of Mrs Castillo's (center) messaged Mr Roark to tell him the ring belonged to her relaitve, who had lost it during their honeymoon in February 2013 . 'If not, please take a second to share this. Let's make some social media magic happen!' In another post he added: 'I'm shocked at how much support the search for the wedding band owner has received!' The story was even shared on George Takei's Facebook wall, boost the search's signal, with Roark stating that along brought in 125,000 more shares. 'Sadly the owner has not been found yet, but my hope for humanity was certainly restored!'

"Bobby Brown spoke for the first time about his daughter Bobbi Kristina in Los Angeles on Saturday night and admitted 'I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with ​it.' In an emotional outburst during a concert Bobby appeared close to tears as he referenced his daughter's ongoing battle for her life.​ . ​The former husband of Whitney Houston looked tired and grief stricken at times during his performance, his first public appearance since Bobbi Kristina fell into a coma. Bobby Brown spoke for the first time about daughter Bobbi Kristina in Los Angeles on Saturday night and admitted: 'I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with ​it' The one-time boy band star shied away from talking in detail about his daughter but instead admitted these were 'rough times.' However, in an odd moment during his 45-minute set, he took time out to promote his kine of BBQ sauces. Bobby performed a set of his old hits for 4,000 fans at the Soul Food Festival ​in downtown Los Angeles ​on Saturday after months staying by his daughter Bobbi Kristina's side. Unresponsive: On January 31, Bobbi Kristina Brown was found unresponsive in her bathtub. She's been in a coma ever since . The 46-year-old was given the biggest cheer of the night as he took to the stage to play hits like Don't Be Cruel and ​On Our Own. ​After his drawn-out introduction Bobby, looking tired from performing dance moves, choked up as he said: 'I must ​tell y'all. This feels really, ​really really good. 'I want to thank all of y'all for coming out tonight​ to support me and my family. ​'Rough times are rough times, hard times are hard times I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with it.' ​Panting and sounding frustrated: '​There is only one thing I ask of you all tonight and that is enjoy yourselves.' Smiling he added: 'Don't be cruel, come on,' referring to one of his biggest hits​ the 80s. ​After a few other tunes, Bobby needed a break from the stage to rest while his boyband performed a number. Bobby needed a towel to wipe his face and often looked out of breath as he relived dance moves from his glory days. Later he was a little less emotional as fans cheered his performances of hits like Roni and Rock Witcha. Broke his silence: The former boy bander's appearance was booked before Bobbi Kristina fell into a coma. It was also Brown's first time discussing the matter in public . Had a booth: Brown told the LA crowd, 'Listen I have been doing a lot of things and been working on a lot of projects from Real Husbands Of Hollywood to my own stuff to my new album to my new Edition to Heads Of States and I have been working on my food line; actually you all can get some food right there, in my booth' Looking toward his stand where his Bobby Brown BBQ cooking tent was set up at the festival, he told the crowd: 'Listen I have been doing a lot of things and been working on a lot of projects from Real Husbands Of Hollywood to my own stuff, to my new album, to my new Edition to Heads Of States, and I have been working on my food line. Actually you all can get some food right there, in my booth. ​'​I will over there in a little bit​ later, if you want to buy some barb​e​cue sauce, seasonings, chicken and a couple of sausages. I don'​t know what my wife is cooking ​- whatever it, is is good. You have got to get the season​ing​, because the seasoning is off the chain, I must let you know.' ​Bobby then asked a bandmate to talk about another brand, but fired back: 'Mine is much better, low in sodium content​, low in salt for us folk if, you understand what I ​am saying. ​'So I made this for us.' Wiping away sweat from his face, he added: 'I ain't done with it yet. I got marinades and all kind of s*** coming out.' He then corrected himself: 'Excuse my French baby girl. I didn't mean to curse in front of you. And ladies too.' He then introduced his new ​R&B​ boy band band 'who can saanng.' 'You just listen and tell me if you like it.' Back to work: Brown's pregnant wife Alicia Etheredge was also at the food festival, selling Bobby Brown's BBQ sauce . Timing: The singer and barbecue entrepreneur was committed to the event before his daughter was hospitalized. He's also slated for a tour of Australia . ​Bobby's appearance marks his first time away from Bobbi in months. He had been scheduled to make the appearance before his daughter's accident. Bobbi remains hospitalized and in a coma after being found unconscious and face-down in a bathtub on January 31. The Soul Food Festival is among a string of appearances Bobby is contractually obligated to fulfill/ The singer is also scheduled to leave daughter Bobbi to tour in Australia. Even though he doesn't want to go, the promoters are holding the distraught father to his contractual obligation, TMZ reports. Bobbi Kristina remains on life support in a long-term care center in Atlanta, Georgia, after being treated at the city's Emory University Hospital where the ex-husband of Whitney Houston visits her regularly. Reportedly Bobby has the final say as to whether the young woman's support system is turned off. ​At the Festival 90s rap act Salt'N'Pepa had the crowd on their feet with their performance of Push It.","Broke down during Los Angeles concert as he talked about his daughter Bobbi Kristin, who has been in a coma since January 31 .

"The three east London schoolgirls who fled the UK for Syria have joined a fearsome group of British female jihadis who run the lslamic State's ultra-religious police force, it has been reported. Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, crossed over the Turkish-Syrian border last February and are believed to be living in the Syrian city of Raqqa. Begum has forged social media links with three of the British leaders of the al-Khansa brigade – an all-women militia set up by the terror group a year ago – and it is understood the trio are now training with one of the notorious females arms of ISIS. Covered in black from head-to-toe and wielding automatic weapons, the group has been accused of doling out savage beatings on the streets of Raqqa and spying on its citizens. They are said to mercilessly patrol the streets of the terror group's adopted capital and has previously declared children as young as nine should be married, women should obey men – who are their masters – and remain 'hidden and veiled' at all times. Scroll down for video . Exodus: Amira Abase (left), 15, and Kadiza Sultana (right), 16, also travelled to Istanbul from UK on February 17 before reportedly entering Syria - where they could now be under the control of deadly female insurgents . Life of terror: 15-year-old Shamima Begum (pictured) - one of three British teenagers who is now believed to be inside Syria - contacted Aqsa Mahmood who is considered to be one of the leaders of brutal all-woman militant group al-Khansa . Extreme beliefs: The al-Khansa Brigade (pictured with automatic weapons) has said children as young as nine should be encouraged to marry and it is women's duty to obey men - who are their masters . Armed patrol: Chilling footage from inside ISIS' adopted capital Raqqa revealed how the notorious women of al-Khansa patrol the streets with automatic weapons - while tending to their toddlers . According to Syrian activist group Raqqa is being Slaughtered Silently, the female fanatics are feared by local women, particularly due to their use of torture. The activist group claim imprisoned women are tortured using a device known as 'the biter', a iron bar with sharp jagged edges. Placed on the helpless woman’s chest, the serrated edges of the bar are pressed into the woman's skin, causing deep lacerations. Such is the violence of the torture, some women reportedly slip into unconsciousness due to the pain. Aqsa Mahmoud, a 20-year-old woman from Glasgow who fled to Syria in 2013, is reportedly the leader of an al Khansaa group known as 'Om Amara'. Om Amara is reportedly a female foreign battalion, with just two Arabic speakers who mercilessly patrol the streets of Raqqa. Begum made contact with Mahmood, known as Umm Layth, on social media prior to departing for Turkey. Begum also used her Twitter account to follow two other members of the al-Khansa brigade known only by their Islamic names Umm Khattab and Umm Waqqas. In one of her recent tweets, Umm Waqqas advised British women on marriage in the Islamic State saying they should choose their jihadi fighters carefully and not to marry any 'Tom Dick or Harry'. The British women jihadists in Syria have conducted a sustained recruitment campaign in the last few months and are thought to operate a woman-only jihadi route for European girls who are groomed to leave their Western lives for the caliphate. They use social media, including Tumblr, Twitter and Ask.fm to publish detailed, practical advice about how to adapt to life in Islamic State and suggest essential items that the teenage wannabe-jihadists will find useful when they arrive. Privately-educated Glaswegian Mahmood - along with Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare, 22 - are thought to be helping patrol Raqqa with guns and daggers hidden beneath their robes. Terror leader: Aqsa Mahmood (pictured), who was reported missing by her Scottish parents in 2013, is now a prominent member of a dangerous all-woman police force that dishes out savage beatings on the streets of Raqqa, Syria . Shocking: In 2014, Aqsa Mahmood posted this photograph of her holding the severed head of a Syrian man executed for criminal acts in Syria as young children looked on . Trained to kill: One of the Halane twins, who fled to Syria to marry ISIS fighters, tweeted this picture with the caption: 'Fun day training for self defence in the Islamic State with humble sisters' Wrong hands: The three teenagers who recently fled to Syria are feared to be with the al-Khansa Brigade, who have been accused of oppressively monitoring the behaviour of women in the city . The group operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in the city and dishing out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that aren't black, or those wearing veils made from the wrong material. Mahmood recently advised that the Syrian winter was even colder than what she had experienced in her native Scotland and suggested 'winter woolies' were an essential. Seventeen-year-old British jihadi twins Salma and Zahra Halane from Manchester, who left for Syria in June last year, are thought to be with older British women who have taken on matriarchal roles within the group. They have been posting pictures on their Twitter accounts showing four al-Khansa women - veiled and armed with automatic weapons - undertaking 'self defence' training. Umm Khattab started a Twitter account on June 27 - the day after Zahra and Salma Halane went missing from their home in Manchester to head for Syria. Jihadi brides: Zahra and Salma Halane, 17, left their home in Chorlton, Manchester, to join the Al-Khansa Brigade in Syria in June last year - after becoming radicalised online . Shooting practice: One of the twins tweeted an image showing the women of Al-Khansa practising with their automatic weapons while dressed head-to-toe in black niqabs . Brain washed: The Halane twins have posted a number of pictures on their accounts where they are dressed completely in black and brandishing deadly weapons - just like their Al-Khansa sisters . Path of extremism: Yusra Hussein (pictured), 16, was also reported to have arrived in Syria in October and is also thought to have been mentored by British jihadists . She later tweeted: 'Missing twins – chilling with one of them now', adding she had met 'many British girls' since arriving in Syria. The female branch of ISIS also released an eye-opening manifesto stating Western women who join the terror group have a duty to wed a jihadi – then spend their life cooking, cleaning and raising a family. Two other British schoolgirls, Yusra Hussien, 16, from Bristol and Samya Dirie, 17, from south London, who were reported to have arrived in Syria last October, are also thought to have been mentored by the British jihadists. Brutal patrols: The duties of the all-woman jihadi group  include the strict enforcement of sharia law dress code as well as searching burka-clad women to ensure they are not enemy fighters in disguise . Jihadi bride: Another Briton who left Britain to join ISIS is Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare (left, with her Swedish terrorist husband Abu Bakr) Muslim society: Members of the all-female Al-Khansa Brigade are seen walking in their adopted capital of Raqqa in Syria . Security services say that 600 British Muslims have gone to fight in Syria and around 60 of them are young women. According to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, a US-based monitoring group, al-Khansa was set up by ISIS commanders in Raqqa, northern Syria, in February last year. Its members dress in black robes, wear a full face veil and are paid a monthly salary of 25,000 Syrian pounds - about £100. Their duties include the strict enforcement of sharia law dress code as well as searching burka-clad women to ensure they are not enemy fighters in disguise. Uniform: Al-Khansa's members dress in black robes, wear a full face veil and are paid a monthly salary of 25,000 Syrian pounds - about £100 . Deadly: British members of the female militant group are the most extreme members of the group and are responsible making barbaric threats against Britain . Mahmood, who once studied radiography at Glasgow Caledonian University, is regarded as one of the leaders of the group of British female jihadists. She was reported missing by her parents over a year ago before surfacing in Syria last February as an outspoken supporter of the terrorist group. In her tweets, she urged Muslim men and women who could not come to fight to instead commit terrorist atrocities at home, praising the brutal murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, the bombing of the Boston Marathon and the shooting of soldiers at Fort Hood in Texas. 'If you cannot make it to the battlefield, then bring the battlefield to yourself,' she tweeted.","Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana fled to be 'jihadi brides'

"Defiant Nigel Farage today insisted he did not 'lose my rag' after rounding on the audience of a live TV debate for being too left wing.

Pollster ICM, which was hired by the BBC to select the audience members, today defended its process 'using random location selection techniques'. Nigel Farage today insisted he did not 'lose my rag' after rounding on the audience of a live TV debate for being too left wing . Mr Farage, pictured today, risked alienating those watching at Westminster's Central Hall in London as he protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC' The BBC stressed that the audience was carefully selected by an process, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process. Asked whether he had lost his temper, Mr Farage told the BBC News Channel: 'I was very calm about it. I didn't lose my rag.' He said his protest had been sparked by the hostile audience reaction to his argument that high levels of immigration were increasing pressure on the housing market, something he said would be accepted by 'most rational people'. And he added: 'This is not the first time I've seen this. The night of the by-election that Douglas Carswell won in Clacton with a landslide, there was a Ukip representative - Patrick O'Flynn - on Question Time in Clacton and the audience were deeply hostile to him.' Asked if he blamed the BBC, Mr Farage said: 'Sometimes these things go wrong, sometimes you get groups who apply to be on programmes who perhaps aren't as truthful on their applications as they could be. 'In this case, the BBC gave the job to a polling company called ICM who are famous for getting everything about Ukip wrong and that I think was the mistake. 'Am I going to make a complaint? I've got an election to fight. What matters isn't the 200 people in the room, what really matters are the millions of people watching on television.' Mr Farage's outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching . Independent pollsters ICM were hired by the BBC to select the audience of around 250 people. After facing stiff criticism from Ukip, the firm today released a statement on how it chose the audience members. They were selected from a 20-mile radius of the venue in Westminster. The region was broken up into 30 small areas, and at least 8 people were chosen from each area. Each person was selected to reflect the 'composition of the UK population by gender, age, ethnicity, and social grade, and political protocols that reflected the balance as agreed between the broadcasters and the political parties', ICM said. A fifth of the people declared themselves to be 'undecided voters'. A 'small number' of SNP and Plaid Cymru supporters were brought in from Scotland and Wales. ICM added: 'The recruitment approach replicated those used by ICM at all the 2010 leader debates, both the Clegg vs Farage debates last year, and the recent ITV debate.' Mr Farage was widely considered to have won the debates against Nick Clegg last year, after which the Ukip leader made no complaint about the audience composition. Last night saw five opposition party leaders go head-to-head in a 90-minute live TV debate. Mr Farage appeared alongside Labour's Ed Miliband, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Green Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. During the earlier exchanges, the leaders on Mr Farage for his anti-immigration policies, attracting applause from the audience. Mr Farage was taken aback, and attacked a 'total lack of comprehension' from those watching and protested they were 'a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC'. His outburst came less than half an hour into the event after some of his comments about pressure on housing due to immigration were greeted with mutters from those watching. Mr Farage warned that foreigners arriving in the UK 'has directly contributed to the housing crisis'. But he came under fire for linking all of the countries problems to immigration. Green party leader Natalie Bennett took a swipe at Mr Farage: 'There is someone here on this platform who wants to totally demonise migrants and you know who I mean.' She hit back at claims migrants are causing a crisis in the health service: 'One in four doctors is foreign born, 40 per cent of NHS staff are foreign born. Mr Miliband said told Mr Farage: 'You abuse immigrants and those with HIV and then you complain that Ukip is being abused.' Miss Sturgeon won loud applause as she urged Mr Farage to 'put the bogeyman to one side'. She told him: 'We have a housing crisis across this country. You know what, Nigel Farage? It isn't caused by immigrants. In your world every problem is caused by immigrants.' But Mr Farage claimed the audience was biased against him: 'There just seems to be a total lack of comprehension on this panel, and indeed amongst this audience, which is a remarkable audience even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC.' Mr Farage was heckled by members of the audience before David Dimbleby, who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say: 'Nigel, let me just say one thing. 'This is an audience that has been carefully chosen not by the BBC, but by an independent polling organisation to represent the balance between all parties.' Labour leader Ed Miliband gave the Ukip leader the advice: 'It's never a great idea to attack the audience, Nigel, in my opinion.' But Mr Farage retorted: 'The real audience are sitting at home.' Explanation: Mr Farage was heckled before David Dimbleby (pictured), who was presenting the broadcast on BBC1, intervened to say how the audience had been chosen . The BBC insists the audience was carefully selected by an independent pollster, but Mr Farage said something had gone 'wrong' with the process . Unimpressed: Ukip voter Mike Cripps, 44 . A Ukip voter has insisted he is having second thoughts about backing the party after Nigel Farage attacked the studio audience. Security worker Mike Cripps, 44, of Bromley, south-east London, believed the Ukip leader had 'done a couple of stupid things'. The first was his comment on the audience and the second was raising his views on people with HIV visiting the UK for NHS treatment, Mr Cripps said. Asked if Mr Farage's remarks had put him off supporting Ukip, Mr Cripps said: 'It did a bit, yeah. I don't think he put himself across right. 'If we're just talking about the debate tonight - it's what we should be talking about, not what he's done six years ago or two years ago or yesterday - for me, Nicola Sturgeon was the best. 'She was slick, she was well prepared, she had been well briefed, that's my personal opinion. Ed Miliband - it was like he was reading off a script.' The BBC insisted the audience had been chosen by an independent polling organisation to reflect the supporters of all parties - not just those represented by their leaders last night. A spokesman for the corporation told MailOnline yesterday: 'ICM recruited an audience to give a cross section of political opinion.' ICM, a public opinion research company founded in 1989, was unavailable for comment last night. Ukip meanwhile was said to be pressing for an inquiry into how the audience was chosen. Asked after the debate about Mr Farage's criticism of the audience, Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'I am not sure whether we will complain. All I will say is I didn't think the audience was representative of the views of British people. 'I think Nigel Farage would have done very well with people sitting at home.' Mr Nuttall said he had spoken about things which had happened to him on Question Time, telling reporters: 'Who knows, may be some people are being disingenuous on their application forms.' Asked if adopting an attack on the audience was an easy get out clause for dismissing opposition to Ukip's views, he added: 'Oh no. People at home agree with us and that's what really matters - the millions of people at home watching this. 'We know, for example, on immigration, on the European Union they agree with where Ukip stands. What the audience in here really think is, I suppose, irrelevant.' Tweeting during the debate, Lord Ashcroft said: 'A minority view once again. Nigel Farage having a go at the BBC audience may well appeal to the viewers whose vote he is targeting.' And Sky News presenter Kay Burley tweeted: 'Farage having a pop at balance of audience. Dodgy ground there. Broadcasters jump through hoops to make sure studio is fair.' As the end credits rolled following the BBC debate last night, four of the five party leaders shook hands with each other - but Mr Farage just drank from a glass of water from behind his stand. As Miss Bennett and Miss Wood walked away, Miss Sturgeon then went to shake Mr Farage's hand - and Mr Miliband offered the Ukip leader a pat on the back. Then, all of the leaders went to the audience to shake their hands - with the exception, again, of Mr Farage. He shook hands with Mr Dimbleby before leaving without going up to the audience.

"Alex Salmond has stepped up the pressure on Ed Miliband saying he won't be able to avoid a deal with the SNP and was 'foolish' to rule out a coalition . Alex Salmond has stepped up the pressure on Ed Miliband saying he won't be able to avoid a deal with the SNP and was 'foolish' to rule out a coalition. The former SNP leader, who is bidding to return to Westminster, said the Labour leader would find it difficult to avoid doing a deal with the Scottish nationalists in the event of  hung parliament. When questioned about a potential coalition with Labour, he suggested Mr Miliband had only rejected the idea because he was 'under pressure from the Conservative press'. He said all parties would have to face up to the 'electorate's judgment' after polling day on May 7. 'There is no disrespect or disgrace in any politician coming to terms with the democratically expressed position of the electorate,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'I think that after the election every Westminster politician will have to come and face the reality of the electorate's judgment,' This comes after SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon warned Mr Miliband he would not be forgiven if he allowed David Cameron back into Downing Street because he was unwilling to do a deal with the SNP. During Thursday night's TV debate, she said: 'I can help Labour be bolder … take the chance to kick David Cameron out of Downing Street. Don't turn your back on it - people will never forgive you. 'It's about delivering real change – not pretend change – real change for people right across this country. Is it the case that you would rather see David Cameron go back into Downing Street than work with the SNP? Surely that cannot be your position.' The Tory Party has just released a campaign poster depicting Ms Sturgeon 'pulling the strings' in the event of a deal between her party and Labour. The billboard depicts Sturgeon as a puppeteer and Miliband as a dummy, with the words 'more taxes, more borrowing, more debt.' underneath. The former SNP leader told Mr Miliband he would find it difficult to avoid doing a deal with the Scottish nationalists in the event of hung parliament, pictured is the Labour leader today on the campaign trail . The Tory Party has just released a campaign poster depicting Ms Sturgeon 'pulling the strings' in the event of a deal between her party and Labour . Speaking at the poster's launch, party chairman Grant Shapps  said: 'Labour are collapsing in Scotland. This means the only way that Ed Miliband might crawl through the gates of No10 now is if he's carried there by the SNP. 'Nicola Sturgeon would pull the strings and demand weaker defences, more spending and unaffordable welfare hand-outs. It would be a disaster for taxpayers.' Labour has insisted that it will not need SNP votes to govern - rejecting Conservative claims that Mr Miliband would be a prisoner of the nationalists if he entered Number 10. Mr Salmond also made clear that SNP MPs at Westminster would be prepared to vote on England-only issues - such as health and education where power has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament - if they impact on Scotland. During Thursday night's TV debate, Ms Sturgeon said: 'I can help Labour be bolder' pictured with Mr Salmond . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon (pictured) warned Mr Miliband he would not be forgiven if he allowed David Cameron back into Downing Street . 'The vast majority of votes have an economic impact,' he said. 'When I was a Member of Parliament before I voted against foundation hospitals in England because I thought it would lead to the fragmentation of the health service and then have effects in Scotland. I voted against tuition fees for English students in England. 'It is not English-only legislation, if it has an economic impact it has an impact on Scotland.' He indicated that the SNP could use their votes to try to change the Budget of the next government. 'I don't think there is a single Member of Parliament or a single political party who wouldn't wish to be in a position and have an effect and influence for the betterment of their own constituents and, indeed, the betterment of politics across these islands,' he said.","Alex Salmond said Ed Miliband would find it difficult to avoid an SNP deal .

"They're national sweethearts and two of television's golden girls. And now, presenters Holly Willoughby and Davina McCall have joined forces in their first campaign together. The presenters star in the campaign, which celebrates finding their perfect hair shade with Garnier Nutrisse - and, of course, they show off their glossy locks in the shoot. Holly, 34, and 47-year-old Davina can be seen cuddling up to each other and larking around with their hair pulled over their mouths to resemble a moustache. Holly Willoughby and Davina McCall have joined forces in their first campaign together for Garnier Nutrisse . Speaking about the new campaign, This Morning presenter Holly said: ‘I absolutely loved shooting with Davina, she is such an iconic brunette. 'Davina and I have found our perfect colour matches. Now we’re joining forces together to help UK women find their prefect shade too. My chosen shade is 10.01 it is the perfect multi- tonal blonde that is just me.' Davina added: ‘I’ve worked with Garnier Nutrisse for over 10 years and it was brilliant to star alongside the beautiful blonde Holly in this campaign. My perfect match is Garnier Nutrisse 4.3. I’m 60 per cent grey and have to dye my hair every three to four weeks otherwise my roots grey.' It's been a busy month for Holly, who wakes up the nation on This Morning, has added another string to her bow by designing a range of vintage-inspired clothes for babies. Holly, 34, and 47-year-old Davina can be seen larking around with their hair pulled over their mouths to resemble a moustache . Speaking to FEMAIL about her latest project with BHS, Holly said: 'It’s something I have been passionate about for quite some time; this project has been about 18 months in the making. 'I have a style that I have tried to bring into this range, which I hope feels fresh and blends the modern with vintage.' The range has a strong vintage feel running throughout and each piece has an element that is reminiscent of a bygone era, from delicate frills to smart pinstripes. Holly, who is mother to Harry, Belle and Chester, certainly has experience when it comes to dressing little ones - and said she designed her new range with her own offspring in mind. 'I love the vintage florals, the soft tones and the fresh cotton dresses,' she said. Speaking about the new campaign, This Morning presenter Holly, left, said: 'I absolutely loved shooting with Davina, she is such an iconic brunette' If that wasn't keeping her busy enough, the presenter managed to find time to extend her home range with Sir Philip Green's high street store, too. Davina, meanwhile, reaffirmed her commitment to Matthew Robertson, her handsome spouse of 15 years, as the couple renewed their wedding vows in the desert gambling haven on Las Vegas last weekend. After the ceremony at the Little White Wedding Chapel, the mother-of-three took to Instagram to share a shot of herself dressed in a white sleeveless top and shorts as she posed beside her man. Davina also revealed that the couple's three children - Holly Willow, 13; Tilly Pippy, 11, and eight-year-old Chester Micky - had a big hand in the ceremony. In another Instagram post, she revealed: 'The kids wrote our vows... It was Funny and more moving than I thought it would be.' The family have since embarked on a road trip around California, visiting the picturesque coastal town town of Carmel, where Clint Eastwood served as mayor for two years from 1986.

"The family of a 19-month-old girl with a seven kilogram cancerous tumour in her belly are desperately searching for specialists who may have the answer to removing the treatment-resistant growth. Little Rosannah Gundry was diagnosed with stage three neuroblastoma cancer in December last year, after a specialist at Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital discovered the football-sized tumour, which weighs more than half her body weight, growing around her vital organs and pressing against her spine. Rosannah, from Baradine in north western New South Wales, had been misdiagnosed with scoliosis when she was three months old, but her aunt, Jessica Searle, said that Rosannah's mother knew something more was wrong when the toddler's stomach began to swell. Little Rosannah Gundry was diagnosed with stage three neuroblastoma cancer in December last year . 'Her mother Jamielee kept saying to the doctor that it wasn't scoliosis. She was pale and not eating, and vomiting up her food, so she kept looking for a second opinion,' Ms Searle, 25, told Daily Mail Australia. In December last year, twelve months after Rosannah was originally diagnosed with scoliosis, the family was given the devastating news that she had stage three neuroblastoma cancer. 'I just don't think her parents had prepared themselves for the news. Even when she was having tests, I don't think they let themselves believe it,' Ms Searle said. The tumour had wrapped itself around her organs and up her spine to near her heart, and was releasing huge amounts of adrenaline, which meant that the toddler needed to be put on heart medication to balance her racing heartbeat of 200 beats per minute. Rosannah was admitted to hospital immediately, and began chemotherapy treatment on the huge tumour, in the hope that it would shrink to a size which could be operated on. 'The oncologist said to us that he was hopeful that after four rounds of chemotherapy it would be able to be removed. While we were waiting for the rounds Rosannah got quite sick and contracted a staph infection,' Ms Searle said. The seven kilogram tumour is pressing against her spine and vital organs causing her swollen stomach . Rosannah's aunt Jessica Searle is seeking treatment for her niece in the United States . Rosannah had four rounds of chemotherapy which her oncologist had hoped would shrink the tumour . 'It's been quite a battle for the poor little thing.' Rosannah and Jamielee, a single mother, have been staying in Ronald McDonald House while the rest of their family lives several hours away in country NSW. A day before her last chemotherapy treatment, Rosannah's mother Jamielee gave birth to her second child, Skylah, and just two week later, was told that the chemotherapy hadn't been successful in reducing the tumour to an operable size. 'We were told that the chemotherapy had been ineffective because the tumour had developed a protective barrier which meant it was immune. They also couldn't put her into radiation therapy because of how close it is to her organs,' said Ms Searle. Rosannah's extended family have now begun reaching out to specialists overseas in the hope that there may be treatment available in the United States that is not available in Australia. A day before Rosannah's last chemotherapy treatment, her mother gave birth to her little sister Skylah . Ms Seale said that Rosannah's mother has been very strong even through the delivery of Skylah (right) Her oncologist has also continued to seek advice, and the family is hopeful that a solution will be found to buy some more time for the 'fun-loving' little girl. 'She's a cracker of a child, despite her pale skin and overly large stomach you wouldn't pick that she has something wrong with her,' said Ms Searle. 'She's very carefree and runs wild like any other child, she's a very happy little girl.' However, it has been a month since Rosannah's last treatment, and her aunt said she is beginning to experience more pain as her condition worsens. 'She's been eating less and can't walk for more than a few metres before she falls over in pain, crying,' Ms Searle said. 'We found out this week that this is because the tumour is pushing on her spinal cord and catching the nerves there,' she said. 'Sometimes when I look into her eyes it's like she knows something is really wong.' Ms Seale said that the family and Rosannah's oncologist aren't giving up hope, and that they are determined to keep searching for a solution. The family is hopeful that a solution will be found to buy some more time for the 'fun-loving' little girl . 'She's very carefree and runs wild like any other child, she's a very happy little girl,' said Ms Seale . It has been a month since Rosannah's last treatment, and her aunt said she is beginning to experience more pain as her condition worsens . 'Her oncologist is looking into using a specialised dye which is currently used to show where the cancer is in her body, but could possibly kill the cells if used in a strong enough dose,' she said. 'But he can't promise anything and so both he and our family are talking to overseas specialists about the next step.' Ms Seale has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money to help Rosannah and her mother fly to the US to seek treatment not available in Australia. 'I feel as though the health system has failed her big time. We want to buy her some time, and the only thing holding us back is the financial side.' Ms Seale said that the whole ordeal has been exhausting, and pyschologically is beginning to take it's toll. 'I've been trying to support Jamielee, going back and forth and doing everything I can to make sure she doesn't feel like she's alone,' she said. 'I am so proud and amazed by how strong she is. If I was in that position I wouldn’t be coping. She just gets up and soldiers on, she hasn’t cried, she’s doing really well,' said Ms Searle. Ms Seale, who has a three-year-old son herself, said that she wants as many people as possible to come forward and support Rosannah. 'We just want to give her the best opportunity at life, and we can't do that here,' she said.","Rosannah Gundry, 19 months old, was diagnosed with stage three neuroblastoma cancer in December last year .

"An impoverished father has revealed that he plans to sell his own kidney to fund life-saving treatment for his three morbidly-obese children. Sisters Yogita Rameshbhai Nandwana, five, and Anisha, three, and their 18-month-old brother Harsh, are among the world's heaviest young children. Weighing 5st 5lbs (34kg), 7st 8lbs (48kg) and 2st 5lbs (15kg) respectively, the food they eat in a week is enough to feed two families in a month. Now their father Rameshbhai Nandwana, 34, of Gurjarat, India, is planning to sell his kidney to earn the money needed to see top specialists. He said: ‘If my kids continue to grow at this rapid rate they will have major health issues. We’re terrified they will die.’ Scroll down for video . Obese: (From left) Yogita, five, Harsh, 18 months, and Anisha, three, weigh 5st 5lbs (34kg), 2st 5lbs (15kg) and 7st 8lbs (48kg) respectively . Yogita and Anisha eat 18 chapatis, 3lbs of rice, two bowls of broth, six packets of crisps, five packs of biscuits, 12 bananas and a litre of milk daily. And their extreme hunger means their mother Pragna Ben, 30, spends most of her day making their meals. She said: ‘My day starts with making 30 chapatis and 1kg vegetable curry in the morning. After that I am again in the kitchen preparing more food. ‘Their hunger never stops. They demand food all the time and cry and scream if they’re not fed. I am always in the kitchen cooking for them.’ The couple have one older daughter, Bhavika, six, who weighs an average 2st 7lbs (16kg), and do not know why their other three children are so big. Mr Nandwana said: ‘When Yogita was born she was extremely weak and weighed just 1.5kg (3.3lbs). We were worried for her health. 'So we fed her a lot during the first year of her life to build her strength but by her first birthday she had bloated to 12kg (1st 12lbs). Family: Rameshbhai Nandwana (left), 34, and Pragna Ben (back right), 30, are the parents of Yogita (front left), Anisha (front right), Harsh (front centre) and six-year-old Bhavika (rear centre), their other daughter - who weighs an average 2st 7lbs. They all live together in Gujarat, India . ‘Our third daughter Anisha also gained weight in similar fashion and by her first birthday she was 15kg. ‘But we only realised they were suffering from a disorder when our son Harsh was born as he too gained weight quickly during his first year. 'We started looking for medical help and consulted many doctors but they would just refer us to bigger hospitals that I couldn’t afford.’ Mr Nandwana earns just Rs 3000 (£35) a month - but usually has sufficient money to buy enough food to fulfil the large appetite of his children. He said: ‘I am a daily wage labour and I usually get paid Rs 100 a day but there are times when there is no work at all. ‘I work in fields, dig wells, and do whatever menial job I can find to earn money. 'And I’m constantly worried about finding the money to feed my continually hungry children.’ Despite his paltry income, Mr Nandwana spends about Rs 10,000 (£110) a month on food for his children and said he 'cannot leave them starving' Diet: Yogita and Anisha eat eight chapatis, 4lbs of rice, three bowls of broth, six packets of crisps, five packs of biscuits and 12 bananas daily .

But I make sure I feed my children when they need.’ The father has spent Rs 50,000 (£540) on seeing doctors and treatment over the last three years – without any improvement in his children’s condition. He said: ‘No one in our family has a giant frame. Only my children are overweight. As parents, it pains us immensely to see them unable to move. ‘They cannot walk; they cannot do anything on their own. Selling my kidney is a desperate measure. But I’m now desperate to get the right help for my children.’ Miss Ben cannot pick up her children so she has to watch them roll around when her husband is at work - or use a trolley to pull them around. She said: ‘They need me to help them bath or when they need the toilet. I’m only 40 kg so it’s impossible for me to pick them up. ‘It’s a struggle when my husband is at work. Hard-working: Anisha hugs her father Rameshbhai, with Harsh. Mr Nandwana spends about Rs 10,000 (£110) a month on food for his children . 'They are usually restricted to the same place for the whole day and because of that, they cannot go to school. 'All they do all day is eat and play and giggle with each other. 'I want my daughters to get an education and play like other kids. I want them to have a life. This is no life.’ Local doctors believe the children are suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome, but do not know how to treat it. The rare genetic condition causes various symptoms including constant hunger, reduced muscle tone, restricted growth and learning difficulties. Dr Akshay Mandavia, a paediatrician at Mandavia Children's Hospital in Gujarat, said: ‘There is an abnormal accumulation of fat in these children. ‘They’re not able to breathe properly, and they wheeze. Their condition could be due to endocrinal disease or Prader-Willi syndrome. ‘But we can only ascertain the right treatment after a proper diagnosis at one of our top hospitals.’ Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems. These include: . It is caused by a genetic defect on chromosome number 15, which happens purely by chance, and is usually diagnosed by carrying out genetic tests. Sadly, there is no cure for the condition. Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems such as overeating. Parents of children with the condition usually have to restrict their diet and lock up all food . Instead, a team of healthcare professionals will help teach parents to manage any problems the child has, such as overeating. Children usually want to eat frequently, so it is important that most of the food they eat is low in calories, and that access to sweets and fatty foods is restricted. Getting the child to stick to an eating plan voluntarily is practically impossible, so parents usually need to lock any storage areas that contain foods, such as fridge or cupboards. They should also search the child’s room for hidden foods, forbid them to leave the house unsupervised, or play with other children who are eating food, in case they try to steal it. Any family, friends or teachers should be informed of the need to restrict their diet. The child should also be encouraged to exercise as much as possible. If the child has restricted growth, treatment with an artificial version of the human growth hormone (HGH) is usually recommended, as it can increase their final adult height by around 10.5cm (4.1 inches). Most adults with Prader-Willi syndrome are unable to live fully independent lives, such as having a full-time job and living in their own home. Their behavioural issues and problems with food mean these environments and situations are too demanding. Adults with the syndrome who don't live with their parents will probably require residential care. Source: NHS Choices .

"Biting his nails nervously, these are the first pictures of the migrant boat captain accused of killing 900 men, women and children in one of the worst maritime disasters since World War Two. Tunisian skipper Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, was arrested when he stepped onto Sicilian soil last night, some 24 hours after his  boat capsized in the Mediterranean. Before leaving the Italian coastguard vessel, however, he was forced to watch the bodies of 24 victims of the tragedy being carried off the ship for burial on the island of Malta. He was later charged with multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and aiding illegal immigration. Prosecutors claim he contributed to the disaster by mistakenly ramming the overcrowded fishing boat into a merchant ship that had come to its rescue. As a result of the collision, the migrants shifted position on the boat, which was already off balance, causing it to overturn. Scroll down for videos . Nervous: Tunisian boat captain Mohammed Ali Malek (centre) bites his nails as he waits to disembark an Italian coastguard ship before being arrested over the deaths of 950 migrants who died when his ship sank . 'Killer': Malek, 27, was arrested when he stepped onto Sicilian soil last night some 24 hours after his overcrowded boat capsized in the Mediterranean. He has been charged with multiple manslaughter . In the dock: Malek affords a smile alongside his alleged smuggler accomplice, a 26-year-old Syrian crew member named Mahmud Bikhit, who was also arrested and charged with 'favouring illegal immigration' A police handout showing Mohammed Ali Malek (left) and Mahmud Bikhit (right) after their arrest in Malta . Malek was also pictured with his alleged smuggler accomplice, a 26-year-old Syrian crew member named Mahmud Bikhit, who charged with 'aiding illegal immigration. Both men were to be put before a judge later today. Catania prosecutor Giovanni Salvi's office stressed that none of the crew aboard the Portuguese-flagged King Jacob is under investigation in the disaster. He said the crew members did their job in coming to the rescue of a ship in distress and that their activities 'in no way contributed to the deadly event.' Meanwhile, the survivors were brought to a migrant holding center in Catania and were 'very tired, very shocked, silent,' according to Flavio Di Giacomo of the International Organization for Migration. Most of the survivors and the victims appear to have been young men but there were also several children aged between 10 and 12, she added. 'We have not yet been able to ask them about this but it seems certain that many of them will have had friends and family who were lost in the wreck.' Deep in thought: Malek stares in space while waiting to leave the rescue vessel. Survivors told how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya . They told yesterday how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya. Some resorted to clinging to their floating corpses until Italian and Maltese coastguards came to rescue them in the dead of the night. The coast guard, meanwhile, reported that it saved some 638 migrants in six different rescue operations on Monday alone. On Tuesday, a further 446 people were rescued from a leaking migrant ship about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of the Calabrian coast. At talks in Luxembourg on Monday, EU ministers agreed on a 10-point plan to double the resources available to maritime border patrol mission Triton and further measures will be discussed at a summit of EU leaders on Thursday. Victims: Malek watches some of the bodies being taken off the rescue ship for burial in Malta . Grim: Survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue . Relaxed: Malek grins on the desk of the Italian coastguard ship next to some of the migrant survivors . Critics say Triton is woefully inadequate and are demanding the restoration of a much bigger Italian operation suspended last year because of cost constraints. The survivors, who hailed from Mali, Gambia, Senegal, Somalia, Eritrea and Bangladesh, were all recovering Tuesday at holding centres near Catania on Sicily's eastern coast. Sunday's disaster was the worst in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1,700 lives this year - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 - and nearly 5,000 since the start of last year. In that time nearly 200,000 migrants have made it to Italy, mostly after being rescued at sea by the Italian navy and coastguard. Italian officials believe there could be up to one million more would-be immigrants to Europe waiting to board boats in conflict-torn Libya. Many of them are refugees from Syria's civil war or persecution in places like Eritrea. Others are seeking to escape poverty and hunger in Africa and south Asia and secure a better future in Europe. Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott urged the EU to introduce tough measures to stop migrants attempting to make the perilous sea voyage from North Africa to Europe. Mr Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said it was the only way to stop deaths. Hardline: Tony Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths . Haunted: Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . While Mr Abbott's controversial policy has proved successful, with the nation going nearly 18 months with virtually no asylum-seeker boat arrivals and no reported deaths at sea, human rights advocates say it violates Australia's international obligations. His comments came as EU foreign and interior ministers met in Luxembourg to discuss ways to stem the flood of people trying to reach Europe. Outlining his views on preventing the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, Mr Abbott told reporters: 'We have got hundreds, maybe thousands of people drowning in the attempts to get from Africa to Europe.' The 'only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats', he added. Yesterday, the Maltese Prime Minister declared a crisis, calling for EU countries to reinstate rescue operations. He warned: 'A time will come when Europe will be judged harshly for its inaction when it turned a blind eye to genocide. 'We have what is fast becoming a failed state on our doorsteps and criminal gangs are enjoying a heyday.' He estimated smugglers behind the doomed voyage from Libya to Europe would have made between €1million and €5million from selling desperate refugees spaces on the boat.","Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, has been charged with multiple manslaughter .

"Ukip has failed to outpoll the Liberal Democrats for the first time since 2013 in a fresh blow to Nigel Farage’s faltering election campaign. An exclusive ComRes survey for the Daily Mail and ITV News shows the Lib Dems are up three points to 12 per cent, equal with Ukip. The poll is the latest bad news for Mr Farage, and undermines his claim yesterday that support for Ukip has ‘rallied’ after a lacklustre few weeks. Scroll down for video . A ComRes survey has revealed that Nick Clegg's (right) Liberal Democrat party is now equal with Nigel Farage's UKIP in the polls. It is the first time since late 2013 that UKIP has failed to outpoll the Lib Dems . ‘Since the debates last week there is a very clear firming of the polls on Ukip,’ Mr Farage insisted. The poll will also ease Tory jitters, showing that with less than a month to go to election day, the Tories are on 34 per cent and Labour on 33 per cent. While the Tory lead has slipped slightly since the start of the campaign, the party will be relieved to be ahead after other pollsters suggested Labour had taken a lead in recent days. Labour has yet to be out in front in any ComRes telephone poll this year, reflecting what the pollster called ‘a small, but existent lead for the Conservatives’. The poll also gives the Tories a commanding lead on key economic issues. Voters are more likely to trust the Conservatives than Labour most to keep the economy growing, by 46 per cent to 28 per cent, and make the right level of cuts to government spending, by 38 per cent to 32 per cent. Even a significant number Labour voters trust the Tories most to secure growth (15 per cent) and make the right level of cuts to government spending (10 per cent). Following the ‘non-dom’ tax row, the public is evenly split in its trust of both main parties in setting the right levels of tax for everyone, with each backed by 36 per cent. Women are more likely to trust Labour most to set the right levels of tax, by 40 per cent to 31 per cent, while men trust the Conservatives, by 41 per cent to 33 per cent. Voters have mixed views on the role of the rampant SNP, threatening to steal dozens of seats from Labour, if it holds the balance of power in a hung parliament. The poll found that while the David Cameron's Conservative lead has slipped slightly since the start of the campaign, the Tories still have 34 per cent of voters compared to Ed Miliband's Labour on 33 per cent . Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she is prepared to prop up an Ed Miliband government even if Labour wins fewer seats. Half of all voters (50 per cent) say the SNP should be allowed to try to form a government with whichever party it chooses. But 32 per cent insist it should try to form a government with the party with the most MPs. Conservative voters are most likely to say that the SNP should have to try to form a government with the party with the most MPs in Parliament, rather than its preferred choice, by 43 per cent to 40 per cent. Katharine Peacock, managing director of ComRes, said: ‘After a desperate five years [for the Lib Dems] in terms of public support, this poll may be the first sign of such a recovery happening again. But they start from a long way behind.’ A Survation poll for the Daily Mirror put Labour on 35 per cent, the Tories on 31 per cent, Ukip 15 per cent, Lib Dems 9 per cent and Greens 4 per cent. A prominent Ukip candidate says he wants David Cameron to win the General Election. John van Weenen admitted his party is ‘not in the running’ but said he was speaking out because of the threat of Labour taking power propped up by the Scottish Nationalists. Mr van Weenen, 73, who is standing in South West Bedfordshire, said: ‘The SNP is going to get in, and I would rather see Cameron get in. I agree with Ukip policy entirely, but I’m concerned looking at the big picture.’ Enough already... Voters don't want to know about leaders' wives . A large majority of voters does not want to know about the spouses and children of party leaders, the poll reveals. It shows that 71 per cent believe they are only voting for politicians - and have no need to know about their wives, husbands or offspring. Just 25 per cent say it is important to get to know party leaders’ families to better understand their characters. The findings are a blow to the three main party leaders, who have made their wives more prominent in this election campaign than ever before. Only 25 per cent of voters believe it is important to get to know party leaders’ families, a new ComRes poll shows. The party leaders have made their wives more prominent in this election campaign than ever before . Samantha Cameron has accompanied her husband on a series of election visits, and even made a solo stop to the seat of Rochester, in Kent, where the Tories are seeking to dislodge Ukip defector Mark Reckless. She has also spoken on camera when a BBC crew was ushered into the Cameron’s Oxfordshire home. Justine Miliband yesterday gave a national newspaper interview, and has also welcomed TV cameras into her home to film her and her children, while Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, Nick Clegg’s wife, has similarly appeared on camera and taken part in campaign visits. The ComRes poll shows Conservative voters are the most likely to think it is important to get to know the wives and families of the party leaders – 32 per cent -- compared to a quarter – 25 per cent -- of Labour voters. Women are marginally more likely to want to know about politicians’ spouses and families than men, by 27 per cent to 24 per cent. A separate poll, by YouGov, found that Mrs Cameron is twice as popular as other leaders’ wives. It found that 54 per cent of voters said they liked Mrs Cameron, more than double the proportion who opted for Ms Gonzalez Durantez Clegg or Mrs Miliband. The Prime Minister’s wife scored well with men and women alike, as well as voters who have backed other parties. The poll found that women are marginally more likely to want to know about politicians’ spouses and families than men, by 27 per cent to 24 per cent. Above: Ed Miliband is supported by wife Justine during the campaign . The poll for the London Evening Standard asked which of the women was ‘the best election asset for their parties’, with 26 per cent backing Mrs Miliband and 20 per cent supporting Ms Gonzalez Durantez. Some 90 per cent of Tory supporters chose Mrs Cameron, compared with 82 per cent of Lib-Dem supporters who opted for Mrs Clegg. Only 61 per cent of Labour supporters backed Mrs Miliband, with around a fifth believing Mrs Cameron was a better asset and a fifth thinking Mrs Clegg was the best. Tanya Abraham, of YouGov, said: ‘Samantha Cameron is the clear winner in the battle of the wives. ‘However, it should be noted that as the wife of the Prime Minister she has had a high profile over the past few years. It could be that as the campaign progresses Miriam Clegg and Justine Miliband become better known and their impact on the party or politicians’ image increases.’","Lib Dems move level with UKIP for first time since 2013, according to poll .

"The Tories are set to steal Labour’s thunder by unveiling tax breaks for workers on the minimum wage. A text message intended for a senior aide to George Osborne – but accidentally sent to a newspaper – yesterday divulged plans for a ‘tax free minimum wage’. The details are unclear, but it is thought this would mean that those on the minimum wage would be exempt from paying any income tax – even if its level is raised in future. New plan: The details of George Osborne's leaked plans are unclear, but it is believed to mean that minimum wage earners wouldn' t be paying any income tax . The minimum wage currently stands at £6.50 an hour, rising to £6.70 in October. Labour’s Ed Miliband yesterday pledged that he would help low earners by raising the level above £8 an hour by October 2019. But the Conservatives look set to outflank both Labour and the Lib Dems on the issue of low pay with a firm commitment in their own manifesto, released today. David Cameron said in his speech to the Conservative party conference last year that he wanted to see the threshold for paying income tax – currently £10,600 – go up to £12,500 by April 2020. This will take an extra million people out of income tax altogether, while giving 30million workers a tax cut worth £500 a year. Critique: Danny Alexander said Osborne’s spending plans are 'becoming less and less credible' But if Mr Cameron goes further by also raising the minimum wage – and still keeping everyone on it out of tax – then that would represent a major giveaway. Tax cuts for the low paid are a priority for the Prime Minister after promising to raise the inheritance tax threshold and the 40p rate of tax for those on higher incomes. A text message from Downing Street intended for the Chancellor’s adviser, Neil O’ Brien, read: ‘Hi Neil, Have sent you the tax free min wage press notice draft. Rupert asks if you could print for George in no11?’ Rupert refers to Rupert Harrison, the Chancellor’s most senior economic adviser. The text message ended up being sent to a journalist at The Guardian. It is thought that it refers to a guarantee that, every time the minimum wage rises, its recipients would be protected from paying any income tax. Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said it would be another unfunded spending commitment. He added:‘George Osborne’s spending plans are becoming less and less credible by the day, and it’s embarrassing. ‘They now expect the public to believe them when they make unfunded promises with one hand, whilst decimating family budgets and public services with the other.’ Harriet Harman, deputy leader of the Labour party, said: ‘The Tories are making panicky promises with absolutely no idea how they will pay for them.’ Mr Miliband yesterday brought forward by one year his pledge to increase the minimum wage to £8. He also promised to enforce it more effectively with higher fines for offending firms.","Osborne accidentally divulged plans for a ‘tax free minimum wage’

"A size 28 woman who was a bridesmaid three times is celebrating shedding six stone - and is planning to walk down the aisle as a bride. Frankie Ruttledge, from Strensall, Yorkshire, weighed 18 stone 7lbs and had struggled with her weight all her life before dieting to a svelte size 10/12. The 24-year-old, who has been a 'fat bridesmaid' three times, ditched her diet of crisps for breakfast, pork pies for lunch and frozen pizza for dinner and dropped to 12 stone in less than two years. Frankie, pictured left at her Mum's wedding in 2010, always thought of herself as the 'fat bridesmaid' however she has now lost six stone and is looking forward to her own wedding . And now the Slimming World consultant is just one year away from walking down the aisle for a fourth time - to marry the love of her life Luke Haynes, 24. Frankie said: 'I have always been bigger - as a child I was always the biggest in my class. I just ate rubbish and had a really poor diet. I ate a lot of pasties and sausage rolls. 'I didn't think I'd ever be different. But then in September 2012 my sister asked me to be her bridesmaid and I promised her I would lose weight for her wedding. 'I wanted to look good for her wedding, but I just kept getting bigger and bigger - I couldn't shift the weight. Frankie poses with her fiance Luke Haynes, the pair are planning to marry next year and Frankie hopes to wear a size ten dress . 'It wasn't until that Christmas when my Aunty said to me she was shocked at how big I was, that it actually hit home. It was a bit of a rude awakening for me. I was mortified. 'When I lost the weight I actually sent her a card to say thank you. 'The bridesmaid dress they got for me was a size 28 - I was devastated. But in the end I fitted into a size 16 dress and I felt absolutely amazing that day.' Frankie was the Bridesmaid for many weddings over the years, by 2013 though (left) she had begun to lose weight and wore a size 16 dress for her sister's wedding . Frankie looks pleased as she holds up a pair of her own shorts. She has dropped from a size 22 to a size 10/12 . Frankie, who runs three Slimming World groups, was spurred on to turn her life around after a family member made a comment about how big she had gotten. And after her sister asked her to be a bridesmaid at her wedding - in May 2013 - Frankie gave it her all and watched as the pounds just seemed to drop off. Frankie joined a local Slimming World group and by changing her diet, and going to Zumba and aqua fit classes at the gym, she shed an amazing five stone in the first year. Breakfast: . Nothing. Crisps and dip as a snack later . Lunch: . A pasty or pork pie . Evening Meal: . Frozen pizza or a take away and pints of cider . Breakfast: . Yoghurt, oats and fruit . Lunch: . Stir fry or a Slimming World healthy fry up . Evening: . Homemade chilli or spaghetti bolognese . Frankie was not happy with her size and was spurred on to lose the weight by an aunt who commented that she was 'shocked' at how big she had become . Frankie and Luke lark about with a pair of her old trousers, Frankie was previously a size 22 . And it took her another 12 months to budge the final stone - tipping the scales at a much slimmer 12 stone five pounds before Christmas. Frankie said: 'The weight came off quickly and I just stuck to it. And the more weight I lost, the more I wanted to go to the gym as I didn't want to have any loose skin. 'And now I am just a much healthier person. I will go out for a run or take the dog for a long walk. I still want to lose a bit more but weight loss is an ongoing journey. I still have to work hard at it. 'And my next goal is my own wedding in the summer - I can't wait to walk down the aisle as a size 10 bride. 'My mum and future mother and sister-in-law are slimming too for it so we are all doing it together. It's great for me to see how my weight loss has had an impact on so many other people.'","Frankie Ruttledge was always the 'fat bridesmaid' for her friends .

"An extraordinary image has emerged of what appears to be a cloud formation that draws uncanny similarities to an Aussie Digger wearing a slouch hat. The photo was taken by Brad Allan in Cape York, far north Queensland, as he was heading out fishing at the break of dawn when something caught his eye. Mr Allan, from the Archer River Roadhouse, says the image is quite fitting considering the upcoming centenary of Anzac Day. The 50-year-old describes it as 'the sunrise digger who's been watching over us for 100 years'. An extraordinary image has emerged of what appears to be a cloud formation that draws uncanny similarities to an Aussie Digger in a slouch hat . It was Easter Monday morning when Mr Allan decided to take the boat out to Weipa, a town in Cape York which is north west of Cairns, when he captured the amazing image. 'I was going out fishing at about 5.45am in the morning with my wife and some mates when I looked out at the horizon,' he said. 'I saw the remnants of a storm cloud which oddly looked like a soldier in a slouch hat. 'I quickly took out my phone and grabbed a few shots of the clouds before it changed in the space of five minutes. I guess I was at the right place at the right time.' The image was taken about two weeks before the 100th anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli. 'For those with a bit of an imagination, if you look closely at the clouds you can almost see facial features like a nose and moustache. It's quite eerie but I think it's also quite fitting considering it's the centenary of Gallipoli,' Mr Allan said. 'It's almost like the sunrise digger who's been watching over us for 100 years.' An Australian soldier stand during a ceremony for Anzac Day last year . This comes as travellers heading to Anzac Day events overseas have been urged to heed safety warnings and get insurance. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said more than 15,000 Australians planned to attend overseas events commemorating the centenary of Anzac Day, with services in Turkey, France, Belgium, Malaysia, Thailand and Papua New Guinea. She said the 100th anniversary of Gallipoli was a significant event for all Australians. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said normal security precautions were in place at Gallipoli. He wouldn't confirm reports Australian spies and special forces personnel had been sent to Turkey amid fears of a terrorist attack. He said appropriate security measures were in place for an international event of this scale. The government has prepared a series of Anzac Day traveller bulletins online. For all destinations, the government urges travellers to take out travel insurance and register on the Smartraveller website. For Turkey, travellers should have a high degree of caution because of the threat of terrorist attack. Anyone travelling to Turkey will need to obtain a visa and only those with attendance passes will be able to attend the official 2015 commemorations. For Anzac Day events in France and Belgium, travellers are advised to exercise normal safety precautions.","The photo was taken on Easter Monday morning at sunrise in Queensland .

"In custody: Dana Marie McKinnon, 24, has been charged with DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide in the 2013 accident that killed an Orlando businessman . A 24-year-old Florida woman has been arrested in connection to a 2013 drunken-driver crash that killed the CEO of a defense contractor. Dana Marie McKinnon, of Oviedo, was taken into custody Tuesday on charges of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide. She is being held at the Orange County Jail on $10,150 bail. According to Florida Highway Patrol, McKinnon, then a 21-year-old student at University of Central Florida, was under the influence of alcohol when she slammed into the vehicle of 42-year-old Orlando businessman Vihn Vo on the morning of May 18, 2013. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene, despite Good Samaritans' desperate efforts to save him. Officials say McKinnon was driving east along Lake Pickett Road at around 5.30am when she lost control of her 2008 Mitsubishi Eclipse while trying to navigate a curve in the road. The college student crossed into the westbound lane and slammed head on into Vihn Vo's 2009 Toyota Sienna minivan, causing both vehicles to spin out. A couple who were on their way to Melbourne that morning stopped at the scene of the crash and rushed to Vihn Vo's aid.

"Ed Miliband’s US adviser pays no tax in Britain on his reported £300,000 salary, he has admitted.

But speaking in the US where he is promoting his autobiography, Mr Axelrod revealed he is not resident for tax purposes in the UK. Asked whether he pays tax in Britain, he told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I don’t do my accounting so I don’t know but I’m not in residence there.’ Labour confirmed it pays Mr Axelrod in dollars through his consultancy firm and that he ‘lives in the US, works in the US and pays taxes in the US’. Hired by the Labour leader: Mr Axelrod (right) has helped refine Ed Miliband’s message about tackling the cost of living and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share . Mr Axelrod makes infrequent visits to the UK to meet Mr Miliband and also offers advice by phone. Mr Miliband made his crackdown on those do not pay tax on their foreign earnings a key pledge in his manifesto. Some remain ‘non-domiciled’ for tax despite spending most of their time in the UK but others, critics of Mr Miliband have claimed, are genuinely only in the country for short periods. Labour frontbenchers have expressed concerns that despite his high salary, Mr Axelrod has been ‘invisible’ ahead of polling day. His biography does not mention his work for Mr Miliband. It is understood that Lynton Crosby, the Conservatives’ Australian election chief, pays full taxes on his earnings in both the UK and Australia, however he is currently working full-time in the UK. David Axelrod: Two presidential triumphs in the US . Behind David Axelrod's self-confessed 'tired and rumpled' appearance lies one of the sharpest political brains of his generation. He won fame in the US after helping to convince Americans to pick their first black president in 2008 and then helped Barack Obama's re-election four years later. But the two presidential triumphs are only the highest profile in a string of Democrat successes that have made the 60-year-old New Yorker a back room political superstar. It began 30 years ago when, fresh from quitting his job as the youngest ever political editor of the Chicago Tribune, he helped oust a three-term Republican senator for Illinois. Three years later, he was a key member of the team that helped re-elect Chicago's first black mayor Harold Washington. But he has not been as successful in Europe. Former Italian prime minister Mario Monti secured only 10.5 per cent of the vote in Italy in 2013 despite the guru's advice.","David Axelrod masterminded two Obama presidential election victories .

"A union plumber, a school teacher and a survivor of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre were among the 19 women and five men chosen to serve as jurors in the death penalty trial of Colorado theater shooter James Holmes. The 12 jurors and 12 alternates were chosen on Tuesday in in Arapahoe County District Court after a selection process that began on January 20, and which experts said was among the largest and most complicated in U.S. history. Holmes is charged with shooting dead 12 people and wounding 70 others in the July 2012 attack at a Century movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight screening of the film The Dark Knight Rises. Aurora theater shooting suspect James Holmes (pictured on June 4, 2013) is seated in court in Centennial, Colorado. Jury selection in the Colorado theater shooting case entered its final stage on Monday . Police and residents visit the makeshift memorial at the scene of the Aurora movie theater massacre in Colorado in July 2012 . His attorneys don't dispute that he pulled the trigger but say he was in the grips of a psychotic episode when he slipped into the packed movie theater and opened fire. Jurors will decide whether he was legally insane at the time. If they find him guilty, they must also decide whether he should be put to death or sentenced to life in prison without parole. THE JURORS . All 24 jurors - 19 women and five men - will sit through the entire trial. Neither the group nor the public will know who is a primary juror and who is an alternate until the case is handed over for deliberations. Also on the jury are a Denver Public Schools employee, a person with depression and a businesswoman who cares for her elderly parents. A lawyer, a gas station attendant, a military veteran and an active-duty service member were also selected, according to The Denver Post. The Post also reported that one female juror selected was a plumber who was diagnosed with ADHD. She said during the selection process that she knew what it was like 'to be a little bit different'. Another female juror said her daughter had gone to see the Batman movie on the same night as the shooting but at a different theater. One juror said during questioning, before she was chosen, that she was nervous what her community would think of her verdict. The case is 'big and serious, and it's going to have a huge impact on me and everyone else, the defendant and people in the community,' she said. 'They're not going to be directly involved, but they're going to be watching.' LINE OF QUESTIONING . Attorneys on Tuesday questioned the 93 remaining jurors about their interpretations of the law, how they would gauge witnesses' and experts' credibility, and whether they could handle serving on such a high-profile trial. District Attorney George Brauchler characterized it as a 'four- to five-month roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine'. He asked prospective jurors if they could serve even if they hear no evidence of a motive, since prosecutors are required to prove only the 165 charges against Holmes — not why they believe he committed the crimes. Holmes' attorney, Tamara Brady, focused on perceptions of Holmes and whether the jury candidates could be objective given the litany of charges against him and the public scrutiny they will face. She asked how they felt listening for nearly two hours as Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. read a list of the charges, including each victim's name. She wondered if prospective jurors would be too sympathetic to survivors. She said she was nervous 'about whether Mr. Holmes can get a fair trial in this case or whether it's just too big'. JURORS' CONCERNS . Potential jurors told attorneys they worry about what their neighbors might think if they reach an unpopular verdict and whether reporters would harass their families. One man said he was reassured when the judge told him steps were taken to shield his identity. And many pledged they would not let their decision-making be influenced by concern about what others think. Other candidates expressed trepidation about hearing graphic testimony and perhaps being overwhelmed by emotion. WHAT'S TAKEN SO LONG? Some prospective jurors have asked the judge why it has taken nearly three years for the case to come to trial. Samour has said it's not an unusual amount of time for a trial this complex. The death penalty and insanity plea introduced complicated and time-consuming legal requirements. After nearly three months, and almost three years since the mass shooting, the jurors were chosen from among hundreds who filled out written questionnaires, then returned for one-on-one sessions, where they were questioned about their views on the death penalty and mental illness. Court officials initially summoned an unprecedented 9,000 people. WHAT ABOUT OTHER LARGE TRIALS? In the amount of time it has taken so far in Denver, federal jurors in Boston convicted marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. That case was accelerated by Tsarnaev's admission that he participated in the April 2013 bombings and that his brother, Tamerlan, was the mastermind. The Texas trial for the killer of a former Navy SEAL depicted in the movie 'American Sniper' was complicated by publicity about the film. But jury selection moved quickly because it didn't involve concerns about the large number of people affected by the crime. WHAT'S NEXT? The chosen jurors will report to court the afternoon of April 27 for opening statements. People enter and leave the Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial on Monday where the jury for the trial of James Holmes were selected. Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and wounding 70 others in the July 2012 attack at a movie theater in suburban Denver .","The 12 jurors and 12 alternates were chosen on Tuesday after a selection process that began on January 20 .

"A lack of iron, especially in women, is known to trigger hair loss, possibly because it means less oxygen is delivered to the hair follicle, but should you take iron pills to treat it? ‘This is a bit of a moot point,’ says Dr Vicky Jolliffe, a consultant dermatologist at the Royal London Hospital and a specialist in hair loss. ‘There is published evidence for and against it. All I can say is that in my practice I see lots of girls with low ferritin levels [stored iron rather than iron in your blood], who shed hair and stop shedding once you correct the ferritin level.’ Meal: Eating protein with every meal is vital to strong, healthy hair, as hair consists of protein, experts say . Sally-Ann Tarver, a former president of the Trichological Society now based at The Cotswold Trichology Centre, recommends Florisene pills (£15.95, lambertshealthcare.co.uk), which contain iron, because these don’t seem to cause the digestive irritation linked to standard pills. But Professor Andrew Messenger, a consultant dermatologist at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, says that while there are many supplements claiming to help promote hair growth, very few have strong evidence to support them. Two years ago, a clinical trial looked into the efficacy of the supplement Viviscal (£29.99, Boots). The study involved 63 women: 33 took the supplement, 30 a placebo. After six months, the hairs in those taking the supplement had increased in width by an average of 7 per cent compared with the placebo group, which were unchanged. However, Professor Messenger remains unconvinced. ‘As far as I am aware, this study has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal and did not appear to look at other parameters, such as hair density,’ he says. ‘Whether a 7 per cent increase in hair diameter can be reliably measured is doubtful, as is whether it is clinically significant.’ Research found women with increased hair-shedding responded well to iron supplements . It might be worth checking your protein intake. As Philip Kingsley, a trichologist, explains: ‘Hair consists of protein, so eating sufficient protein is vital to strong, healthy hair.’ He suggests having protein at every meal. A good diet including protein is certainly important, says Dr Jolliffe. She points to the fact that those with anorexia or a very low BMI suffer from hair loss. ‘However, I am not sure I can justify saying you need to eat protein at every meal,’ she says. There is some evidence that an amino acid (or protein building block) called l-lysine may play a role in hair loss. A review published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Dermatology found that women with increased hair-shedding responded well to l-lysine and iron supplements (l-lysine is thought to help the body to absorb iron). L-lysine is found in particularly large concentrations in poultry and fish, but it is also in smaller amounts in soy and eggs. However, supplements or dietary changes won’t pay dividends overnight. ‘It usually takes more than two months for the hair follicles to begin to benefit from dietary changes and as hair only grows half an inch a month, it may take as long as six months before you begin to notice any changes,’ says Philip Kingsley. ‘But stick with it because perseverance pays off.’ The caffeine in Alpecin caffeine liquid hair energiser (£7.49 for 200ml, from chemists) is said to stimulate weakened hair roots. But does it work? Professor Andrew Messenger says that a study published last year shows caffeine can stimulate human hair growth in vitro, ie in a test tube. There have also been studies showing caffeine is absorbed quickly through hair follicles, suggesting it could be active when used in a shampoo formulation. What is lacking is good clinical trial data showing an effect in vivo, ie in people, he says. ‘Interestingly, minoxidil, which does prevent hair loss in men, has no effect on hairs growing in a test tube, but does in vivo.’","Trichologist Philip Kingsley says hair consists of protein so eating it is key .
He adds that dietary changes and supplements won't pay off overnight .

"Children caught throwing rocks at police in the Northern Territory will be removed from their families if their parents don't 'get off the grog' and bring them home, the local government has warned. The Northern Territory’s Chief Minister Adam Giles and Minister for Children and Families John Elferink made the threat after a recent rise in youth crime in Alice Springs surrounding the Easter holidays. ‘I’m giving the parents of the children responsible for this spate of violence a very clear message. Get your kids off the streets. Get them back to communities and back into school,’ Mr Giles said. Mr Elferink threatened: ‘If parents don’t want to see their children in care then they need to get off the grog and head back to their home community.’ In a media statement titled ‘strong consequences for Alice Springs rock throwers’ the government stated ‘the current situation would not be tolerated’. ‘These children will be regarded as requiring protection and we will take immediate action. Parents should not doubt our resolve to do this,’ Mr Giles added. Northern territory’s Chief Minister Adam Giles said parents should not doubt his 'resolve' to take their children into the hands of child protection services . Parents will also be fined $298 if their child is found on the streets during school hours. The manager of Jesuit Social Services in Alice Springs, John Adams, told ABC radio the government's announcement was a 'knee-jerk' reaction. 'Removing kids is never the best response to such an issue,' he said. On Monday night, 42 people were taken into protective custody and 34 young people were driven home after a group of 50 young people threw ‘large rocks’ at police. Northern Territory Police Superintendent Travis Wurst said none of the group have been identified but ‘the main protagonist of the incident is described as a male aged in his late teens/early twenties, of Aboriginal appearance.’ On Tuesday night no rocks were thrown at police but 34 people were taken into protective custody and 77 youths were conveyed home, while three youths were arrested for trespassing.

On Wednesday night, the crime spree appeared to calm. A Northern Territory police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘We only received couple of reports of rock throwing near Anzac Hill and no reports of damage.’ There were 29 youths driven home by police as officers stepped up their police presence to deter anti-social behaviour. Superintendent Wurst said: ‘The reduction of property damage and rock throwing is encouraging and police will continue to target anti-social behaviour to ensure a safe environment for the people of Alice Springs.’ A NT Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘No police officers have been harmed by the rock throwing.’ 'No police officers have been harmed by the rock throwing,' a NT police spokesperson said . They said incidences of rock throwing had calmed down and that it wasn't a ‘regular occurrence’. ‘It’s more since the Easter Holidays and the carnival has been here,’ the police spokesperson said. Minister  Elferink, who is in Alice Springs assessing the situation, said: ‘I have directed my department to take strong action and take children into care where the legal grounds are met. 'Normally the department would see this as a last resort and be willing to work with parents but these are not normal circumstances.’ ‘Gangs of youth throwing rocks at police officers is not normal and is illegal.

"A plus-size model who once earned up to £2,000 a day has found herself out of work after dropping three dress sizes. Rebecca Exton-Russell, 37, was formally a size 18 and posed in campaigns for major brands including Marks & Spencer, QVC and Dove. But the Derby-based model was secretly 'repulsed' by her body, so she checked into a military-style fitness camp and lost just over two stone in two months - going down from 14 stone to just below 12 stone. Transformed: Rebecca Exton-Russell, 37, pictured before (left) and after (right) her weight loss, was formally a size 18 and posed in campaigns for major brands including Marks & Spencer, QVC and Dove . Rebecca lost a further stone herself after she left No 1 Boot Camp in Norfolk - a reality TV star favourite - dropping to 11 stone, and slipping into size 12 outfits. 'I really don't mind losing all the work I once had at all because I am so much happier as a slimmer person,' she says. Indeed, getting the toned stomach she had always craved meant her work completely dried up. Rebecca was now was too slim to fit into any of the outfits her clients expected her to wear. 'I realised that I had lost all this weight but I effectively made myself redundant from my job as a model,' she said. 'I didn't mind because although I was always happy to smile for the cameras, I was desperately unhappy as a size 18. 'I had very little self-esteem and had lost all my confidence. My body repulsed me. I knew that I needed to turn around my life and properly get in shape. The Derby-based model, pictured in a plus-size campaign (left) and as she is today (right), was secretly 'repulsed' by her body, so she checked into a military-style fitness camp and lost three stone . Before she lost the weight, Rebecca, seen in her plus-size prime, scored a number of high profile campaigns, which could earn as much as £2,000 for a day's shoot as a size 16 or size 18 . Impressive results: In spite of this, she knew she would never be happy unless she got into shape once and for all, so she checked into No 1 Boot Camp . 'Now I have the body that I always wanted, I hope to get work as a slimmer model.' For years Rebecca, who is single, was happy to cash in on her fuller figure by working as a plus-size model. She did a number of high profile campaigns which could earn as much as £2,000 for a day's shoot as a size 16 or size 18. Rebecca appeared in promotions for High Street names like Ikea, Perfect Pizza and Butlins, who were keen to target customers of all sizes. But despite her success as a model, Rebecca had been battling her weight for years, fluctuating between 13 and 14 stone. She would often lose weight by following fad diets, but as quickly as she dropped the pounds they would pile back on, which was always good news for her modelling career. In spite of this, Rebecca knew she would never be happy unless she got into shape once and for all, so she checked into No 1 Boot Camp. Rebecca was stunned when she lost 10lbs in her first week at boot camp (pictured) 'That was all the encouragement I needed,' she remarked. 'All the pain I was going through was worth it. The trainers were very strict but very supportive and motivating' Farewell: Rebecca, pictured before she lost the weight, left boot camp and knew immediately that she would never be able to return to her job as plus-size model . Made In Chelsea stars Spencer Matthews and Binky Felstead both lost a stone in a week at the same camp, and Rebecca was at No 1 with James 'Arg' Argent from The Only Way Is Essex, who slimmed down after going through a spell in rehab. 'James was a lovely guy who mucked in with the rest of us and had no airs or graces,' she said. 'It's no surprise that he has lost so much weight because he was prepared to really knuckle down and get in shape.' As for herself, Rebecca was stunned when she lost 10lb in her first week. 'That was all the encouragement I needed,' she remarked. 'All the pain I was going through was worth it. The trainers were very strict but very supportive and motivating.' Rebecca left the camp and knew immediately that she would never be able to return to her job as plus-size model. 'I tried to carry on for a bit but it was never going to be work,' she said. 'All the dresses I was being asked to model were way too big for me. They were hanging off me and I knew that chapter in my life had come to end.' Now Rebecca has set up her own jewellery and gift business, Rebecca Louise, which she runs online and in pop-up shops across the UK. She is launching a new jewellery collection soon which is inscribed with the same self-belief quotes she feels helped her through her own tough times. 'My weight still fluctuates a bit,' Rebecca admits. 'I like to allow myself treats and nights out from time to time, but when I put on three pounds, I know it's time to stop and knuckle down.' Worth it: Rachel, who has kept the weight off, now runs a jewellery business and still hopes to find work as a slimmer model in the future .","Rebecca Exton-Russell, 37, formally weighed 14 stone and was a size 18 .

"Probe: Dr Rory Lyons was suspended by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service and his surgery raided following four deaths 'of concern' The unexpected deaths of two members of a family are at the centre of a criminal probe into their GP. Detectives raided Dr Rory Lyons’ private health centre and medical officials have suspended the 62-year-old from treating patients. Cousins Karen and Colin Cosheril were patients of the Alderney family doctor when they died. Islanders claim the death from pneumonia of Karen, 52, in January prompted the investigation, which then uncovered three more deaths of concern – including that of retired stonemason Colin, 63, who died of heart failure in May. Mr Cosheril’s sister – ambulance technician Brenda Webb – said she complained to Guernsey’s health service after his sudden death. The mother-of-two, 61, said: ‘His death was very sudden. It was a shock. My brother was getting well one day and the next day he went downhill too quickly – the day after that he was dead.’ A family friend of divorcee Karen Cosheril, who used to work at the island’s Chinese takeaway, said: ‘Just before she died there didn’t seem to be anything wrong with her. Then she phoned me and said she was in hospital. 'The next day I got a call saying she had died from pneumonia and I thought, “That is sudden isn’t it?” It was strange because that usually takes time.’ A family member said of Miss Cosheril, who was also known by her married name of Tayleur, said: ‘Her death is one of those being investigated. We were in complete shock when we heard.’ More than 10 Guernsey police officers flew to the island to search Dr Lyons’ Eagle Medical Practice last Thursday. The surgery remained shut over the Easter weekend. A note referring patients to the other island practice was pinned to the door and signed by Dr Lyons, who also worked at the island’s care home. The father-of-two lives in Alderney with his wife. The blinds of their home were shut over the weekend but he was spotted at a flat close to the surgery in the town of St Anne’s. He has not responded to requests for comment. Medical records and other documents were seen being taken from his surgery during the five-hour police search. A search warrant was also executed at a private address. A spokesman for Guernsey’s Health and Social Services Department said the investigation was launched when concerns were raised about a death earlier in the year. The police were then informed after an internal investigation identified the three other potentially suspicious deaths. All four patients died in the past 18 months. Relatives: Cousins Karen and Colin Cosheril were patients of the Alderney family doctor when they died. Karen, 52, left, died in January of pneumonia and Colin, 63, right, died of heart failure in May last year . Family liaison officers have also been sent to the island to help relatives of the deceased. Guernsey Chief of Police Patrick Rice said: ‘This decisive early action was necessary to ensure the protection of the public. 'The community will be understandably concerned by news of this investigation. It will be complex and take time to establish the full facts.’ Dr Lyons was suspended by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service following a hearing on Thursday. Before moving to the island, he worked and lived in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was a part-time GP. Alderney – which has fewer than 2,000 inhabitants and is just three miles long – has two medical practices, with four GPs, and a 20-bed hospital where GPs treat their own patients. All services are run privately outside the NHS.","Detectives raided Dr Rory Lyons’ private health centre in Alderney .

"A Turkish teenager returned home from work to find his entire family were dead from suspected food poisoning. Abdulkadir Zeyat, 45, his 43-year-old wife Antika, and their six children were all discovered at their house in the village of Alintepe in the country's eastern Agri Province. Turkish authorities believe the family, which included siblings as young as three-years-old, died of  food poisoning. Kemal Zeyat, 19, had returned from work to his family home to find his six younger siblings (two of whom are pictured and his parents were dead . Mr and Mrs Zeyat, and six of their children (one of whom is pictured) are thought to have died from food poisoning or exposure to poisonous gas from a gas cylinder used by the family for lightning purposes . Other theories suggested that the tragic deaths may have been down to a possible poisonous gas leak from a cylinder they kept for lighting. purposes. The only survivor was the couple's eldest son, Kemal Zeyat, 19, who had been out at work in the north-western city of Istanbul. He is now receiving counselling to try to come to terms with the devastating loss. Tragically, father Mr Zeyat - who would normally have been working away from home - had  popped home to see his family when he too became a victim of the gas leak or food poisoning and died. The bodies of the family were found at the Turkish home (pictured being attended by police) by neighbours who became concerned after they noticed the house had been unusually quiet . Friends and neighbours called an ambulance but the family was pronounced dead at the scene. Kemal is now receiving counselling for the tragedy . The shocking discovery was made by the Zeyat family's neighbours. Residents nearby had been concerned after they noticed the house and yard - usually filled with children laughing and playing - was eerily silent. When they went to check if everything was ok, they discovered the bodies of the children, aged between 3 and 18 years old, and of the parents. Neighbour Ates Demir, 43, said: 'Nobody answered the door, so we broke it down. They looked so peaceful, lying there as if they were asleep, but they didn't wake up and we couldn't see any signs of breathing. 'We called an ambulance but all they could do was to confirm everyone was dead.' An investigation is currently under way into the cause of their deaths, according to village head Idris Ceri, 59. The bodies have been taken to Doğubayazit State Hospital's morgue for autopsy.","Abdulkadir Zeyat, wife Antika, and six children were discovered at home .

"Leanna Norris (pictured during her trial) admitted killing her young daughter . A mother who drugged her young daughter with allergy medicine before smothering her to death has been jailed for 37 years. Leanna Norris, 25, of Auburn,  plied two-year-old Loh Grenada with Benedryl to make her sleep before by covering her mouth and nose with duct tape and a blanket, a court heard. The body was found in the front seat of her car in Stetson, Maine, on June 24, 2013. Assistant Attorney General Deb Cashman said Norrishad committed the murder to stop her ex-boyfriend, the father of her child, dating other women. 'She did not want (his new girlfriends) mothering her child,' reported the Bangor Daily News. Norris wept as she told the Judge: 'I want it to be known that I'm sorry to everyone that I have hurt,' reported the newspaper. 'All I ever wanted was for her to be safe and us to be together forever.' The court heard that Norris had suffered from mental health problems including depression, and had tried to commit suicide after she killed her daughter. But Superior Court Justice Ann Murray had rejected Norris' insanity defense and found her guilty. Norris admitted to investigators that on the evening of June 23, 2013, she drove her daughter, Loh Melody Grenda, to Durham Bridge Road in Newport and gave her three times the normal dose of an antihistamine. She put duct tape over the girl’s mouth and nose, then smothered her with a blanket so she would not have to watch her die, according to the trial testimony. The mother then drove to a cemetery in Stetson and took the rest of the antihistamine and swallowed 200 Advil pills in a suicide attempt. Norris told police that she had broken up with Loh’s father and he had threatened to try to get sole custody of the girl. Norris, 25, had drugged two-year-old Loh Grenada (pictured) then covered her mouth and nose with duct tape . Cowardly act: The court heard that Norris allegedly had covered her daughter with a blanket while she smothered her so she 'would not have to look at Loh's eyes' Martha Harris, who is representing Norris, told the courtroom that her client was depressed and had both anxiety and mood disorders last year, according to the newspaper. Norris' ex-boyfriend Michael Grenda, who was the father to two-year-old Loh Grenda, testified about the parents' estranged relationship, according to the newspaper. His testimony reportedly included that the couple's verbal disputes led to police being dispatched on multiple occasions -- and though Grenda broke up with Norris on June 16, 2013, the two agreed to stay and parent in the same residence. Norris' digital communications with different men stopped a potential reunion, he also said, according to Bangor Daily News. Grenda reportedly recounted his telling Norris on June 23 'that was the end of everything' - and then 'She became very upset. She was crying and smashing her head against the wall.' The 27-year-old's testimony also reportedly revealed that Norris cooled off that morning through his help, he left the home in the afternoon, and found out what happened to Loh Grenda on June 24. Suicidal: Leanna Norris allegedly asked for a gun after her daughter's death in order to take her own life . Testimony: Assistant Attorney General Deb Cashman said Norris knowingly committed the murder and 'did not want Mike dating other women and did not want them mothering her child . The suspect's father Steven Norris said he received a 2.27am phone call on June 24 from his daughter, in which she admitted to killing Loh. He then contacted the authorities while Norris was one the phone with her mother. Norris later turned up at her parents' home with the dead body inside the car. He told the court she had been feeling suicidal and had asked for a gun, according to the Bangor Daily News. Her affidavit by Maine State Police Detective Thomas Pickering said she offered 'two or three syringes of Benadryl to make [Loh Grenda] go to sleep.' 'Leanna Norris put black Gorilla [duct] tape on Loh Grenda's mouth and nose; that Leanna Norris put a blanket over Loh Grenda's face so she would not have to look at Loh's eyes,' the affidavit reportedly said. ' Leanna Norris said that she killed Loh Grenda; that Leanna Norris put her hand over Loh Grenda's face and suffocated her.' Judge: Superior Court Justice Ann Murray is pictured at the bench during the trial at Penobscot Judicial Center, Bangor . Assistant Attorney General Leann Zainea appears for the prosecution (left) across from defense attorney Martha Harris (right) Norris said she took the tape off 'so it would not look so horrible', the affidavit is said to reveal. Later at a Stetson cemetery was 'where [Leanna Norris] took pills and put tape on her face in order to kill herself,' the affidavit also reportedly said. But, after vomiting, the 24-year-old allegedly called her father, Steven Norris, and then drove to his house, where he discovered his granddaughter dead under a blanket. Norris, who had asked to be tried without a jury, had told the judge that she didn't set out to kill her daughter and her defense asked for the minimum sentence of 25 years. But Mr Grenada, Loh's father, had branded the request 'a joke' and recommended a 45 term for the 'premeditated' killing. Justice Murray sentenced Norris to 37 years in prison after taking into account the child's suffering and her mother's mental illness.","Leanna Norris admitted killing her  daughter Loh Grenada, 2, in June 2013 .

"A stunning bride rode to her wedding on the horse she saved from dying of starvation. Sally White, 28, rescued the terrified animal from a bleak hillside where he was abandoned without food and water.

She says: 'I rode him to church and I even had a model of Miller on my wedding cake,' The RSPCA were called in to rescue the 15.2 hands cob abandoned in a field in Swansea, South Wales, three years ago . Sally's dramatic entrance at the church was slightly ruined when it poured with rain - putting a dampener on the wedding pictures. So she put her white wedding gown on again a week later and brought in a specialist equine photographer to take the stunning snaps which she will treasure forever. The RSPCA were called in to rescue the 15.2 hands cob abandoned in a field in Swansea, South Wales, three years ago. He was malnourished, had severe anaemia and struggled to stand up because he was so weak. Miller was taken to the RSPCA's Gonsal Farm Equine Welfare and Rehabilitation Centre in Shrewsbury where Sally works as a groom - and it was love at first sight. Sally said: 'He was in a terrible state after being abandoned in a field with no water and only brambles to eat. When Sally first found Miller his ribs were poking through and vets feared he would not survive more than a few days . 'I adopted him and after a lot of tender love and care he put his weight back on and turned out to be a very good pupil.' Sally trained the six-year-old horse in the arts of dressage and she now competes with him in the British championships. She said: 'He took to dressage straight away - he's won lots of rosettes and everywhere he goes people love him. He's become a real star. 'He was on his best behaviour for my wedding day and when we took the photographs later he just looked perfect. I felt very proud.' The RSPCA hope Miller's story will encourage others to adopt mistreated horses, ponies and donkeys. Gareth Johnson, the RSPCA's equine rehoming officer for Wales, said: 'Sally has worked hard with Miller and his transformation has been fantastic. 'I am delighted that he has been given a completely new life with Sally and it is lovely to see them both together.'","Sally White, 28, rescued the terrified animal from a bleak hillside .

"Police in Georgia say a man shot an armadillo, but ended up accidentally wounding his 74-year-old mother-in-law when the bullet ricocheted off the animal's shell. Lee County Sheriff's deputies said that 54-year-old Larry McElroy fired his 9mm pistol at the animal on Sunday night when he saw the vermin in his Leesburg backyard. While one bullet killed the armadillo, deputies say another bounced off the armored animal, hit a fence, traveled through the back door of the mother-in-law's mobile home and the recliner she was sitting in and struck her in the back. According to police reports, McElroy fired 100-yards away from Johnson's home. Accident: Larry McElroy shot Carol Johnson on Sunday night after he tried to kill an armadillo in his backyard . McElroy's mother-in-law, Carol Johnson suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was talking all the way to the hospital. 'Just the circumstances, just all the way around, the whole situation was unusual,' said Investigator Bill Smith to WALB.Com. 'She was walking around on her own power and talking,' said Smith. 'It didn't appear to be too severe. They took her to Phoebe North hospital.' Unusual: Lee County Sheriff's investigator, Bill Smith advised Mr. McElroy to use a shotgun the next time he wanted to kill an armadillo . Battle hardened: Armadillo's are known for their armored shells which protect them in the wild against bears and wild cats . Lee County Sheriff's department said they recommend using a shotgun to kill vermin. 'I really think if they're going to shoot at varmints and whatnot, maybe use a shotgun.. with a spread pattern with a lot less range,' Smith said.","Larry McElroy shot his 74-year-old mother-in-law Carol Johnson on Sunday .

"An Italian former policeman has been found guilty of raping a 16-year-old Australian girl after luring her to his home via a couch-surfing website. Dino Maglio, who is on trial in Padua, northern Italy, was sentenced to six and a half years in prison on Tuesday after the girl reported being drugged and raped while staying at his home. Prosecutors said Maglio spiked a glass of Baileys liqueur the girl was drinking with a tranquilliser pill. Maglio claimed sex with the girl, who was under-age at the time, was consensual but admitted he was ‘stupid’ to spike her drink. Boris Dubini, who represents the teenager, says Maglio's claim that the sex was consensual was nonsense given the tranquilliser he gave her turned her into a 'rag doll' and she couldn't resist. Former Italian police officer Dino Maglio (pictured right) has been found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl . Maglio was ordered to pay €60,000 ($83,000) to the victim and €15,000 ($20,000) to her mother, who was travelling with her at the time, the Guardian reports. The Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPO) carried out a year-long investigation into Maglio, collecting 14 testimonies from women who claimed they were assaulted by him after using the host-a-traveller website to arrange accommodation. The policeman was accused of using the name of Leon on Couchsurfing.com. The case has raised safety concerns surrounding the social networking site, which puts travellers in touch with hosts who are willing to put them up and show them around their home-towns for free. It has been linked to several alleged sexual assaults over the years, including the rape of a Hong Kong tourist in Leeds, according to the Guardian. The 35-year-old has admitted drugging her with a tranquilliser and having sex, even though he knew she was under-age . Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liqueur belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason' The website's chief executive, Jennifer Billock, told the newspaper users' safety was a top priority and it was constantly 'evolving our tools and processes to find and halt abusers of our system'. It is believed that Maglio had told one alleged victim he closed his profile because he had so many positive reviews he had to open a new one. The IRPO’s investigation revealed a man who made himself seem like a fun and fast-living host. Some alleged victims claim he would constantly compliment them and insist they drink while they were out together and on the first or second night say they were served drinks of tea or wine. They did not report feeling unsafe as they were not travelling alone but in separate incidents from March 2013 until March 2014, the women recalled feeling suddenly 'woozy and intensely tired'. Maglio told investigators the sex was consensual and that he had joined Couchsurfing to improve his English, as he believed it would help further his career. In a victim statement, one Canadian woman alleged she had tried to rouse three other female visitors staying at Maglio's after she discovered them passed out before falling unconscious herself. Dino Maglio's Couchsurfing profile page listed his name as Leon Padova and showed his occupation as a policeman . Dino Maglio used Couchsurfing.com to entice a 16-year-old girl to his home before drugging her and raping her, it has been alleged. Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year jail term . She added that she had hazy memories of being kissed and fondled by Maglio but was unable to protest. Others feared they had been slipped the drugged and were unsure if anything had happened while they were passed out. Three young woman from Czech Republic also said they had been unable to recall what happened after staying at the defendant's home and drinking his wine. They claim they had brief flashes of being kissed and touched by Maglio and vomited when they woke up. Another traveller from Hong Kong claimed she was unconscious after drinking his alcohol and posted a negative review on his Couchsurfing profile. The next day he allegedly sent her a threatening message over Facebook demanding she remove it and said that if she refused he would use his authority as a police officer to create 'trouble' for her on her next visit to Europe. 'It took me some days to realise I was sexually abused,' the alleged victim told IRPI. 'So I wrote to him on Facebook. I asked him what happened and he admitted we had sex. I felt like a whore. I felt nobody would ever want me again after this.' The alleged attacks came to light after the women connected on the website to share their experiences. When his home was searched officers found a gun and a large amount of pornography and child abuse images, according to the Guardian. Court papers showed he was also hosting two other Couchsurfing tourists at the time - with one showing the same 'sickness' as other alleged victims. More than a dozen women have since come forward after finding his profile on the social network and staying at his flat in the picturesque city of Padua in northern Italy .

"It seems like an idyllic smattering, with nothing more to worry about than sun, sea, sand and where the next cocktail is coming from. But one organisation is asking tourists to investigate before heading to the exclusive holiday destination to ensure they are not visiting a resort associated with human rights abuses. Known for pristine beaches and crystal clear water, the Maldives has recently come under scrutiny after the country's former president, Mohammad Nasheed, was found guilty of terrorism charges earlier this year. Ethical Maldives Alliance is encouraging tourists to boycott 'high risk' resorts linked to human rights abuses . Now, the Ethical Maldives Alliance is encouraging tourists to consider the instability in the region when booking their accommodation. The Alliance has crafted a list of over 100 well-known hotels and is urging visitors to consult the guide before travelling. Although very little detail is provided when it comes to the Alliance's rationale for dubbing certain resorts to be 'high risk,' it has colour-coded the hotels into three categories. Those to be avoided are labelled red, those coded as green are considered to be 'low risk' and orange hued businesses are 'under consideration.' 'While okay to visit in the short term, there is a possibility that they will be on the 'to avoid' list in the longer term,' the website reads. 'Therefore, early reservations for visits later in the year should be avoided.' The group claims that the 'red' or 'orange' resorts are directly or indirectly linked to human rights abuses. Hotels are coded as 'low risk,' 'high risk, or 'under consideration' depending on their ties to corruption . By boycotting, the alliance hopes that tourists will help to make a difference in protecting and promoting democracy, while not adversely effecting the Maldivian economy. 'With a long and sad history of corruption, political oppression and human rights abuses, Maldives' first attempts at democratic reform are now faltering,' a statement on the Alliance's website reads. Crime is reportedly on the rise as a result of support for 'extreme gangs,' which are supported by police to suppress any dissent. 'Uncontrolled corruption starting at the very top of all branches of government filters down through all levels of society, making life very difficult for the average Maldivian.' Though most resorts are categorised as 'low risk,' Conrad Maldives Rangali Island is listed as one to avoid . While most resorts are categorised as 'low risk,' several top name hotels have been included on the Alliance's list of those to avoid. Among them, the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island. 'Ethical Maldives evaluates resorts and other businesses on ethics-based criteria,' the website reads. 'These include owners' support for governments that perpetuate corruption, intimidation and oppression, measures relevant to the environment and social responsibility.' In response to allegations presented by The Ethical Maldives Association, the High Commission of the Maldives told MailOnline Travel: 'Resorts appear to be categorised not on the basis of any practices in their resorts, but on the basis of alleged links of their owners to the Government of the Maldives. 'With only two resort groups targeted and very little information about the identities of those behind 'The Ethical Maldives Alliance,' it is difficult to discern the true intentions and objectives of the website. 'Over the past months, the Maldives' young democratic institutions have proven themselves in challenging circumstances, while the Government of the Maldives has maintained a positive, engagement-first approach with international stakeholders. 'The Government of the Maldives will always remain committed to promoting development, human rights and the ethical values that we all hold dear.' MailOnline has reached out to both the Ethical Maldives Alliance and a spokesperson for the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island resort for comment.","The organisation has classified over 100 resorts into 'risk' categories .

"Supermarket giant Asda has been forced to recall dummies which could pose a choking risk to newborns for the second time in two years. The chain was alerted to a possible fault in the packs of Little Angels 2 Newborn Soothers 0+ Months after a customer complaint on Facebook. The complainant said that the teat had detached from the hard casing of one of the dummies, although luckily the baby was unharmed. The Asda Little Angels 2 Newborns 0+ dummies, which have been recalled by the supermarket over a potential choking risk . Customers are now been asked to either dispose of the products or return them to an Asda store, where they will be given a full refund. The supermarket said that no other Asda Little Angels dummies had been affected and that the recall was a 'precaution'. It comes after parents were also asked to return packs of the Little Angels Cherry Soother in January 2013, when a fault was identified. Again a choking risk emerged when one dummy came apart in a baby's mouth. An Asda spokesman said: 'These are two isolated incidents involving different products. 'We are yet to conduct our investigation to identify the cause of the problem, but we take any complaints about baby products extremely seriously, which is why we have taken the decision to recall the soothers as a precaution.' The recall is the second that Asda has issued in two years after the Little Angels Cherry Soother dummy was recalled after one came apart in a baby's mouth (file picture) Meanwhile in a notice to customers, the supermarket apologised for any inconvenience caused by the recall of the dummies, which are sold in twin packs. Asda said: 'We have had one customer complaint that the teat has broken away and detached from the hard casing, so we have taken the precaution of taking the product off sale and recalling from customers due to the possible choking risk. 'The care and safety of our customers is out top priority, which is why we are recalling the product even though there has been only one complaint and we are yet to conduct our investigation.' In 2007, the supermarket was also forced to recall 115,000 Chinese-made bottles due to fears the caps could break off. Although no child was hurt drinking from the bottles, which were intended for children aged three and over, the supermarket asked customers to return them for a full refund.","Recall affects packs of Asda branded Little Angels 2 Newborns Soothers .

"Runner: A Short Story About a Long Run . by Lizzy Hawker . (Aurum Press £12.99) Waiting nervously at the starting line of her first 155 km race around Mont Blanc, 29-year-old Lizzy Hawker looked down at her holey long johns, clumpy trail shoes and the poorly fitting rucksack she had borrowed, then up at the elite Lycra kit of her fellow competitors. She had entered the 2005 Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB) on a whim — but now, the reality of the challenge ahead began to sink in. She would be covering almost the same distance as that between her birthplace in the London suburbs and Southampton, where she was studying for a PhD in environmental science. And her slight, 5 ft 4 in body would have to keep lifting those heavy shoes through 8,500m of ascent and descent — equivalent to climbing from sea level to the summit of Everest and back. Some 26 hours, 51 minutes and 51 seconds later, Hawker surprised herself, and everyone else, by becoming the first woman to cross the dark, wet, Alpine finish line that year, coming 24th overall. Lizzy Hawker entered the 2005 Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc  (pictured) on a whim and she's since gone on to become Britain’s most distinctive female ‘ultra runner’ She would go on to become Britain’s most distinctive female ‘ultra runner’, coming first in the UTMB five times, taking gold in the Women’s 100km World Championships in Korea in 2006, setting a new women’s world record for 24 hours on the road in the 2011 Commonwealth Championships and a new course record at the sunbaked 246 km Spartathlon in 2012. But Hawker’s inspirational memoir does not focus on the figures. She’s more interested in why she is able to push herself beyond normal limits, and how running makes her feel. Her book is strong on Buddhist philosophy and the peace that comes with living fully in the now. Raised in Upminster, East London, Hawker says she always felt a profound connection to nature. She became a vegetarian aged five, and knew her future lay in the mountains after her first skiing trip to Zermatt when she was six. Only a few years later, frustrated by the queue for the cable cars, she threw her skis over her shoulders and beat her family back down the mountain. When you ask artists and musicians why they chose their paths, they will often reply that all children love to draw and sing: they just refused to stop. Hawker feels the same about running. Studying at Cambridge and later working for the British Antarctic Survey, she struggled with the hours at her desk and confined on boats. She ran at weekends and after work, clocking an average time in the London Marathon and later winning a race across the fells. But after that first UTMB triumph, Hawker knew she had found her calling and she renounced the world of employment. Sponsorship from The North Face helped fund her travel to races around the world. She owns few possessions, travelling with just clothes, shoes and a laptop. Though running makes Hawker feel ‘beautifully empowered’, it has left her with ‘unbeautiful’ feet. As she writes (from her temporary home in the Himalayas), she faces the possibility of never running again. Six stress fractures to the bones of her legs and feet may end her career. But she ends by quoting Hunter S. Thompson, who believed that: ‘Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out and loudly proclaiming: “Wow! What a ride!” ’","Lizzy Hawker entered the 2005 Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB) on a whim .

When Malia asked her mom about how to park in a public parking lot, the first last admitted she was stumped. 'I barely know now too so I have to check with other sources,' she said. The first lady also discussed a Time magazine article which named Malia and sister Sasha among the 25 Most Influential Teens of 2014. 'I don't know why — they're not influential, they just live here!' she joked. 'They have done nothing to gain any influence.' 'I don't think they even realize that they're influential,' she added.

'How fitting that on the day we celebrate the rising of our Lord and savior, we also welcome our sitting president,' Wesley said, as the congregation rose to their feet in applause. 'This is not selfie time,' Wesley said jokingly. 'Let the brother worship in the house of God.' Churchgoers traditionally walk around to shake hands and give hugs during the greetings and announcements portion of service, but the pastor encouraged the crowd to stay in their seats and greet only their closest neighbors, as the sanctuary was tightly secured with Secret Service agents. The choir - including women in purple dresses and men sporting purple ties - sang a lively rendition of the hymn 'He Lives,' stirring most of the church, filled to capacity, to clap, sing and sway in praise alongside the upbeat organ keys while ushers collected the tithes and offering. Singalong: The family (pictured in the second row of the congregation) joined in with upbeat hymns . People queued around the block for the service in Alexandria, monitored by federal security officers . The lively pastor based his sermon around a scripture from 1 Corinthians 15 on the life and resurrection of Christ. 'Where do you stand in the resurrection of Christ,' he asked. 'You either believe it or reject it.' Wesley said the sacrifices of Christ allowed the congregation to be forgiven for their own sins. 'He took the pain for me. I owe him my life. I owe him my praise. I owe him my hallelujah,' he said.

"Despite countless campaigns, protests and marches, the notion of blaming a victim for their rape remains shockingly high. The biggest myth associated with victim blaming is that women are 'asking for it' because of their choice of dress. A new London based campaign wants to see this myth abolished for good with their #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes movement. A new campaign from Rape Crisis London has captured hundreds of women across London in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped . The initiative, created by Rape Crisis London, aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing. To accompany the hashtag, the campaign has also produced over 2,000 photographs of 200 women in London accompanied by the logo #ThisDoesn'tMeanYes. The images, shot by photographer Perou in Braithwaite Tunnel, aim to demonstrate that no matter what a woman wears she never deserves to be raped and the fault is always with the attacker. On the campaign website, the charity points out the absurdity of placing blame on the victim's clothing. A photographer captured 2,000 pictures of 200 women in London as part of the campaign . The campaign aims to stamp out the myth that women are 'asking for it' because of how they are dressed . They say: 'There's a myth that surrounds women, a myth that embroils them: Women who dress or behave suggestively, women who are playful or who act provocatively, women who flirt or openly discuss sex – they're 'asking for it'.' The charity goes on to explain that women shouldn't have to suppress their individuality in fear of an attack. 'It's an insidious fable, and it needs to stop. 'Every woman has a right to freedom of expression. No woman deserves to be raped for it.' The photos are accompanied by the manifesto which states that no piece of clothing means 'yes' The campaign asks women to join the movement by uploading their images to Instagram using the hashtag . In January this year the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking' 'No one should be able to blame rape on a short skirt. A short skirt can't talk – a short skirt can't say 'yes'. The only yes should be an active and embodied 'yes!'' As well as the 200 photographs produced, the charity have called for other women to join the movement by posting their own photographs on Instagram using the same hashtag. The movement is the latest in an ongoing battle to stamp out victim blaming when it comes to rape. In January this year, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must 'challenge' the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been 'drinking'. In February it was revealed that 20 per cent of people believe victims are partly responsible if they're drunk . It was also revealed that it is the younger generation who are more likely to blame women for their rape . She said: 'For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent – by drinking or dressing provocatively for example. 'It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink.' Just a month later an ONS report – based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which questions thousands of people – found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility. Some 33 per cent of those aged between 16-19 believed that victims were partially responsible for their rape if they were drunk . Some 6 per cent said the victim is 'completely/mostly responsible' if they were drunk. A further 20 per cent said they were 'a little bit responsible'. Two-thirds of respondents said the victim was 'not responsible' and 7 per cent didn't know. A short skirt is not a yes. A red lip is not a yes. A wink is not a yes. A slow dance is not a yes. A walk home is not a yes. A drink back at mine is not a yes. A kiss on the sofa is not a yes. The only 'yes' is a 'yes'. Among those aged 25 to 44, around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible. For those aged 16 to 19, the figure was 33 per cent. Sarah Green, from the campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition, says that the concerning increase for victim blaming appears to be coming from the younger generation. 'We already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped, but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape. 'Young people today are bombarded with confusing messages about men and women and sexuality – women are constantly portrayed as sex objects and it is implied that it is 'natural' for men to pursue women to the point of coercion.'","#ThisDoesn'tMeanYes captured images of 200 women across London .

"Former Northern Territory politician Matthew Gardiner has reportedly been detained at Darwin airport as he returned from Syria, where he is believed to have been fighting the Islamic State. In January the senior NT Labor party figure fled the country with plans to join Kurdish militants - an action which is penalised with life in prison in Australia. He arrived at Darwin airport early on Sunday morning after flying from the Middle East via Sweden and Singapore, according to . Australian Federal Police confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that a man had been detained at the airport. 'The AFP can confirm that it spoke to a Darwin man today (Sunday 5 April 2015) following his return to Australia,' an AFP spokesperson said. 'Enquiries relating to his activities while overseas are ongoing and as such it is not appropriate to comment further at this time.' Scroll down for video . Former Northern Territory politician Matthew Gardiner has returned to Australia after he was understood to have been fighting ISIS in the Middle East . The 43-year-old, who has an army background, was allowed to leave the country because he was not on any watch list. He left behind his wife Andrea and three young sons, aged between three and 11. They reportedly had no idea of his decision to flee the country before he disappeared. Mr Gardiner is also head of the NT Labor Party, though he was suspended from his role after his disappearance. In February Australian man Ashley Johnston became the first Westerner to be killed fighting against IS for the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG). It's believed the 28-year-old was fighting with the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) and trying to liberate the ISIS-held town of Tal Hamis in Syria. Johnston was reportedly killed after he became outnumbered when a truck he was travelling in broke down in a small village near Shingal, close to Iraq's border with Syrian Kurdistan. His mother Amanda Johnston had no idea her son was at war in the Middle East until she learnt of his death, as he told her he was simply heading to the Middle East to do humanitarian work. Around 90 Australians are understood to have travelled to the Middle East to join militant causes . Gardiner reportedly headed to Iraq or Syria with the view of joining Kurdish militants and fighting against IS . Mr Gardiner, 43, reportedly served as an Australian Army combat engineer in Somalia in the early 1990s. Attorney General George Brandis was delivered an AFP brief on the Gardiner case. A spokesperson for Mr Brandis said Australians who join militant causes overseas face imprisonment should they survive and return. In January the senior NT Labor party figure fled the country with plans to join Kurdish militants . Gardiner was reportedly detained at Darwin Airport after returning to Australia via Singapore and Sweden . 'If you fight illegally in overseas conflicts, you face up to life in prison upon your return to Australia,' the spokesperson said. 'It is illegal to fight in Syria for either side of the conflict. 'It is illegal to fight for a terrorist organisation anywhere, including in Iraq.' Australians who wanted to oppose the actions of the Islamic State group should instead donate to humanitarian groups operating in affected areas, the spokesperson said.

"David Cameron will today claim that Labour's economic policies risk putting a million people out of work after Britain was singled out as one of the few 'bright spots' in the global economy. The Prime Minister will vow to encourage more job creation by extending national insurance breaks, worth at least £2,000 a year to smaller firms taking on new staff, for a further five years. Saying he is 'really angry' at Labour's claim that the Conservatives are 'the party for the few, not the many', Mr Cameron will hail the 'jobs miracle' that has seen 1,000 new jobs created every day. David Cameron will today claim that Labour's economic policies risk putting a million people out of work . Contrasting that with Labour's record, he will claim Ed Miliband's economic policies could see 'a million more people joining the dole queues'. Last night, in a boost for George Osborne, the head of the International Monetary Fund picked out the UK recovery as exemplary. Christine Lagarde said the world was suffering from a 'moderate and uneven' return to growth which was 'simply not good enough'. But, in an endorsement of the Government's economic record, she cited the United States and the United Kingdom as countries where the outlook is positive. The comments completed an extraordinary volte-face by the IMF on the Coalition's handling of the economy. Just two years ago, it warned that Mr Osborne was 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with austerity – only to see the economic recovery take off. Britain was the best performing major economy in the developed world last year, with growth of 2.8 per cent. Figures published by the fund also show it has overtaken socialist-run France to become the second most powerful economy in Europe behind Germany. However, the IMF predicted Britain would still be running a deficit at the end of the decade – despite Tory efforts to balance the books. Cameron will say if Ed Miliband repeated the economic mistakes of last Labour government there will be a risk to jobs . Mr Cameron, who dismissed the projections, will today launch a Conservative 'jobs manifesto' setting out plans to bring about 'full employment' – meaning everyone who wants a job has one. 'We are living through a jobs miracle – brought to you by a Conservative government that has backed business, reformed welfare and rewarded work,' he will say. Claiming Mr Miliband represents a threat to jobs, he will add: 'You know what makes me really angry? It's when our opponents still go on about 'you Tories – the party for the few and not the many…' Excuse me? 'This is the party that's taken three million of the lowest-paid workers out of income tax altogether; that's cut the taxes of 26million working people; that's seen 1,000 jobs created every day – jobs that are giving families security, putting food on tables, helping people out of poverty. 'Under the last five years of Labour, unemployment went up by 600 people a day. 'So if Ed Miliband repeated the economic mistakes of the last Labour government – that he was a part of – he risks a million more people joining the dole queues.' The jobs manifesto will include a guarantee to maintain the so-called 'employment allowance' until 2020, meaning a third of employers will continue to pay no jobs tax for another five years. The tax break, which helps smaller businesses take on new workers by freeing businesses from at least the first £2,000 of employers' national insurance, has already been taken up by 856,000 firms. David Cameron pictured on a metal platform yesterday (left) and John Major on his soap box in 1992 (right) One of the most abiding images from the 1992 General Election campaign was the moment John Major got on his soap box. And yesterday David Cameron did the same... but gave it a 21st century twist by taking to a folding metal platform. During a campaign stop in Leeds, the Prime Minister raised himself above the closely packed crowd to engage in a question and answer session with employees at the O2 office in Morley and Outwood – the marginal constituency of shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Major climbed onto an old fashioned soap box in Cheltenham to persuade Conservatives to come out and vote in 1992, just ten days before the election. He went on to win the fourth consecutive victory for the Tories – and their last outright UK majority.","David Cameron will launch 'job manifesto' with plans for 'full employment'

"‘Guys can tell if a girl is taking collagen or not.’ That’s the bizarre tagline for a new brand of Japanese beer that claims to make women beautiful. The new collagen-laced brew, created by Japanese liquor company Suntory, boasts a five per cent alcohol content level and claims to have two grams of collagen per can. Scroll down for video . A new collagen-laced brew, created by Japanese liquor company Suntory, boasts a five per cent alcohol content level and claims to have two grams of collagen per can . Collagen is a type of protein found in skin that provides structure, firmness and texture, making people appear more youthful. As it gets older, the body’s reserves of collagen deplete, causing skin to lose firmness and develop wrinkles . Collagen supplements have become popular in recent years claiming to offer the ultimate anti-aging cure. But before cancel the gym for a night out, Rocketnews24 says the beer is currently on available in Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido. The company has yet to reveal how effective the beer has been in trials, or how much it costs. This isn’t the first time Japan has tried to pump collagen into people. Last year Tokyo eatery, Zenyaren, revealed that has begun serving a variety of the meaty treats designed to beat wrinkles. The grilled skewers of meat come in frozen blocks of collagen gelatin so they can be licked or crunched just like an ice lolly. Last year Tokyo eatery, Zenyaren, revealed that has begun serving a variety of the meaty treats designed to beat wrinkles. The grilled skewers of meat come in frozen blocks of collagen gelatin so they can be licked or crunched just like an ice lolly . Tokyo skin expert Tatsuto Tamura explains: 'This has been popular in Japan for generations although only now is it becoming mainstream and known in the West too. 'People here seek out collagen-enriched foods such as chicken, pigs' feet or shark fin because they believe it will help their skin,' he added. In the US, many restaurants now serve special 'wrinkle free' menus of dishes loaded with collagen. But the craze has not, however, impressed British skin specialists, and the British Skin Foundation claims that eating collagen does not benefit the skin in any way. Using X-ray beams, scientists were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments . It is probably the most unpleasant experiment you will read about today: what happens when your skin starts to tear. Researchers have uncovered the reason why skin is so difficult to tear even when put under extreme pressures, by cutting samples of real skin and attempting to pull them apart. They found that rather than simply tearing, mammalian skin actually has sophisticated stress resistance properties that prevent holes and cuts from expanding. Using X-ray beams they were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments. They discovered that the curly fibers of collagen that make up dermis of the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear to share the load and prevent further damage. The findings help to explain why the thin layer of cells that cover our bodies is able to provide such an effective barrier to the outside world.","'Precious' brew has been created by Japanese liquor company Suntory .

"With just a bird, a gas lamp and a net, each morning, fisherman in China keep a special, thousand year old tradition alive. Sailing peacefully across a river, the men fish without the aid of a rod with this unusual method, which was first practiced in 960 AD. The men, pictured in southern China, release a cormorant bird, which then dives into the water and retrieves a carp, returning it to the fisherman's reed raft. With just a bird, a gas lamp and a net, each morning, fishermen in China keep a special, thousand year old tradition alive . The stunning images were captured on the River Li in Guilin, China, by a Russian photographer called Viktoriia Rogotneva. The 45-year-old, from St Petersburg, was captivated upon visiting the fishermen in the town. 'Every fishermen has a reed raft, a few trained cormorants and a small source of light - usually a kerosene lamp,' he said. 'In the morning the fishermen go to the river and let the cormorants go. The birds are very hungry and dive into the water to catch big carp.' Sailing peacefully across the river, the men men fish without the aid of a rod with this unusual method, first practiced in 960 AD . A man releases a cormorant bird, which then dives into the water and retrieves a carp, returning it to the fisherman's reed raft . The fishermen quite literally just take the carp right out of the bird's mouth after the hungry animals return with their haul . These breathtaking early morning images were captured by 45-year-old Viktoriaa Rogotneva from St Petersburg, Russia . 'The cormorants then return to the surface of the water, and the fishermen take the fish right out the bird's beak,' Rogotneva added. The elderly fishermen of Guiliin spend between two and three hours on the lake each every morning, and while cormorant fishing only produces about 4kg of carp per day, the men are determined to keep this special practice alive. To control the birds, the fishermen tie a ring near the base of the bird's throat, which prevents them from swallowing any large fish, but allows them to eat smaller fish with no discomfort. The images were all shot on the River Li in Guilin, China, which is in the southern part of the country . Heading out in the dawn's light, each man is equipped only with a reed raft, a few trained cormorants and a small kerosene light source . The elderly fishermen spend anywhere between two to three hours per day on the lake, despite the low yields from cormorant fishing . On average, the men will only produce about 4kg of carp per day, but are still determined to keep this beautiful practice alive = . This fishermen bring up the birds from when they are tiny chicks, so the cormorant is more of a pet than a hunter . This way of fishing is 'absolutely ecologically safe,' says Rogotneva, who insists that the fishermen catch only as much as they need . Rogotneva said: 'These fishermen bring up their birds from when they are very small chicks, so you can almost call the cormorant a pet, like you would a dog. 'It is an absolutely ecologically safe way of fishing. Every fisherman just catches as much as he needs for his family and they are never greedy. 'I really enjoy looking for these unusual moments, they make for beautiful photos.'","Elderly fishermen in Guilin, China, keep the unusual, ancient tradition of cormorant bird fishing alive .

It's hard to know just when the cherry blossoms will bloom in Japan each year, but in Kanazawa in the Ishikawa region of Japan, it's traditionally during the first half of the month of April. Because the winter is generally cooler in the area, compared to Tokyo and Kyoto, it takes a bit longer for the blooms to thaw. The nearby Kenrokuen Garden, designated as a National Site of Historical Significance, is part of the Kanazawa Castle grounds and open the public free of charge for the two weeks surrounding the cherry blossom season.

Mone, who also owns a £2million flat in Mayfair, London, said she would change her old mansion to rid it of 'bad memories' when she revealed her property plans last week. The mother-of-three said: 'I'm selling my home here in Glasgow but I also own the big house with my ex-husband. For two years I've been trying to buy him out of it and he only agreed just the other day - which is fantastic. 'I'm over the moon. I'll always have a base here in Glasgow but I've moved in to my London home as well. So, that means I'll have just the one home here rather than one and a half.' She said that although she has not lived in the Thorntonhall home for two years, she 'loves' the property, which she bought with her then husband, Mr Mone, in 2008.

That said, I haven't been spending a whole lot of time in the town house since I've been promoting my book in America.' In 2010, Ms Mone was at the centre of a row with neighbours over plans to add a sauna, gym and bar to the home. Five residents objected to her proposals and one said the development would 'completely dwarf' the rest of the street. But it was still given the go-ahead by planners. The couple created lingerie brand Ultimo together in 1996, split in 2011 after she believed Michael had had an affair with bra designer, Samantha Bunn, with whom he has set up a rival lingerie firm.

The couple continued to live in the family home for some time after their acrimonious separation. In her recently published autobiography, Mone admitted she put laxatives in her husband's coffee, let down his tyres and cut holes in his boxer shorts. She also said that on one occasion while they were still sharing the marital home, she poured cold water on his side of the bed. Ms Mone said later: 'I am sorry for that. Sorry for that woman I became. It wasn't nice at all.'

"Tough new regulations will allow for a crackdown on notorious party houses on the Gold Coast after years of complaints about boozing and scantily-clad women. Gold Coast City Council will finally be able to shut down illegal party houses in suburban areas after the state government approved new planning powers, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports. There are more than 700 party houses across the city, which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours due to noise, nudity, lewd behaviour and violence. Tough new regulations will allow for a crackdown on notorious party houses on the Gold Coast after years of complaints about boozing and scantily-clad women . The new powers, approved by Deputy Premier and Planning Minister Jackie Trad, means there is now an official and legal definition of a party house so the council can enforce laws to shut them down in certain areas. If an illegal party house is reported to the council, authorities will be able to force the owner of the property to apply for a development application. If they refuse the council can legally shut them down. Party houses are just short-term accommodation options that people regularly rent out for rowdy events like Bucks parties. Police have often been called in after neighbours complained about noise and lewd behaviour at some of the houses across the Broadbeach, Mermaid Beach, Mermaid Waters and Surfers Paradise areas.

There are more than 700 party houses across the city, which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours due to noise, nudity, lewd behaviour and violence . Some residents who live near a party house have said they are afraid to leave their homes while a weekend-long party is raging and are tormented by the noise and activities next door. Burleigh councillor Greg Betts told the Gold Coast Bulletin the crackdown would begin this month. 'This is a planning issue which means that the criteria of what is allowed to be a party house is strict and those people operating them will have to apply to have this status,' he said. 'If they fail to get this approval but continue to operate we can shut them down.' The former state government introduced new laws last year allowing council to institute 'party house restriction areas' where short-term rental properties will be forbidden from operating.

"Rarely-seen photos of Captain Robert Scott’s expedition to the South Pole and an American Civil War flag are among the items expected to fetch tens of thousands of pounds at a unique auction in London later this month. More than 250 fascinating and eclectic objects – with estimated values of £500 to £30,000 – will go under the hammer in the one-off, travel-themed auction at Christie’s South Kensington. Filled with historic artefacts, pricey art and souvenirs acquired during the original owners’ travels, the Around the World auction is drawing interest from collectors and those with wanderlust. This 1838 map (estimated value £7,000 to £10,000) was engraved by John Dower and includes a list of the era’s major discoveries . The one-off, travel-themed auction includes a 34-star US flag, with an estimated value of £10,000 to £15,000, from the Civil War era . One of the highly-anticipated lots contains 11 restored photos of Captain Robert Scott's doomed expedition to the South Pole . One of the highlights of the collection – consignors – is 11 professionally restored photos of Captain Scott’s fateful British Antarctic Expedition. Estimated at £20,000 to £30,000, the copies were created using the surviving gelatine positives and paper negatives taken by the captain himself before he and the rest of his party died during their return journey after reaching the South Pole in January 1912. The photos document the building of the expedition’s base hut, the frigid conditions on Ross Island and their long march to the southernmost point on Earth. Christie’s, the world’s largest auction house, said very few copies were published at the time and many remained unseen and unknown until recently. A photo of a Geisha exiting a Kyoto metro station, taken by Steve McCurry, has an estimated value £3,000 to £5,000 . A saddle made by the Edward H Bohlin Company (left) and an incense burner in the shape of Venezuelan military leader Simon Bolivar . A Indo-Portuguese marquetry chest (valued at £20,000 to £30,000) from the late 17th to early 18th century is one of the rare items available . Another unique item that is expected to fetch a similar price is a silver-mounted and engraved leather parade saddle manufactured by the Hollywood-based Edward H Bohlin Company, which served as ‘the saddle-maker to the stars’. Hand-crafted around 1930, the saddle bears the company’s stamp and all the hallmarks of its attention to detail. Edward Bohlin, who was born in Sweden, created saddles, outfits and accessories for some of Hollywood’s biggest stars, including John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, and US presidents. A model of a British Airways Concorde (valued at £6,000 to £9,000) is one of more than 250 items that will go under the hammer . The travel-themed collection includes a Maori hei tiki pendant from New Zealand (estimated value: £8,000 to £12,000) These Italian marble busts of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, circa 1900-1910, have an estimated value of £6,000 to £8,000 . Another item valued at £20,000 to £30,000 is an elaborate Indo-Portuguese marquetry chest from the late 17th to early 18th century. Christie’s said: ‘The chest displays the blend of East and West seen in Colonial furniture and is typical of work from the former Portuguese colony of Goa. ‘The pattern of intersecting circles that covers the surface of this chest is almost identical to a Contador, or cabinet on stand, in the Victoria and Albert Museum.’ Other items that will go under the hammer on 28 April include a Maori hei tiki pendant from New Zealand (estimated value: £8,000 to £12,000), a rare 34-star US flag from the Civil War era (£10,000 to £15,000), a model of a British Airways Concorde (£6,000 to £9,000), an incense burner in the shape of Venezuelan military leader Simon Bolivar (£15,000 to £25,000), and a silver-mounted section of elephant tusk (£1,200 to £1,800). Stephen O’Connell, co-head of sale, said: 'Around The World, our latest themed auction, is a carefully curated and eclectic sale of works of art, objects, furniture, silver and porcelain and 20th and 21st century design from six continents. 'Individually, the lots on offer are highly unique to their place of origin, and in many cases they draw the eye and mind to a particular geographical place and period in history. 'It’s an exciting sale to be a part of and, for decorators and collectors alike, it is a wonderful opportunity to acquire interesting and unusual works of art from around the globe.'","More than 250 fascinating and eclectic items - with estimated values of £500 to £30,000 - will go under the hammer .

"With its stuffed rhino heads and gleaming white tusks, the trophy room at Sandringham was a relic of a bygone era – as well as rather embarrassing for animal welfare crusader Prince William. But now the age of political correctness appears to have caught up with the Queen’s Norfolk estate. For every last piece of hunting memorabilia has been removed from public display and replaced with what one visitor called ‘trinkets and bric-a-brac’. Throwback: How the trophy room at Sandringham used to look, complete with stuffed rhino heads . Bric-a-brac: Sandringham's updated display - and even the blood-red walls have been repainted white . All 62 items – including an Indian tiger, a leopard, skins and tusks – have been placed in storage. Even the blood-red walls have been painted white, as if to make clear the break with the past. The drastic change was apparent when the estate reopened its doors to the public on Saturday. Following the winter closure, a new sign outside the Sandringham museum makes pointed reference to how changing times have spelled the end for some exhibits. After explaining that the museum opened in 1928 to house George V’s collection of ‘big game trophies’, the message says: ‘Thankfully, due to the work of organisations like the World Wide Fund for Nature, whose President was HRH Prince Philip until 1996, this destructive era is drawing to a close – the camera having replaced the gun in recording the sightings of these magnificent animals.’ Questions were raised in December about the legality of ‘unworked items’ – those not fundamentally changed from their natural state – dating from prior to 1947. Under a European Council regulation, the uncarved ivory, stuffed lions and white rhinos all potentially broke the law as they were not on show with an official certificate. The Animal and Plant Health Agency – an arm of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – confirmed there was a ‘potential legal question mark’ about some of the contents of the room. Bygone era: The room, which featured stuffed lions, must have been embarrassing for animal welfare crusader Prince William . Chnging times: Now every last piece of hunting memorabilia has been removed from public display . The situation was particularly embarrassing for Prince William, who had just denounced the illegal wildlife trade in ivory, rhino horn and endangered animal parts during a speech in Washington DC. He had also previously called for the Royal Family’s ivory collection to be destroyed. And the royals now appear to have taken decisive action by removing the items from display – but whether their replacements are particularly interesting is another matter entirely. The new items include an ashtray used by King George V, a Sandringham Cycling Club badge dating from 1895 and an embroidered cover of Radio Times that marked the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. An ornate cabinet of ‘curios’ from a primary school on the estate contains dolls, jewellery made from oyster shells and a dried puffer fish. The only other creatures to be found are stuffed birds in a glass cabinet and a butterfly collection. One visitor who went along to Sandringham on Saturday said: ‘Every last animal head, stuffed animal or skin has gone. Gone: All 62 items – including an Indian tiger, a leopard, skins and tusks – have been placed in storage . ‘There’s a real mixed bag now of bizarre and random things. Someone has come in and taken everything out of there, whitewashed the place and put in an entire room of trinkets and bric-a-brac.’ A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said yesterday that the trophies had been put away to make room for an exhibition of paintings by members of the British, Danish, Greek and Russian royal families. He added: ‘Changes were made to the Sandringham museum during the winter closure as part of an ongoing process of updating and refreshing the displays.’ A source said the legality of around five items had been questioned although those in charge of the collection were ‘still sure’ they had not broken the law.","All hunting memorabilia removed from public display at Norfolk estate .

"An American-Egyptian citizen was jailed for life as an Egyptian judge handed down harsh punishments to now outlawed Muslim group. American Mohamed Soltan, 27, and 36 others were given life sentences as Mohamed Badie, the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, and 13 other defendants were ordered to be executed. The defendants were found guilty of plotting unrest from their headquarters in a sprawling Cairo protest camp in the months after a military coup overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013. Scroll down for video . Mohamed Soltan, 27, was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of plotting unrest against the military-backed government that overthrew former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi in a 2013 coup . The American-Egyptian citizen, who grew up in Michigan, Missouri and Ohio before attending Ohio State, moved to Egypt to be closer to his mother (right) during her cancer treatments . The young man has been on a hunger strike protesting his arrest and has done 'irreparable damage' to his body including losing roughly 100 pounds. Above, his father was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood . Judge Mohamed Nagy Shehata is known for his harsh rulings in cases involving the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt has banned and labeled a terrorist group. Soltan, who grew up in Missouri, Michigan and Ohio and graduated from Ohio State in 2012, has been on a hunger strike over his detention for more than 14 months. His family called for Mohamed's immediate release in a statement after the verdict, charging that there was no evidence against him. He is not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, according to the Washington Post. His father Salah Soltan, who was outspoken in support of the Muslim Brotherhood and served in the Morsi administration, was among the 14 detainees sentenced to death. The US embassy in Cairo said in a statement that it was 'gravely concerned' about Mohamed Soltan and would 'continue to monitor his case closely and to provide him with all possible support.' The State Department later that said: 'The US government is deeply disappointed in the Egyptian court’s decision in the case of US citizen Mohamed Soltan.' It said that the US 'reiterates our call for the release of Mr. Soltan on humanitarian grounds, and we urge the Government of Egypt to redress this verdict.' Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie, pictured at a trial earlier this year, has had his death sentence confirmed by a Cairo judge . Badie (front) and his fellow defendants including Soltan were found guilty of plotting unrest in July 2013 . The young man had been working at an oil services company in Cairo after moving to Egypt in 2012 to be near his mother receiving cancer treatments. Soltan had criticized former Egyptian president Morsi but did not approve of his forcible removal by the military roughly a year after he took office. He was shot in the arm during an August 13, 2013 protest where human rights groups estimated 1,000 people were killed by the military, according to the New York Times. Police moved in to disperse the camp after weeks of failed European and US-brokered negotiations with the Brotherhood, who publicly insisted on Morsi's return after he was toppled by the military amid another set of protests. Soltan, who had been working as a translator for Western journalists, was arrested several days later and has not been released since. A former basketball player, his hunger strike has caused 'severe, in some cases irreparable, damage to his body,' according to US diplomats working on his case. In May last year he was thought to have lost 98 pounds. The dual citizen (left) had worked as a translator for journalists during protests in the summer of 2013 (right) Egyptian Judge Mohammed Nagi Shehata reads the verdicts in a cases in Cairo, on Saturday. He has made a series of harsh rulings against Egyptian Islamists . His health earlier this year was said to be dire, according to Al Jazeera. Saturday's sentences come days after the US released hundreds of millions of dollars in aid for the Middle Eastern country that had been held up because of concerns about repression. Soltan's family has criticized the Obama administration for not doing enough to free their son. The State Department has refused to call the military take over in 2013 a coup. The rulings can be appealed before the Court of Cassation, which has overturned dozens of other death sentences, including against Badie. So far Egypt has executed one Islamist sentenced to death after Morsi's overthrow, following his conviction of involvement in the murder of a youth during violent protests in July 2013. Judge Shehata read out a Koranic verse that stipulates amputation and crucifixion for outlaws, before rendering his verdict on Saturday. At a previous session, he had sought the opinion of the country's mufti, the Islamic legal authority who has an advisory role under Egyptian law, on the death sentences. He has previously sentenced hundreds of Islamists at a time to death and also gave prison terms to Al Jazeera journalists for reporting false news, though no evidence of false reports was given. Above, pro-Morsi Egyptian protesters in 2013 . Known as the 'Rabaa Operations Room' case, the prosecution accused the defendants of organizing months of unrest and protests against the ouster of Morsi, who is himself now on trial. The Muslim Brotherhood had said that the protests were peaceful and no 'operation room' existed. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former army chief who toppled Morsi and then won an election, has pledged to eradicate the Muslim Brotherhood. The government has blacklisted the movement amid a spike in militant attacks that have killed dozens of policemen and soldiers. The deadliest attacks have been claimed by jihadists in the Sinai Peninsula and in Cairo, though Brotherhood insists it is committed to non-violence. But decapitated and driven underground, the Islamist movement is believed to have radicalised with members adopting militant tactics against policemen.","Confirmed death sentences for Muslim Brotherhood leader and 13 others .

"The Married at First Sight star who tried to leave her groom at the altar after deciding he was too ‘unattractive’ for her has finally admitted to having romantic feelings towards him. While the honeymoon period comes to an end for the couples on tonight's episode of the hit FYI reality series, as they all return home to celebrate the holidays with their spouses, whom they've known for a total of seven days, it seems that, for Jaclyn Methuen and Ryan Ranellone, the romance has only just begun. 'Day one, I was freaking out. Day seven, oh man, I have a crush on my husband,' 30-year-old Jaclyn says in a preview for the latest episode. Scroll down for video .

Euphoric feeling: The 30-year-old is all smiles as she admits that she is developing a crush on her new husband . Meanwhile, Ryan tells the cameras that he remains dedicated to cultivating a real relationship with his new wife, whom he has been attracted to from day one. 'I am committed to making our marriage work,' the 29-year-old says. And, thankfully, after a week of awkward encounters and terse conversations, it looks like things are starting to take a turn for the better for the newlyweds. After being single for seven years, Jaclyn started their union by keeping Ryan at arm’s length and subconsciously putting him in the 'friend zone' throughout their honeymoon in Puerto Rico, with Ryan admitting in last week’s episode that that he was growing increasingly irritated with her insistence on calling him 'dude' and 'bro' when they were supposed to be acting like a married couple. Making it work: The couple share a laugh after they return home from their honeymoon in Puerto Rico . But it looks like the sales rep from Union, New Jersey, is finally seeing her spouse in a new light. As well as Jaclyn’s long-awaited confession about her romantic feelings for her husband, the preview clip also shows the couple laughing in bed together as she gently caresses his chin. Interestingly enough, while Jaclyn and Ryan initially appeared to be the couple with the most problems, but they are growing ever closer to one another – while the other newlyweds seem to be growing apart. Jessica Castro, 30, and Ryan DeNiro, 29, who were comfortable with each other from the start, spent the end of their honeymoon arguing over his choice of words during what should have been a romantic dinner date in Key Largo. During last week's episode, Jessica showed her new husband a photo of herself with her 'Monroe' lip piercing and was furious with his reaction, accusing him of calling it trashy.

Marriage woes: Ryan DeNiro and Jessica Castro are still going through a rough patch after he allegedly called her 'Monroe' lip-piercing 'trashy' last week . 'You just don't say that to a person,' she told him over dinner, and Ryan soon stormed out of the restaurant. And it looks like the two are still struggling to reconnect. While Jessica tells the cameras that things are 'really weird' between them, Ryan admits that he has a side of himself that 'sometimes isn't too pleasant'. 'I feel like I have to walk on egg shells around him,' Jessica adds. Meanwhile, Davina Kullar, 34, and Sean Varricchio, 35, appear to be moving forward with their marriage as they continue to build an emotional bond.

"Five Afghan men were found hiding in the back of a refrigerated lorry  after travelling 200 miles across Britain. It is thought the migrants had climbed into the British-registered truck in Belgium before crossing the channel and entering the UK illegally. Police sniffer dogs were used to find them after officers opened the truck's back doors on the A40 near Churcham, Gloucestershire. A group of Afghan men discovered crammed in a refrigerated lorry in Gloucestershire are removed by police . Photos taken by officers show the tiny space the men had climbed into between crates in the packed trailer of the HGV. Gloucestershire police tweeted photos of the moment the men were brought out of the lorry this morning. They tweeted: '[Police dog] Max & his handler assisting on the A40 at Churcham. 5 stowaways on board from Afghanistan. '1 of the 5 men from the refrigerated HGV on the A40 at Churcham. Possibly climbed in in Belgium.' The men were found a week after an illegal camp of migrants was cleared in Calais, the French port closest to Britain. It is believed the men boarded the lorry in Belgium before crossing the channel and travelling across Britain . Sniffer dog Max  helped find the men, who had wrapped themselves up in hats and scalves in the cold . Around 200 people were thought to have been living in a sports hall but were told to move on or face arrest by French authorities. The port's outspoken mayor has already blamed Britain's benefits system for attracting the migrants, thousands of whom have massed in Calais waiting for an opportunity to sneak into lorries, cars or caravans and enter Britain. Eleven suspected illegal immigrants were arrested last week after they were seen clinging to a moving lorry last week. The group, believed to be from Syria, were arrested on the M20 motorway near Folkestone, Kent, on suspicion of illegal entry into Britain after they were seen riding on top of the vehicle by a fellow driver. It is the latest in a series of similar incidents after French authorities began dealing with huge numbers of migrants who have set up camp in Calais and are desperate to reach Britain .","Truck stopped by police this morning after travelling 200m across the UK .

"Police have revealed that they believe missing toddler William Tyrell may be alive, despite fears that he was abducted by a paedophile ring operating on the mid-north coast of NSW. Just a day after William's parents made an impassioned plea for the three-year-old to be returned to them, police have described the 'fast-paced' investigation into the new line of inquiry. 'The two worlds collided. We have information that could link William’s disappearance to a group of people suspected of paedophile activity,' said lead investigator Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin. Scroll down for video . The parents of missing William Tyrrell, who police now say may have been kidnapped by a paedophile ring, have revealed the moment they realised their son was missing . The focus of the investigation has shifted dramatically, and is now 'progressing rapidly', according to Homicide Squad commander Detective Superintendent Mick Willing, reported news.com.au. 'We are pursuing many, many lines of inquiry but what I can say is that there is a team of detectives working very hard. This is a very fast-paced moving inquiry,' Detective Superintendent Willing said. The Detective Sup took a firm stance on the consequences for anyone found to be involved with the toddler's disappearance. 'If you know anything you are implicated. If you are involved you will be charged,' he said. Det Sup Willing also spoke of the heartache William's parents had experienced since his abduction, and said that the family needed answers to where their beloved little boy was. This comes as the three-year-old's mother spoke out about the horrifying moment she realised her son had vanished. Little William's mother frantically searched the house, opening cupboards and yelling out, 'You need to talk to mummy and tell me where you are' in the moments after she found she couldn't hear her son. 'When I realised that William was missing – I think back to that moment where I just went, ""I can't hear him, why, why can't I hear him"",' she said. William had been in the front yard of his grandmother's house in Kendall, on the NSW mid-north coast, when he disappeared in September last year. 'I just walked out and just I see nothing, I hear nothing, I'm speechless. I'm walking around in a circle on the spot thinking where is he? Why can't I see him? And I'm yelling out, ""William, where are you""?' his mother told The Sydney Morning Herald. The toddlers parents released a heart-wrenching video earlier on Friday begging for his return. 'Just give him back ... take him to a church, take him to a police station, take him to school. Give him to someone, give him back,' his mother says in a video released by police. William's father choked back tears as he remembered his son, who was infatuated with the Spider-Man superhero. '(He loved) anything that related to Spider-Man and superheroes,' William's father said in the video. 'He's a cheeky, vibrant little boy ... full of energy. I mean he's my little boy.' One of the new photos released by police of William Tyrrell show the three-year-old smiling and playing guitar, while other images and photos show an energetic and happy youngster full of life . Heartfelt plea: William Tyrrell's distraught parents released a video pleading for their missing son's return as well as home movies showing the lively boy riding his bike (pictured) and playing at the family home . But he said William was a cautious boy who wouldn't go with a stranger. His mother said she had a vision that somebody 'reached over ... has gone `clump' on his shoulders, picked him up and moved him on ... because ... that's the only way ... to explain for him not to be there.' She said the family was struggling with not knowing where William is or what happened to him. 'We need to know what happened to him ... `cause we can't live forever ... like this.' She said she hoped whoever had him was looking after him. 'I want him to be safe, I want him to be feeling loved and I want someone to be looking after him because to imagine that something else is going on ... we can't live like that.' The distraught couple has also released new pictures and home videos of the boy in the hope that new clues will emerge as to his whereabouts. In the videos, William can be seen riding his bike down a path and flashing a cheeky grin, as well as playing a guitar and swivelling his hips in times to the music. 'Just give him back':  The parents (pictured) issued the plea in an emotional video released by NSW Police to encourage people to come with forward with new leads as to the missing toddler's whereabouts . Full of life: The new videos of William Tyrrell (pictured, above at a slightly younger age) show a smiling boy full of energy and his mother has begged kidnappers to show her son care and love if the little boy is still alive, seven months after police believe he was abducted from his grandmother's NSW mid north coast home . The parents of missing three-year-old William Tyrrell have released new pictures of their son and a video pleading for his return by abductors who are believed to have snatched him in daylight last September . Legal restrictions have prevented William's parents from speaking publicly throughout the ordeal, and their identities are not revealed in the video. The footage comes as detectives reveal that they believe the three-year-old may have been abducted by a paedophile ring. Detective Superintendent Mick Willing, NSW Homicide Squad Commander, said on Friday: 'One of our lines of inquiry relates to people we expect to be involved in a paedophile ring.' He said detectives from the homicide squad and the sex crime squad are 'vigorously perusing that line of inquiry and this investigation is moving at a very fast pace.' 'We are persuing every lead that we get,' Detective Willing said. William was last seen dressed in a Spider-Man suit and playing in his grandmother's yard in broad daylight in a quiet street in Kendall last September. Vigorous pursuit: NSW Homicide squad boss Detective Superintendent Mick Willing (pictured) revealed on Friday that police are investigating William Tyrrell's disappearance at a very fast pace and that 'one of our lines of inquiry relates to people we expect to be involved in a paedophile ring' A new home video of cheeky William Tyrrell (pictured, eating cake) has been provided by the family in their desperate wait for the return of the three-year-old, seven months after his probable kidnap . Investigators believe he was snatched during a very short window of time when he was out of sight of his family as he played outside. The parents are calling for any who has any information to contact Crime Stoppers immediately on 1800 333 000. The release of the video comes more than a month since police scoured bushland in Bonny Hills, south of Port Macquarie, for evidence relating to William's whereabouts. Police divers were brought in from Sydney to search a murky dam in a bush reserve and a nearby swamp, after more than 30 officers and the dog squad had spent spent two days searching through dense bushland - including along a track that can only be accessed by four-wheel drive. The three-day search was carried out near local washing machine repairman William 'Bill' Spedding's home. Mr Spedding was identified as a person of interest in the case after he was due to fix William's grandmother's washing machine around the time the toddler vanished. However, Mr Spedding says he didn't go to the house on September 12 because he couldn't get in contact with William's grandmother. Police searched the 63-year-old's home and business in nearby Laurieton in January, seizing various items, including cars, a mattress and computer, for forensic examination. Mr Spedding has strongly denied any involvement and police have previously stressed he isn't their only line of inquiry.

"It may sound like the stuff of science fiction, but this stunning image shows that a white dwarf star  ripped apart a planet as it came too close. Astronomers say the unique event happened in an ancient cluster of stars at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy. A white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the Sun that has run out of nuclear fuel - may have ripped apart a planet as it came too close, they believe. Nasa says a white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the Sun that has run out of nuclear fuel - ripped apart a planet at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy. When a star reaches its white dwarf stage, nearly all of the material from the star is packed inside a radius one hundredth that of the original star. This means that, for close encounters, the gravitational pull of the star and the associated tides, caused by the difference in gravity's pull on the near and far side of the planet, are greatly enhanced. For example, the gravity at the surface of a white dwarf is over ten thousand times higher than the gravity at the surface of the Sun. Using several telescopes, including Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory, researchers have found evidence that a white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the Sun that has run out of nuclear fuel - may have ripped apart a planet as it came too close. When a star reaches its white dwarf stage, nearly all of the material from the star is packed inside a radius one hundredth that of the original star. This means that, for close encounters, the gravitational pull of the star and the associated tides, caused by the difference in gravity's pull on the near and far side of the planet, are greatly enhanced. For example, the gravity at the surface of a white dwarf is over ten thousand times higher than the gravity at the surface of the Sun. 'A planet is first pulled away from its parent star by the gravity of the dense concentration of stars in a globular cluster,' the experts write. 'When such a planet passes too close to a white dwarf, it can be torn apart by the intense tidal forces of the white dwarf. 'The planetary debris is then heated and glows in X-rays as it falls onto the white dwarf. 'The observed amount of X-rays emitted at different energies agrees with expectations for a tidal disruption event.' Researchers used the European Space Agency's INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) to discover a new X-ray source near the center of the globular cluster NGC 6388. NGC 6388 in the X-ray spectrum. Chandra's excellent X-ray vision enabled the astronomers to determine that the X-rays from NGC 6388 were not coming from the putative black hole at the center of the cluster, but instead from a location slightly off to one side. Optical observations had hinted that an intermediate-mass black hole with mass equal to several hundred Suns or more resides at the center of NGC 6388. The new composite image shows NGC 6388 with X-rays detected by Chandra in pink and visible light from the Hubble Space Telescope in red, green, and blue, with many of the stars appearing to be orange or white. Overlapping X-ray sources and stars near the center of the cluster also causes the image to appear white. With the central black hole ruled out as the potential X-ray source, the hunt continued for clues about the actual source in NGC 6388. The source was monitored with the X-ray telescope on board NASA's Swift Gamma Ray Burst mission for about 200 days after the discovery by INTEGRAL. Researchers used the European Space Agency's INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) to discover a new X-ray source near the center of the globular cluster NGC 6388. The source became dimmer during the period of Swift observations. The rate at which the X-ray brightness dropped agrees with theoretical models of a disruption of a planet by the gravitational tidal forces of a white dwarf. In these models, a planet is first pulled away from its parent star by the gravity of the dense concentration of stars in a globular cluster. When such a planet passes too close to a white dwarf, it can be torn apart by the intense tidal forces of the white dwarf. The planetary debris is then heated and glows in X-rays as it falls onto the white dwarf. The observed amount of X-rays emitted at different energies agrees with expectations for a tidal disruption event. The researchers estimate that the destroyed planet would have contained about a third of the mass of Earth, while the white dwarf has about 1.4 times the Sun's mass. While the case for the tidal disruption of a planet is not iron-clad, the argument for it was strengthened when astronomers used data from the multiple telescopes to help eliminate other possible explanations for the detected X-rays. For example, the source does not show some of the distinctive features of a binary containing a neutron star, such as pulsations or rapid X-ray bursts. Also, the source is much too faint in radio waves to be part of a binary system with a stellar-mass black hole.","Occurred in ancient cluster of stars at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy .

"Natalie Bennett said the so-called ‘citizens income’ – which critics say would cost £280billion – would take longer than five years to bring in, and could take even longer . Every adult in Britain would be paid £72 a week under a commitment in the Green manifesto – but the party leader admitted her pledges could take decades to implement. Natalie Bennett said the so-called ‘citizens income’ – which critics say would cost £280billion – would take longer than five years to bring in, and could take even longer. She said another Green pledge – to dismantle the Armed Forces and use weapons factories to build wind turbines – was also a ‘long-term aspiration’. And the party’s policy of leaving Nato and abandoning nuclear weapons was ‘many decades into the future’. The revelations came in another disappointing performance by Miss Bennett, when she was interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. In February she suffered what she called a ‘brain fade’ on LBC Radio when she forgot the details of her party’s key housing policies. On Today, she was challenged about policies listed in the Green policy book, which is set by party members at the annual conference. One of these is the citizens’ incomes, which would be given to everyone in Britain as a ‘right of citizenship’, regardless of wealth or whether they are seeking work. Miss Bennett, the Green Party leader in England and Wales, said the policy would take time to implement. She said: ‘Let me say this very slowly – the commitment is in the manifesto. We don’t think we can introduce it in the term of the next parliament; it’s a big change. ‘The Green Party has a long-term vision about what Britain should look like. I don’t apologise for that. ‘We are saying we need a Britain that’s built on principles of politics; we need a different kind of politics and having that long-term vision, looking into the future and saying what should Britain look like in five, 10, 20 years’ time is something that is very much central to Green Party politics.’ Claiming the citizens’ income was backed by an ‘increasing number of economists’, she said that as ‘the sixth richest economy, we have to provide for everyone's basic needs and we have to do that within the limits of our one planet’. ‘The Citizens' Income, the commitment to that, is in this manifesto – but we've seen the difficulties that Iain Duncan Smith has got into in introducing Universal Credit, so we're saying it would take more than the term of one parliament to actually introduce this,’ she said. Claiming the citizens’ income was backed by an ‘increasing number of economists’, Ms Bennett said that as ‘the sixth richest economy, we have to provide for everyone's basic needs and we have to do that within the limits of our one planet’ After two-and-a-half years as Green party leader, Natalie Bennett would have liked to think she has made a name for herself. But after another faltering media performance she suffered the indignity of being confused with her predecessor. Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphreys ended the grilling saying: Caroline Lucas, thank you very much.' He quickly apologised for his gaffe. Ms Lucas was Green leader from 2008-12, but stood down to concentrate on being the party's first MP. Miss Bennett was also challenged over a pledge, contained in the same policy book, to dismantle the Armed Forces – saying it was a ‘long-term’ aspiration. She also said that abandoning nuclear weapons and leaving Nato was a ‘long-term plan many decades into the future’. The book also contains pledges to legalise the sex industry and drug use, decriminalise Al Qaeda membership and impose new taxes on pop music performances and large gifts. Miss Bennett said the Greens were now the third-largest party in England and Wales. ‘We're larger than UKIP, we're larger than the Lib Dems,’ she said. ‘We have more than 58,000 members. ‘We've had one Green MP, Caroline Lucas, who's had a huge impact as one MP in the Parliament. ‘And we're now working very hard to send a strong group of Green MPs to Parliament who - given the electoral arithmetic - have a very good chance of being in a strong position to really influence the whole direction of the next government.’ She said her party offered a ‘genuine alternative’ to the Conservatives' ‘austerity heavy’ and the Labour's ‘austerity-lite’. The Green’ manifesto will be launched next week.","Green party leader flounders again in interview about her own policies .

"Hundreds of runners from across the globe have taken part in North Korea's Pyongyang marathon - perhaps the most isolated international sporting event in the world. Around 650 foreign entrants, three times more than last year, joined in today's event under the constant watch of soldiers. The event - which only opened its doors to non-local amateurs in 2014 - was founded in 1981 in the single-party country, which is now led by brutal dictator Kim Jong un. One of this year's entrants Duncan Erasmus (far left) a 23 year-old software firm owner from Auckland ran in the full amateur marathon . Charles Kobold, a cable TV installation guy from the state of Wyoming, took gold in the 10km race. There were also categories for amateur full and half marathon runners plus North Korean entrants. Foreign professionals were not allowed to take part. Last year Will Marks, the British man who won the amateur half marathon category, revealed how runners were banned from displaying country flags and western logos. Photography was also forbidden, but many runners flouted the rule. Photographs of this year's event were submitted by people from Koryo Tours who flouted the ban to secretly snap the runners on their smartphones. One of this year's entrants Duncan Erasmus, a 23 year-old software firm owner from Auckland who ran the full amateur marathon, told MailOnline he was aware of being constantly watched but said the atmosphere remained jovial.

The event starts and finishes at the Rungnado May Day Stadium or Kim Il Sung Stadium (pictured) every year . Local entrants to the Pyongyang marathon were joined this year by hundreds of runners from across the world . Runners praised the jovial atmosphere as thousands of supporters turned out to cheer them on . ‘I did feel like I was in a bit of a bubble,’ he said. ‘The North Koreans were very friendly during the run but outside of it there was a marked change. They were very cautious about interacting with us, whereas it felt like during the marathon they were allowed [to interact more freely]. ‘Our cameras were confiscated by our tour guides – although they asked us for them very politely. ‘Although, like last year, some people managed to get through with cameras anyway.’ He added that alongside the thousands of supporters who came out to cheer them on was a huge number of soldiers strategically positioned to ensure that no-one stepped out of line or saw anything they weren't supposed to. ‘The soldiers were stern and restrained in their actions but even they cracked the occasional smile,’ said Mr Erasmus. ‘Their presence was everywhere – you could always see the uniform. ‘When I was running I noticed that they were positioned in places that could be deemed sensitive. For example, I saw three soldiers standing by an entrance to a construction site. They don’t like you photographing or even seeing construction.’ This year saw around 650 foreign entrants, three times more than last year, join in the Pyongyang marathon . Entrants were ran past North Korean monuments on during the marathon, such as the Arch of Triumph . Photographs of this year's event were submitted by people from Koryo Tours who flouted the ban to secretly snap the runners on their smartphones . Around 5,000 westerners visit North Korea every year. All tourists face tight restrictions and must be accompanied by guides who work for state-owned companies. Free roaming is banned. In February authorities announced that the marathon would be closed to foreigners due to North Korea’s borders being closed to keep out Ebola, despite no cases of the disease being reported in the country. They reversed their decision shortly afterwards. Mr Kobold, a 30 year-old cable TV installation worker from the city of Casper, won the 10km amateur race in the isolated country with a time of 40 minutes and 20 seconds. Speaking to MailOnline after the winners’ ceremony that took place in front of thousands of North Koreans in Pyongyang’s Kim il Sung Stadium, he described how he came second in last year’s 10km run. Back then he fainted due to exhaustion before picking up his medal, but he had no such problems this time round. 2014 Winner: British runner Will Marks  triumphed in the North Korean half marathon after the event was opened to foreigners for the first time last year . Photography was also forbidden at the marathon and other races but many runners flouted the rule . One of this year's entrants told MailOnline he was aware of being constantly watched but said the atmosphere remained jovial . ‘I only did the 10km run but I felt like a million dollars – I had 50,000 locals cheering me on in the stadium,’ he said. He added, ‘A lovely Korean woman in traditional dress gave me a porcelain vase, which was instead of the medals they gave out last year. It’s pretty big, it’ll have to be my carry-on luggage when I go back to the US.’ The race, named the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon after the late North Korea leader Kim il Sung’s birthplace, gave foreigners the rare chance to run through the streets of Pyongyang, which is home to the country’s elite classes. Thousands of locals came out in force to cheer them on. ‘There was a festival atmosphere – there were so many people waving and shouting “Hurry up!” in Korean to me,’ said Mr Kobold. He added, ‘I was high-fiving so many people. By the end my arms were in such pain from doing it, I couldn’t even wave to any more supporters.’ The marathon trip, like all other heavily-vetted tourist trips to North Korea, gave foreigners a sanitised view of the country .

The marathon trip, like all other heavily-vetted tourist trips to North Korea, gave foreigners a sanitised view of the country. Founded in 1981 in the single-party country, which is now led by brutal dictator Kim Jong un . It offered no glimpse of the horrors that allegedly exist outside the version of North Korea authorities allow outsiders to see. Human rights groups claim that torture, infanticide and oppression characterise Kim’s dictatorship and are kept from view. But Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, the tour firm that Mr Kobold travelled with, told MailOnline that events such as the marathon were good for increasing interaction with the culturally-isolated country. ‘It’s a good thing because anything that has foreigners interacting, even in the simplest way such as high-fiving, is positive,’ he said. He added, ‘At this marathon any interactions were fleeting. But it was a spectacle and an opportunity for the locals to see hundreds of foreigners and for foreigners to see thousands of North Koreans.’ During his 10km race Mr Kobold ran past landmarks such as the imposing Arch of Triumph and statues of late North Korean leaders Kim il Sung and Kim Jong il. He is staying in the Yanggakdo International Hotel before returning home. Despite Kim’s hatred of the US, and the fact that anti-US rallies regularly take place in Pyongyang, Mr Kobold found that western comforts were available in the hotel. ‘You can easily buy Coca Cola there,’ he said. ‘And I was pleasantly surprised to find Milka chocolate, which is originally from Germany, available.’ However, he said he was more likely to indulge in a few glasses of the local beer, Taedonggang, to celebrate his victory. ‘I’ve been enjoying it – it’s a little spicy but it’d stand up to a pint of Worthington’s,’ he said.

"That's a wrap - Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia came to a close on Thursday night in Sydney, with the Johanna Johnson show bringing the event to a spectacular close with her Hollywood-inspired Sirens' Call presentation. Now that the heels have been kicked off, the cameras put down, and the last bottle of champagne drunk, FEMAIL take a look back at the week, taking note of the trends emerging from the shows, the beautiful designs we can't wait to hang in our wardrobes and the trends we won't be trying any time soon. Some dazzling creations had fashion spectators dreaming of an occasion special enough to warrant a couture price tag, other trends were so wearable we wanted to snap them up straight off the model's backs... while a few were downright bizarre. Make-up trends and accessories threatened to overshadow many of the designs being showcased, with stylists going over the top to stand out with head pieces, masks and other adornments bordering on the ridiculous. The week that was: MBFWA featured loud prints, metallic, intricate detailing in couture masterpieces from highlight shows Romance Was Born (left), Toni Maticevski (L) and Steven Khalil (middle R)... and some very different beauty looks and trends we won't try in real life (R) Bigger was better this week with voluminous silhouettes appearing again and again at some of the star shows, including Maticevski and Michael Lo Sordo. Skin is definitely in - flimsy, sheer fabrics were a fixture on the catwalk, with the front row receiving an eyeful as breasts, backsides and everything else were put on display beneath see-through mesh and lace designs. A key beauty trend on the catwalk appeared to be face bling - both Akira Isogawa and Bondi Bather sent models down the runway with sequins and beads glued to their faces. Meanwhile eyebrow-raising head wear frequently outshone the designs on parade - from perspex masks made to look like plastic bags blowing in the wind, to giant animal heads, and Ned Kelly-inspired head pieces. METALLICS . Shine on: Maticevski (left), Ginger & Smart (middle), and Johanna Johnson (right) wowed with metallic golds and bronzes . Metals were a recurring feature on the catwalk. Head-to-toe gold dazzled at Toni Maticevski, while Johanna Johnson showed full-length skirts. Ginger & Smart's bronze dresses were favourites for their wear-ability off the catwalk. VOLUMINOUS SILHOUETTES . Big is better: Toni Maticevski (left), Ellery (middle), and Michael Lo Sordo (right) all presented voluminous silhouettes . The future is now: Contemporary styles by Maticevski (left and right) and Romance Was Born (middle) were masterpieces of design, wearability is questionable . Big is better - silhouettes went super-sized at many of the highlight shows. Maticevski, Romance Was Born, Ellery and Michael Lo Sordo all presented billowing, voluminous gowns. SLOUCHY COMFORT . Pyjama party: Laid-back, slouchy silhouettes featured in the (L-R) Haryono Setiadi, Gary Bigeni, Tome, and Serpent & The Swan shows will make for a comfortable season . Next season looks to be a comfortable one. As well as the oversized evening wear being showcased, ready-to-wear separates were inspired by bedtime. Haryono Setiadi, Gary Bigeni, Tome, and Serpent & The Swan all presented slouchy, pyjama-style ensembles. COUTURE CREATIONS . Dazzling: Couture creations made a splash - our favourites were seen at (L-R) Galanni, Steven Khalil, and Johanna Johnson . Masterpiece: Betty Tran on Thursday night presented a show-stopping gown . Heavenly show-stopping masterpieces were highlights of the week, with intricate hand-sewn embellishments, fringing, feathers, and sheer fabrics key trends. Johanna Johnson closed the week with a number of beautiful creations, while Steven Khalil, Betty Tran and Galanni also sent incredibly couture down the runway. WE SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU . Peekaboo: Marriam Seddiq (left), Any Step, (middle), and Johanna Johnson (right) gave the front row an eyeful with their revealing designs . Sheer delight: Delicate sheer fabrics left little to the imagination at Mariam Seddiq (left), Kate Sylvester (middle), and Johanna Johnson (right) Things got a little cheeky mid-week, particularly amongst the up-and-coming designers, who strived to stand out during the New Generation and Raffles Showcase presentations. Marriam Seddiq during the St George New Generation show and Any Step during the Raffles International Showcase in particular had the front row blushing, with their see-through creations that put models' bodies on full display. The Any Step show stood out for its bondage-style dress made of only leather straps and buckles. GLADIATORS ARE BACK . Lace it up: Bec & Bridge (left), CS Edit X Kirrily Johnston (middle), and Daniel Avakian (right) all showed knee-high Gladiator sandals . Oh, hello 2008. Your favourite footwear trend is back again. Bec & Bridge and Daniel Akavian accessorised their wares with very similar Gladiator-style lace-up sandals, while the CS Edit X Kirrily Johnston show presented the same in metallic gold. BIZARRE 'BEAUTY' Don't try this at home: One Fell Swoop (left), Akira Isogawa (middle), and Dyspnea (right) tried out some interesting hair and beauty styles that we won't be trying in real life . The beauty looks of the week were met with some head scratching. 'Ugly' beauty, and unusual trends including sequinned faces are styles best left on the catwalk. Hair was repeatedly slicked down, while some hair designers got crafty, creating 'origami' influenced hair style and sectioning off strands of hair to create unique designs (pictured at Dyspnea). ACCESSORISE THIS . Hats off to you: Blue Glue Bikinis (left), Vanessa Moe (middle) and Romance Was Born (right) were in the headlines for their out-there headwear on the runway which included oversized animal heads, perspex masks, and Ned Kelly-inspired headpieces . One-sided: Both Ellery (left and right) and Gail Sorronda (middle) sent models out sporting circular ear pieces on one side . Accessories threatened to overshadow the designs they were intended to complement. Blue Glue Bikinis sent models down the runway wearing oversized animal heads, Vanessa Moe's plastic face masks were a unique touch, while Romance Was Born's quirkiest inclusion in their Australiana-themed presentation was a Ned Kelly-inspired head piece. Both Ellery and Gail Sorronda's models sported circular ear pieces or earrings on one side only. STRONG IS THE NEW SKINNY . Sporty: We Are Handsome made headlines for casting fitness influences instead of regular models for their show (left and right), while Bec & Bridge's debut Swim line show featured healthier models (middle) The We Are Handsome show made headlines when design duo Jeremy and Katinka Somers chose to cast fitness influencers rather than traditional models in their shows. Lindy Klim, along with former Commonwealth Games pole vaulter Amanda Bisk, Australian Ballet star Juliette Burnett, and Yogi and Instagram star Sjana Earp, wowed the crowds as they struck strong poses and modelled the brand's new Activewear range. SPECTACULAR SETTINGS . Unique: The iconic Icebergs pool was drained on Thursday to create a spectacular seaside catwalk for Ten Pieces . Australiana: The Art Gallery of NSW was transformed into a colourful floral setting for the Romance Was Born show . Moving: The Ellery show featured a performance by the Australian Ballet . While most of the shows took place at the Carriageworks venue in Eveleigh, a few designers went rogue, putting on shows in a more spectacular fashion with elaborate sets, locations and stunts. Ellery's opening show featured a performance by the Australian Ballet and Romance Was Born were typically stand-out with their floral setting inside the Art Gallery of New South Wales. But the nod for most scenic setting was Ten Pieces on Thursday, who drained the iconic Icebergs pool to create a stunning seaside catwalk overlooking Bondi. MAKING HEADLINES . Making news: Someone with sticky fingers stole THREE of the tablets gifted to the front row at Maticevski (left), while the fashion crowd followed in the footsteps of Kimye and the Beckhams by bringing children to the shows (right) Highlights and headaches: The opening show on Sunday night by Ellery kicked off proceedings with Gemma Ward's triumphant return to the catwalk (left), but angered a local man who interrupted the catwalk show to complain about the noise (right) The primarily smooth-running week was interrupted on a few occasions which grabbed our attention. Opening night at Ellery got off to a dramatic start, with the audience witnessing the return to the catwalk by home-grown supermodel Gemma Ward. The night took a turn, though, when a disgruntled neighbour stormed the stage complaining about the racket. Australian fashion insiders copied the Beckhams and Kim Kardashian by turning up to the shows with their children in tow, while someone with sticky fingers stole three tablet worth $899 that were intended for front row guests.","Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia 2015 came to a close on Thursday night in Sydney .

"More than 30,000 cases of the country's most popular hummus dip are being recalled after Sabra, the manufacturer, said they could be contaminated with listeria. The company said the total number of containers in the recall comes to 'approximately 30,000.' Only five batches of hummus are being recalled - and only the company's Classic Hummus. 'This measure is limited to five SKUs of Classic Hummus sold nationwide,' Sabra Dipping Co. said in a release. 'To date, no other Sabra product is affected by this recall.' Scroll down to see the batches of hummus being recalled . Listeria concerns have led to thousands of Classic Hummus containers being part of a voluntary recall, Sabra Dipping Co. said Monday . The company said that 'The potential for contamination was discovered when a routine, random sample collected at a retail location on March 30th, 2015 by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes.' The positive test happened at a Kroger in Port Huron, Michigan, a MDARD spokeswoman told the Detroit Free Press. The newspaper reported that Michigan officials contacted both the FDA and inspectors located in Virginia. Sabra has a production plant in Virginia's Chesterfield County. Sabra Dipping Co. said that customers will be refunded if they return the products to stores. Both supermarkets and food service accounts had received products, the company said. The company said 'Listeria monocytogenes is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. 'Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.' The company said it has so far not yet received any sickness reports. On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says about 260 people are killed each year by listeriosis, and about 1600 people get sick. Antibiotics are used on those who get listeriosis. Prevention methods include rigorously washing both produce and kitchen equipment; cleaning kitchen and food storage areas; rigorously cooking poultry and meats; storing food as soon as possible; and avoiding both unpasteurized milk and food products that include it as an ingredient, according to the agency.

"The U.S. teenager facing 15 years in jail for the murder of her mother grinned nervously as she took her baby to court in Bali again today - while maintaining her innocence. Heather Mack,19, smiled and laughed as she cradled her baby Stella - born last month - in a holding cell at the Denpasar District Court as she announced: 'I should not be sent to prison because I'm innocent. 'I haven't murdered anybody. I didn't murder my mother.' She was also filmed singing the Rihanna hit Umbrella as she nursed the infant outside of the courtroom. Heather Mack, pictured smiling behind bars, is accused of the murder of her socialite mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack . The new mother took baby Stella to court with her, who was born last month at a prison hospital . Prosecutors have asked judges in the holiday resort to jail Mack, left with baby Stella, for 15 years and Schaefer, right, for 18 years . Mack has said that she intends to keep Stella with her until the child is two years old . The teenager has previously said that her smile is a 'disguise,' according to the Chicago Tribune. 'If I allow myself to grieve whatsoever I'm in a complete state of depression,' she told the Tribune. 'The smile is actually a disguise I wear to survive here.' Innocent: Baby Stella was born in hospital last month . Both Miss Mack and her boyfriend now face an anxious five days after court officials indicated that the judges would declare their verdict next Tuesday. Chief Prosecutor Eddy Wijaya insisted  that pleas for lighter sentences for the pair, because of their young age and new-born daughter, should be ignored. He argued that the physical evidence in the hotel room and texts between the defendants revealed their dislike of the 62-year-old victim pointed to premeditated murder. Both Mack and Schaefer openly displayed nervousness as they waited to go into court today, aware that the case against them was drawing to a close and the judges were close to announcing sentences. The young mother bit her nails in the holding cell and smiled nervously as cradled her baby and Schaefer chain-smoked as he paced up and down his own cell. At an earlier hearing the prosecution team argued that the murder of her mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack had been premeditated and insisted Mack and Schaefer, should go to prison for 15 and 18 years respectively.. Mack had denied the premeditated murder of the Chicago socialite in the five-star St Regis Hotel, Bali, in August last year. But judges on the holiday island, under Indonesia's legal system, said they accepted the Prosecution's argument of guilt before the defence team had offered their reasons for leniency. Schaefer has admitted unintentionally killing Mrs Mack, telling the court  that he had lashed out while defending himself after Mack's mother grabbed him by the throat in an argument in her hotel room. The panel of three judges accepted the prosecution's argument that Mr Schaefer had intended to murder Mrs Mack when he went to her hotel room because she had racially insulted him and objected to his relationship with her daughter. Her body was found crammed into a suitcase which had been loaded into a taxi with the couple's other luggage at the hotel after they had run out through the beachside exit of the premises. New father: Tommy Schaefer looks dotingly at his young daughter as he is led away from court in handcuffs . Mack drapes her arms across the bars of the holding cell as she waits to be taken into court . Mack, looking bored in her cell, now faces a five day wait to find out her fate . Baby Stella was born by cesarean section last month after Mack was transferred from her prison cell to hospital. Lawyers for both defendants have asked the judges to reject the demands for long prison sentences, insisting the murder was not premeditated but that Mrs Mack was killed amid moments of panic and distress. When asked by reporters about a possible 15 year sentence, Mack replied: 'It's not the verdict today is it?' When pressed about it, she added: 'Less than that (15 years), I'm innocent.' The couple are accused of killing socialite Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, in the five-star St Regis Hotel, Bali, in August last year . After today's hearing the couple were taken back to Kerobokan prison, which, if the judges agree to the prosecutions demands could become their home for the next 15 and 18 years. Mack has already told officials that she intends to keep baby Stella with her in prison for the maximum two years that youngsters are allowed to remain with their mothers. But it is understood that Schaefer's mother, Kia Walker, has been pressuring her to allow the baby, which had to be treated for jaundice within days of her birth, to be taken back to the US.","Heather Mack,19, tells Bali court she did not kill Sheila von Wiese-Mack .

"A sheep farmer has won an apology from supermarket giant Asda after a leg of lamb she bought from them labelled as British turned out to be imported from the other side of the world. Sue Sharp was shocked to find a stamp on the £11 joint saying it had come from New Zealand despite Asda's packaging claiming it was born, reared and slaughtered in the UK. Mrs Sharp, who runs a 1,600-acre sheep farm with her husband Robert, had purposely sought out British produce in support of her fellow farmers. Misleading: The leg of lamb Sue Sharp bought from Asda in Midlothian, Scotland, claims on the packaging that it is from the UK. But a stamp on the meat (pictured) is from the New Zealand health inspector . But she was horrified when she got home and found the 'home-grown' leg of lamb had actually been flown halfway round the world to the store in Midlothian, Scotland. Asda said the mislabelled lamb was a one-off and that the gaffe was the result of human error. But Mrs Sharp has questioned the claim and is now warning other shoppers to be extra vigilant when choosing their joints of meat. The label on the Asda Butcher's Selection leg states it is 'Born in the UK. Reared in the UK. Slaughtered in the UK. Cut in the UK' but a stamp branded onto the animal's skin carries the stamp of the New Zealand health inspector. The error has been called 'unacceptable' by farming unions who are now demanding to meet with bosses at the supermarket chain to discuss their future plans for selling British lamb. Asda says it has carried out an investigation into the mistake which revealed Mrs Sharp's leg of lamb was the only one mislabelled at the Galashiels store she shopped at. Sue Sharp, 57, has refused to accept Asda's explanation that the mistake was a one-off . Mrs Sharp, 57, whose farm has 1,300 sheep, said: 'As a sheep farmer I'm very interested in making sure I buy British meat. 'The lamb I bought from Asda was clearly labelled UK born, UK raised, UK slaughtered. 'It wasn't until I got home and looked at it more closely that I realised the stamp actually on the meat itself said New Zealand. 'It was a bit of a shock and something I feel rather strongly about as a sheep farmer - the last thing I want to do is buy New Zealand lamb. 'I was completely baffled so I wrote to Asda and they came back apologising but saying it was an isolated incident. 'I just don't believe that. I'm sure it was a mistake but I bet there were more, I can't see how just one could have been wrongly labelled.' She added: 'They've held their hands up but is that enough? A big company like Asda should have procedures in place to make that sort of error pretty much impossible to make. 'As farmers we have to deal with traceability. The form-filling is really onerous, and that needs to apply right the way through the chain. 'We are doing our part so you would have thought big companies should be able to do their part. 'I think British meat is a better product, it tastes better, but it's also much better for the environment than shipping it round the world. You couldn't get much farther away than New Zealand.' Mrs Sharp has now advised other people to check their meat thoroughly to make sure it is from where it says it is. John Armour from NFU Scotland said: 'For a sheep farmer like Mrs Sharp to have bought a product she thought would support her fellow British farmers only to discover that it was imported is unacceptable and Asda has acknowledged that. An Asda spokesman said: 'This was an isolated incident where a leg of lamb was accidentally mislabelled' It is estimated that more than 70 per cent of the New Zealand lamb sold in Britain comes from halal slaughterhouses without the fact being declared on the label. All the slaughtermen in these establishments must be Muslim and say a prayer when making the cut across the animal’s throat which kills it. The New Zealand meat industry has taken the step to ensure its lamb can be sold in Muslim markets round the world. In conventional slaughterhouses, animals are stunned before they are killed by having their throats cut. However, in most Muslim countries, halal means the animals must not be stunned first. 'Asda's planned review of practices at the Galashiels store is a sensible step and it would be prudent for guidance to be re-issued to its suppliers and all Asda stores across the country to avoid fresh meat being incorrectly labelled in the future. 'Shoppers who want to support British farmers need to be able to trust the labels used in every supermarket.' He added: 'Thankfully incidents of this kind are rare but the vigilance of Mrs Sharp has provided an excellent reminder to all retailers of the need for best practice and accurate labelling at all times. 'If it says Scottish or British on the label, it must be Scottish or British in the packet.' An Asda spokesman said: 'This was an isolated incident where a leg of lamb was accidentally mislabelled. 'We pride ourselves on product traceability and transparency and are committed to sourcing British products first when in season. 'This was a genuine colleague error for which we apologise and was not meant to mislead any of our customers in any way. 'We've briefed our colleagues at the Galashiels store to make sure this doesn't happen again.'","Sue Sharp shocked to find 'home-grown' leg of lamb from New Zealand .

"This terrifying cache of high-power weapons was allegedly found inside a secret basement bunker in the home of two school bus drivers. Steve and Sarah Nick built up the huge arsenal, including a 50-caliber machine gun, a sniper rifle, and 17,000 rounds of ammunition, after it was claimed they stole more than $50,000. Many of the 30 weapons were legally owned, but the couple, who are said to have links to the Michigan militia, are accused of plundering Mrs Nick's 67-year-old mother's savings to fund the potentially deadly haul. This is the huge weapons arsenal allegedly found inside a secret basement bunker in the home of Steven and Sarah Nick. Pictured: Genessee County Sheriff Robert Pickell with the haul . The couple are facing a combined total of 15 felony charges, according to mlive.com . Police raided their home in Davison Township, Michigan, after concerns were raised by adult protective services in August last year. It is alleged that the husband and wife had gained access to Mrs Nick's severely ill mother's bank account and were writing blank bank cheques to themselves. As well as the huge weapons haul in the basement bunker, officers also discovered a number of bullet proof vests, including one for the couple's nine-year-old daughter. One of the vest had a patch on it that read, 'We kill for peace,' the website reported. Mrs Nick. 32, was employed as a bus driver for the Flint School District and her 33-year-old husband was said to work for Davison Schools. Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell said that his officers had seized all of the weapons. 'It's an issue because they were purchased with stolen money,' Pickell reportedly told mlive.com . Steven Nick, 33, pictured left, and his wife Sarah, 32, pictured right, are facing a combined total of 15 charges . They also face charges in relation to a short-barreled rifle allegedly discovered at the property that did not meet the state minimum length. The sheriff said the well-armed couple were linked to the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia, a group that aim to deter disasters. The Nicks were released on bail and are set to return to court on Thursday.","Steven and Sarah Nick are facing a combined total of 15 felony charges .

"A majority of the public does not want Camilla to become queen if Prince Charles succeeds to the throne, a poll for the Daily Mail reveals today. And the nation is completely split on whether Charles should become king at all. Only 43 per cent believe he should ascend to the throne compared with an almost identical number saying he should stand aside in favour of his elder son Prince William. William and Prince Harry are the most popular members of the Royal Family, closely followed by the Queen and the Duchess of Cambridge. Scroll down for video . A majority of the British public does not want to Camilla (left) to become Queen if the Prince of Wales (right) succeeds to the throne, a Daily Mail poll reveals . Four out of ten people think Prince Charles should give up his right to be king so the crown passes straight to William (pictured with his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge) Prince Andrew languishes at the bottom of the popularity table, with his brother Edward not far ahead. Camilla and Andrew are the only two royals who are more disliked than liked, according to the poll. Despite courtiers’ efforts to have Camilla accepted into the nation’s hearts, 55 per cent are against the Duchess of Cornwall becoming queen when her husband becomes king. This is down from 73 per cent opposition at the time of her wedding to Charles in April 2005, but shows she has yet to win over most of the country. However, she is no longer regarded as the main culprit for the break-up of Charles’s marriage to Princess Diana. The prince himself is held most to blame by 39 per cent, followed by Diana on 13 per cent and Camilla on 12 per cent. There is still great affection for Diana, who died in a Paris car crash 18 years ago, with a substantial majority saying she would have made a better queen than Camilla. Intriguingly, the younger generation is most attached to her even though many of them were not old enough to remember her when she was alive. Among 18 to 24-year-olds, two out of three would have preferred Diana to be queen, while only 3 per cent backed Camilla. Charles’s wedding to Camilla divided the country at the time, and ten years on people remain uncertain about its wider significance for the Royal Family. Fifteen per cent said the marriage had strengthened the monarchy but 24 per cent believed it had weakened it; just over half felt it had no impact. Camilla, 67, was once reviled as the woman whose love affair with Charles, 66, destroyed his relationship with Diana, who was 36 when she died in 1997. Prince William and his son George . Four out of ten people say Prince Charles should give up his right to be king so the crown passes straight to William. Britain is evenly split on the question of whether Charles should succeed to the throne when the Queen dies, the poll reveals. William has the female vote, with 43 per cent of women saying he should be the next monarch compared to 37 per cent of men. Young people are also much more likely to favour the Duke of Cambridge as king, with 53 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds urging his father to step aside. But 43 per cent of the public back Charles to take over from his mother, with a clear majority of over-55s wanting him as Britain’s next monarch. The findings suggest that support for the Prince of Wales to wear the crown may actually have dipped slightly in the past decade. In 2005 a survey found that 53 per cent of people thought he should be king despite his marriage to Camilla, and 43 per cent said he should not. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall outside St George's Chapel, Windsor after their civil wedding in 2004 . Senior officials at Clarence House have nurtured the duchess’s image with carefully chosen public appearances. She has won widespread praise for her charity work, dedication to attending royal functions around the country and emergence as a style icon for older women. The Duchess of Cornwall is patron or president of 85 charities, and has undertaken nearly 1,700 royal engagements in Britain and more than 600 abroad since 2005. Yet the survey reveals how Camilla’s past continues to affect how she is perceived. Just over a third said they had grown to like her more over the past decade, and nearly two-thirds thought Charles was happier with her than he ever was with Diana. Prince Andew languishes at the bottom of the popularity table . But only a quarter felt the Duchess of Cornwall had been a good influence on the Royal Family, and a similar proportion argued that her marriage to the prince had ‘stained’ the royals’ reputation. Four in ten say Charles should give up his right to be king so the crown passes straight to William. Among those aged 18 to 24, that figure rises to 53 per cent. But overall 43 per cent of the public back Charles to take over from his mother, with a clear majority of over-55s wanting him as the next monarch. Support for the monarchy itself remains very high, with the 88-year-old Queen and the younger royals – William, Harry and Kate – hugely popular. By contrast, Prince Andrew was least popular, with only 30 per cent liking him. Charles, Prince Philip and Princess Anne were ranked in the middle. Only 19 per cent would back turning Britain into a republic, although the figure rises to 36 per cent in Scotland, perhaps a by-product of the SNP’s unsuccessful independence campaign last year. Charles, who is said to favour a ‘slimmed down’ monarchy, will be buoyed by the finding that 56 per believe that the royals should be reduced to the Queen’s immediate family only. By law Camilla will automatically become Queen Consort when Charles is king, but privately officials continue to debate whether she should use a lesser title to avoid controversy. The official position has been that she intends to be known as Princess Consort, but in recent years Camilla and Charles have dropped a number of hints that they would like her to be queen. Asked in 2010 whether his wife would take the title, Charles replied: ‘We’ll see, won’t we? That could be.’ The duchess herself says ‘You never know’ when she faces questions about whether she will become queen. Nearly two-thirds of people thought Charles was happier with Camilla than he ever was with Diana (pictured) Princes William and Harry are the most popular members of the royal family, the survey found. Nearly eight out of ten people said they ‘liked’ the princes, with the Duchess of Cambridge and the Queen receiving similarly high ratings. Women were significantly more likely to approve of the younger royals – 84 per cent said they were fans of Prince Harry compared to 75 per cent of men. By contrast, Prince Andrew was the least popular of the royals, with only 30 per cent of respondents saying they liked him. Prince Charles, his father Prince Philip and his sister Princess Anne were ranked in the middle. Camilla divided opinions most sharply. Thirty-four per cent of people said they liked her, but 38 per cent disliked her. The survey did not ask people what they thought of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s son Prince George, who is now nearly two.

"Demand for rubber to make tyres is having a ‘catastrophic’ impact on the world’ s forests, scientists have warned. Up to 21 million acres of jungle will be torn down to make way for rubber plantations in the next decade alone, according to researchers at the University of East Anglia. The demand is putting endangered gibbons, leopards and elephants in south east Asia at risk, a study published in the journal Conservation Letters says. A scene of devastation captured on Indonesia's Borneo island. Endangered species in south east Asia at risk . Lead researcher Eleanor Warren-Thomas said: ‘The tyre industry consumes 70 per cent of all natural rubber grown, and rising demand for vehicle and aeroplane tyres is behind the recent expansion of plantations. ‘But the impact of this is a loss of tropical biodiversity. ‘We predict that between 4.3 and 8.5 million hectares (10.6 - 21 million acres) of new plantations will be required to meet projected demand by 2024. The tyre industry consumes 70 per cent of all natural rubber grown, and rising demand for vehicle and aeroplane tyres is behind the recent expansion of plantations . ‘This will threaten significant areas of Asian forest, including many protected areas.’ She said many protected areas have already been lost to rubber plantations - including three-quarters of the Snoul Wildlife Sanctuary in Cambodia, which was cleared for rubber between 2009 and 2013. Miss Warren-Thomas added: ‘In Cambodia, forest areas earmarked for further rubber plantations contain critically endangered water birds like the White Shouldered Ibis, globally threatened mammals like Eld’s deer and Banteng, and many important primates and carnivores. ‘Macaques and gibbons are known to disappear completely from forests which have been converted to rubber.

"Nicola Sturgeon was booed last night as she refused to rule out holding a second independence vote in the next few years – despite having earlier claimed 2014’s referendum was a ‘once in a generation’ event. Two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: ‘We have always said it’s a once in a generation thing.’ But last night, in an election debate on Scottish TV, she said she respected last year’s result, and said she would not call for another plebiscite in the SNP manifesto for the Westminster election in May. Scroll down for video . Support: Asked by Mr Murphy (left) where she 'wanted' Mr Miliband to be prime minister, Ms Sturgeon (right) said: 'I'm offering to help make Ed Miliband prime minister. I don't want to see the Tories in Downing Street' Power: The result of the election this May is set to put Ms Sturgeon in a powerful position at Westminster, with the chance of choosing which party can form a government. Above, the SNP leader at tonight's debate . She said she would not rule out such a call in the manifesto for the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, saying: ‘That’s another matter.’ The admission sparked howls of derision from the audience. The Scottish first minister was accused of holding Britain to ‘ransom’ after she said she was ‘offering to make Ed Miliband prime minister’. She said she wanted to wanted to do a deal with Mr Miliband so she can influence the policies of a Labour government and keep it ‘honest’. Reacting to Miss Sturgeon’s offer to prop up Mr Miliband, Labour’s leader in Scotland, Jim Murphy, said: ‘Nicola, we don’t need your help. Reacting to Miss Sturgeon’s offer to prop up Mr Miliband, Labour’s leader in Scotland, Jim Murphy, said: ‘Nicola, we don’t need your help. ‘What we need is people north and south of the border, people in Scotland, people in England and people in across Wales coming together to kick out an out of touch government.’ He pleaded with the audience to claim that Labour can only beat the Conservatives if people vote for Mr Miliband in Scotland. ‘Only Labour is big enough, only Labour is strong enough to beat the Tories and their austerity,’ he said. Debate: From left to right, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie . Plan: Speaking in the debate for STV, Ms Sturgeon (right) said wanted Scots to vote SNP rather than Labour because 'we can make sure Labour keeps its promises'. Left, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy . Grant Shapps, Conservative Party chairman said: ‘Tonight Nicola Sturgeon has promised that she’d prop up a minority Labour government – and hold Great Britain to ransom, vote by vote, policy by policy. ‘And that means more debt, higher taxes and the end of Trident – wreaking havoc on our economy and putting the security of British people and their families at risk. ‘Weak Ed Miliband doesn’t stand a chance. He’s in the pocket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon: and you’ll pay the price.’ The SNP is way ahead in the polls north of the border, and Labour is expected to lose dozens of seats in May’s election. The result is set to put Miss Sturgeon in a powerful position at Westminster, with the chance of choosing which party can form a government. She said she would never prop up a David Cameron government, but would help Mr Miliband get into Downing Street. But she said the polls showed that Labour could not beat the Tories on their own. Speaking in the debate for STV, Miss Sturgeon said wanted Scots to vote SNP rather than Labour because ‘if there’s a strong block of SNP MPs, we can make sure Labour keeps its promises. ‘Tony Blair was elected on a wave of hope and optimism, but his Labour government began the process of NHS privatisation. ‘I don’t want to see a Labour government simply implement Tory policies. Heading for success: The SNP is ahead in the polls north of the border, and Labour is expected to lose dozens of seats in the election. Above, Ms Sturgeon, second from right, during the debate tonight . ‘We need to send a strong team to make sure Labour get it; so we can keep Labour honest.’ She said: ‘We will work with Labour to keep David Cameron out of Downing Street. Labour is not offering an alternative to Tory austerity. ‘I stood on a platform last week in the UK leaders debate with Ed Miliband and I heard Miliband say if Labour is elected and left to their own devices there will be further spending reductions. ‘I don’t want to see further spending reductions, I don’t think the country can afford them. That’s why we’re proposing modest spending increases and with SNP influence we can force Labour down that path.' The Scottish first minister has already said offered to work with Labour to keep the Tories out of power if this is possible in a hung parliament. ‘I’ve said to Ed Miliband and I’ll say to Jim Murphy this evening, that if there is an anti-Tory majority in the House of Commons after the election, even if the Tories are the biggest party we will work with Labour to keep David Cameron out of Downing Street.’ Asked by Mr Murphy where she ‘wanted’ Mr Miliband to be prime minister, she said: ‘I’ don’t want David Cameron to be prime minister; I’m offering to help make Ed Miliband prime minister.’ Mr Murphy replied: ‘Nicola, we don’t need your help. ‘What we need is people north and south of the border, people in Scotland, people in England and people in across Wales coming together to kick out an out of touch government.’ He claimed he believe Labour would win, saying: ‘Even when my football team plays Barcelona, I don’t expect us to lose. ‘David Cameron ain’t no Lionel Messi – he can be beaten. ‘Any seat that Labour loses in Scotland reduces the chances of Ed Miliband becoming prime minister.’ Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said the SNP’s position – urging Scots to vote against Labour and also promising to prop up a Labour government – was illogical. ‘Vote for what you want,’ she said. Audience members attending live political events occasionally catch the eye of the public. And last night was no different as a man wearing a fake moustache during the Scottish leaders’ debate caused Twitter to erupt. The man was filmed wearing a thick fake black moustache and large fedora hat as the four main political parties took part in a televised TV debate. Many social media users posted pictures of the blond-haired man on Twitter and questioned the authenticity of his facial hair. Others started a campaign to find the unnamed man and used the hashtag #moustacheman. The identity of the joker was later revealed as a man named as Danny McAfee, the father of Jack McAfee, who tweeted a picture of him without the disguise. A photo also emerged of the man posing with Nicola Sturgeon after the debate. Moustache man: The man, dressed in fake facial hair and a fedora, was spotted in the debate audience .

"Police are offering a £5,000 reward for information on the whereabouts of a 'very dangerous' convicted murderer who is on the run after being released from jail on licence. William Kerr, 53, is believed to have travelled to London after disappearing from approved premises in Hull. He was released on licence in January after spending 17 years in jail for the murder of Maureen Comfort, who was found dead in 1996. Hunt: There is a £5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of convicted killer William Kerr, pictured . Crimestoppers is now offering a reward for information that leads to the arrest of Kerr - who police said must return to prison 'as a matter of urgency'. A spokesman said: 'Police have described Kerr as a very dangerous man and it is urgent that he is returned to prison after this breach of his licence. Victim: Maureen Comfort was found dead in January 1996 after being murdered by Kerr and Christopher Moody . 'We understand that it might be someone that knows him personally who is aware of where he is, and for that reason, I would urge you to contact Crimestoppers, completely anonymously, safe in the knowledge nobody will ever know you spoke to us. 'Do the right thing and tell us where Kerr is.' North Yorkshire Police have previously warned members of the public not to approach him but to call 999 if they spot him. Officers believe Kerr, who has links to the Humberside and West Yorkshire areas, may attempt to book in to a hostel in London under a false name. He was released from HMP Stocken in Rutland on January 23, and police announced last week that he had gone missing. Appealing directly to Kerr, Detective Inspector Eamonn Clarke of North Yorkshire Police said: 'William, you know you have breached your licence conditions, and by continuing to do so you are only making things worse. It is now time to do the right thing and hand yourself in to the police.' Kerr, who speaks with a Scottish accent, was jailed along with Christopher Moody for the murder of 43-year-old Maureen Comfort, whose body was found in a cupboard in her flat in Leeds. She was last seen alive on December 4, 1995, and her strangled body was found by relatives on January 8, 1996. To qualify for the reward, anyone with information should contact Crimestoppers directly over the phone or online.","William Kerr, 53, was convicted of murdering Maureen Comfort .

"Psychologists and wellness experts have long-known that we're at our happiest when we're doing the things we love. But, according to one new study, a third of Australian women are not finding time for their hobbies and passions. The survey of 1,025 Australian parents, conducted by Officeworks, found that more women had foregone personal interests for work commitments or to finance 'more important' things in the last week, than had men. The cost, says clinical psychologist and Happiness Institute wellness expert Dr Paula Watkins, will be our happiness - and potentially that of our children. According to a recent study of more than 1,000 Australian parents, a third of Australian women are not finding time for their hobbies, choosing work and 'more important things' over their passions . 'We know that we tend to gravitate towards hobbies and interests that use our best strengths but a lot of the other things we do in our lives, including work, do not,' Dr Watkins told Daily Mail Australia. 'This is why it's so important for us to consciously do more of the things that bring us joy.' Dr Watkins says changing work spaces and technology do contribute to stress and brain overload. 'We know that we’re filling life with more info, we know that technology has so many pros - but the information we’re exposed to grows exponentially,' she says. 'We have to look at how we can break up a day at work  because its abnormal for a brain to focus on a screen for 8 plus hours a day.' 'Remember the brain is wired to pay attention, the brains will just keep processing information to the point of exhaustion, so we actually have to take more care of ourselves. Otherwise, we run the risk of over-stressing our brains, by actually not doing very much.' Clinical psychologist and Happiness Institute Wellness Expert Dr Paula Watkins says its important to create space for the things we love to be happy . One interesting finding to come out of the recent survey, Dr Watkins says, is that twenty per cent of women are inspired to start new hobbies through social media. 'Being inspired is a great thing, so long as that translates into our real lives,' she says. 'If it doesn't, it can actually add another layer of stress.' 'What we're seeing is that women could actually be more inspired than ever before, right at the time that we're also more time poor.' So how can we create more space in our lives for the things we love? Dr Watkins says its important to be pragmatic. 'We have to look at our lives and ask: ""what can go?""' she says. 'It's not about loading more onto our lives, we've all done that, if we're going to add something in, something else has to go, or we're just going to feel overloaded.' Spending time doing things you love with friends has the advantage of the 'accountability' factor, Dr Watkins says. Dr Watkins also emphasises the importance of being organised. 'Get prepared,' she says. 'Whatever your hobby or interest is, recognise that you're actually going to need the gear to do it. 'Next time an unexpected pocket of free time opens up, you can take advantage of it if you've got the craft stuff you need at hand, for example, or your runners under your desk at work.' Other tips include spending more time sharing your passions with friends - this has the added 'accountability factor' -  and giving to others, perhaps by volunteering your time to others. 'Make a list, then pick one or pick two things you love– you can shelve the other stuff  for another time - it’s there, the seed has been planted,' Dr Watkins says . Finally, Dr Watkins says women should include their 'little people' in the things they love because hobbies and passions are created in childhood. Another worrying statistic that was revealed in the Officeworks survey is that 85 per cent of younger Australians, specifically GenY respondents, said they have also stopped pursing interests that they are passionate about because they feel they should be spending money on 'more important things' or using their time to complete work or home duties. According to Dr Watkins, the current situation of parents failing to pursue the things they love is concerning for generations to come because it sets a dangerous cultural norm in Australia. Pursuing past-times and creative outlets has a positive impact on children, she says and promotes healthy lifestyle choices for teenagers and young adults. 1. Lighten your load . Prioritising your commitments and saying ‘no’ occasionally can free up your time. 2. Use your breaks . Lunch breaks, coffee runs or public transport commutes provide you with opportunities to take time out. 3. Be prepared . Being prepared can help you take advantage of opportunities. Carry your camera with you, store a journal in your bag, leave a pair of running shoes at work. 4. Commute creatively . Create a Pinterest board on your tablet (like an iPad), discover new artists on Spotify or read a magazine about your hobby. 5. Include friends . Combining your social commitments with your passion is a great way to go. It help enhance your feeling of connectedness with your peers while providing you a creative or physical outlet. 6. Prioritise passions . Focus your efforts on one or two interests at a time. Remember, you can revisit other projects later when you have more free time. 7. Pledge a commitment . Joining a club or engaging a coach to mentor you will do two things: continually motivate you and challenge you to further develop your skills. 8. Involve your little people . Many of our hobbies begin in childhood, so share yours with the little people in your life. Childhood is all about learning and exposing your children to new activities. It helps their brain strengthen old connections and make new ones. 9. Make it work . With only 9% of Aussies admitting they’re very happy at work, it’s time to get creative and find ways to enhance your workplace. Instead of attending another office meeting, suggest a walking meeting or build staff members’ hobbies into team-building activities. 10. Gifts that give . Try volunteering or coaching to stay connected to your passion. When you commit your time to others, you’re more likely to leave work on time and prioritise your hobbies.","A third of Australian women are not making time for hobbies and passions .

"The other day I was driving past the port at Bristol and I saw all those thousands of cars lined up on the quayside – and whoa… I did a double take. There they were: phalanx upon phalanx of shiny new vehicles glinting like Dinky toys in the sun; and I suddenly realised that they weren’t arriving in this country. These cars hadn’t just disembarked from France or Germany or Japan. They were about to make their own journey overseas – they were British cars, for goodness sake. They were examples of British manufacturing and design and engineering – and they were about to be loaded on to ships and taken to other European countries, and to Africa, and Asia; and I reflected on one of the most stunning turnaround stories in the economic history of this country. Scroll down for video . Britain last year produced more than 1.5 million cars – the most since 2007 – and we are poised to overtake France and become the second biggest car manufacturing power in Europe. Across the West Midlands – and indeed across the country – there are now literally thousands of businesses, large and small, that are engaged in automotive innovation and supply; and there was a time when no one would have believed that was possible. I remember the 1970s. You, too, may remember that mullet- haired decade. The music was superb, the food was mediocre, and British industry was on its knees. I remember when our motor manufacturing industry was in the hands of ‘conveners’ and ‘shop stewards’, and when the man who ran British Leyland – then our biggest car company – appeared to be an avowedly communist trade union official called Red Robbo. When I was a child I am afraid to say that British cars were the butt of international derision. They leaked oil, and they were generally assembled with such slovenly imprecision they gained a reputation for unreliability that it has taken decades to shake off. Lemon after lemon rolled off our production lines, culminating in the ludicrous rustbucket called the Austin Allegro – and there was a reason for the disaster. Boris Johnson: The problem with Ed Miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s . We had atrocious relations between management and unions, and a legal framework that gave all the power to the unions. We had a Labour government that believed companies existed not to serve the needs of the market, or the desires of their customers – but to satisfy the rights of their workers. We had an era of tea breaks and ‘demarcation disputes’ and closed shops and one-out-all-out strikes, with the Labour government trying to impose such insane solutions as Tony Benn’s communist-style motorbike ‘collective’ at Meriden. It did not work then, and it seems to me to be deranged that we could be even contemplating going back to such arrangements now. I am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the Labour Party manifesto is my former adversary Ken Livingstone, who has long been on the Bennite wing. By Ed Miliband’s own admission, Livingstone has been a big influence in his thinking – and in their return to the Benn/Livingstone approach Labour’s plans are truly nightmarish for business and enterprise. Miliband is turning the Labour Party sharply back to the Left, and actively repudiating the chief insight of Tony Blair – that the party can only be successful if it makes a sensible accommodation with capitalism and the market economy. That is why British business people are so unanimous in their horror, including many former Labour supporters and donors. They are not wrong. Labour wants to hit small- and medium- sized businesses with more corporation tax and higher national insurance – but it is worse than that. 'I am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the Labour Party manifesto is my former adversary Ken Livingstone' They want to recreate the stifling environment of the 1970s, in which management was deprived of the ability to manage. They want to make it easier for employees to take firms to employment tribunals – when you might think the system was already out of control, with people endlessly and automatically and indeed very often vexatiously claiming racial or sexual or age or disability discrimination. They want all companies with more than 50 employees to have a system of profit-sharing – a return to Bennery – and they want the workers to be able to block takeovers. That is before you have even begun to calculate the impact of their attacks on the City, higher income tax, and the higher interest rates that small firms would have to cope with – the result of Labour’s failure to tackle the deficit. What makes this anti-capitalist agenda so dangerous is that the British motor manufacturing industry is not in the hands of a few giant firms. We are talking about huge numbers of often tiny companies – firms that pride themselves on making a more efficient windscreen-wiper or a quieter air-conditioning unit or a more easily wipeable dashboard fascia. It is incredible but true that Britain now has more specialised motor manufacturing marques than any country on earth – Lotus, McLaren, Bristol, Morgan, Caterham, TVR… the list goes on. Think of London’s new hop-on hop-off Routemaster bus, a glorious piece of low-carbon technology and one of the greenest new buses on the market – made in Northern Ireland by Wrightbus. The West Midlands is once again the epicentre of one of the world’s densest ecosystems of motor manufacturing and development. British brands have shed their 1970s reputations; they are taking on the world and winning. How mad, how tragic, that this extraordinary British triumph should be faced with a Labour government that regards capitalism as ‘predatory’. The problem with Ed Miliband is not his method of consuming a bacon sarnie – in fact I totally sympathise on that one. The problem with Ed Miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s, writes Boris Johnson . The problem is not even that he crashed the economy last time, though he did. He and Balls were at the controls in Downing Street when this country experienced the worst economic catastrophe in living memory – a catastrophe that was gravely exacerbated by their irresponsible fiscal policies. The problem with Ed Miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s. He genuinely thinks France is the model we should emulate, when the French – whatever the splendours of their civilisation – have 12 per cent unemployment, and when huge numbers of the most talented French people have decided that they wish France was more like Britain. How many Brits work in Paris? 16,000. How many French men and women live and work in London? About 400,000. Mais oui. That should tell Miliband all he needs to know about the relative dynamism and competitiveness of the two economies. Labour wants to go back to the 1970s, Ukip to some non-existent version of a monochrome 1950s, the Greens would like to go back to the middle of the stone age, and the Lib Dems would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls. There is only one party presenting itself for election on May 7 that seems to believe in the genius of this country, and that has a plan to take it forward. The Lib Dems under Nick Clegg would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls . It is only the Conservatives that understand the real economic and social significance of all those British cars lined up at Bristol. They aren’t the results of an evil and predatory system, by which workers are exploited and the boss class luxuriate in ever greater privilege. They are the fruits of a long and painful post-war period in which Britain has learned that in order to survive we must innovate and compete, and that we cannot hope to compete if we over-tax and over-regulate in the way that Ed Miliband is proposing. Those British-made vehicles are the sign of an economy that is back on its feet after the Labour-made disaster of 2008-9, in which motor manufacturing fell by half a million cars; an economy that has seen the creation, since 2010, of about two million jobs. And those glistening British cars at the Bristol docks therefore embody the great moral purpose of wealth creation – because it is only if you have a strong and vibrant economy that you can hope to raise the tax to pay for roads and schools and hospitals and pensions and welfare – not to speak of strong defences – and all the other civilised objectives that we want to meet. I really don’t think Miliband gets that. He is one of those theoretical socialists who thinks the problem with socialism is it has never been properly tried; and I am horrified at the idea he should be given another go. There is only one party presenting itself for election on May 7 that believes that on the whole today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow is going to be better than today. That is David Cameron and the Conservatives. We need five more years to entrench this economic recovery, five years to take this country forwards and not backwards. That is the Battle for Britain next month, and one this country can’t afford to lose.","Boris Johnson issues rally cry to defeat Ed Miliband in ‘Battle For Britain’

"Joe Anderson, 56, the Mayor of Liverpool, claimed £4,500 per year from Chesterfield High School, Merseyside, despite doing nothing for pupils . A Labour mayor who campaigned against austerity while being paid an £80,000 salary took  £4,500 per year from a school where he previously worked, despite doing nothing for pupils. Joe Anderson, 56, the Mayor of Liverpool, attempted to justify the payments by saying he provided the school with 'kudos' for being linked to him. And when Chesterfield High School in Crosby, Merseyside, stopped the payments in 2011, he attempted to sue them, claiming discrimination because of his 'philosophical belief' in public service. The details of the case, published in The Times, came after Mr Anderson rejected an employment tribunal ruling against him and took his case to appeal, which was also rejected. In the most recent case, Judge Daniel Serota ruled that outsiders would consider the payments a 'misapplication of public monies ' and that the school was right to stop them. He added that he had repeatedly asked Mr Anderson's lawyers to state what benefits the school got in return for their cash. He said: 'The only answer that I received was that it gave 'kudos' to the school.' Mr Anderson had been a senior learning mentor at the school from 2001, when he was already a Liverpool councillor. He eventually rose through the ranks to become full-time leader of the council in 2010, effectively stopping his role as a mentor, but he continued taking payments from his former employer. When the school became an academy in 2011, and therefore had greater freedom over its finances, it ceased paying Mr Anderson, leading to his discrimination claim. Mr Anderson, who is paid an £80,000 salary, tried to sue the school (pictured) for discrimination after it stopped the payments, saying he was being punished for a 'philosophical belief' in public service . Mr Anderson said that his claim was no about getting more money, but about protecting his lucrative public sector pension pot. A tribunal ruled that Mr Anderson was unfairly dismissed, but that it was '100 per cent likely' the school would have sacked him following a consultation, so he was not entitled to compensation. It also ruled that, while Mr Anderson's belief in public service is a protected status, he had not been discriminated against.","Joe Anderson, 56, earns £80,000 in full-time job as the Mayor of Liverpool .

"Since it was revealed that Andreas Lubitz – the co-pilot who purposefully crashed Germanwings Flight 9525, killing 150 people – had been treated for psychiatric illness, a debate has ensued over whether privacy laws regarding medical records should be less strict when it comes to professions that carry special responsibilities. It has been widely argued that Germany's privacy laws were to blame for the tragedy. The Times, for example, ran an article with the headline: 'German obsession with privacy let killer pilot fly.' Similarly, another article published in TIME said: 'German privacy laws let pilot 'hide' his illness from employers.' While Dirk Fischer, German lawmaker and the transport spokesman for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), called for airlines to have mandatory access to pilots' medical records, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, president of the German Medical Association (BÄK), disagreed. Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who purposefully crashed Germanwings Flight 9525, killing 150 people, had been treated for a psychiatric illness, it later emerged. The discovery sparked a debate over whether airlines should be given greater access to pilots' medical records . Mr Montgomery believes that current laws are appropriate, since aviation doctors are already relieved of their duties of confidentiality if they think a pilot could put other people's lives at risk. If Lubitz's doctor did not alert Germanwings, it must have been because Lubitz did not seem like a threat. There are two arguments for why Lubitz's doctor did the right thing by not disclosing Lubitz's depression to his employer. First, functional doctor-patient relationships depend on trust. If confidentiality between patients and doctors is breached, patients will no longer trust their doctors. And a lack of trust will lead (at least some) patients to hide some of their symptoms or refrain from seeking medical attention altogether for fear of bad consequences, such as stigmatisation and work-related penalties. More dangerous than a pilot with a mental illness – or any number of other professions that carry the responsibility of a great many lives – is that one with a mental illness who will not seek treatment because he does not trust his doctor. For these reasons, philosopher Kenneth Kipnis goes even further. The passenger jet crashed in Seyne-les-Alpes, France while en route from Barcalona to Dusseldorf. All 150 people on board were killed on impact . He argues that confidentiality should be 'far closer to an absolute obligation that it has generally taken to be' and that doctors should honour confidentiality even in cases where the patient might harm a third party. If patients come to doctors for help, doctors have a chance at avoiding a possible catastrophe. Strict German privacy laws which prevented doctors treating Andreas Lubitz from telling his airline about his 'suicidal tendencies' were introduced as a consequence of the Nazis. The Germanwings pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week's Alps disaster. But German law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash. The findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in Germany on a patient's right to privacy, with Chancellor Angela Merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law. Draconian legislation was initially brought in after World War Two to prevent a repeat of government spying during the Nazi era and subsequently the Stasi secret police in East Germany. This extends far beyond confidential medical data, however, to stringent protection of someone's identity, meaning many German publications only referred to Lubitz as Andreas L, even after his death. Further data protection laws traced back to 1907, which enshrines the 'right to your own picture', also mean images can only be published with the individual's consent. With respect to medical data, the criminal code means doctors are only allowed to breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent 'a particularly serious crime' or a threat to someone's life. They can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy, but up to five years in jail for withholding 'credible information about the planning or commission' of serious acts like murder. Despite the variation in sentences, doctors have tended to favour the individual's privacy. Many in Germany are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor-patient privilege. If patients lose trust in doctors and do not ask for help, nothing will be gained – patients will remain afflicted by their illnesses and people who might be put at risk by patients will remain at risk. In the days before the crash, Lubitz searched online both for medical treatments and for ways to commit suicide, which suggests he was undecided as to what to do. So another way of thinking about his scenario is that perhaps if he had trusted his doctor even more – and shared with him or her the way in which he was thinking of committing suicide – his doctor could have done more to help him and to protect the passengers of the aircraft he piloted. Lubitz's doctor also did the right thing by not revealing his depression to Germanwings because his depression was far from obviously related to his crime. Simon Wessely, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and an adviser to the British army, said that 'there isn't a link between depression and aggressive suicide'. Jürgen Margraf, psychologist and professor at Bochum University, likewise told NBC News that, given the sheer weight of numbers involved, you are far less likely to be harmed by a person with depression than by a person without depression. 'The chances of killing others are higher for non-depressed than for depressed people,' he said. Furthermore, given the lack of relationship between depression and the pilot's crime, it was not obviously in the public's interest to know about Lubitz's depression and morally questionable that his medical history of depression has been exposed so freely. In Germany, medical confidentiality is supposed to be valid after death. Publicly disclosing Lubitz's ailment harms the public trust in doctor-patient confidentiality after death – and it may stigmatise people who are suffering from depression but who would never hurt anyone (but themselves). The avoidable deaths of 150 people is a calamity and it makes sense to have a public debate about how to prevent future similar events from happening. Luckily, breaching confidentiality and endangering relationships between patients and doctors is not the only answer. Along with the crucially important rule of having two people in the cockpit at all times (which violates nobody's privacy), one medical measure to avoid future catastrophes is to notify employers of stay-home orders from doctors for employees who have high-responsibility jobs without mentioning the cause of the incapacitation. Lubitz reportedly had a sick note for the day he flew but never told the airline. If they had been aware of the sick note things might have been different.","Andreas Lubitz crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 into the French Alps, killing himself as well as the other 149 people on board the flight .

"Half of hospitals in England are allowing patients to jump NHS queues for cataract surgery if they pay for it themselves, new figures reveal (file picture) Half of hospitals are letting patients jump NHS queues for cataract surgery if they pay for it themselves, an investigation has revealed. Some are charging up to a ‘shameful’ £2,700 for one eye – treble what it costs the health service – raising suspicions that they are ripping off elderly patients. Cataract treatment is being rationed in England to save money, even though the NHS recently announced it would fund weight-loss surgery for 15,000 obese adults every year at a cost of £6,000 each. Yesterday the Mail revealed how millions was being wasted on prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Many NHS trusts have imposed arbitrary rules to determine who is eligible for cataract treatment, and patients who cannot read, sew or watch television are routinely turned away. Those patients who do meet the strict criteria often have to wait eight months for treatment, over which time their eyesight deteriorates further and impairs basic tasks and hobbies. Freedom of Information responses from 78 hospital trusts in England obtained by the Mail found that 41 offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery themselves. The operation usually costs the NHS between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700. Campaigners accused hospitals of profiting from elderly patients. Clara Eaglen, from the Royal National Institute of Blind People, said: ‘It’s shameful that people are being asked to consider funding their own treatment when they are entitled to it for free, and in a timely manner, on the NHS. Scroll down for video . ‘We strongly believe that everyone who has a sight-threatening condition deserves early access to treatments.’ Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘In the last few years it has become harder to access cataract surgery as people are forced to wait for their sight to significantly deteriorate before getting help. ‘It is extremely worrying if people whose sight is starting to fail feel the only way to get help quickly is to pay for it. ‘Cataracts are extremely debilitating and treatment should be based on a clinical need not age or bank balance.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association, added: ‘The NHS belongs to the people, and all patients have the right to access appropriate treatment at the right time and in the right setting, irrespective of their ability to pay; we cannot and should not have a two-tier NHS.’ In England, 41 hospital trusts said they offered patients the opportunity to pay for cataract surgery. The operation costs the NHS about between £800 and £900 per eye, but some trusts are charging up to £2,700 . More than half of over-65s suffer from cataracts, which are cloudy patches in the lens that make vision blurred or misty. Sight can be restored in a simple 45-minute operation, with doctors using ultrasound waves to break up the cataract. Most hospitals charge patients between £700 and £1,000 per eye for cataract treatment and say the money is spent on improving services. But this rises to £2,552 at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey and £2,700 at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust in Kent. Several trusts actively encourage patients to ‘self-fund’. The University Hospital Southampton’s website informs patients that ‘surgery will be offered much sooner than the usual NHS wait’. It adds: ‘Our cataract choice service offers a new option, between the traditional private sector and the NHS, bringing private healthcare within the reach of many more people.’ Yeovil District Hospital in Somerset says its private cataract service will ‘help you get back to the things you love’. Patients at North Cumbria are offered free parking and a daily newspaper, while at Frimley Park they can choose from an ‘exclusive a la carte menu’, which includes whitebait and chicken goujons.","Half of hospitals in England let patients jump queues if they pay for surgery .

"Covering aircraft in blue lights, and only turning them on when beginning to take off, could help stop birds colliding with aircraft. That’s according to a study, which found that birds responded to lights in different ways than a human might. The researchers said runways could be synced with taxiing aircraft, to help capture birds’ attention before an aircraft takes off. The study was conducted by scientists at Purdue University in Indiana. They were investigating how to reduce bird to aircraft collisions by keeping birds away from planes (stock image shown). Research showed that birds responded most to blue lights on planes . The study, by scientists at Purdue University in Indiana and the National Wildlife Research Centre in Ohio, was published in The Condor: Ornithological Applications. They were seeking to find a solution to the problem of birds colliding with aircraft, which causes £480 million ($700 million) worth of damage in the US alone. The FAA estimates that bird strikes have resulted in 200 worldwide deaths since 1988. They are dangerous to aircraft because birds can be sucked into a jet engine and strike an engine fan blade. That impact knocks out a single blade and can trigger a domino effect, resulting in engine failure. Incidents are most common shortly before landing or take-off when the jet engines are at top speed. A 12lb (five kg) goose striking an aircraft going 150 mph (240 km/h) at lift-off generates the force of a 1,000lb (450kg) weight dropped from a height of 10ft (three metres), according to Bird Strike Committee USA. Despite this, the number of accidents involving civil aircraft is low, estimated at one fatal accident in one billion flying hours. Around 65 per cent of bird strikes cause little damage to aircraft, but the blow is usually fatal to the bird. In experiments, they studied how flocks of cowbirds responded to model aircraft. They found that blue light was the most noticeable by birds, so they outfitted the aircraft in this colour. When the plane was stationary, the birds became alert more quickly when the lights were on. But when it approached them with its lights off, their response slowed - and they only became more alert when the lights were turned on. And the birds were also more likely to get out of the way of the aircraft when the lights were pulsing, rather than being continuous. The authors suggest that runways could be synced with aircraft to alert birds to incoming planes and avoid collisions. The lights could be off during taxiing but on during take-off, to help the birds move out of the way of the fast-moving planes. And they say their method could even help birds avoid collisions with buildings and wind turbines by also covering them in blue lights.

He was deported by the Turkish authorities and flown back to Britain on a plane packed with holidaymakers last night. Ahmed and eight of his relatives - including four children ranging from a one-year-old baby to an 11-year-old - were stopped on the Turkish border with Syria on April 1. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Waheed Ahmed, the 21-year-old son of a Labour councillor, has been held at Birmingham Airport after returning for allegedly trying to sneak into Syria with eight members of his family (pictured in Turkey) Convoy: Ahmed was seen being moved by Turkish police on Sunday and then put on a Monarch-operated Flight from Dalaman which landed at Birmingham Airport at 12.14am today . They were arrested by Turkish police within walking distance of the border with Syria in the town of Reyhanli earlier this month. Ahmed was filmed leaving Antakya police station in the Hatay Province in southern Turkey and getting on a coach to Antalya, which is 500 miles to the west, on Sunday. And he is believed to have arrived back in the UK on Monarch-operated Flight ZB 909 from Dalaman which landed at Birmingham Airport at 12.14am today. Greater Manchester Police said they are working to ensure the safe return of the rest of the group, which included four children aged one, three, eight and 11. In a statement, the force said: 'In the early hours of Tuesday 14 April 2015, a 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of Commission, Preparation or Instigation of acts of Terrorism at Birmingham Airport'.

Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed arriving back at his home today bur he refused to comment on his son's arrest . Fellow passengers said they were held in their seats before a man thought to be Ahmed, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was whisked off the plane. One man who was on the flight said: 'We landed and taxied to the terminal and then there was an announcement over the tannoy. 'It said someone needed special assistance and we had to remain in our seats. 'Then a plain-clothed policeman got on the plane and escorted someone off. It was quite far away from me so I couldn't make out what they looked like. 'There were other police officers on the tarmac too and they got into a car and drove off. It all happened very quickly.' Other travellers said they saw a police van and car driving away from a side exit at the airport shortly after the plane landed. The student's father, Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed - who has been pictured with party leader Ed Miliband - previously said he wanted his son 'to come home as soon as possible'. Mr Ahmed, who sits on Rochdale Borough Council, thought his son had been in Birmingham on a work placement when he discovered that he had been detained in Turkey. Police searched the councillor's home earlier this month for clues about why Ahmed had travelled to the country. In a statement Councillor Shakil Ahmed said: 'My son is a good Muslim and his loyalties belong to Britain, so I don't understand what he's doing there. 'If I thought for a second that he was in danger of being radicalised, I would have reported him to the authorities. 'He's studying a degree in politics and sociology at Manchester University and has a good future ahead of him.'

"Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, died after he and a colleague got into difficulties battling a fire started at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter on July 13, 2013 . A 16-year-old girl charged with arson after she discarded a cigarette causing a city centre shop blaze which claimed the life of a firefighter had the charge dropped today after a judge said she was 'guilty only of being careless'. Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, lost his life tackling the inferno which began at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter almost two years ago. The girl - who was just 15 at the time - is said to have dropped a cigarette to the floor while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight. She was originally charged with arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered, but was cleared having been due to stand trial on Monday. After more than a year of legal wrangling, with scientists initially stating that the fire could not have been started accidentally, further investigation led to the conclusion a discarded cigarette could have been the cause. More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as frightened passers-by watched on. Father-of-two Mr Hunt, of Whitefield, Manchester, and another fireman, got into difficulties while tackling the fire and they were rushed to hospital where Mr Hunt was pronounced dead. At Manchester Crown Court, prosecutor Alexander Leach said thin and damaged cardboard boxes and paper labels stored behind the fire door at the business may well have caught fire if a cigarette was discarded. He said: 'Combined with the suggestion that boxes may have been on top of the smouldering cigarette, compressing and containing the heat, this made it more likely items would ignite. The salon was totally gutted when an inferno started by a discarded cigarette ripped through it. The 16-year-old girl who started the fire was today told she will not face trial for arson as she had only been 'careless' The family of Stephen Hunt visit the scene where he died. The girl who started the fire is said to have dropped a cigarette while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight . Firefighters enter the remains of music venue NQ Live in Manchester which was also destroyed by the fire (left). Dozens of floral tributes to fireman Stephen Hunt were left at the scene (right) 'It was a hot day and there was a gap beneath the door and as a result experts were unable to exclude a chimney effect as air was drawn under the gap underneath the door and the fire began. 'The conclusion is the Crown's case, which had previously been based on scientific evidence which excluded accidental ignition, can no longer be sustained, so I offer no evidence.' The teenager, who did not attend court, was initially arrested along with another 15-year-old girl but she was the only one charged. Throwing the case out, Judge Michael Henshell said: 'I spent some time reading the papers and reports and it is perfectly obvious this terrible and tragic case demonstrates the danger and potential danger from discarded cigarettes. A fireman patrols the scene in Manchester's Northern Quarter where his colleague was killed. More than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral . More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as passers-by watched on . 'This was discarded without any thought and as a result a fire started in circumstances which were particular to the site in question, resulting in extensive damage and costing the life of a man who, as part of his employment, was there to protect life and property. 'It was a terrible consequence for a thoughtless act. The girl who had been charged and faced trial was, in fact, blameless so far as criminal law is concerned and guilty only of being careless.' In September 2013 more than 1,000 firefighters, emergency service staff and members of the public lined the streets of Bury for Mr Hunt's funeral. In a tribute to him at his funeral, his son Sam said: 'To me, he wasn't just my dad but my hero, my role model and my best friend.' Following the hearing today, a spokesperson for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said: 'We have made no comment on any aspect of the incident and are unlikely to do so until the coroner's inquest into Stephen's death has concluded. 'Safe to say we continue to work with everyone involved in various investigations to find the truth of what happened, not least for Stephen's family but for everyone involved and especially our firefighters.'","Teenager charged with arson at Manchester hair salon will not face trial .

"Farmers and shearers across Australia are 'prepared to fight tooth and nail for our farming industry' after PETA released a confronting campaign accusing the wool industry of barbaric treatment of their sheep. The gruesome campaign, shows vegan lead guitarist of 'I Killed the Prom Queen,' Jona Weinhofen, holding a severed lamb alongside the words, 'here's the rest of your wool coat.' PETA later admitted the lamb was a prop and made of foam even though they said the advert detailed 'the realities of the Australian wool industry.' The Victorian Farming Federation launched an official complaint to the Advertising Standards Bureau on Monday. Scroll down for video . PETA's latest campaign shows vegan guitarist Jona Weinhofen, holding a severed lamb actually made of foam . Many have taken to social media to voice their disgust at the 'misleading' and 'inaccurate' advertisment . After the lamb was revealed to be fake, Mr Weinhofen took to social media to post an image of a real sheep . People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals also accompanied a series of graphic videos along with the advert. The Victorian Farming Federation launched an official complaint on Monday . The disturbing clips showed Australian shearers kicking, stamping and mutilating the creatures before stitching up their butchered wounds with a needle. The investigation posted on PETA's website states that this gruesome behaviour was observed in 19 shearing sheds across Australia. 'Shearers are often paid by volume, not by the hour, which encourages fast, violent work and can lead to severe cuts on sheep's bodies,' it said. 'Large swaths of skin were cut or ripped off the bodies of many sheep by the shearers.' The campaign aims to deter people from purchasing wool products and gives a number of alternatives such as cotton, linen and fleece. But many shearers, farmers and wool buyers have taken to social media to defend the industry and reject that the abuse is systematic across the country as this would cause a national scandal. The Victorian Farming Federation also took to social media to vent their disgust at the advertisement. 'WE'RE prepared to fight tooth and nail for our farming industry today launching an official complaint to the Advertising Standards Bureau on PETA's latest misleading and offensive campaign,' they posted on their Facebook page. The disturbing clips showed Australian shearers kicking, stamping and mutilating the creatures . The campaign mainly aims to deter people from purchasing wool products and gives a number of alternatives . President of the Victorian Farming Federation, Peter Tuohey, congratulated TV presenter Gorgi Coghlan after she voiced her strong support for the wool industry on The Project on Tuesday . The Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce has also voiced his outrage calling the campaign a 'load of rubbish.' According to The Weekly Times, in their submission to the Advertising Standards Bureau, the Victorian Farmers Federation said the campaign 'denigrates, offends, belittles and insults every Australian's intelligence'. 'The fact the lamb they are trying to represent is fake and made our of foam is grossly misleading and offensive,' the submission says. 'The comments and allegations made by PETA misrepresent and damage an entire industry.' PETA Australia campaigns manager Ashley Fruno reminded the public of the content of the gruesome video. 'Everyone keeps forgetting that there is a video that documents shearing leading to severe cuts on sheep's bodies,' she said. 'Large swaths of many sheep's skin were cut or ripped off by the shears. Workers didn't give sheep any painkillers before using needles to sew up their flesh to try to close gaping, bloody wounds caused by shearing while the sheep writhed and kicked out in pain.' But the President of the Victorian Farming Federation, Peter Tuohey, congratulated TV presenter Gorgi Coghlan after she voiced her strong support for the wool industry on The Project on Tuesday.

"A 10-year-old boy who beat a younger child to death in Canada went to his friends claiming that he had witnessed a 'big guy' strike the victim with a rock. Lee Allan Bonneau, 6, died from blunt force trauma to the head in August 2013 following a savage attack on a reservation in Saskatchewan. A 10-year-old boy, identified in court documents as L.T., reportedly admitted to killing Lee Bonneau and crushing his head after initially blaming a stranger for the slaying. Slain: Lee Allan Bonneau was 6 years old when in August 2013 he was attacked by a 10-year-old boy and beaten to death with a rock and a stick . Brief life: Lee was pronounced dead from severe head injuries four hours after he went missing in Saskatchewan, Canada, while in the care of his foster mother . Tribute: A collage created by Lee's biological family celebrating his short, troubled life . On Thursday, a coroner's jury in Regina heard how the underage suspect ran to his friends after the attack on Bonneau telling them he had witnessed a murder, reported National Post. The troubled 10-year-old was described as appearing scared but also excited, telling his friends how a 'big guy' had struck Lee with a stick three times, pushed him down an embankment and then bashed him with a rock. L.T. then changed his story, according to Thursday's hearing, saying the he was the one who killed the 6-year-old. He then pleaded with his pals, 'Don't tell on me,' because he was afraid of being jailed. During an interview with investigators a day after Lee Bonneau's slaying August 21, 2013, L.T. reverted back to his original version of events, telling Royal Canadian Mounted Police that a 'big person' committed the crime. The 10-year-old named the purported killer and told law enforcement officials that he even walked up to the man and asked him what he was doing. 'I'm just killing a little boy,' L.T. quoted the man as saying. Police later questioned the person identified by L.T. and cleared him of any wrongdoing. On the evening of August 21, 2013, Lee Bonneau accompanied his foster mother, Mary Ramstead, to a bingo game at the Kahkewistahaw First Nation hall. At around 8pm, Lee stepped outside the bingo venue to buy snacks and never returned. He was last seen playing with some dogs and walking in the company of an older boy, later identified as 10-year-old L.T. More than two hours after his disappearance, Lee was found critically injured in a remote field more than half a mile from the bingo hall. A coroner's inquest has heard how a 10-year-old boy named L.T. attacked the younger child, pictured here as an infant on the evening of August 21, 2013 on a reservation . Family troubles: Lee was removed from the home of his biological mother, Stacey Merk (pictured) just two and a half months before his murder . Lee is pictured here with his birth father, Dave Bonneau. Child servers reportedly refused to release the 6-year-old into his parent's care . The 6-year-old was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead from his injuries at around midnight. Forensic pathologist Dr Shaun Ladhman determined that Lee died from blunt force trauma to the left side of the head after suffering multiple skull fractures. In his testimony at the coroner's inquest Thursday, Ladhman compared the boy's injuries to those seen in high-speed car collisions or a three-story fall. Bonneau also had bite marks on his body. Because of his young age, 10-year-old L.T. has not been charged with Lee Bonneau's murder. Global News reported that Saskatchewan’s children’s advocate determined the underage killer had severe behavioral issues and likely required constant supervision. RCMP Cpl. Donna Zawislak testified court that when officers came to the child's house and said that Lee Bonneau has died, the 10-year-old did not react. The following day, L.T. sat down for a forensic interview, saying he had been a witness to the killing, not the perpetrator. When asked about the blood stains on his clothes and shoes, the 10-year-old blamed it on a nosebleed. The child had a history of troubling behavior, including a break-in where he killed a pregnant dog and her puppies, which had been cut out of the animal's body. Lee had been removed from the home of his biological mother, Stacey Merk, just two and a half months before his death citing concerns related to his verbal skills and behavioral problems. Violent end: A pathologist testified that 6-year-old Lee suffered injuries often observed in high-speed car collisions. He had multiple skull fractures and bite marks on his body . Lies: The troubled 10-year-old was described as appearing scared but also, telling his friends after the killing how a 'big guy' had struck Lee . Unpunished: L.T. will not face any charges in connection to Lee Bonneau's death because of his young age . During the coroner’s inquest, Ms Merk testified that a social worker became alarmed when she confided in her that she has been struggling with depression and had suicidal thoughts. On August 1, child services placed Lee with Mary Ramstead's family on a temporary basis. Three weeks later, the 6-year-old was murdered while in the care of his foster mother. L.T. will not face any charges in connection to Lee Bonneau's death because of his young age. The goal of the coroner's inquest is to determine the circumstances of the murder and make recommendations to prevent similar tragedies going forward.","Lee Allan Bonneau, 6, was attacked by a 10-year-old boy and beaten to death with a rock and a stick in August 2013 in Saskatchewan, Canada .

"NBC News has changed its account of how chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel was kidnapped in Syria, saying he was now most likely taken by Sunni rebels who tried to convince their victims they were government militants. The broadcaster had previously reported that the 2012 kidnapping of Mr Engel, which saw him held for five days and expecting to be killed, was carried out by forces associated with President Bashar-al Assad. But Mr Engel has revealed that following analysis of his kidnapping it is likely the men that took him were in fact a Sunni group who had tried to convince their victims that they were Shi-ite rebels affiliated to the Government. Scroll down for video . NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel (centre) was taken captive with Turkey reporter Aziz Akyavas (left) and photographer John Kooistra (right) and were convinced by their captors they had been taken by forces related to President Bashar al-Assad, but they may have been Sunni rebels instead . A statement posted on the NBC News site said: 'The group that kidnapped us put on an elaborate ruse to convince us they were Shiite Shabiha militiamen. The group that kidnapped us was a criminal gang with shifting allegiances.' The statement also raises concerns that rather than being freed following a harrowing firefight, as they were told, this may actually have been staged for propaganda purposes. Instead the captives may just have been handed over. The statement added: 'We have not been able to get a definitive account of what happened that night. But based on all of our reporting, it is clear that we were kidnapped by a criminal gang for money and released for propaganda purposes. 'This, of course, does not make our kidnappers or the five days they held us at gunpoint any less dangerous. It does, however, underscore the treacherous and violent nature of the conflict inside Syria.' Mr Engel and his team were prompted to research the circumstances of the 2012 kidnapping after the New York Times raised questions over the attackers' identities. They suggested the kidnapping was likely to have been carried out by a Sunni criminal element of the North Idlib Falcons Brigade, linked to the Free Syrian Army and known for taking hostages. The New York Times claimed that NBC executives were informed of the suspicions about the kidnappers' identities during and after Mr Engel was taken. Mr Engel was convinced by his captors that he had been taken and held by government affiliated forces . But immediately after his release Mr Engel appeared on Today and in a Vanity Fair interview claiming he had been taken by the shabiha group, government militia loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. He made these assertions based on what he had been told by his captors, which included that they had been rescued by Sunni rebels. The paper claimed that when the captors realised other rebels were trying to free the victims they had actually staged a rescue so they could blame the kidnapping on the Assad regime. Engel and his crew, including producers Ghazi Balkiz and Aziz Akyavas, as well as cameraman John Kooistra, were taken hostage on December 13, 2012, while reporting in Syria. The foreign correspondent said they had met a man who had claimed he was a Syrian rebel commander who had promised to take them across the border to see Iranian and Lebanese prisoners being held by rebels. Syrians run for cover after a mortar shell hit a street killing several in the Bustan Al-Qasr district of Aleppo . They were soon removed from a truck and loaded into a container vehicle by armed men where they were bound, blindfolded and stripped of their passports and shoes. The kidnappers forced the group to make a video and unwittingly set off a distress GPS signal, which informed NBC exactly where they were.  NBC was able to broadcast images of the farm they were being held at across the world, also informing their kidnappers they knew of the location. Engel and his crew were believed to have been taken near Ma-arrat Misrin, and were pictured in captivity with Arabic sprayed on the wall behind them. It read: ‘Or will burn.’ A statement published by NBC said it was clear that the group were released for propaganda purposes . During the five days they were held Mr Engel reported apparently hearing one of the rebels they were with being shot, and constantly being subjected to the sounds of guns being loaded - believing each day was his last. He claimed they were constantly tormented by the kidnappers. As an example, the 39-year-old correspondent said that one minute, their captors were giving them tea, and the next, they were demanding the crew decide who would be killed first. On the fifth night they were loaded, while blindfolded, into a van. They were told they would be handed over to military forces in  Foua. As they reached a checkpoint there was the sound of gunfire and a dead body was seen on the floor. Engel has since said, in light of the new information, this may have been staged to convince them they were rescued rather than handed over. Engel, who is divorced and doesn't have children, was promoted to NBC News's chief foreign correspondent in 2008.","Richard Engel was kidnapped in Syria with his crew and held for five days .

"Support: Kai Windsor, now 10, with his mother Rachel . Like most boys, he always preferred football to dolls. But Kai Windsor started life as a girl – and knew from the age of three that he had been born into the wrong body. Christened Kaia, he would shun traditional girls’ toys in favour of kicking a ball around. By four, he refused to wear dresses – and at six he wanted his hair cut short and developed a boyish awkwardness around girls. By nine, he had finally broken the truth to his mother Rachel, 37, telling her: ‘I’m really a boy.’ Now, at the age of ten, Kai is set to undergo hormone treatment to halt puberty to stop him developing into a woman. Miss Windsor, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said: ‘As a toddler, Kai only wanted to play ball. As a girl, he had no interest in any dolls and made a beeline for boy’s toys. ‘And as soon as he began school, he only wanted to wear trousers as the other boys did. Soon after, I noticed he went red whenever girls were around.’ Kai is not alone in facing gender problems. The number of transgender referrals to the NHS for children under 11 has quadrupled since 2009. Like many parents in her situation, Miss Windsor had never heard of children facing such issues. But the single mother, who runs a health juice business, said Kai had ‘amazing support’ from his primary school. He was given counselling when his schoolwork started to suffer, and later decided to confront the issue head-on. ‘They were the ones who suggested Kai should have counselling,’ she said. ‘Then when he came out as transgender, they sent a letter out to all the parents in his year to explain he now wanted to be referred to as a boy. ‘Staff then held a special lesson for all the year to explain about being transgender. And now they are even in the process of building unisex toilets to make life easier for Kai and other children like him.’ Kaia pretty in pink, aged four, pictured left, and dressing up as a pirate, at five, pictured right . When Kai was born there was no outward sign he was anything other than female. Miss Windsor, who also has a daughter Jasmine, 16, from a previous relationship, said: ‘As a toddler I usually put Kaia in dresses and bought her lots of dolls. Meanwhile, as her blonde hair grew, I put in pigtails. It simply never occurred to me she wouldn’t be as feminine as her sister.’ She added: ‘Looking back Kai knew then he was a boy. He had no interest in dolls, preferring to play with a football. And when we were out he’d head straight for the boy’s section in shops, asking for Spiderman toys.’ At seven, Kai wanted his hair cut shorter. But his grades started suffering and he was later given counselling at school. Within a few weeks, his behaviour and schoolwork improved and last year he officially became transgender after telling his mother one morning. Transgender Kai is now happy in his skin at last and is now set to undergo hormone treatment . Meanwhile, his grades immediately improved. ‘Once people stopped referring to Kai as a girl and he could just be the little boy he wanted, he was so much happier,’ she said. Kai is now set to have hormone treatment to curb puberty. If at the age of 16, he wants to complete the full transition to an adult man, he will be offered gender reassignment surgery. Miss Windsor added: ‘There have been plenty of tears. It is hard to see your child going through such turmoil. But whatever happens I will always be there to support Kai. ‘And right now it is just a wonderful relief to see him happy in his own skin at last.’","Kai Windsor knew from  three that he had been born in the wrong body .

"The victim of a road rage attack during rush-hour traffic has come face-to-face with the man suspected of shooting her in the head. Dietrich Evans was arrested yesterday for the attack which left  Kay Hafford with bullet fragments in the bottom right side of her brain. The brave church singer  agreed to face her alleged shooter in a police line-up and Evans, 22, has now been charged with aggravated assault. Scroll down for video . Dietrich Evans has been arrested on suspicion of shooting Kay Hafford in the head in a road rage attack . Lucky to be alive: Kay Hafford, 28 (left and right) was shot in the back of the head in a Texas road-rage accident but was able to pull over and call for help . Ms Hafford, who is still recovering, had been trying to get on the freeway in Houston when she honked at a passing SUV. She said the pair had an angry exchange and the driver  then began taunting her. A short time later, the motorist pulled up beside her, aimed a gun at the front passenger window of her red Dodge Avenge and pulled the trigger, reported Click2Houston. Evans, 22, was arrested on suspicion of the shooting after detectives from Harris County Sheriff's Office say they discovered the gun  used to shoot through Hafford's window and a car matching the description of the shooter's. Shot fired: Officials say Hafford got into an angry confrontation with another driver and honked at him, prompting the man to fire on the passenger window of her Dodge Avenger (pictured) Officials confirmed that Evans, who is being held on $250,000 bond, is a documented gang member. Incredibly, Ms Hafford told Eyewitness News she wasn't angry with her attacker but felt sorry for him. On meeting him she said: 'It made me nervous. I just shed my few tears and I let it go. I knew without a shadow of a doubt, it was him. 'Seeing him made me hurt a little bit. I kinda feel sorry for him, but I'm not mad at him. I appreciate him coming forth. He just needs help and they got him.' The victim said she had prayed for police to catch her attacker or for him to give himself up and was delighted her prayers had been answered. Artistic: Both Hafford (right) and her husband of nearly two years, Kendrick Hafford (left), are musicians . Ms Hafford said the argument began when she was 'cut up' by the suspect as she turned into the feeder road to the North Freeway. He had driven alongside her shouting for her to roll down her window and as she entered the Freeway she said she heard a loud noise and felt pain in the back of her head. Despite the gunshot wound, she was able to pull over and dial 911. It took responding constables about 15 minutes to track down the woman's car and get her medical help, reported KHOU. Paramedics who responded to the scene rushed her to Memorial Hermann Texas Trauma Institute. Ms Hafford, nee Kelley, works as a singer at a Houston-area church. Her husband of nearly two years, Kendrick Hafford, is also a musician, according to her Facebook page. When he arrived at the hospital to visit is wife, Mr Hafford described her survival as a 'miracle.' When asked by reporters what he would like to say to the man who shot Kay, the husband replied: 'May God deal with you.'","Kay Hafford was shot in the head after a confrontation with an angry driver .

"Our quest for the perfect garden could be ruining our chances of making contact with ET. This is according to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory who is objecting to proposals by iRobot to release a radio wave-guided lawnmower. It claims iRobot's machines will interfere with its sensitive radio telescopes which astronomers are using to pick up signs of alien life. Our quest for the perfect garden could be ruining our chances of making contact with ET. This is according to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory who is objecting to proposals by iRobot to release a radio wave-guided lawnmower. iRobot is famous for creating self-guided Roomba machines . The problem is the frequency band proposed for the lawnbot is 6240-6740 MHz - the same one several large radio telescopes operate on. 'We'll see the whole thing with our electronics,' Harvey Liszt, spectrum manager for the observatory, told Bloomberg. 'It's a distortion.' iRobot, who has created self-guided Roomba vacuum cleaners, has filed a request with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to use airwaves for its latest design. The Massachusetts company says its vision is to create lawnmowers that are guided wirelessly from beacons on poles stuck into the lawn. Existing models use wires hidden in the ground to set boundaries, rather using airwaves. Astronomers that the frequencies iRobot wants to use are the same as they use to detect methanol – a key sign of star formation. There is already a ban on the use of mobile phone close to the Green Bank Telescope (pictured) in West Virginia, which the National Radio Astronomy Observatory owns . The company claims its device could 'make this necessary chore easier' and reduce the 38,000 injuries caused by walk-behind mowers each year. According to Bloomberg, iRobot claims the astronomers' concerns are exaggerated and said the chances of its gardening technology will interfere with space exploration are 'infinitesimal'. But the National Radio Astronomy Observatory argues that the frequencies iRobot wants to use are the same as they use to detect methanol – a key sign of star formation. iRobot has offered to place a notice in user manuals that states: 'Consumer use only; use must be limited to residential areas.' Researchers at the Parkes Observatory claim they have finally found the source of these 'alien' signals - in their kitchen microwave . For years, scientists have been trying to uncover the source of mysterious radio signals being picked up in Australia. Theories have ranged from evaporating black holes to extraterrestrial communication and mergers of neutron stars. Now researchers at the Parkes Observatory claim they have finally found the source of these 'alien' signals - in their kitchen microwave. Scientists knew the strange signals, known as perytons, originated somewhere near to the planet, but they had no idea just how close. The researchers were able to replicate the emission of perytons by opening the microwave door while the device was still running. Within a fraction of a second, the microwave activity was picked up by the reader and the source of the perytons revealed. 'Subsequent tests revealed that a peryton can be generated at 1.4 GHz when a microwave oven door is opened prematurely and the telescope is at an appropriate relative angle,' the authors wrote. But this doesn't go far enough, say astronomers. They want the company to implement 'exclusion zones based on geolocation' to keep lawnmowers at least 55 miles (89km) from telescopes. iRobot responded by saying: 'The NRAO observatories for the most part are not closely surrounded by residential areas, at least no residential areas with lawns. 'A review of the observatory locations on Google maps also shows that many are surrounded by desert or forests, not environments where residential lawn equipment is used.' NRAO replied: 'This claim is most charitably characterised as silly.' There is already a ban on the use of mobile phone close to the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, which the National Radio Astronomy Observatory owns.

The hand-beaded dress was so heavy that the slight model struggled to stay upright as she made her way down the runway, and was seen celebrating backstage when she made it back without falling. More sheer creations turned heads following an increasingly racy day at the shows - a black netted full-length dress turned heads. Flirty: A model swished her sheer red dress on the catwalk, giving a glimpse of her black G-string underwear . Sheer delight: Another see-through dress was conservatively cut, but entirely sheer . Leather and feathers: A gold maxi skirt was a stand-out in the collection (left), while ensembles were accessorised with feather neckwear . A model in a gold fringed top paired with a plum skirt shimmied her way down the catwalk to give photographers a glimpse of how the garment moved. 'The luxe collection celebrates the art of fine dressing with an elaborate approach to both luxury lifestyle and opulent evening wear,' Johnson stated. 'Adorned with embellished hand beading, refined leather accessories and delicate feathering, it is a call to all independent women. Siren call: A seemingly simple strapless gown revealed a flash of flesh with a thigh-high slit . Shimmer and sheer: Full-length (left and centre) and midi (right) dresses were presented in a variety of fabrics, colours, and opacities . 'Women who stand strong against diversity, women who support each other in their endeavours to juggle the demands of our modern world. Our everyday Hollywood sirens.' The in-demand designer is a favourite amongst celebrities, including Madonna, who has a number of designs by Johnson and wore a body armour piece from to her 56th birthday party last year. Johnson, who has two primary school-age boys, has had a store in New York for the past few years and splits her time between Sydney and Los Angeles. Inspiration: 'It's a call to all independent strong women, everyone who is trying to juggle careers, motherhood and even just modern life,' Johnson said of the Sirens' Call collection . Family achievement: The designer, who is set to open a flagship store in Sydney, took her bow with her two sons by her side . Gatsby gorgeous: The hair and make-up and accessories were vintage in style and inspired by the 1920s . She is opening a new Sydney flagship store next month and is moving into a larger production space, which reflects her firm commitment to make her clothes in Australia. Johnson's advice to women striving for success is to actually just cut themselves some slack. 'Don't be so hard on yourself,' she said. 'You are always going to feel like you can't do it all but you can - you just try your best.'","Final show for MBFWA took place at 7pm at the Carriageworks venue in Sydney .

"Evicted: Hayley Sandiford has been told that postman terroriser Winston must leave her home this month or she will lose her house . A dog has been evicted from social housing for terrorising  postmen - meaning neighbours can have their mail delivered for the first time since February 2014. Mother-of-two Hayley Sandiford has been told she must get rid of her seven-stone American bulldog Winston by the end of April or she will also have to leave her house in Blackburn, Lancashire. The pet has attacked several terrified postmen but Miss Sandiford says Royal Mail are victimising Winston and claims her family are being 'taunted all the time' by people in the area. Angry neighbours have even left notes on her front door saying 'keep your devil dog away', she says. One postman on his rounds reported Winston bounded 100 yards up the street towards him before clamping his powerful teeth around his mailbag. The victim had to cower behind a tree and throw his one remaining letter to distract the animal before diving behind a gate and alerting a colleague to take cover. A second postmen reported being being bitten on the arm and had to kick Winston in the head twice to fend him off. Winston's attacks have led to a 14 month ban on all postal deliveries to 60 homes in his neighbourhood. Residents living on two surrounding roads  have been making make a four-and-a-half mile round trips, sometimes by taxi, to collect their mail. Twin Valley Homes housing association has now taken Miss Sandiford, 30, to court and she must find a new home for the dog by 4pm on April 30 or her tenancy is at risk. Obsessed: Miss Sandiford admits her American bulldog has 'a thing' for chewing up mail - but unfortunately this has led to him also attacking postal staff . Legal battle: A housing association has decided to end a ban on postal deliveries to the area of Blackburn by demanding that Winston is evicted . The ruling at Preston County Court means the post to the area is due to resume on May 1. Today Miss Sandiford, who has asked a friend to take in Winston, said: 'I feel sick and gutted to be losing Winston. Winston had been brilliant and I have done everything they asked me to do but they're still making a big deal out of it. Court case: Miss Sandiford outside court last year after Winston was threatened with destruction for attacking a postie . 'I have had things stuck on my door saying keep my 'devil dog' away. I don't even like going out anymore I'm not the same kind of person. My kids have been affected at school through it because people would say stuff and my son gets into trouble because of that. We are being taunted all the time. 'Winston is one of the nicest dogs. He is not a danger - I wouldn't have him near my kids. 'Unfortunately he does have a thing about postmen but it is the mail they carry and not the postmen themselves. I don't get much post only bills and a lot of junk mail and he loves ripping them up. He doesn't touch the kids toys he'd rather play with the leaflets that come through the door. 'Winston did jump up at the postman - but he is a very bouncy playful little thing and he forgets how big he is - although I accept it must have been scary for the postman.' Winston's first trouble came in February last year after it bit an unnamed postman on the arm whilst being taken for a walk by his owner's nine-year-old son. The postman suffered a bite wound which broke his skin and he underwent medical treatment in hospital. Although postal deliveries were suspended no action was initially taken against the animal but at 10am on July 9 the 'thick set and stocky built' dog bounded up to postman Paul Warnock whilst he was on his rounds. Mr Warnock who had only delivered to only a handful of houses later told a court hearing: 'Straight away I was worried because it was quite a big dog. As soon as it spotted me it came running towards me fast, at speed. 'Then it was showing it's teeth and growling at me. It was coming at me aggressively, I was frightened. I was backing off then all of a sudden it went for me it grabbed the bundle of mail. It was in the middle of the street because I was backing off so much.' Mr Warnock ran behind a tree for cover and added: 'When I got behind the tree I saw a gate, I thought if I can get inside the gate it's safe. I was left with one letter. It was still going for me. I had one piece on mail, I threw it to take it's eye off me and ran behind the gate. It would have attacked me in the street.' Keen: Winston once ran 100 yards to get to a post bag and the postman only managed to dive into a garden because he tossed a letter into the middle of the road . 'When I got behind the gate the dog was roaming the street. I saw my colleague further up the street coming down, he heard the commotion. I shouted ""Get back get back, dog loose on the street!"".' His colleague took cover behind a gate and watched Miss Sandiford get hold of the dog. Last October Miss Sandiford pleaded guilty to being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control and was handed a six month community order with a six month supervision requirement. She was also told that whenever is taken out for walks, he must be muzzled and kept on a harness with two dog leads and has to be accompanied by a person over the age of 16. Miss Sandiford was also ordered to keep her home securely fenced, but now it appears she must part with Winston to keep her home. David King, one of Miss Sadiford's neighbours said: 'It's brilliant news if they are going to start up the deliveries again. We've waited a long time to get the mail back. My wife is disabled and having to go down to the depot every time we get a letter is hugely frustrating. It's also frustrating that it has taken so long for this to be sorted. Trevor Smith said: 'The Royal Mail could have handled this a lot better and sorted it sooner. I can't understand why they stopped delivering to so many houses anyway. I'm not happy about it. I'll believe the deliveries are restarting when I see it.' Ian Bell, head of Twin Valley Homes, said: 'We're delighted to get this result. The people in the area have suffered due to a lack of a postal service and being in fear of this dog for too long, but now they can see an end in sight. The Royal Mail confirmed a health and safety assessment had been carried out on Miss Sandiford's neighbourhood which highlighted an 'unacceptable level of risk associated with deliveries.' A spokesman said 'Suspending deliveries is a last resort but we take the health and safety of our employees very seriously. We apologise to all affected customers and we are pleased with this outcome.'","Court rules American bulldog Winston must leave his home this month .

"This is the dramatic moment a homeowner was gunned down and handcuffed by police after she blasted her estranged husband who allegedly broke into her house and tried to kill her. Lisa Skinner, 52, shot the male home invader, who has now been identified as her estranged husband Bradley Skinner, 59, after he broke into the house she shared with her mother around 6 p.m. Police said Mr Skinner was armed with both a pistol and a large knife. According to AL.com, his injuries are life threatening but she is expected to survive. Shootings: Paramedics tend to a man, thought to be Bradley Skinner after he was shot by his estranged wife. Meanwhile, a woman, thought to be Mrs Skinner, is handcuffed on the ground . Ambulance: A woman, thought to be Mrs Skinner, is taken away by stretcher to an ambulance after a deadly double shooting at a house in a south Huntsville, Alabama, neighborhood . Response: Paramedics tend to Mr Skinner after he was shot and take him to a waiting ambulance . Police said the incident unfolded when her husband broke the glass out of a back door of the home in South Huntsville, Alabama, to get inside. Mugshot: Mr Skinner, pictured here in a mughsot released by Madison County jail, had been ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation prior to a court hearing next month in the couple's divorce . Officers say Mrs Skinner armed herself with a shotgun then went into the garage, where he followed her and aimed his pistol at her. She then opened fire  with a shotgun, hitting him in the chest, causing life-threatening injuries. Her mother ran from the house in the 2500 block of Bonnie Oaks Drive to a neighbor's house and called 911. Officers from Huntsville police arrived on scene and heard gunshots ring out and saw Mrs Skinner in the garage holding the shotgun. They demanded that she drop her weapon but when she turned toward them with the gun in her hand, at least one officer fired at her, wounding, but not killing her. Mrs Skinner was struck by the police gunfire and both she and her husband were taken to Huntsville Hospital. Lieutenant Darryl Lawson said the shootings took place after the man broke into the rear of the house armed with a gun and a knife. At that time, Mrs Skinner told her mother to run away and call police - so she ran over to a neighbor's house. Several neighbors reportedly heard the gunfire on the normally quiet street, according to AL.com . Neighbor Angela Humlicek, who lives across the street said she heard a single shot and, when she went to see what the noise was, she helped the woman's mother to safety. A spokesman for the Huntsville Police Department, said that the couple was estranged and the woman had been living at the home with her mother. Mrs Skinner also had a protective order against her estranged husband, according to WHNT 19 News. Meanwhile, the officer who shot the woman has been placed on administrative leave. Hospital: Paramedics tend to Mr Skinner and take him to Huntsville Hospital - where he is reported to have life threatening injuries . Restraining orders: Mr Skinner, pictured here, had a history of violent outbursts against his estranged wife. Records show that she had filed for multiple orders of protection against him . Double shooting: Officers put up police tape around the house where the two shootings took place . Shooting: Lieutenant Darryl Lawson, said police officers demanded that Lisa Skinner drop her weapon but when she turned toward them with the gun in her hand, at least one officer fired at her, wounding, but not killing her . According to AL.com Mrs Skinner, a science teacher at Arab High School, lived in fear of violence from her estranged husband. Records show that she had filed for multiple orders of protection against him and planned to take time off from her teaching job to protect her students from his violent temper. Mrs Skinner's petitions to the court describe her estranged husband, who she was divorcing after almost 11 years, as a 'clever, gifted manipulator' who was heavily armed. In February, a Madison County judge prohibited Mr Skinner from going within 100 yards of the Bonnie Oaks Drive home where Sunday's shooting occurred. Police said he violated that order when he broke into the home, which belongs to his mother-in-law, armed with a handgun and a large knife. He was arrested on February 21 on charges of harassing communications and domestic violence by harassment. Home invasion: Police said Lisa Skinner shot a male home invader, thought to be her estranged husband, after he broke into the house armed with a gun . Eyewitnesses: Police interview witnesses after neighbors reportedly heard the gunfire on the normally quiet street . Shock: Local residents crowd around after the deadly shootings which left two people injured . Mrs Skinner described him as a 'mercurial' man who abused alcohol and prescription and illegal drugs and said he had begun speaking about his death. She wrote: 'On [February 18] he began talking about dying and had often mentioned that he wanted to 'take out all of his enemies and die by PoPo,' meaning he wished the police would kill him after he had killed his enemies. I am certainly now an enemy.' The following day she  never returned home after he was obsessively texting threats to her daughter and the daughter's friend saying that he didn't have much time left. 'I left in fear of becoming a victim of murder/suicide,' she wrote. And as recently as Friday, Mr Skinner had been ordered - again - to have no contact with his estranged wife or her family. He was also ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation prior to a court hearing next month in the couple's divorce.","Lisa Skinner shot a man now identified as her estranged husband Bradley Skinner after he unlawfully entered the house she shared with her mother .

"A rescued baby orangutan whose heartbreaking plight captured the hearts of thousands, has gone on to find love. Budi - who spent the first year of his life trapped in a chicken coup - was introduced to Jemmi less than a month ago and now the two apes appear to be inseparable. Indeed, video footage captured at the International Animal Rescue's orangutan center in Indonesia, shows the duo throwing adoring glances at each other as they share a dinner of fruit. At one point Jemmi nuzzles Budi's side and purses her lips, as if she is blowing him a kiss. He then promptly performs the same gesture back at her. Love at first sight: Budi - who spent the first year of his life trapped in a chicken coup - was introduced to Jemmi less than a month ago and now the two apes appear to be inseparable. Two peas in a pod: Indeed, video footage captured at the International Animal Rescue's Orangutan Rescue Centre in Indonesia, shows the duo throwing adoring glances at each other as they share a dinner of fruit . Mimicking: At one point Jemmi nuzzles Budi's side and purses her lips, as if she is blowing him a kiss - he then promptly performs the same gesture back at her . Carers at the rescue center say that 15-month-old Budi and Jemmi have developed a 'beautiful friendship'. Along with eating meals together, they apparently enjoy playing around on the ropes and branches of their enclosure. A spokesperson added: 'If Budi is taken into the day enclosure first he will keep looking back for Jemmi and, if left on his own, will cry until his new friend joins him. 'At the end of the day they both make their way back to their shared hammock where they spend the night together.' Budi was dying from malnutrition and too weak to move when the International Animal Rescue discovered him in Borneo, Indonesia, last December. Rescued: Budi also had a tough start to life Budi the orangutan and was found (pictured) lying on his back in a wire chicken coop without the strength to sit up . Tragedy: This photo, taken at the time of his rescue, shows the 10-month-old with a thin blanket in his cage for comfort . Along with being kept in a confined space, his owner had never given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him - leaving his tiny limbs swollen and bent. Earlier footage showed him crying in pain when one of his carers gently turned his body or lifted him to sit up. But thanks to intensive treatment and care from International Animal Rescue's veterinary team, he made a remarkable recovery. Meanwhile, eight-month-old Jemmi was orphaned when her mother was killed and then illegally sold as a pet. Despite their rough beginnings, the wonderful new footage shows the orangutans' transformation from frail and helpless babies into inquisitive animals, now strong enough to swing from trees. They look extremely comfortable in each other's company as they sit side-by-side. It's hoped that their friendship gets them both used to being around other orangutans so they can hopefully be released into the wild some day. Strength: The tiny orangutan didn't have the muscle strength to open his mouth when he was first rescued from a life of neglect . One of many: International Animal Rescue are keen to stress that Budi's story is not an isolate case and there are 'countless' orangutans currently suffering from neglect in Indonesia . Alan Knight, CEO of International Animal Rescue, said: 'As they start to form bonds with each other and then with other orangutans in baby school, they will learn from each other how to behave in the forest and gradually shed their dependence on their human babysitters.' 'We couldn't be happier to see how well Budi is getting on with his new playmate. 'This first meeting is a milestone in the development of both babies.' International Animal Rescue are keen to stress that Budi's story is not an isolate case and there are 'countless' orangutans currently suffering from neglect in Indonesia. The charity is currently caring for 83 orangutans who were being kept illegally as pets. The primates of all ages are now undergoing rehabilitation so they can eventually be released back into the wild. Mr Knight added: 'People are being very generous in their response to Budi's story and I would urge everyone please to keep on supporting us. 'The more people give, the more orangutans we can rescue and help on their journey back to a protected place in the forest where they belong.'","Budi was introduced to Jemmi less than a month ago and now the two apes appear to be inseparable .

"A video of a menacing crocodile swimming through a public marina with a dead pet dog locked in between its jaws has been viewed more than half a million times online. The clip shows a large croc calmly moving through the marina in the tourist hotspot of Puerto Vallarta, in Mexico, with a black dog wearing a red collar lifeless in its mouth. New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when the attack happened and described how 'the crocodile kept the dog in its mouth for ages, not moving at all'. Mr Weston told Daily Mail Australia the dog belonged to the local bike shop's owner. Scroll down for video . The large croc proudly held on to its catch for hours as it lurked around the Puerto Vallarta marina, in Mexico . 'There's a sanctuary for these crocodiles up the river (200m away) which runs out to the sea and the marina,' Mr Weston explained. 'The dog went to the water's edge to see the crocodile (being curious I guess) but things didn't go according to plan obviously. 'It was certainly a shock to the system. Guess that's nature though,' he said. In the video the beast glides through the water, with rocks on one side and a footpath on the other, as crowds gasp in amazement. New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when he saw the alarming sight . Tourist Tim Weston took a photo of the crocodile with the dog between its jaws . A video of the crocodile swimming through the marina with the bike shop owner's dog has been viewed more than 500,000 times . Mr Weston said: 'A couple of hours later we walked back past and there was still a crowd... But we didn't want to look at it again as we had just eaten. Yesterday morning there was no sign of either.' Social media users have reacted in horror to the video that was posted on the Bogged Facebook page. One woman  called the video 'horrible' and another said 'I hate crocodiles now'. But crocodiles are a common site in Puerto Vallarta as the Mexican beach resort is built amongst the mangroves that the creatures have called home for centuries. As well as living in the nearby sanctuary, crocs are regularly spotted on the resort's golf course. In Mexico the 'American Crocodiles' can reach lengths of 6 meters and as a result of urbanisation are living closer to humans than ever before.

"A new Islamic fatwa in Turkey has decreed that Muslims are allowed to use toilet paper. The Directorate of Religious Affairs for Turkey stated that the use of the material for hygiene is acceptable but water was preferable. Islamic teachings traditionally state that followers should use water to clean themselves  after going to the toilet. A new Islamic fatwa in Turkey has decreed that Muslims are allowed to use toilet paper . The set of rules for how Muslims should relieve themselves, called the Qadaa al-Haajah, was established in the times before toilet paper or toilet seats were invented. Use of the left hand or three stones was also permissible. The code also states that followers should not speak or read while on the toilet and should enter with their left foot and leave with their right, speaking a prayer. The Directorate of Religious Affairs for Turkey stated that the use of the material for hygiene is acceptable but water was preferable . Men and women are also told not to stand while relieving themselves but to squat or sit. The new announcement, reported by Hurriyet Daily News, stated: 'If water cannot be found for cleansing, other cleaning materials can be used.' 'Even though some sources deem paper to be unsuitable as a cleaning material, as it is an apparatus for writing, there is no problem in using toilet paper. Last month the Directorate of Religious Affairs had also relaxed rules on around the use of products containing alcohol - as long as they were not consumed. Hand sanitizes and other similar products used for hygiene products are now halal. 'While it is forbidden to drink substances containing alcohol that were produced for cleaning purposes, it is acceptable to use them for cleaning,' Hurriyet Daily News reported. The fatwa stated that places that had been cleaned with the products would not need to be washed again with water prior to performing prayer.

"Whatever caused small space rocks to lump together billions of years ago, magnetism is unlikely to be the reason. Scientists announced today that measurements made by the European space probe Philae, which landed on comet 67P in November, show the comet's core isn't magnetised. Some astrophysicists have suggested that magnetism might have been responsible for aligning and then binding together rocks into larger boulders during the early stages of planet formation. A composite of 18 images showing off the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko activity from different angles as seen between 31 January (top left) and 25 March (bottom right), when the spacecraft was at distances of about 30 to 100 km from the comet . But in a paper published online by the journal Science, the team led by Hans-Ulrich Auster at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, said their data — which benefited from three unexpected bounces that allowed Philae to collect more results than planned — don't support this theory. 'If the surface was magnetised, we would have expected to see a clear increase in the magnetic field readings as we got closer and closer to the surface,' said Auster. 'If comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is representative of all cometary nuclei, then we suggest that magnetic forces are unlikely to have played a role in the accumulation of planetary building blocks greater than one meter (3 feet) in size.' Allan H. Treiman, a senior scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas, who wasn't involved in the study, said the results credibly suggest other forces were responsible. Magnetic  data before (top) and after (bottom) the cliff collision at between the first and second touchdowns. Height above the surface is plotted on the x-axis and magnetic field strength on the y-axis. The measurements (crosses) are compared with a hypothetical model (solid line) assuming a slightly magnetised surface . data collected by the Rosetta Plasma Consortium fluxgate magnetometer on board the orbiter (top) and the Rosetta Lander Magnetometer and Plasma Monitor on board the lander (bottom) have been used to investigate the magnetic properties of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko . Studying the properties of a comet can provide clues to the role that magnetic fields played in the formation of Solar System bodies almost 4.6 billion years ago. The infant Solar System was once nothing more than a swirling disc of gas and dust but, within a few million years, the Sun burst into life in the centre of this turbulent disc, with the leftover material going into forming the asteroids, comets, moons and planets. The dust contained an appreciable fraction of iron, some of it in the form of magnetite. Indeed, millimetre-sized grains of magnetic materials have been found in meteorites, indicating their presence in the early Solar System. This leads scientists to believe that magnetic fields threading through the proto-planetary disc could have played an important role in moving material around as it started to clump together to form larger bodies. 'Auster did not find any magnetic field, with a very sensitive instrument, so it seems unlikely that magnetism in the solar nebula was significant for the collection of meter-sized objects,' Treiman said in an email. 'At that scale, it seems likely that electrostatic or gravitational attraction would be stronger.' The findings are part of a series of scientific results obtained by scientists analyzing data collected by the Philae lander and its mothership Rosetta, which is flying alongside the comet on its elliptical orbit around the sun. Magnetic data providing an estimate of the final landing region. Initially, Philae was seen to rotate slowly during the descent to Agilkia. It landed and then bounced, rotating significantly faster as the momentum of the internal flywheel was transferred to the lander . Some astrophysicists have suggested that magnetism might have been responsible for aligning and then binding together rocks into larger boulders during the early stages of planet formation.

"Sue Southern, head of West Midlands Counter Terrorism Police Unit, which has detained three people in relation to terrorism offences today . Police have arrested two 17-year-old boys on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to join terrorists, while also detaining a 'terror fundraiser'. The teenagers were detained at their homes in Coventry, West Midlands, during a 6am raid by the region's Counter Terrorism Unit today. A 39-year-old man in Coventry has also been held on suspicion of fundraising for the purpose of terrorism, Scotland Yard said. All three are currently in custody in a West Midlands police station and have been detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. The legislation gives officers a maximum of 36 hours before they can charge, release, bail or apply for further detention. West Midlands Police has said the arrests of the teenagers were pre-planned and there was no immediate risk to the public. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the arrests were part of two separate investigations while officers say enquiries into both are continuing. The West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit has appealed for help in identifying would-be terrorists after it was revealed there had been a rise in the number Syria-related investigations in  the region. One of Britain's most senior counter terrorism officers, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, explained the challenge for police is identifying potential jihadi fighters. This is because many of the young people from the West Midlands suspected to have travelled to the conflict zone had no previous links to extremist groups. Detective Chief Superintendent Sue Southern, who heads up the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, said: 'We are seeing young people who previously had no reason to be known to the authorities, being radicalised. 'It makes working with communities all the more important if we are to stop young people from becoming involved in terrorist activities.' The West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit has appealed for help in identifying would-be terrorists after it was revealed there had been a rise in the number Syria-related investigations in the region . Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, one of the country's most senior counter terrorism officers, has warned there has been a high rise in the number of Syria-related investigations in the West Midlands . The force has seen a number of high profile Syria-related investigations, which have resulted in people appearing in court. Two men, aged 22, from Handsworth were recently sentenced for terrorism offences while  a man and a woman stood trial in September and October. Detective Chief Superintendent Sue Southern, added: 'We have a number of other on-going investigations involving individuals suspected of fighting with proscribed groups. 'Anyone who does travel to the region faces being questioned by police when they return. Every case is assessed individually but if there are grounds to suspect a person has been involved in terrorism they will be arrested.' She urged families to allow police to intervene at as early a stage as possible to 'help safeguard young people'.

"Computers may soon be able to transmit the complexities of human personalities, the Stanford professor who originally set up Google's X laboratory has claimed. Sebastian Thrun, who founded the Google X laboratory where the Internet search giant has developed Google Glass and driverless cars, said it was often difficult to grasp concepts before they come to fruition. But he said that, much like data is now routinely transmitted via computers, the same may soon be true for full personalities. Scroll down for video . Sebastian Thrun (R), the founder of the Google X research library, looks on as virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier speaks at a symposium at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California on April 2, 2015 . 'Perhaps we can get to the point where we can outsource our own personal experiences entirely into a computer - and possibly our own personality. 'Maybe we're going to have a demo at some point where the computer runs 'Sebastian,'' he told a symposium Thursday evening at Stanford University. 'It's maybe unimaginable but it's not as far off as people think. It's very doable,' said the German-born computer scientist, who remains a fellow at Google. 'I do believe that in all these technologies we have just scratched the surface. 'Almost everything interesting hasn't been invented yet,' he said. Other upcoming inventions predicted by Thrun include flying cars, computers that are implantable into the human body, and medical treatments that will drastically curb unnatural deaths. Thrun was speaking as part of events to mark the premiere of 'The Demo,' an experimental opera about the 1968 data transmission test by scientist Doug Engelbart that helped pave the way for the creation of the Internet. But Jaron Lanier, a virtual reality pioneer known for his books on the philosophy of computers, doubted that scientists could ascertain how to share personalities. 'You are a moving target, and the way you change yourself in response to the presence of that technology would undo any ability to measure whether it has succeeded,' he said. The California giant's patent says that one day a robot personality could replicate the robot's owner, 'a deceased loved one,' or 'a celebrity.' Above it Atlas, which according to Google-owned Boston Dynamics, is a 'high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor, rough terrain. According to Google owned Boston Dynamics, Atlas is a 'high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor, rough terrain. 'Atlas can walk bipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift, carry, and manipulate the environment. 'In extremely challenging terrain, Atlas is strong and coordinated enough to climb using hands and feet, to pick its way through congested spaces.' Lanier warned that Silicon Valley puts too much faith in technology's progress. 'I think we are going to have a real struggle to define ourselves in a humane and sweet way as we go through a lot of changes,' he said. He warned that technological innovations risked worsening inequality, saying: 'I don't think the interests of entrepreneurs and everyone else are always aligned.' He gave the example of Egypt, saying that Silicon Valley was too congratulatory about the role of social media in the 2011 revolution that brought down strongman Hosni Mubarak. 'When it starts to go wrong, we don't take responsibility for that. 'There is a way in which we are being a little selective in tallying our victories,' he said. Google has already developed a system to allow robots to download new personalities online. The system would allow machines to download them in a similar way to an app - and even have a different personality for each user. The patent says that the personality could replicate the robot's owner, 'a deceased loved one,' or 'a celebrity,' Google's patent details a cloud-based system where a personality could be downloaded to a robot, in the same way one might download an app. 'The robot personality may also be modifiable within a base personality construct (i.e., a default-persona) to provide states or moods representing transitory conditions of happiness, fear, surprise, perplexion (e.g., the Woody Allen robot), thoughtfulness, derision (e.g., the Rodney Dangerfield robot), and so forth,' states the patent. Friends will even be able to clone their robots and swap aspects of its personality. 'The personality and state may be shared with other robots so as to clone this robot within another device or devices. 'In this manner, a user may travel to another city, and download within a robot in that city (another 'skin') the personality and state matching the user's 'home location' robot. 'The robot personality thereby becomes transportable or transferable.' The firm also explains 'This disclosure relates to a robot imbued with a personality, or personalities. Google's patent drawings reveal the system can share personalities and download them . 'In particular, but without limitation, the disclosure provides for a robot that operates with personality attributes and related capabilities drawn from cloud computing capacities. 'Personality may be thought of as personification in the sense of human characteristics or qualities attributed to a non-human thing. 'A robot can be programmed to provide a desired look as well as interactability for the robot, which may be subject to change by the user or by the robot itself, such that the robot interface is customized to provide a desired personality for the robot.' Google already owns several firms developing robotic technology, including Atlas, 6.2 feet of metal with a plastic body that can walk, run, jump and even open doors. This is latest version of the Atlas robot created by Boston Dynamics, a Google-owned robot firm. Later this year, seven of the robots will compete in a 'robo oylmpics' - designed to recreate natural disasters the robots could one day be sent into. The upgraded Atlas is 75 percent new—only the lower legs and feet were carried over from the original design . The 'crane' stance, being held by Karate Kid Daniel LaRusso (played by Ralph Maccio left) in the 1984 film inspired the latest movements of the Atlas robot. It demonstrates strong balancing skills and composure and showcases the agility of the Google-owned machine, said the firm .","Google has already patented system to swap robot personalities .

"Cate McGregor was surprised when she was unconditionally backed by the cricket community and the Australian Army. But it was Tony Abbott's response to her transformation from man to woman that knocked her for six. It took less than an hour for the federal Liberal leader to call Ms McGregor after she forwarded the chapter of her book that outed her. Ms McGregor recalled that very moment - during her address to the National Press Club on Wednesday - when the prime minister told her 'it was okay'. 'I actually said to him ""your party won't be thrilled about this"",' she said, the ABC reports. However the senior military official did not express the same kind of appraisal when it came to Mr Abbott's stance on same-sex marriage, saying she is 'sad' that he is not a supporter of it. Scroll down for video . Cate McGregor - now Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force - spent 40 years in the Army, most of those under the name Malcolm . Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) publicly backed McGregor (right) by introducing her on ABC's Australian Story, when she detailed her struggles as a man and then as a trans-woman . Ms McGregor had put off discussing her gender dysmorphia with her long-time pal - a Catholic conservative who openly opposes same-sex marriage - and in hindsight 'grossly under-estimated his capacity for friendship'. 'He didn't run a focus group or ring (conservative Liberal members) Cory Bernardi or Kevin Andrews to see if it was ok,' McGregor says. 'There is a kind of a firefighter buried inside the politician still and he tends to barge into burning buildings if his friends are in there.' Mr Abbott publicly backed his friend by introducing her on ABC's Australian Story, when she detailed her struggles as a man and then as a trans-woman. Ms McGregor, now Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force, spent 40 years in the Army, most of those under the name Malcolm. In 2012, after years of drowning agonising pain with alcohol and drugs, McGregor stopped 'functioning' as a man and chose to live as a woman. She tried to resign from the office of former Chief of Army David Morrison when her transformation became public. He refused her resignation. 'It was easier to tell David Morrison I was transgendered than I was going to become an air force officer,' she said. 'I love the Army for that.' Mr Abbott sits with Ms McGregor to commentate during the International tour match between the Prime Minister's XI and England at Manuka Oval in Canberra last year . The senior officer addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday as part of a women in media series . McGregor a senior officer knows she's 'benefited enormously' from male privilege. But she'd willingly sacrifice it all to have lived as a woman from her early 20s. The cricket commentator, columnist and former staffer to Bob Carr, addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday as part of a women in media series. At times, she became tearful. But even through tears she had the room laughing. 'The hormones are obviously working,' she quipped. 'I guess if Michael Clarke had to cry during a eulogy, I get to do a weep.' McGregor believes Mr Abbott wasn't given the credit he deserved for publicly embracing her and risking a wedge within his own party. 'He received cynical abuse from some quarters,' she said. 'There's no denying it, he has been vilified and become a hate figure to some extent.' And she won't attack him publicly, including his stance on same-sex marriage or his performance as minister for women. 'The one thing I'm not going to do is shop a friend for a round of applause.' The ABC did however report that she said: 'He's not a supporter of gay marriage, I'm sad about that.'","Cate McGregor is a Group Captain in the Royal Australian Air Force .

"The Muslim couple who were abused by a middle-aged woman on a Sydney train said they intend to press charges over the verbal attack. Hafeez Bhatti, 33, and his wife, Khalida, are a 'hardworking, honest and kind' parents of a little baby boy who moved from Pakistan several years ago seeking a better life in Australia. The couple were in Sydney for just a day when they were abused by an unknown woman on an Airport Line train on Wednesday afternoon. Stacey Eden, 23, overheard the ranter insulting the Muslim couple as 'ISIS terrorists' and was recorded on video standing up for the couple. Scroll down for video . Abused on the train: Young parents Hafeez Batthi, 33, and his wife, Khalida, 26, said they will be pressing charges on the woman who verbally attacked them on the train once she is identified . The abusive woman has not been identified despite the video of the attack going viral. NSW police sources told Daily Mail Australia a formal investigation is 'definitely' under way into Wednesday's incident. Mr Bhatti said he will be preparing a statement for Queensland police so charges can be pressed as soon as the woman is identified. 'She touched my wife's head, that is one issue that I will raise,' he said during a 7:30 Report interview. 'Then she was verbally abusing my wife. 'That's what I will ask, police to charge her once she will be identified.' The ABC reported that the couple were still quite shaken up by the incident and have been extra cautious when they leave the house. 'We take very special care, especially when we have to go out,' he said. 'I always look around that if somebody is noticing us. 'I should be very careful that no-one comes close to us or tries to hit us.' While Mr Bhatti would like to put the negative experience behind him he said he has received several threats online. When Stacey Eden witnessed Mrs Bhatti being verbally abused on a Sydney train she quickly jumped to her defence telling the abuser to 'have some respect' One comment from a Facebook profile called 'Christian Soldiers' read: ' I am a Christian I met you, I would have killed you a terrorist. F*****g Islamic Propaganda'. Mr Bhatti said he wouln't 'engage' in a conversation like that, instead deciding to show the comment to police. He said he has also faced criticism for not standing up for his wife, despite English not being his first language. 'People are saying I'm not a brave man for not standing up for my wife,' he said. 'In my local language, people are calling me a coward person. Mr Bhatti has faced criticism for not standing up for his wife but he said he wanted to show respect for the lady, even if she was mounting a verbal attack on the couple. 'I came to Australia but I don't know how to speak English, if I could have speak up.' Mr Bhatti said he didn't want to misrepresent his religion by reacting angrily to the abusive commuter. 'That was my respect for that old lady that I wasn't engaging aggressively and with bad language,' he said. 'I tried to educate her and at the same time I was calm.' Friends of the Islamic couple painted a picture of them as 'committed' members of the community in Brisbane. The family regularly attend the Holland Park mosque, community spokesman Ali Kadri said, and they are raising a newborn baby son, Mohammad, in the country which they are grateful to call home. Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf . Rant: Video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about Islam, bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a Muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf . Mr Bhatti said he was upset by the fact the abusive woman touched his wife's head . Now, in an extraordinary act of gratitude, the Brisbane couple's mosque in Holland Park has offered Ms Eden and her partner an all-expenses-paid trip to visit the Gold Coast for a night and to see their mosque. Ms Eden, a blood collector for a pathology company who was born and bred in Sydney's eastern suburbs, said she was planning to consider the 'lovely' offer after the overwhelming wave of international media attention passes. Mr Bhatti told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked by the ugly incident, which occurred on the Airport Line train around 1:40pm on Wednesday. Hafeez Bhatti, who was racially abused along with his wife on a Sydney train, thanked the woman who stood up for them . 'She asked my wife why she was wearing a scarf when it was hot outside - when my wife answered her I thought the woman was asking to be friendly,' Mr Bhatti said. 'Then she started saying Muslims like us are trying to conquer Australia and behead everyone here. We were absolutely shocked. 'It was just very disappointing.' 'She said all Muslims should be kicked out of Australia - I tried to calm things down by telling her we love everyone,' Mr Bhatti said. 'This sort of thing has happened before, but you try to ignore it and the ignorant people behind it; there are lots of very good people in Australian and only a few bad ones,' he said. 'God bless Stacey Eden who supported us.' Mr Bhatti reached out to Ms Eden on his Facebook page after the story emerged. Police are urging anyone who witnessed the attack, which was caught on camera, to come forward . Mr Bhatti posted the rant on his Facebook account with a special thanks to Stacey for supporting them that day . 'Stacey thanks again for your support for us on that day...I generally believe that you and many other Australian do respect all religions,' Mr Bhatti posted. In her recording of the incident, Ms Eden is heard fuming:  'She wears it (her hijab) for herself, OK!' 'She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body, not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her.' Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf. Ms Eden was not having a bar of it. 'That is not her doing it. That is a minority of people. Not a majority of people OK? 'It doesn't matter what they're doing... Have some respect, have some respect,' she said, as the woman continued on her tirade. 'It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What's that got to do with this poor lady? What's that got to do with her?' 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot .","Hafeez Bhatti and his wife Khalida were verbally abused on a Sydney train .

"Elton John and lead singer of the band REM Michael Stipe have joined forces calling for the equal rights of transgender inmates in response to allegations of mistreatment at a Georgia prison. ‘Transgender women in male prisons have an equal right to protection from violence and abuse in prison, and yet they continue to face horrific injustices,’ according to a joint statement the musicians released Tuesday. Last week, the US Justice Department said prison officials must treat an inmate’s gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition following a February lawsuit from the Southern Poverty Law Center filed against Georgia Department of Corrections officials on behalf of Ashley Diamond, a transgender woman. Allies: Elton John and lead singer of REM Michael Stipe have joined forces calling for the equal rights of transgender inmates . Prison officials must treat an inmate's gender identity condition just as they would treat any other medical or mental health condition, according to a Justice Department ruling in the case of transgender inmate Ashley Diamond . According to the lawsuit, prison officials did not provide sufficient treatment for 36-year-old Diamond’s gender dysphoria - a condition that causes a person to experience extreme distress because of a disconnect between the birth sex and gender identity. The lawsuit also said Diamond was without hormone treatment for three years and her body suffered as a result, and that she had been sexually assaulted and ridiculed in prison. ‘More often than not, assaults in part go unreported because the perpetrators are prison guards, wardens and staff,’ said Stipe and John, who founded the Elton John AIDS Foundation. ‘This is outrageous, and the message it sends is horrific: that violence against and discrimination of trans people is not only allowed, but sanctioned.’ Both John, 68, and Stipe, 55, are openly gay. The frontman of REM is a long-time supporter of the Rocket Man singer’s foundation. In their statement, John and Stipe applauded the Justice Department for coming out in support of Ms Diamond and for challenging the constitutionality of Georgia’s policy of denying transgender inmates hormone treatments. But the musicians argued that more steps must be taken to end the ‘culture of violence and discrimination.’ ‘We urge the state of Georgia to embrace desperately needed changes to their correctional system,’ the statement concluded. Last week, a judge ordered California’s corrections department to provide a transgender inmate with sex-reassignment surgery. It was the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state. A photo of Diamond compared to her Department of Corrections mugshot shows the drastic difference without maintaining treatment . The Justice Department filed a brief in Ashley Diamon's case last Friday saying it's not taking a position on the accuracy of Diamond's claims, but reminding prison officials that the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution requires them to provide inmates with individualized assessment and care for the condition. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan wrote in an email that the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation. While similar cases have been brought in other courts, Justice Department officials said this is the first time the agency has gotten involved in one of these cases. That action signals this administration's commitment to protecting the interests of transgender people in this context and sends a message to state officials that the federal government has taken a clear position on the substantive legal issues in the case, said Georgia State University law professor Russell Covey. 'If Georgia disagrees, that sort of holds out the possibility of some future legal conflict between the state and the federal government,' he said. 'It's a kind of shot across the bow.' Diamond has identified as female since she was a child and began hormone therapy when she was 17, the Southern Poverty Law Center lawsuit says. Diamond says she has been subject to ridicule and even sexual assault while behind bars . That gave her full breasts, a feminine shape, softer skin and a feminine appearance. Only inmates identified as transgender during their initial intake screenings are eligible for gender dysphoria treatment under Georgia Department of Corrections policy, but the personnel who do those screenings often aren't familiar with the condition, the lawsuit says. Despite having noticeable feminine physical characteristics and telling department staff she was transgender and receiving hormone therapy, Diamond was not evaluated for gender dysphoria and wasn't referred for treatment and her hormone therapy was halted, the lawsuit says. Though medical personnel subsequently evaluated her and determined she had gender dysphoria and that hormone therapy and female gender expression were medically necessary, department officials refused to authorize the treatment, the lawsuit says. So-called freeze-frame policies, that only allow inmates the level of treatment that they received before imprisonment and that allow no treatment for those who weren't initially classified as suffering from gender dysphoria are unconstitutional, the Justice Department brief says. Such policies violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Without the hormone treatment for the past three years, Diamond's body has suffered a painful physical transformation back to its masculine state and she has experienced severe mental anguish, the lawsuit says. She has also been subject to ridicule by inmates and prison staff and has been sexually assaulted by inmates because she hasn't been offered safe accommodation, the lawsuit says. Diamond, 36, identifies as a female and has been on hormone therapy since she was 17 . Southern Poverty Law Center staff attorney Chinyere Ezie said in an emailed statement Friday that the Justice Department brief bolsters their arguments. 'Transgender inmates like Ashley have a right to proper medical care,' Ezie said. 'They have a right to protection from violence and abuse and these rights are secured by the U.S. Constitution.' Other courts have ordered hormones, psychotherapy and other treatments for transgender inmates. A federal judge on Thursday ordered California's corrections department to provide a transgender inmate with sex-reassignment surgery, the first time such an operation has been ordered in the state. It was only the second time anywhere in the country that a judge issued an injunction directing a state prison system to provide the surgery, said Ilona Turner, legal director at the Transgender Law Center in Oakland. The previous order in a Massachusetts case was overturned last year and is being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.","John and Stipe issued a joint statement calling for equal rights of transgender inmates .

"Attorneys representing more than 8,000 women who were secretly recorded during pelvic exams by a gynecologist at Johns Hopkins will receive $32 million in legal fees from a $190million settlement. The sum, will be divided among patients of Dr. Nikita Levy, a gynecologist who secretly filmed and photographed thousands of women during gynecological exams at a Hopkins-affiliated clinic. The attorneys had originally asked for a 35 percent settlement fee, however the ruling by a Baltimore judge means they will only receive 17.25 per cent. Dr. Nikita Levy was fired from John Hopkins Health System in February 2013 after it was discovered he had surreptitiously videotaped and photographed thousands of women during gynecological exams . In his order the judge praised the attorneys for achieving 'extraordinary results,' and called the settlement 'unprecedented.' Jonathan Schochor, the suit's lead attorney, says he and the other attorneys won't challenge the judge's order. Dr. Levy was fired in February 2013, days after a co-worker alerted hospital authorities about her suspicions and he was forced to turn over the camera. He committed suicide ten days later. Investigators discovered roughly 1,200 videos and 140 images stored on a series of servers in his home. The settlement is one of the largest settlements on record in the U.S. involving sexual misconduct by a physician, and all but closes a case that never produced criminal charges but threatened the reputation of one of the world's leading medical institutions. Lawyers said thousands of women were traumatized, even though their faces were not visible in the images and it could not be established with certainty which patients were recorded or how many. He committed suicide ten days later. Investigators discovered roughly 1,200 videos and 140 images stored on a series of servers in his home . Hospital authorities called Baltimore police just before Levy's firing. Police and federal investigators said they found no evidence he shared the material with others. Levy, 54, graduated from the Weill Cornell Medical College in Manhattan, and completed his internship and residency at Kings County Hospital Center. He began working at Hopkins in 1988. When the allegations came to light, he was working at Hopkins East Baltimore Medical Center, a community practice affiliated with Johns Hopkins Hospital. During his 25-year tenure, he saw roughly 12,600 patients.

"One of Australia's most baffling cold cases of the so-called the Somerton Man may finally be solved after 67 years thanks to the technological advances in DNA testing. People walking along Somerton Beach, southwest of Adelaide, found a deceased fully-clothed man aged about 45 lying on the shore on December 1, 1948. A post-mortem determined that the man had died of poisoning but police and coronial investigations were unable to identify the body due to several factors including that the poison used to kill him was undetectable. The mystery of a dead man's body washed up on a beach 67 years ago may be solved thanks to the technological advances in DNA testing . The Persian phrase 'ended' was scrawled on the scrap of paper and the discovery of a secret code and a woman's telephone number in the book where the paper came from . Even a handwritten note found hidden in the pocket of a man's trousers did not provide any clues to the identity of the body - in fact it left experts even more puzzled. The Persian phrase 'ended' was scrawled on the scrap of paper and the discovery of a secret code and a woman's telephone number in the book where the paper came from. Adelaide University Professor Derek Abbott said there was 'a good chance' of identifying the body if South Australian Attorney-General, John Rau, agreed to exhuming the remains, which are buried at an Adelaide cemetery. 'Even with a body of that age, I think we will be able to get something,' he told The Adelaide Advertiser. In October 2011, Mr Rau rejected an exhumation to go ahead because he said it did not exceed 'public curiosity or broad scientific interest'. 'If circumstances existed ... that would warrant my considering an exhumation it would be considered, however, those circumstances don't exist and never have,' he said. American forensic genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick, who was in Adelaide yesterday as part of an expert panel discussing the Somerton Man, said she could take the body's DNA code and search ethnicity markers using data across 50 countries to find the man's origin. 'Yes, the man is dead and at peace, hopefully, but there also may be family looking for him,' Dr Fitzpatrick said.

"New York is set to officially break ground this week on a Ferris wheel that could become the tallest in the world once it is completed in early 2017. But any reign for the New York Wheel would be brief, as Dubai started construction a few days ago on a Ferris wheel that will be just 60ft higher. The humongous attraction on Staten Island promises stunning panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline, in addition to other New York City boroughs and the neighbouring state of New Jersey. Planners for the New York Wheel said it will offer stunning panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline and other New York boroughs . Set near the St George Ferry terminal the giant observation wheel will cost an estimated $25 to $30 for a 38-minute ride . Located next to the Hudson River the 630ft New York Wheel will be able to carry as many as 1,400 passengers at a time, with one full cycle taking about 38 minutes to complete. It will include mobile bar cars, a 20-seat restaurant, a 4-D ride on the ground and an LED light show every night, in addition to alternative energy sources. A shopping mall and 200-room hotel are to be built next door. Ticket prices will range from an estimated $25 to $30 (£17 to £20) as New York Wheel LLC, the company behind the ambitious project, hopes it will join the Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building and Times Square as one of New York’s must-visit attractions. Located on the bank of the Hudson River the New York Wheel will be able to carry as many as 1,400 passengers at a time . The $500million (£340million) observation wheel was designed by Perkins Eastman and EEK Architects, and is being built by Starneth BV, the Dutch company which erected the London Eye and is overseeing the Dubai Eye. Wil Armstrong, president of Starneth LLC, told Mashable that the Dubai Eye is ahead, but ‘anything could happen to delay it’ and give New York Wheel the lead. Dubai’s observation wheel will stand 690ft tall when it is complete, making it the world’s biggest. At 550ft, the current record holder is the High Roller in Las Vegas, followed by the Singapore Flyer (541ft), China’s Star of Nanchang (525ft), and the London Eye (443ft). The $500million observation wheel  is being built by Starneth BV, the Dutch company which erected the London Eye . Planners hope the New York Wheel will join the Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building as a top attraction in New York City . The original Ferris wheel, built in Chicago, was 264ft tall. New York’s giant Ferris wheel will be located near the St George Ferry Terminal, which welcomes an estimated two million tourists every year. Planners for the New York Wheel believe it will attract more than three million riders every year, and claim it will create about 350 construction and 600 permanent jobs in ticket sales, maintenance and other positions. The company said it is currently in talks with the New York Police Department and a private security firm to prepare a security plan for the tourist attraction.","Official ground-breaking for the 630-ft New York Wheel will take place this week on Staten Island .

"The camera on your iPhone could soon help save your life by testing to see if you have cancer in just a few minutes. Scientists have developed a device that clips onto the smartphone and could even eventually be used at home. Their device uses the powerful cameras available now on most smartphones in combination with tiny beads that bind to cancerous cells. Scroll down for video . The graphic above shows how a blood sample can be mixed with microbeads that bind to cancerous cells (labelled A). When these are placed in a clip on module (B) that attaches to a iPhone camera (C) the microbeads produce distinctive diffraction patterns when they clump around a diseased cell (top right) When added to a tissue or blood sample, these microbeads bind to any cancerous cells in the sample, changing the way light passes through it. Using a smartphone app, these images can then be sent to a central computer for analysis and then the result returned in less than 45 minutes. A tissue sample taken from a biopsy or blood from a simple finger prick is mixed with microbeads labelled with specific antibodies. This mixture is then placed on a slide that is inserted into a module that can clip onto the camera of a smartphone. An LED at the back of the module illuminates the sample on the slide and lens in the module magnifies the image, which is then captured using the camera on the phone. The scientists used an iPhone 4S in their tests meaning an 8MP camera is enough. When clumped around a cell, the beads alter the way the light is scattered by the sample. They produce distinctive diffraction patterns in in the image if clumped together. The user can send this image to a central computer for analysis. The researchers claim it can asses 100,000 cells from a single image in around 45 minutes. The researchers say each test costs around £1.20 ($1.80). The scientists behind the device, based at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, say it can even return results within two minutes. They have already tested their device to detect cervical cancer in tissue samples obtained during smear tests. However, they say the system - known as digital diffraction diagnosis or D3 - can be adapted to screen for other types of cancers and they have already begun a trial testing for lymphoma. Professor Ralph Weissleder, a system's biologist at Harvard Medical School who led the work, said it could even be used to help diagnose infectious diseases like HIV, TB and Ebola. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Professor Weissleder and his colleagues said: 'We envisage that these advances will position D3 as a versatile screening tool for various cancer types (eg cervix, breast ad lymphoma) and infectious diseases (eg Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis) with applications in field work, mobile clinics and home care settings.' The device works by using microbeads that specifically target molecules that sit on the surface of cancer cells. Diseased cells often produce molecules that makes them stand out from healthy tissue and so can be detected by antibodies. The graphic above shows how the new device works with a iPhone to analyse samples for signs of cancer . The images above show how the microbeads (small white circles in bottom images) clump around cells (dotted lines) in samples that were found to be of high risk of cervical cancer (left) low risk (middle) and benign (right) By attaching specific antibodies to the beads, it is possible to make them bind to these molecules, meaning they will gather around a cancerous cell in a tissue or blood sample. The scientists developed a module that can be attached to the camera of an iPhone 4s device . A tissue sample taken from a biopsy or blood from a simple finger prick could be mixed with these labelled microbeads and then placed on a slide. This is then inserted into a module that can be clipped onto the camera of a smartphone. An LED at the back of the module illuminates the sample on the slide and an image is taken by the camera on the phone. The scientists used an iPhone 4S in their tests. When clumped around a cell, the beads alter the way the light passes through the sample by scattering it into distinctive diffraction patterns. This can be detected by a central computer that looks for these distinctive patterns. The researchers say each test costs around £1.20 ($1.80). They tested the device on 25 women whose smear tests suggested they were at risk of cervical cancer. The graphic above shows the internal structure of the diagnosis module that can be attacked to a smartphone . They also used it to detect infection with human papilloma virus, which is thought to cause the cancer. The images above show how the diffraction patterns created by beads and cells change when the beads clump around a cell, highlighting cancerous cells (bottom) compared to a healthy cell (top) They found that their results were between 92% and 100% accurate when compared to the current 'gold standard' diagnostic test. Professor Weissleder said that the prevalence of smartphone technology around the world could bring tests like this to remote areas. He said: 'By taking advantage of the increased penetration of mobile phone technology worldwide, the system should allow the prompt triaging of suspicious or high-risk cases that could help to offset delays caused by limited pathology services in those regions and reduce the need for patients to return for follow-up care, which is often challenging for them. Dr Cesar Castro, a cancer specialist at Massachusets General Hospital, said it could prove invaluable for places like Botswana, where there are less than 10 pathologists in the whole country. He said: 'The global burden of cancer, limited access to prompt pathology services in many regions and emerging cell profiling technologies increase the need for low-cost, portable and rapid diagnostic approaches that can be delivered at the point of care.' Parents can use their smartphone to spot the early stages of retinoblastoma, an aggressive, deadly eye cancer affecting predominantly young children. The cancer, which develops in the retinal cells of the eye, is fast growing and lead to sufferers needing their eye removed. Taking a photo of a child's eye using a flash can highlight signs of a tumour as the cells reflect the light back, making the pupil appear white. The Childhood Eye Cancer Trust launched a campaign last year urging parents to use their smartphones to conduct the test.","Digital diffraction diagnosis or D3 could be used to detect cancerous cells in blood or tissue samples and even detect infections from HIV and Ebola .

"A helicopter hero travelled 23,000 miles to find every chopper he had ever flown - only to find one had been converted into a posh camping facility. Jerry Grayson, who lives in Melbourne but is originally from Arundel, Sussex, set himself the task of tracking down every aircraft he ever flew as part of Royal Navy rescue missions during the 1970s. The 59-year-old, who now designs aerial stunts for films, was once the youngest pilot to join the navy and was responsible for saving 15 yachtsmen during the doomed Fastnet Yacht Race in 1979. Former Royal Navy rescue pilot Jerry Grayson, who was involved in rescuing sailors during the Fastnet Yacht Rescue in 1979 (pictured), has tracked down every aircraft he flew in during the 1970s . After travelling 23,000 miles, including from his home in Melbourne, Mr Grayson found that one of the choppers had been turned into a glamping unit - a popular style of camping for posh campers . The Wessex Mark 1 (pictured) now resides between a gypsy caravan and an old Routemaster bus in Blackberry Wood campsite near Ditchling, Sussex . During his mission, Mr Grayson found that most of the helicopters had been blown up in target practice or turned into museum pieces. But he discovered that one chopper, a Wessex Mark 1, has been kitted out as a so-called 'glamping' unit, accommodation for campers who want something more luxurious than a traditional tent. The Mark 1, called Wessex XS 886, now resides between a gypsy caravan and an old Routemaster bus in Blackberry Wood campsite near Ditchling, Sussex. Mr Grayson said: 'It's bizarre that it's now being used to sleep in. If I'd fallen asleep in a Mark 1 35 years ago, it would have cost me my life. It didn't feel like three decades ago that I'd last set foot inside. 'But when I looked at all the switches and dials I realised I can't remember how to start the thing.' Mr Grayson's journey took him all around the UK. He is pictured at the International Helicopter Museum in Weston-Super-Mare . He also tracked down another chopper at Gunsmoke Paintball in Hadleigh, near Ipswich - where it is used as part of the course . The tour also took him to another paintball site in Bawtry Fields, Doncaster, where he found another aircraft . The helicopter may be fitted with beds, curtains and cushioned seats. But, between 1977 and 1979, Mr Grayson flew in the aircraft for six rescues out of his base in Cornwall. He said: 'We used to save people from the cliff sides. Things like children in dinghies being blow out to sea or surfers suffering with the bends. 'Once we rescued a woman who had injured herself after falling off the cliff near a theatre. The whole cast of A Midsummer Night's Dream watched as we did it.' Mr Grayson, who is writing a book about his experiences, pictured with the helicopter in which he learned to fly at the age of 17 . The former pilot at Whittington Barracks, Staffordshire (left) and Taskforce Paintball, Cowbridge, South Wales . One of two helicopters that Mr Grayson found at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovilton . Mr Grayson's interest in retracing his old aircraft was piqued when he found a website, created by a former pilot, which spoke out previous experiences. The pair got in touch and began swapping stories. And as he dug deeper into the history of the helicopters, he decided to make one last visit to each one to see what had happened to them. His trip then took him from Melbourne to several parts of the UK, including London, Sussex, Doncaster, Cambridge, Ipswich, Yeovilton and Newport. He said: 'The natural cycle of life is that a helicopter first serves its time in a front line role and then gets allocated to a second line role such as training or SAR. He was awarded with Air Forces Cross by the Queen for outstanding gallantry in search and rescue. Pictured: Mr Grayson flying a helicopter, as smoke pours out . By the age of 25, he had become the most decorated naval pilot in peacetime. Pictured: Mr Grayson flying a Wessex 1 from HMS Ark Royal during the height of the Cold War . Mr Grayson, pictured at the controls of a Wessex 5, joined the Fleet Air Arm in 1972 aged 17. It made him the youngest helicopter pilot to serve in the Royal Navy . 'It then serves one final useful role as a teaching tool for young engineers or for airport fire services. 'As most of these aircraft were built in the early 60s the only surprise was that out of the 31 Wessex helicopters I used for rescues there are still 12 in existence.' Mr Grayson joined the Fleet Air Arm in 1972 aged 17. It made him the youngest helicopter pilot to serve in the Royal Navy. By the age of 25 he had become the most decorated naval pilot in peacetime and was awarded with Air Forces Cross by the Queen for outstanding gallantry in search and rescue. As well as being a rescuer during Fastnet, Mr Grayson has previously gone head-to-head with Russian submarines and was entrusted with carrying the key for a nuclear weapon aged just 19. He now designs shoots and aerial stunts for films, including Black Hawk Down. He is writing about his latest experience for his book 'Rescue Pilot: Cheating the Sea'.

"A woman who allegedly dumped her quadriplegic son in the woods so she could spend the week with her out-of-state boyfriend is now facing an attempted murder charge, police have said. Nyia Parler, 41, has been hospitalized for undisclosed reasons in Maryland ever since her 21-year-old son was found in a pile of wet leaves in Cobb Creek Park in Philadelphia last Friday. Police believe the man had been left in the woods all week - with nothing but a bible and a blanket - and was exposed to the rain and cold and to wild animals. He was found next to his wheelchair. Parler was initially charged with aggravated assault, kidnapping and neglect of a care-dependent person, and police have now added attempted murder to the list. Accused: Nyia Parler, 41, who is in hospital for undisclosed reasons, now faces an attempted murder charge for allegedly dumping her disabled son, 21, in the rainy and cold woods for five days . Charged: Parler (right) left her son on Monday to visit her boyfriend John Ferguson (left), right. Ferguson thought that other relatives were looking after the son, while Parler told relatives the boy was with her . Police said they did not expect to arrest Parler until she was cleared for release from the hospital and charged in Maryland as a fugitive. They would then seek to have her extradited. Captain Paul Starks of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department in Maryland said on Monday that security reasons prevented him from disclosing the name of the facility where Parler is being held and medical privacy laws prevented him from discussing Parler's health condition. The last time the mother and son were seen together was on Easter Sunday. She then allehedly boarded a bus to visit her new boyfriend, John Ferguson, in Maryland, authorities said. She told concerned relatives last week that she had taken her son with her when she went to visit her boyfriend, who thought that family members were watching the son, police said. But the son attends a public high school that had inquired about his absences, they said. Horrific: The quadriplegic man was found on the floor of a secluded woodland outside Philadelphia with this Bible and this blanket, 10 feet from his wheelchair. He'd allegedly been left there by his mother . Abandoned: A passerby saw the 21-year-old's wheelchair and found the man after going to investigate . Investigation: Officers recovered the man's wheelchair (pictured) for evidence after he was found alone . Relatives, who had been contacted by the boy's school when he didn't turn up to class, commented on Parler's Facebook page, 'nyia call me asap,' and 'How the hell you happy?!? Call me!' The son, who has cerebral palsy, was found around the corner from his home by a person who saw the wheelchair and went to investigate. If the person hadn't done that, Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker said, 'this kid would have died a miserable death'. The son was in stable condition at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia on Monday after being treated for dehydration, malnutrition and abrasions, Walker said. 'This kid is obviously a fighter,' Walker told ABC. 'It's just unbelievable how we found him last night. It's just heartbreaking to see how another human, especially a mother, could treat him like that.'","Nyia Parler 'left her son in the woods in Philadelphia so that she could spend the week with her boyfriend in Maryland'

"It is the biggest culinary question which divides the Westcountry: when eating a scone, do you add jam or cream first? Today David Cameron waded into the long-running dispute, and quickly got into a muddle about the Devon and Cornish way of eating a cream tea. The Prime Minister made the gaffe on a campaign visit to Devon, before risking the wrath of purists by claiming 'it all tastes the same'. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, on a visit to Devon this morning, made the blunder of confusing the two methods for eating a cream tea . How do you eat your scone? How do you eat your scone? Now share your opinion . The Tory leader has spent the day campaigning in Devon, where he must win several seats if he is to stand any chance of winning a majority. But his hopes of courting support in the county were given a knock with his food faux pas as he chatted with staff and customers of Tea by the Taw on The Strand in Barnstaple, the North Devon Gazette reported. All good politicians know how to make small talk with voters, but the jam and cream debate is no trifling matter. In an attempt to woo the locals, Mr Cameron ventured: 'When you are in Devon you do the jam and the cream in a different order to Cornwall, is that right?' Sensing a gaffe was imminent, he went on: 'I'm going to get this wrong, aren't I?' His prediction was correct, as he added: 'In Devon it's... jam first and cream on top?' His comments were greeted with silence and stony faces, as the staff realised someone was going to have to put the Prime Minister right. 'Wrong way round. I knew I'd get it wrong,' Mr Cameron said. 'It all tastes the same, doesn't it?'. Wrangles over whether it should be jam first or cream, and whipped cream or clotted, have been running for generations, with references to the sweet treat dating back to the 11th century. The Devon tradition is to slather the scone with cream first, while the Cornish – who also lay claim to inventing cream teas – prepare their scones the opposite way. Two years ago, an academic devised what was claimed to be the mathematical formula for the perfect cream tea, and it used the Cornish way. Dr Eugenia Cheng, of Sheffield University, concluded that the best weight ratio is 2:1:1, which means an average scone, weighing 70g, requires 35g of jam and 35g of cream . The Tory leader has spent the day campaigning in Devon, where he must win several seats if he is to stand any chance of winning a majority . Academic Dr Eugenia Cheng, of Sheffield University, devised what was claimed to be the mathematical formula for the perfect cream tea, and it used the Cornish way. Dr Cheng set the ideal thickness of the scone, with all its elements added, at about 2.8cm, allowing a relaxed open width of the mouth when taking a bite. The equation also specifies the thickness of the cream and jam layers. Dr Cheng's formula is a victory for Cornwall, with jam spread first due to avoid it running off the edge. Another rule in the scientific method is to use clotted rather than whipped cream. This is due to the excessive volume of whipped cream needed to satisfy the weight ratio. The thickness of the layer should not exceed that of the scone.","Prime Minister makes culinary blunder as he tries to woo Devon voters .

"Locked up: Martin Alvarado Jr, 23, allegedly repeatedly hit his girlfriend's young son last week . A 23-year-old man beat his girlfriend's 18-month-old son to death for urinating him as he changed the boy's diaper, according to police. Martin Alvarado Jr., from Cicero, Illinois, appeared in court on Monday on a first-degree murder charge for the death of Edwin Eli O'Reilly and has been ordered to be held without bail. He was watching Edwin at their home in Cicero last Thursday when the toddler urinated on him during a diaper change, according to authorities. Enraged, Alvarado allegedly repeatedly hit the little boy. Police and paramedics responded to the home following a call about an unresponsive child and Edwin was rushed to MacNeal Hospital in Berywn, where he later died. According to the Cook County Medical Examiner, the child suffered from multiple blunt force trauma and his death was ruled a homicide. During questioning, Alvarado allegedly confessed to the assault on videotape, the Chicago Tribune reported. An Illinois Department of Children and Family Services spokeswoman said the agency had prior contact with the family, but would not provide further details.

"Standing at 174 centimetres at just 12 years old, Venessa Harris looked destined to be a model. But just months after winning a modelling contest that would take her overseas, the 12-year-old's lofty plans to make it to the runway hit a snag. Venessa was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer on January 5 after a nasty fall, which left her with pains in her leg. Aspiring model Venessa Harris, 12, was diagnosed with bone cancer just months after she won a talent search . Venessa is pictured with her proud mother, Karen Monaghan, and grandmother, Lyn Harris . At first doctors dismissed it as growing pains but shortly after discovered she had Ewing’s sarcoma as her discomfort continued. Venessa's parents Kelly Harris and Karen Monaghan found out that their daughter could have cancer on Christmas Eve, but her condition wasn't confirmed until the new year. Mr Harris and Ms Monaghan spent Christmas at the family's Windorah home, in central west Queensland, with a dark cloud hanging over their head. 'It was really hard, extremely hard. We'd gone home Christmas Eve,' Ms Monaghan told Daily Mail Australia. The 12-year-old was the international winner in the Tamblyn Young Model Discovery contest . Venessa, whose family live in Windorah, gained self-confidence from the competition after struggling with low self-esteem . Her family have been a constant support for Venessa who is currently undergoing chemotherapy in Brisbane . 'It was a very scary at that time. We were given clear instructions for her not to use her leg.' Then days later at Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in South Brisbane, a doctor told the family what they had feared after Venessa underwent medical scans. The cancer was located in the neck of Venessa's right femur and she was told it had eaten away so much of her bone that it had the thickness of an egg shell. 'The first few weeks were really chaotic and extremely stressful, as Kelly and I went through that uncontrollable fear stage,' Ms Monaghan said. The family's mood was in stark contrast to what it had been just months earlier, when Venessa was named international winner in the Tamblyn Young Model Discovery contest in September. Ms Monaghan said the contest had lifted Venessa's spirits and boosted her self esteem. 'She was feeling pretty down with her self-esteem. You don't get to do many girly things out west,' the 45-year-old said. She hopes to pursue a career in modelling after she recovers. Tamblyn Models have started a fundraising campaign for their rising star . Venessa had suffered a fall and her leg started to hurt. It was after this she discovered she had cancer . 'We had entered her in the quest when her self-esteem was taking a hard battering at the time. 'It was an emotional night and a great thing for Venessa to participate in and to bring that self-esteem in her up again.' The win meant Venessa was signed by Tamblyn Models who would help her learn how to succeed in her chosen career. 'They teach Venessa things like how to walk, dress and prepare her for an overseas trip when she's 15 or so, when she is old enough to participate in some modelling jobs.' Ms Monaghan told Daily Mail Australia. Now that Venessa has been handed this opportunity she is prepared to hit the ground running when she has recovered. The 12-year-old is destined to be a model with the height of 174 centimetres and is determined to fulfill her dreams . Her family is able to be close by to Venessa as she receives her cancer treatment thanks to Childhood Cancer Support . Fortunately, Venessa is expected to make a full recovery after her chemotherapy treatment as doctors caught the cancer early . 'She's our selfie queen. She's always loved the camera,' Ms Monaghan said. 'It's all happened really differently to what we expected of Venessa and [modelling is] what she wants to do, she's made her mind up.' But it is not just Venessa's career Tamblyn Models has been helping with. Ms Monaghan said she did not know what she would have done without the help of founder Pam Tamblyn who assisted in finding them a place to stay with Childhood Cancer Support. The organisation - who are supported by the modelling agency - helps provide accommodation to rural families who want to live in the city to be closer their loved ones receiving much-needed medical treatment for conditions, such as cancer. Tamblyn Models have also started a fundraising campaign to help Venessa and her family through her cancer treatment. Fortunately, Venessa is expected to make a full recovery after her chemotherapy treatment as doctors caught the cancer early. This is the same good news more and more young Australians are receiving. Over recent decades, the rate of childhood cancer survival has risen by six per cent, according to new Cancer Council figures. Latest data shows a reduction in mortality rates overall, and an increase in five-year relative survival for all childhood cancers from 76 per cent in 1992-2001 to 82 per cent during 2002-2011. Sadly, one in five children still will die from cancer within five years, with about 95 children under the age of 15 dying from cancer each year in Australia.","Venessa Harris was diagnosed with rare bone cancer at the age of 12 years .

"The devastated mother of a schoolgirl killed by a speeding driver who was on drugs had ‘dark thoughts’ about committing suicide at the spot where her daughter died, a court heard yesterday. Liberty Baker, 14, was walking to school when Robert Blackwell, 19, lost control of his car and ploughed into her. He had been smoking cannabis and was allegedly checking a text on his phone at the time of the crash. Scroll down for video . Heartbreak: Maureen Baker is consoled by her husband, Paul, outside Oxford Crown Court after seeing their daughter's killer jailed for four years. The family say they are 'devastated' by the sentence handed to him . Liberty Baker was killed last June by teenager Robert Blackwell. The 19-year-old, who smoked cannabis the day before crashing into the schoolgirl while texting at the wheel, was jailed for four years . As the baby-faced teenager was sentenced to four years in prison, Oxford Crown Court heard how Maureen Baker, 45, had wanted to walk in front of a car at the scene of her child’s death so they could be reunited. Her husband Paul, 47, told the hearing his wife was depressed and had been unable to return to her job at Oxford University. He said in an impact statement: ‘In the early days after Liberty’s death, Maureen would often have dark thoughts of wanting to return to the scene and walk in front of a vehicle so she could be with Liberty. ‘She has many flashbacks and often goes to Liberty’s room praying Liberty is there but she never is. If it was not for our son Finley, I honestly believe that Maureen would not be here now.’ Blackwell, who had previously been cautioned for possession of cannabis, had traces of the drug in his bloodstream at the time of the crash and admitted to smoking cannabis the day before. Jailing the teenager, Judge Ian Pringle said his speed – 44mph in a 30mph zone – had been ‘grossly excessive’. Blackwell’s lips quivered as he received his sentence and he wiped away tears as he was taken down to the cells. The teenager was walking to school in Witney, Oxfordshire, when she was struck by Blackwell's car . Tragic: Liberty's family offered heartbreaking victim impact statements in court . Liberty's family offered heartbreaking victim impact statements during the trial of Robert Blackwell. Among them was Finley's, her 11-year-old brother, who said learning of her death was 'the worst day'. 'I feel there is a big hole in our family circle. My feelings are of sadness and anger,' he said. 'I worry about my mum and dad, I have a big responsibility to make mum and dad happy. 'I hope the man goes to jail.' In a separate poem read aloud in court he told his sister: 'There is a new angel in the sky. Those special memories of you will always make me smile. 'If I could have you back just for a while. It's been a year since you passed away, I still think of you every day in my own special way. 'I hate not knowing for sure what happens when you die. But I really love to believe there is heaven past the sky.' Reading a statement on behalf of the whole family to the court, Mr Baker said Liberty's death had left their lives 'severely shattered' and that they felt 'utterly devastated'. He said: 'Liberty left the house at 7.55am to go to school. Within 10 minutes out lives had been destroyed and changed forever. 'We are all still in disbelief and cannot understand how Liberty could have been killed whilst walking innocently to school along the footpath which she had done for the past three years. 'The future milestones that we would have taken for granted such as Liberty wearing her prom dress, going to university, her 18th and 21st birthdays and being able to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day have been so cruelly taken from us. 'Day to day life will never be the same. Our house has gone from a very happy, vibrant home which used to run like clockwork. Now it is a house which just about functions. 'No parent should have to bury their child especially after an avoidable event.' Speaking outside court, Mr Baker said: ‘We are devastated at the sentence. This man’s actions cost my daughter her life and we will have to live with our loss every single day. ‘He is only likely to spend a few years in prison… Our lives will never be the same again.’ The crash happened as Liberty and two friends walked to the Henry Box school in Witney, Oxfordshire, just after 8am on June 30 last year. The judge heard that Blackwell was likely to have been checking a text message from his girlfriend when he lost control of his blue Citroen C2. Blackwell, of Bampton, failed to turn for a significant left-hand bend and continued driving straight on. Blackwell wept as he was led away to the cells. He is seen arriving yesterday before being jailed for four years . Liberty's father Paul Baker (left) said he wished he had been killed instead. Her mother, Maureen (right with Finley, Liberty's 10-year-old brother) broke down in tears at a previous court hearing . His speeding car mounted the pavement, first hitting pedestrian Paul Cracknell, 54, who suffered severe injuries from which he is still recovering. It then hit Liberty, who was thrown into the windscreen and over the roof before landing in the road – she was killed on impact. One of her friends was also struck but escaped with cuts and bruises. Prosecutor Ian Hope said: ‘He completely failed to negotiate the sweeping left-hand bend. He quite literally just didn’t turn. The most obvious reason for the gross lack of attention was he was in some way messing about with his phone.’ Mitigating, Claire Fraser said Blackwell denied looking at his phone and claimed the cannabis in his bloodstream had not affected his driving. She added that he told his probation officer: ‘I need to be punished.’ Following her death campaigners fundraised for a tree to be planted in Liberty's memory. Above, the grass verge where she was run over . Liberty was on her way to Henry Box School in Witney, Oxfordshire (above) when she was hit by the car . Blackwell's car following the incident last June. Liberty was struck as she crossed the road and tossed onto his windscreen . In a statement to the court, Liberty’s 11-year-old brother Finley described being taken out of his classroom and to hospital to say ‘goodbye’ to his sister. He said it was ‘the worst day’. Finley said: ‘I feel there is a big hole in our family circle. My feelings are of sadness and anger. I worry about my mum and dad, I have a big responsibility to make my mum and dad happy. ‘I am an only child. I hope the man goes to jail.’ Mr Baker added: ‘The future milestones that we would have taken for granted such as Liberty going to university… birthdays and being able to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day have been so cruelly taken from us. ‘No parent should have to bury their child, especially after an avoidable event.’ Blackwell, who pleaded guilty, was jailed for four years for causing death by dangerous driving and two years for causing serious injuries by dangerous driving, to run concurrently.","Liberty Baker was killed as she walked to school in Witney, Oxfordshire .

"A middle-aged mother from New Orleans has been arrested for allegedly dousing two teenage girls with bleach for cutting in line at a gas station store. Police say 55-year-old Deanna Rudison was captured on a surveillance camera at Quick Stop gas station in the 3300 block of Carondelet Street this morning splashing a liquid believed to be bleach at an 18-year-old girl and her 15-year-old friend. Just hours after the incident, which took place just before 8am Monday, the woman turned herself in and was arrested on two counts of aggravated battery. Bleach attack: Deanna Rudison, 55, has been charged with aggravated battery after New Orleans police say she was caught on video throwing bleach in the face of two Cohen High School students (one of them pictured here in her school uniform talking on the phone) Splashed: This is the moment the suspect doused the girls with bleach, allegedly in retaliation for skipping the line at the convenience store . Rudison's son, 27-year-old Jonathan Rudison, who was with her and allegedly took part in the attack on the two Cohen High School students, remained at large Monday evening. Investigators say the older of the two victims was standing in line at the gas station convenience store at around 7.40am when Deanna Rudison came up to her angrily accusing the girl of skipping the line to pay for her purchases. The 18-year-old girl went outside to speak to her friend in the parking lot when Rudison approached the two carrying two white bottles of liquid from the Quick Stop and threw it in the girls' faces, as seen in a surveillance video obtained by Nola.com. Crime scene: The incident took place Monday morning at this Quick Stop gas station in New Orleans . Moments later, Rudison’s son joined the group in the parking lot and a tussle ensued. During the physical altercation, which involved pushing and shoving, the man allegedly hurled one of the high school students to the ground, breaking her arm, reported WVUE. The mother and son then took off from the scene of the crime. One of the girls gave chase and managed to kick a window's in Rudison's silver car before it peeled off from the parking lot. Both girls were taken to the hospital to be treated for a suspected exposure to bleach, and one of them was also treated for a fracture. In the course of the investigation, Deanna Rudison showed up at the Sixth District police station this afternoon and turned herself in. Her son has been named a person of interest in the parking lot attack.","Deanna Rudison, 55, charged with two counts of aggravated battery in New Orleans bleach attack .

"A 16-year-old boy who was seized in an anti-terror operation after he tried to buy deadly poison on the internet has been spared jail after the court heard he wanted to commit suicide. The teenager from Mossley, Greater Manchester, who cannot be named for legal reasons, ordered the deadly toxin off the 'dark web'. He was unaware his online requests were being tracked by covert counter-terrorism officers who feared he was planning an attack. The teenager pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court earlier this month. A 16-year-old boy who was seized in an anti-terror operation after he tried to buy deadly poison on the internet has been spared jail after the court heard he wanted to commit suicide . But he claimed he was attempting to buy the deadly poison because he wanted to commit suicide and was sentenced to a 12 month referral order. Officers from the North West Counter Terrorism Unit started investigating the teenager in January when they received information that he was attempting to obtain the poison. Officers were in contact with the boy over the dark web - a subsection of deep web which is not indexed by standard search engines so users are less likely to be monitored. During their covert communication he expressed an interest in buying the poison and also showed an awareness of its toxicity and potential for use in causing harm. The teenager pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court (pictured) earlier this month . The 16-year-old  attempted to place an order on February 6 and also suggested he would make future purchases in larger quantities. Officers raided two homes in Tameside on February 16 and the 16-year-old boy was arrested. A 16-year-old girl was also arrested as part of the investigation but later released without charge. The dark web is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website, and its successor that were recently shut down, was used to sell drugs in exchange for Bitcoins. Other dark net sites let users share pornographic photographs, hacked information and credit card numbers. Det Sgt Russell Stubbs said after the case: 'The teenager at the centre of this investigation is clearly a vulnerable, troubled young man and I hope now that this case is concluded he can get the help and support he needs to turn his life around. 'Thanks to the vigilance of officers from a number of different law enforcement agencies, we were able to intervene before this young man did get hold of such a deadly substance from a genuine seller. 'I want to reassure our communities that the North West Counter Terrorism Unit and local police are well aware of the potential dangers associated with internet activity on the 'dark web'. Law enforcement agencies use a range of investigative techniques to monitor and police unlawful internet activity. 'I would also urge parents of children to keep a very close eye on what their children are doing. Security measures are available to block certain sites and if you suspect your child is spending too much time on the Internet and you notice sudden changes in their behaviour then please report it. 'As in this case, the sooner we are able to identify someone either at risk or using the 'dark web' for criminal purposes the better chance we have to consider appropriate intervention options.' Last year, a graphic designer who fantasised about poisoning her mother after she forbade her from marrying the man became the first person to be prosecuted under the Biological Weapons Act. Kuntal Patel, from Stratford, east London, had wished her 'selfish and controlling' mother Meena Patel dead after the 61-year-old was 'hell-bent' on breaking up her engagement, a court was told. During the trial at Southwark Crown Court, the court heard the 37-year-old contacted a dealer in the U.S through the 'dark web' and said she needed a 'tasteless' and deadly toxin to get her mother 'out of the way'.

"A digital art student has used Photoshop to show what her body might look like if she could mold it like modelling clay on a whim. Kelsey Higley, who studies art media at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, created a fascinating self-portrait of her body, showing what it would look like if it were digitally trimmed or augmented into various shapes considered beautiful. The 22-year-old's work, which is part of a project and has been published on video-sharing site Vimeo, shows just how different her frame might look if she had, for example, an hour-glass figure, or larger boobs. Scroll down for video . Before the process: Oklahoma University student Kelsey Higley, pictured above in her natural form, made a video entitled 'Manipulation' which showed her body digitally altered according to beauty trends . At its most extreme, Kelsey's body has a tiny waist, large breasts and large eyes. The project, entitled 'Manipulation' used 126 different images resulting in a video that was published on Vimeo . She even digitally alters her face, making her eyes appear much bigger than they are. The artist set her camera on a timer to take a photograph every seven seconds and posed as if she 'wanted to look like someone else'. The resulting video, entitled 'Manipulated', plays in a non-stop loop for over a minute and sees her proportions morphing into different shapes, often cartoon, highlighting the constantly changing beauty ideals that women face. Bigger boobs, smaller waist: Art Media student Kelsey made her body pliable by using photoshop to show what she'd look like with different proportions . The student artist browsed through hundreds of images of what might be considered beautiful and even changed the proportions of her eyes, seen as normal, left, and much bigger, right . Kelsey, who graduates in May, says that after spending 'countless hours' browsing magazines for body trends, she combined '126 digitally manipulated photos that create the illusion that I am molding my body like modeling clay.' She told entertainment and lifestyle website Hello Giggles: 'Being a young woman, I have had many battles with this idea of beauty. 'I’ll go through stages where all I want in life is to be super fit with rock hard abs and big boobs, then after a while I’ll flip to the other side and tell myself that I should love and embrace the body I have. This time Kelsey experiments with a nipped-in waist and small breasts. The artist took a different image every seven seconds to capture the video . Fantasy proportions: With big eyes and large breasts in one shot (left)...Kelsey then slims down her frame to be much more slender (right) 'But as soon as I start scrolling through the Internet, my mind is flooded with images of this impossible, ""ideal"" beauty.' She goes on to explain that 'the video goes through several stages of “beauty” as I receive conflicting opinions on what true beauty is. As I go back and forth, I end on my natural body and the video starts over.' The aim of the project, which has garnered an art award, she adds, is to illustrate 'the effects media and public opinions have on the way we look at ourselves.' 'I have chosen to use myself in this short to show my own inner conflict with beauty as I battle with the desire to look like someone else and the acceptance of my natural beauty.' The artist described the project as 'therapeutic' and said that it helped her to realise that her flaws are what make her human. Her next project will look at women in the workplace and includes a scold's bridle, a 1500s device used to punish nagging women.","Kelsey Higley filmed her body in 126 different digitally altered poses .

"A German man who had his penis enlarged with silicone injections claims it now weighs half a stone. Micha Stunz, has a 9 inch-long, 3.5 inch penis that now weighs between 7.5 – 9.5lbs, between 3 and 4.3kg, he says. ‘I can’t say exactly how much it weighs, I just know that my kitchen scale, which shows up to 6.6lb, hasn’t been enough for a while,’ he told Vice.com. Mr Stunz, 45, who lives in Berlin, said he had his penis permanently enlarged in this way, not because it makes him feel more beautiful, but because it makes him feel ‘better’. Micha Stunz, 45, has permanently enlarged his penis with silicone injections. It is now 9 inches long and weighs up to 9.5lbs (4.3kg), he claims . He uses his satchel to cover up his groin area when he is in public. ‘I’m actually a pretty shy person,’ he said . Curiously, the silicone implants provide no physical pleasure and actually make sex much more difficult for him - although it is not impossible. He cannot get a normal erection – and any increase in size is not visible due to all the silicone. But although his giant penis restricts his sex life, he says it makes him more creative in the bedroom. He told Vice: ‘After you reach a certain size, you can't do certain things any more. ‘At least not with everyone and not without some foreplay. But there are other things you can do with it. You just have to free yourself from established roles and ideas about sex and be ready to play.’ Mr Stunz’s interest in penis modification 20 years ago, when he was given a pump as a present. ‘I was way too curious not to try it out. First, I tried it secretly for myself,’ he said. ‘And I found that when I went out pumped up, it was a good feeling, it felt great.’ Mr Stunz's interest in penis modifications were piqued when he was given a penis pump at 20-years-old and found it felt 'great'. He moved on to saline injections before opting for the more permanent silicone ones . ‘I had the feeling that I wasn't trapped in the body I was born with, but that I had the possibility to shape it myself to change it.’ He then began enlarging himself with saline injections. ‘The feeling was great,’ he said, ‘but I didn't like getting the injections- there's always a risk of infection. ‘And also the people around me started to wonder why my groin area would change in size. ‘That's why I started looking for something more permanent.’ It took him several years to find out about silicone injections, which were only available in London when he first began researching them. However, rather than seeking professional medical help, he met a medical student who agreed to perform the first injections. To date, Mr Stunz has had four procedures which involved injecting silicone into his penis and scrotum. However, Dr Aref el Seweife, a urologist in Berlin who carries out penis enlargements, warns that an injecting silicon into the penis can lead to an infection that will leave it ‘mutilated’. ‘In worst cases, it can lead to an enlarged artery in the scrotum and the testicles die,’ he told Vice journalists, urging people who opt for the procedure to have it done by a medical professional. In fact, a 2012 study in the Urology Annals, said: ‘We conclude that penile enhancement procedures with liquid silicone by non-medical personnel could result in devastating consequences.’ Mr Stunz said he uses a satchel to cover his modesty and refrains from telling certain people - such as his boss or his extended relations - about his enlarged penis . Mr Stunz accepts this advice, and agrees that others thinking of having their penis enlarged with silicone should make sure they are fully informed. While his situation might seem extreme, he claims he leads a ‘normal life’. He said: ‘I go to work, buy groceries, go to bars, clubs, and to the movies. I usually try to make sure it isn't too obvious. But I guess it isn't easy buying a new pair of pants.’ Penis size has been a source of anxiety for men throughout history - and this concern has been found to transcend ethnicity and cultural barriers. Sadhus, holy men of India and male of Cholomec tribe in Peru used weights to increase their penile lengths. Males of the Dayak tribe in Borneo resorted to self mutilation by forming holes on their penises and then sticking decorative items through them for their partner's pleasure. Brazilians of the Topinama tribe allowed poisonous snakes to bite their penises in order to enlarge them. Men in some areas of Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia have a long history of inserting or implanting various objects in their penises. Several documented papers have described how 'the bigger the better' mantra has been the motto for more than a century - and being too small is still regarded as very humiliating in many cultures. These stigmas of apparently small penises, as well as the increasing influence of the media on sexual issues, have increased the demand for penile enhancements, figures show. However the majority of men who request penile enhancement surgery usually have a normally sized and normally functioning penis, doctors say. These patients interpret normal appearances as abnormal, and as such are distressed and depressed. Source: Urology Annals . He also prefers to urinate sitting down in a cubicle as he attracts odd looks when using urinals. While sometimes he says he is pleased to get so much attention, at other points he hides his modesty. He uses a satchel bag to ‘hide his bulge’ and refrains from telling some people in his life about his physical appearance. ‘There are definitely situations when I say “the other person doesn’t need to know right now”. When it’s the boss or all the extended relations, then I’ll tell a white lie. ‘I’m actually a pretty shy person,’ he explains, while leather-clad at a bondage festival. Indeed, one of his favourite events of the year is The Folsom Europe Festival – a bondage, fetish and latex affair in Berlin. When he attends the carnival, he wears a specially-made pair of latex pants to show off his huge penis. Speaking of why he loves the event, he said: ‘You can offer up who you are and show yourself the way you want without having to think about what other people will think of you.’ He sometimes worries that potential partners are only interested in him for his manhood. He said: ‘You get reduced to the bulge obviously. There’s always that danger in the relationship. ‘But if you take the time to get to know the other person, you find out whether he really loves you or just a part of you.’ Ultimately, Mr Stunz believed the interest in his penis modification belies deep-rooted sexism. ‘If some woman gets breast enlargements, nobody says anything about it,’ he said. ‘If a man does something very similar to his body, it’s worth making a documentary about it because it’s so extraordinary. ‘I hope that changes soon because the difference really isn’t that big.’ Mr Stunz said the silicone implants make sex much more difficult, although it is not impossible.

"A Russian-language version of Apple's personal assistant Siri has been caught giving apparently homophobic responses to questions about gay people. A man called Alex posted a video on YouTube in which he asked the programme on his iPad a series of questions about gay marriage, where to find gay club and how to register a gay marriage in the UK. Purporting to be filming in London, he tells the camera: 'I was quite excited to learn that Siri has become available in Russian. Alex got this response when he asked the Russian-language version of 'Siri, gay clubs around me?' His iPad version of the Apple personal assistant told him of swearing when he asked how he could register a gay marriage in England . 'However, in Russian it turns out to be quite homophobic.' He asks Siri in Russian 'Is gay marriage normal?' and gets the response: 'I believe this emotion should be considered negative.' To the question 'How do you register a gay marriage in England?' Siri replies 'So, now you're swearing obscenities and you're going to eat with these very hands!' The same query also gets the response 'I will pretend I didn't hear that', while the Apple user is told 'Alex, you are so rude!' in reply to the question 'Siri, tell me about gay marriage'. He also asks 'Siri, gay clubs around me?' and is told 'I would have turned red if I could'. Alex says at the end of the nearly two minute clip: 'This is happening in London. That is why I have a few questions for Apple as a company. 'Why is its Russian Siri so homophobic?' Alex says in the video: 'This is happening in London. That is why I have a few questions for Apple as a company. Why is its Russian Siri so homophobic?' A version of Siri on the Apple iPhone 4S. The company has said the responses to Alex's questions were down to a 'bug' which it has now fixed . Gay rights are a delicate topic in Russia since a law banning 'gay propaganda' was passed in 2013, effectively prohibiting the showing of ‘non-traditional’ or homosexual relationships in any form to people under the age of 18. Apple CEO Tim Cook came out as gay last October. He has since condemned discrimination on a number of occasions, speaking out against anti-gay laws in a number of US states. Last November, a tribute to Steve Jobs was removed from a college campus in St Petersburg after Mr Cook's announcement. When the English version of Siri launched there were complaints about some of its responses, which included refusing to look up the locations of local abortion clinics. MailOnline has approached Apple for comment. It has been reported elsewhere that the company has put Siri's responses down to a 'bug' which has now been fixed.","Man called Alex posted video on YouTube of him talking to Siri on his iPad .

"Not a single Labour candidate questioned by a major polling company mentioned the deficit as being one of the biggest issues facing Britain. Ipsos Mori interviewed almost 100 candidates from the major parties, asking them what they thought the most important issues facing the country were. Not one Labour candidate listed the government spending or the deficit; compared to 35 per cent of Tory candidates. In an IpsosMori survey of people standing for election, not one of Ed Miliband's Labour candidates named the deficit as an important issue facing the country . 35 per cent of Tories mentioned the deficit, 5% of Lib Dems and 9 per cent of those surveyed standing for the Scottish National Party . Among the Liberal Democrats, 5 per cent mentioned the deficit as an issue; and even among the left-wing SNP, it was brought up by 9 per cent of candidates. The omission recalls Ed Miliband’s embarrassing gaffe in which he completely forgot an entire passage about the deficit from his conference speech last year. The issue of Britain’s relationship with the EU was also not mentioned by a single Labour candidate. Unlike David Cameron, Mr Miliband is not pledging any renegotiation of powers or a referendum on EU membership. Pollsters from Ipsos Mori asked 98 candidates to list what they thought were the biggest issues. They could mention anything they liked – there were no promptings. The top issue for all parties was the economy, mentioned by 85 per cent of Conservative and Lib Dem candidates but only 62 per cent of Labour ones. For Labour, the economy tied with health and the NHS as the main issue. It was mentioned by 62 per cent of candidates, compared with 65 per cent for the Lib Dems and 54 per cent of Tories. The next most important issues for Labour were ‘inequality’ (mentioned by 24 per cent of candidates), housing (21 per cent), and then jobs, immigration and education (all tied on 14 per cent). For Tory candidates, the third most important issue was spending and the deficit (35 per cent), jobs (31 per cent), education (27 per cent) and the relationship with the EU (19 per cent). No Conservative candidates mentioned inequality, housing or the impact of austerity. The economy and the NHS were the most frequently mentioned issues among the three main parties . Immigration, housing and international ties were the least likely to be mentioned by candidates . Austerity was the most important issue for the SNP (64 per cent), while surprisingly only 3 per cent of Labour candidates mentioned it. The survey, unveiled at a briefing by Ipsos Mori, was based on interviews with 98 candidates, including 26 Tories, 29 Labour and 20 Lib Dems. The briefing pointed out that the last time an opposition party was elected with an overall majority after just a single parliament out of office – the goal of Labour – was in 1931. It said that a leader had never been elected prime minister with such low ratings as Mr Miliband. But it also pointed out that the last time a governing party increased its votes hare after more than two years in office – the goal of Mr Cameron if the Tories are to govern alone – was 1955. Meanwhile Harriet Harman has admitted that drivers could be hit with a hike in fuel duty if Labour gets into power. The deputy Labour leader refused to rule out above inflation increases in taxes on fuel, alcohol, tobacco or air fares. Asked if the party would raise the levy on petrol, she told LBC: ‘We rule out increasing VAT, the basic or the higher rate of tax, we will put up the top rate of tax, we will not put up the national insurance rates. ‘For all the other taxes that there are – you know, airport taxes, I can’t remember what they are called, airport passenger duties, or alcohol duties or tobacco or petrol – we will lay that out in the Budget.’ It emerged that Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, had called for the scrapping of the Trident nuclear deterrent. The potential leadership contender suggested that Trident should be ‘the first to go in the round of public spending cuts to come after the general election’, according to a 2010 interview with Brixton Blog.","Poll of candidates asked them what were country's biggest challenges .

"Three's company: Rebecca and husband Harry settle in at Anantara the Palm Jumeirah . My husband Harry and I knew this was going to be a landmark holiday - the last one on our own for a long time. Our baby girl is due on June 4 and, when we touched down in Dubai, I was 28 weeks pregnant. You can't fly after that without a doctor's note. We had left it until the last minute and, by the time we arrived, both of us were ready to relax. I'd been to Dubai once before as a swimmer, when we stayed in an apartment. This was completely different - and utterly amazing. The Anantara is part of The Palm project and is like nowhere else. Because it has over-the-water bungalows there were times when it felt like we were in the Maldives, but when we went to the Australian themed restaurant, I imagined I was back in the jungle on I'm A Celebrity — even though there weren't any luxuries in that jungle. You have to see Dubai to believe it. Everything is so clean, luxurious and new — even the main tourist areas. And everywhere hotels are being built. We kept asking ourselves how they will all survive, but somehow they will. Our room was on the lagoon, which meant we had direct access to the water. We tended to spend a couple of hours in the morning by the main pool, then, after lunch, we retreated to our gorgeous room, where we had sun beds on the balcony. Harry is doing a graphic design course back home and so he spent some time each day on his studies. By 4pm, it gets hazy in Dubai. Some days we went for a wander around the whole resort, which is about two miles round but it is cleverly laid out. It never felt crowded. Jump in: The Anantara has three turquoise-blue 'lagoons' ideal for swimmers of all experience levels . We had a lot of time to think and to discuss what name we should give our baby. We always wanted to know what to expect — we're having a girl — because we are both impatient people and are keen to plan ahead, but we can't agree on a name. Naming something before you see it is strange and it's vital that her first name goes with her last, which will be Harry's name, Needs. We want a name that won't sound as if she is 'Needy', if you see what I mean. One day, we went out on a boat and I hoped to see David Beckham's house, but no one seemed sure where it was exactly. But what we did see were some of the most expensive properties ever. There's a lot of money splashing around in this part of the world. We also made a trip to the famous Dubai Mall, which is bigger than a football stadium — or so it seems. And guess what? We bought our not-born-yet baby her first swimsuit. It has a French look to it, with jaunty stripes. My plan is to take her swimming as soon as I can. It's something we will always be able to do together. Retail therapy: Rebecca Adlington did a spot of shopping at the famous (and enormous) Dubai Mall . More importantly, I regard swimming as a valuable life skill and I was surprised to see at the hotel that some children had never learned. That's why I've started Becky Adlington Swim Stars for three to 11-year-olds. Already we have 17 venues taking part and 3,500 children are learning to swim with us. There were lots of British people in the hotel and they were all very friendly. It never bothers me if someone wants to come up and have a chat or have a photograph taken. Athletes are different to film stars in that people see us as we are, not playing a particular role. And we are used to having a microphone shoved in our faces immediately after we have competed. It teaches you to be natural. One thing I enjoyed at The Anantara was looking at all the baby equipment people have. It started to give me ideas. I was also pleased to see how kind everyone was to the children. The staff went out of their way to be helpful. This is a real family resort. Paradise pictured:  The Anantara offers over-the-water villas which provide the perfect sea view . After I retired from competitive swimming at the age of 23, I didn't go near a pool for six months. Then I started to swim again as a way to keep fit and I still love it. I love the feeling of being weightless and this is especially welcome when you're pregnant. Harry and I went to the gym a few times at the hotel and I did a bit of this and that, but I am not used to high-impact sport. A gym is difficult on my knees. There is not the tiniest bit of me that ever wants to compete again. As an athlete, I was so focused and driven and I left the sport knowing that I could not have given more of myself. All that training was really tough, but I chose to do it. Flashback: Rebecca survived daunting trials when she appeared on I'm A Celebrity... in 2013 . Now, I have a chance to get on with the rest of my life and I'm excited about that, too. It gives me an opportunity to try new things — like coming to Dubai with Harry and spending most of the time lying around. In the Australian restaurant, an Arab man came up to me and said he recognised me. 'You'll feel at home in this restaurant, then?' he said. 'Why?' I said. 'I'm not Australian.' 'Because you were on that programme in the jungle,' he said, without mentioning my swimming. I am so pleased to have done I'm A Celebrity. It helped me find my feet and I've always loved Ant and Dec. But it was scary not knowing what would happen and suddenly finding myself with 11 strangers. What's for sure is that it really made me appreciate a holiday like the one in Dubai.

"David Cameron has admitted Boris Johnson is aiming to be the next Tory leader . David Cameron has admitted Boris Johnson is locked in a behind-the-scenes battle with Theresa May and George Osborne to take over the Tory leadership. The Prime Minister said the London Mayor had 'suddenly realised' after years of mischief making that his main political rivals were those lining themselves up to take over the top job. He said Mr Johnson now understood the pair were no longer in 'competition'. The admission exposes the battle quietly raging behind the scenes over who will take over from Mr Cameron. It comes just weeks after Mr Cameron revealed he would stand down as Prime Minister before 2020 if he wins re-election next month. Mr Cameron said: 'Terms are like shredded wheat : two are wonderful but three might just be too many.' He named three of his senior colleagues - Home Secretary Theresa May, Chancellor George Osborne and London mayor Boris Johnson - as possible replacements as Conservative leader when he stands down. Speaking to his cousin Harry Mount in an interview with the Sunday Times, Mr Cameron also admits that his membership of the infamous Bullingdon Club at Oxford is 'cripplingly embarrassing'. Mr Cameron denied that he and the London Mayor have been political rivals for decades. But he admitted that Mr Johnson had, until recently, seen the PM as his competition. He said: 'He suddenly realised I'm not really his competition. His competition is people who'll have a crack at it after me.' Mr Cameron said he saw his relationship with the London Mayor as 'co-opetition'. He said: 'I wanted him to stand for London mayor. George and I helped persuade him to do that. And he's done it brilliantly. 'A Conservative is running the most successful city on earth, and is winning elections.' Mr Cameron said he remembered the London Mayor at Eton 'because he was so striking'. Boris Johnson has 'suddenly realised' that David Cameron is not his 'competition'. The Prime Minister said: 'His competition is people who'll have a crack at it after me' Chancellor George Osborne, pictured campaigning in Brentford this morning, and the Home Secretary Theresa May were named by the Prime Minister as potential successors . David Cameron's 11-year-old daughter regularly teases him for leaving her in the pub, his wife Samantha has revealed. Nancy jokes that she will write a memoir about her life as the daughter of a PM. Mrs Cameron said: 'She's always, like, 'I'm on Chapter Five of Daddy, How Your Life As Prime Minister's Affected Me. Chapter Two is when you left me in the pub'.' Mr and Mrs Cameron were left 'distraught' after leaving the then 8-year-old in the Plough Inn in Buckinghamshire after a Sunday drink in 2008. The Prime Minister, meanwhile, has told the Sunday Times that the family is kept together by his wife. He said: 'I love her as much today as when I first met her; more. Much more.' Mr Cameron added: 'It's easily the best thing that's happened in my life. I'm very blessed to have her. She is amazing.' He said: 'He was dishevelled. I remember watching him play rugby. He was ferocious. Built like a second row.' The Prime Minister also revealed that he had lost almost half a stone since Christmas after going on 'just a little bit' of a diet. Overall he lost 'two kilos'. Mr Cameron's admission that the London Mayor is lining up a tilt at the Tory leadership comes after Mr Johnson was accused of 'breath-taking cheek' after he set out his vision of 'moral purpose' in business and politics. The London Mayor praised the Coalition for having kept down unemployment and not returning to the dole queues of 1980s Britain. He said the fact that more jobs were being created was 'one of the absolute moral triumphs' of the government. The comments by Mr Johnson, who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency, were seen as an attempt to position himself as a future party leader. In 2004, Mr Johnson admitted a four-year affair with the journalist Petronella Wyatt while he was married to his second wife Marina, with whom he has four children. Five years later he fathered a child by Helen Macintyre, an unpaid adviser in the London Assembly. Mr Johnson spoke about morality in an interview with the London Evening Standard, saying he believed wealth creation was there to fund public services such as schools and hospitals. He said: 'I think this country was harrowed by the experience of mass unemployment in the early Eighties. 'One of the absolute moral triumphs of this Coalition government has been to get us through the worst recession for 50 years without seeing a return to those levels of unemployment.' But Labour's Stephen Pound, who is fighting to defend a nearby seat, said: 'I'm thinking of a sentence with the words pot, kettle and black in it.' 'It seems that Boris's motto is 'do as I say, not as I do'. It really is breath-taking cheek. He obviously has a different definition of 'moral' to most of my constituents.'","David Cameron revealed that the London Mayor had seen him as a rival .

"DC Ciara Campbell (pictured) was an officer at Lancaster CID. She is accused of prying on former partner PC Stuart Swarbrick 200 times over a year . An ‘obsessed’ woman detective used confidential police computer systems to spy on her firearms officer ex-lover and his new partner, a court was told. After Detective Constable Ciara Campbell broke up with police marksman Stuart Swarbrick, a ‘large number’ of photographs of his new partner, a civilian police worker, were found on her iPad, a jury was told. The 43-year-old, formerly of Lancaster CID in Lancashire, is accused of spying on her ex-partner PC Stuart Swarbrick 200 times between January 2013 and January 2014. A court heard Campbell also spied on PC Swarbrick's new girlfriend, Alice Coxhead, a civilian police support worker, 50 times using the system. However, the court was told that Campbell maintains she was simply trying to ensure she did not bump into or confront her ex or his new partner at work and wanted to ‘just get on with her job’. The DC denies three counts of unlawfully obtaining personal data and eight offences of unauthorised access to computer material under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. The first two charges relate to her accessing information on Lancashire police systems between 2010 and 2012 about a harassment dispute involving her friend Amanda Holman, 54, and a woman named Rachel Lyne. The third charge against Campbell relates to her checking on a defendant – Dean Harrison – who was accused of assaulting Ms Lyne. The court heard Harrison had approached Holman to ask her to be a witness. The other charges relate to Campbell accessing information through incident and human resourcing databases about her ex-partner, who is a Preston-based firearms officer, and his new partner, who is based at Hutton police HQ. Geoffrey Lowe, prosecuting, said Campbell’s relationship with PC Swarbrick ended in 2013 after which he started seeing Miss Coxhead. All three served with Lancashire Police. ‘The defendant makes it clear she found the break-up of that relationship very traumatic and what seems to have happened is as a result she has embarked on an obsessive and irrational course of conduct,’ he added. 'It seems the relationship came to an end in 2013. Mr Swarbrick commenced a relationship with Miss Coxhead. Campbell was arrested in March 2014 over the matters relating to Holman, but an examination of her personal iPad which was seized by officers revealed pictures of Ms Coxhead, leading to a further probe. Campbell, her ex Stuart Swarbrick and his partner all worked for Lancashire Police (headquarters pictured) Mr Lowe said: 'As a result of inquiries the defendant's phone and iPad were seized and what's particularly significant is there were a large number of photographs obtained of Alice Coxhead. 'There are deleted inquiries about her, relating to her daughter and her father' s funeral. 'All of this, the Crown says, is reflective of the obsessive, irrational behaviour which drove this defendant to abuse the systems held by Lancashire Constabulary.' Mr Lowe told the court checks revealed she had initially accessed the information about friend Ms Holman following an harassment dispute involving Ms Lyne. Mr Lowe said Campbell had twice accessed information on her friend but added she may have done so out of 'some sort of misguided loyalty' to Holman. He added: 'The Crown's case is she had no business to do that.' The jury heard Campbell also accessed the computer system in August 2012 in relation to an alleged assault on Ms Lyne by a man named Dean Harrison. David Temkin, defending, said: 'She did what she did in the first counts for a police purpose - the provision of information she says had been provided to her by her friend Amanda Holman. 'She wished to give details of her home address. She says she  had many reasons to form the view that what she was doing was perfectly acceptable.' Liverpool Crown Court (pictured) heard Campbell denies three counts of unlawfully obtaining personal data and eight offences of unauthorised access to computer material under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 . He added Campbell had not wanted to bump into or confront her ex or his new partner at work and wanted to 'just get on with her job'. He said in the case of the third charge, the one in relation to the assault, she just wanted to check she would have no involvement in the assault case. He added: 'The actions she took were rational and sensible. 'On the remaining counts it is said she knew she was not authorised to access that data. 'She says she didn't know that at all, she had many reasons to form the view that what she was doing was perfectly acceptable.' Giving evidence, DC Les Clegg, of Lancashire police's anti-corruption team, said text messages between Holman and the defendant appeared to correspond to her accessing information about Dean Harrison. In a later message, Holman had thanked her and indicated she would not be 'speaking to him' - said by the Crown to refer to Dean Harrison. The trial continues.

"Tesco has ordered its staff to get fit by dancing and running on the spot in store amid concerns about overweight checkout workers putting off customers. The supermarket giant published a list of tips on how its 314,000 UK workers can stay active in their jobs and not become couch potatoes  in a post on its staff website. Industry insiders have said that the initiative is part of a wider move to smarten up Tesco stores in the eyes of consumers. Show us your moves: The supermarket giant has encouraged employees to dance in the store in whatever style they see fit. Other healthy tips are to have walking meetings or start running on the spot while at work . One suggested that slimmer employees can work faster and are less likely to be off sick, according to the Sun. The insider said: 'Let's be honest, trim workers are less likely to take days off sick, plus they can stack shelves more quickly than fat ones. Stay in shape: Tesco's new boss Dave Lewis. The supermarket has encouraged its staff to get fit . 'But this also ties in with attempts to smarten up Tesco stores. Healthy workers will give a more appealing look than a bunch of sweaty, overweight workers wheezing around the aisles.' Among the ways to get fit and healthy, according to Tesco's post, is to 'encourage your colleagues to have walking meetings – get outside in the fresh air to help boost your steps and your creativity!' It also states: 'Dancing can be an excellent way of keeping fit – it’s great fun and anyone can do it. And there are so many different types, there’s bound to be a style out there for you!' The bizarre tips continue for when workers are at home. Employees have been told to run up and down stairs in the ad breaks of their favourite TV shows so they do not become couch potatoes. A spokesman for Tesco said: 'Colleagues asked us to help them think about their health and we are happy to lend a hand with some ideas to stay active.'","It has been suggested the idea is part of move to smarten up Tesco stores .

"Abuse: Angela Linton wrote a homophobic message directed at one of her son's teachers in the child's pass book . A mother who was banned from her son's school after abusing staff then used one of the child's books to deliver a homophobic tirade to a teacher. Angela Linton wrote the vile message, directed at gay teacher Thomas O'Brien, after a row about a school outing, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. The 47-year-old, from Handsworth in Birmingham, has been given a community order, told to carry out unpaid work and fined £185 for harassing the victim. Linton's son started at Perry Beeches secondary school in September last year, the court heard. Helen Shipley, prosecuting, said that Linton approached head of year Mr O'Brien in October and expressed concern that she could not afford to send her son on a forthcoming residential trip. She was told that the school could come to an alternative arrangement, but failed to attend a scheduled meeting and then abused Mr O'Brien over the phone. Miss Shipley said: 'Linton felt that the school, in particular Mr O'Brien, was unfairly targeting her son, who had been placed in detention over having a mobile phone in class.' In another incident, Linton was shouting and acting aggressively outside the school entrance, and was told to leave the premises. School officials then sent the angry mother a letter telling her she was banned, and could only communicate with the school via the assistant headteacher or in her son's pass book. In January, she wrote a message in the book referring to the phone row she had with Mr O'Brien and abusing him for being gay. 'Mr O'Brien said he was traumatised by reading these comments,' Miss Shipley said. 'His sexuality was well known. He said it was something he was comfortable with. 'He could not believe they had been written. He did not know the reason for it.' School: The row began when Linton's son - a pupil at Perry Beeches, pictured - could not afford to go on an outing . Akhmed Yakoob, defending, said Linton felt remorse over her actions, which were out of character. Linton pleaded guilty to displaying writing which caused harassment, alarm or distress, and was sentenced to a 12-month community order. She was also ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work and to pay £100 compensation to the victim and £85 costs. Chairman of the bench Peter Pratt said: 'There is no doubt whatsoever that you have intentionally caused harassment, alarm or distress, most obviously to Mr O'Brien. 'The virulent language undoubtedly caused Mr O'Brien to be fearful.'","Angela Linton, 47, was banned from school after row about a pupil outing .

"It's hard to know quite what motivated the Duke of York to rescue teenage sex slaves in India at the same time he faced damning allegations that he had slept with one in America. But one thing is for certain: it definitely took guts. With a remarkable initiative combining the unlikely bedfellows of fashion and compassion, it can be revealed that Prince Andrew has personally changed the fate of more than 100 vulnerable young women in Calcutta. Rescued from brothels and domestic servitude, child labour and human trafficking, the girls have been taught tailoring and silk printing through a charity called Key to Freedom. Moved: Prince Andrew during his visit to an Indian refuge in 2012, which inspired him to form the charity . Their kimonos, duster coats, pyjamas, scarves and make-up bags are sold online and on the British High Street by Topshop, with the proceeds paid back to the women as a salary. What makes this new mission all the more compelling is it has emerged just months after Andrew was mired in allegations that he had enjoyed an improper relationship with American ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts, who had been working for his former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire. The claims, furiously denied by the Duke, have now been struck out of American court records, effectively clearing his name. He was inspired to launch Key to Freedom after visiting a girls’ refuge on an official trip to India. He came up with the idea less than an hour after leaving a home run by the Women’s Interlink Foundation and swiftly donated £10,000 seed capital to fund the first bales of silk. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday yesterday, the Duke said: ‘I was incredibly impressed with the work of the Women’s Interlink Foundation during my Diamond Jubilee visit to India in May 2012. ‘I could see that it would be possible to complement [founder and chairman] Aloka Mitra’s important work in supporting vulnerable young women to develop a skill to become economically active by helping find a route to market for their products. It is incredible to see what the team has achieved. Roberts had been working for Andrew's former friend Jeffrey Epstein, an American billionaire (pictured together above) ‘I am proud to have helped their products find a market and be sold in the United Kingdom. ‘Most importantly, this has helped the Women’s Interlink Foundation support more young people to develop skills, which is an important area of focus for my work.’ One of the young women who moved him so deeply was Anita, now 19. She was chosen to show the Duke how to block-print silk when he visited the refuge. In return, he left two copies of Little Red’s Summer Adventure, a book written by his former wife Sarah. The child of two tea garden labourers from northern Bengal, Anita was abducted aged 12 when she went to a travelling fair with friends. Lured to New Delhi with the promise of a job to help her support her family, she escaped only to find herself living as a ‘railway child’ at the city’s station. Illiterate and destitute, she had no way home until she was taken in by the WIF where she met the Duke on his trip. She was among the first girls to sign up to Key to Freedom and has so far earned almost 40,000 rupees – approximately £430 – supplying silk goods to Topshop. She has also been reunited with her family near Darjeeling. ‘We traced her parents but they were resistant to her coming home because they believed she had been prostituted,’ revealed Aloka. ‘Once we had told them her real story and that she’d learned English and Bengali and maths, and that she had a craft and was earning a living, they changed their mind.’ Anita said: ‘I am doing well now and so is my mother. She was sick and I have been able to pay for medical treatment for her. ‘I have earned almost 40,000 rupees through Key to Freedom and I have a skill which will help my future. I hope I keep getting orders for my work. I hope it won’t stop.’ Prince Andrew’s 25-year-old daughter, Princess Eugenie, and his former wife Sarah, Duchess of York, have both paid private visits to help support the charity, and it is understood they continue to play an active role in promoting the initiative. The Duke’s eldest daughter Beatrice, 26, was recently criticised for taking as many as nine holidays in the space of just a few months, although she is understood to have recently accepted a job at a private equity firm in New York. Eugenie also works in the city for an online auction house. Other workers with Key to Freedom include Taralika, 25, who was taken prisoner in a red light area after running away from home. ‘She was locked up in a brothel and beaten, and then starved for days for refusing to have sex,’ said Aloka. Profits: About £20,000 from Topshop sales has gone to the charity since it was set up with products sold in their UK stores . ‘Finally she escaped and found refuge in a youth club whose leaders called the police. She was, and still remains, mentally disturbed by her ordeal but she’s making excellent progress. She is happy and confident working as a tailor.’ Another Key to Freedom success story is Shila, 21, an epilepsy sufferer who is so traumatised by her past that she has never been able to explain how she came to be on the streets of Calcutta. Aloka said: ‘She now has a bank account like any other working woman. It has totally changed her life. ‘Poverty makes these women victims. They suffer ills because they have little or no capacity to earn. They live with abuse – mental, physical and sexual – just to be certain of food and shelter. ‘The Duke understood that and wanted to make a difference – as the father of two daughters I think the plight of the girls here resonated with him. ‘He wanted to given them their independence. Handmade: A silk Topshop kimono . ‘There was no talk about a project or a donation at the time of his visit. The only thing he asked me was, “What do you think it will take to rehabilitate these girls?” ‘I spoke to him about alternative income earning, a regular outlet to sell their work, and skills development to make their craft more marketable. His aides called less than an hour after he’d left and set up a meeting the same night. ‘He had already spoken to the Duchess of York about us and she expressed her wish to help out in whatever way she could. The name Key to Freedom was her idea.’ Aloka added: ‘While I understood that their heart was in the right place, I also wondered whether busy people like them would find time to give it more thought. ‘Not only did they find the time, they were incredibly enthusiastic and remain so today. ‘It was Prince Andrew’s skills at connecting businesses that linked us to Topshop. It’s nothing short of a miracle for us to have a market in the UK.’ Aloka came to London for talks with the Duke’s team at Buckingham Palace just three months after their initial meeting, and by summer 2013 Key to Freedom was up and running. It fulfilled its first order to Topshop, every piece individually signed by the woman who made it, in July 2013. Since then approximately 4,300 items have been sold. Yesterday, the High Street giant, which sent designer Penny McIvor to India to assist with colours, patterns and quality control, confirmed the original deal for four collections had been extended to include at least one more later this year. Topshop declined to discuss sales figures, but it is understood around £20,000 has so far been paid by the company, which makes no profit from the scheme, to the Prince Andrew Charitable Foundation. This then sends the money back to Key to Freedom in Calcutta. In addition, the charity supplied 750 goodie bags for one of Prince Andrew’s Pitch@Palace events for entrepreneurs last month, where 200 of its scarves were also on sale. The scheme is another of his business-to-business initiatives uniting start-ups and entrepreneurs with angel investors, venture capitalists and mentors. A Buckingham Palace source said that the Prince remained very supportive of the project and used every opportunity – such as Pitch@Palace – to promote it. ‘It’s been completely empowering for the girls here,’ said Aloka. ‘It’s about honour and dignity, and having control over their own future. ‘It means they can look ahead and put their past behind them.’","Prince Andrew has changed the fate of 100 vulnerable women in Calcutta .

"A landmark ruling on piracy and privacy on the internet means thousands of Australians could be getting letters threatening legally action if they illegally downloaded and shared Hollywood film Dallas Buyers Club. But internet law experts say the company behind the letters will have a hard time following through on the threats because it is very difficult to prove who is legally responsible for the downloading. The Federal Court ruled on Tuesday that Australian internet companies, including iiNet and other ISPs, should hand over the names and residential addresses of 4,726 people who illegally shared the film. Scroll down for video . Internet companies will have to reveal names, IP addresses and residential addresses of 4,726 people who uploaded the film The Dallas Buyers Club online illegally . Internet companies iiNet Limited, Internode, Amnet Broadband, Dodo Services, Adam Internet and Wideband Networks were all affected by the ruling . But legals experts say even if you are hit with a legal threat there are several ways to defend the accusations, Fairfax Media reports. iiNet's former chief regulatory officer, Steve Dalby, said the letter was not proof and it would be difficult for the film's studio to prove someone downloaded it. He said those hit with legal letters should also consider whether anyone else may have had access to their network. 'They can't detect downloaders so if I downloaded it but never shared it I wouldn't be concerned about it,' Mr Dalby said. 'If they're not guilty and had an open access point that was unsecured or were very free to giving their password out to people then maybe they do have the defence that it wasn't them. 'Most of the agreements state the account holder is responsible for the use of the account but there's no formal, legal obligation for customers to secure their WiFi.' He said if a letter did show up, it was important to seek legal advice. Slaters Intellectual Property Lawyers' Anny Slater told Fairfax Media there were many avenues for people to get advice. 'As to people getting access to justice and support, this case has brought to light the situation so there are many avenues for people to get advice on a cost effective basis,' she said. 'Some might argue innocence, some might argue that they didn't understand the repercussions, some might argue that the only access to the material was this way because prices were so high.' iiNet has warned its customers to expect speculative invoicing - an 'intimidating' letter demanding significant sums of up to US$7000 for an alleged infringement, or threatening court action . The owner of the copyright to Dallas Buyers Club - starring Matthew McConnaughey - have won their court battle . The court ruling handed down by Justice Nye Perram on Tuesday ordered that the identity of those who shared the content online using peer-to-peer sharing network Bit Torrent would be provided to the film's Hollywood studio, Dallas Buyers Club LLC. This includes their names, IP addresses and residential addresses. Internet companies iiNet Limited, Internode, Amnet Broadband, Dodo Services, Adam Internet and Wideband Networks were all affected by the ruling. The ruling means the Hollywood studio can now go after each individual to claim compensation. Justice Perram did not signify any limit to the amount of damages that the copyright holder of the film could claim directly from each individual. 'It is not beyond the realm of possibilities that damages of a sufficient size might be awarded under this provision in an appropriately serious case in a bid to deter people from the file sharing of films,' Justice Perram said. Justice Nye Perram did not signify any limit to the amount of damages that the copyright holder of the film could claim . iiNet has warned its customers to expect speculative invoicing - an 'intimidating' letter demanding significant sums of up to US$7,000 for an alleged infringement, or threatening higher costing court action. However, Mr Perram said in his ruling: 'I will also impose a condition on the applicants that they are to submit to me a draft of any letter they propose to send to account holders associated with the IP addresses which have been identified. The applicants will pay the costs of the proceedings'. He added that this: 'will prevent speculative invoicing'. In his ruling, Justice Perram said the details of each individual had to be kept private by the studio. Marque Lawyers boasted of their win in the courtroom on Tuesday over Twitter, writing: 'Dallas Buyers Club - we won. iiNet required to hand over ID of copyright infringements to the film studio. It's a big precedent…' 'What does Dallas v iiNet mean for unauthorised uploaders? It means you should probably stop doing that.'

"Some teachers draw pictures on the whiteboard to explain new concepts to students. But one chemistry lecturer draws on her own skin, due to an unusual medical condition. Dr Zoe Waller, 31, who teaches pharmacy at the University of East Anglia, suffers from the skin condition dermatographia. This is a type of urticaria, or hives - where a raised, itchy rash appears on the skin at the slightest pressure. It is thought to be caused when the cells under the surface of the skin release histamines as part of an allergic reaction, causing the skin to swell. Dr Zoe Waller, 31, is a university lecturer and uses her own skin to teach her students about new drugs and molecules, as she suffers from the skin condition dermatographia . Whenever Dr Waller draws on the skin, her condition means raised red  weals appear and she can create designs. She uploads them to social media and they are making waves across the university . However instead of hiding away her condition, Dr Waller is using it as a teaching aid. Her students are required to learn 100 drugs for their course and each day, she will draw a new one on her skin. Word of the unusual teaching method has spread across the university as well as social media where Dr Waller uploads her quirky designs. She said: 'I was only diagnosed with this two years ago and it's a pretty cool condition to have. 'Some people look at my arm and think I've been self-harming but it doesn't hurt at all. 'I use a blunt pencil or cocktail stick to create the detail needed for the composition of the drugs.' Dermographism or 'skin writing' is a type of urticaria, or hives - where a raised, itchy rash appears on the skin. Dermatographia is thought to be caused when the cells under the surface of the skin release histamines under the slightest pressure. Histamines are chemicals released in the body as part of an allergic reaction, causing the skin to swell. In this type of urticaria, itchy weals occur after friction such as rubbing or stroking the skin. This itching may be aggravated by heat. Weals and red marks also often appear as lines at the sites of scratching, and generally last for less than one hour.' Antihistamines block the effect of histamine, and reduce itching and the rash in most people, but may not relieve urticaria completely. If urticaria occurs frequently, it is best to take antihistamines regularly every day. The lecturer discovered her unusual skin condition after she started working at the University's school of pharmacy. She noticed her skin was itchy and irritated but the doctor couldn't remember the name of the condition he thought she had and sent her away with anti-histamines. She said: 'I was left confused after visiting the doctor. Then my friend in America sent me a link to Ariana Russell's work and I knew then that was what I had.' Ariana Russell is an artist in the USA who uses her own body and dermatographia to create artwork. Inspired by Ariana, Dr Waller set to work on her own project - creating science molecules and compounds for her students using her skin. Her students and fellow professors often ask her for requests which she happily draws on her skin. Dr Waller said: 'My skin might not be like this forever but it's a fun and unusual way of teaching my students and it grabs their attention a lot more than a text book would.' Dr Tabi Leslie, from the British Association of Dermatologists, explained that dermographism or 'skin writing' is a type of urticaria. She said: 'Raised red weals, which are caused by the release of histamine from cells in the skin called mast cells, appear at sights of friction, such as rubbing or stroking of the skin. 'This itching may also be aggravated by heat. 'Weals and red marks often appear as lines at the sites of scratching, and generally last for less than one hour. 'Antihistamines are used to reduce the itch and the rash, and are effective in most patients. People across the university have began to make requests for designs they want Dr Waller to draw on herself . 'However, antihistamines may not relieve the symptoms completely in all cases. 'In such cases, other treatments may need to be used in addition, or higher dosages of antihistamines may be prescribed than licensed recommendations suggest. 'Sufferers of dermographism may need to take antihistamines on a daily basis, as long as the symptoms persists. Usually, the non-sedating antihistamines are preferred as they have fewer side effects. 'Treatment needs to continue until the condition settles by itself which may take years. 'Your doctor will advise you on the best regime depending on the severity of your symptoms.'

He said: 'I was the fat kid at school, I was always chubby. I've got a sweet tooth and my mum worked at a biscuit factory, so she was always bringing packets home. I spent all my pocket money on pick and mix.' Tony says that it was his full-time job in the bank that saw his weight creep up as working all hours left him little time for cooking. Tony struggled with his weight since childhood when his mother would bring back treats from the biscuit factory where she worked and he would spend his pocket money on pick and mix . At his largest Tony would avoid sitting in certain chairs in fear of breaking them or being unable to get back up . 'We didn't have time to go shopping, so Indian and Chinese takeaway menus were always on the kitchen table. 'I'd order an onion bhaji to start, tikka masala and a rice to myself, a large naan and poppadoms and polish the lot off.' In May 1997 Tony was made redundant from his full-time job as a bank manager and but his old habits continued and by 2003, his size made it too difficult to work. In 2006 for their 25th wedding anniversary, the couple had booked a celebratory holiday to Florida. But they were unable to travel because of his size. Both Tony and his wife Debbie piled on the pounds after their jobs kept them too busy to cook so they would order Chinese or Indian takeaways most nights of the week . The pair decided to make a change after staying with Tony's sister Anna who was having success with Slimming world and have lost a combined weight of 29st since 2012 . Debbie said: 'We were looking forward to spending a week in the sun and I'd bought new holiday outfits. I was ticking the days off, couldn't wait to spend some quality time together. 'But a month before, Tony was struck down with cellulitis and leg ulcers, so painful he was hospitalised and we had to cancel the holiday. 'Tony was so apologetic, I know he felt guilty, but I didn't care. I just wanted him to get better. We ended up celebrating with a big party instead.' Debbie admits that even when they did manage to go on holiday Tony's weight proved to be a huge problem. As he gained more weight Tony developed health complications including type-two diabetes . 'Even when we did fly over the years, Tony wouldn't get out of his seat,' she admitted. 'He was so scared he might not fit back in. He couldn't go to the toilet, because the loo cubicle is so small on a plane.' The pair did occasionally attempt to shed a few pounds but it never worked out. 'We'd lose a few pounds then treat ourselves with chocolate,' Debbie said. 'Sometimes we'd go shopping together and I'd have to drop him at the front of the supermarket then go and park. Otherwise he couldn't walk all that way.' Debbie says that eventually Tony's weight prevented him from enjoying social situations. 'It got to a point where Tony hated going out, the staring really upset him. 'I would confront strangers about it, asking if they thought they knew us or if they had a problem. 'No-one ever said anything rude but I know it really got Tony down.' Debbie successfully lost 8st but says she couldn't keep up with Tony's phenomenal efforts . As well as affecting his appearance Tony's weight became more and more of a danger to his health. Debbie continued: 'Getting so big meant he developed type-two diabetes and he was taking a cocktail of 15 different tablets and an injection for it every day. 'I was concerned but I just had to be supportive for him, I couldn't control what he was eating.' Tony became more aware of his size and it got to the point where he would deliberately avoid certain situations. Debbie said: 'He wouldn't sit on our friend's garden furniture in case he broke it. He was petrified of breaking other people's property. He's so tall as well. 'It was like a giant trying to sit down. 'We couldn't go into coffee shops because he couldn't fit into the chairs with arms. 'We wouldn't go to the cinema in case the chairs weren't wide enough. Tony was so scared he might get stuck. Aged 45, Tony reached his heaviest weighing 38st and Debbie became increasingly concerned for her husband. 'He was so depressed and withdrawn, we did talk about his weight but we never spoke about how serious it was. 'I knew Tony could die if we didn't do something but that part was unspoken between the two of us.' But Tony wasn't the only one who struggled with his weight. Debbie had also piled on the pounds after she left her high-energy job as a chef. She said: 'I'd always been running around in a boiling kitchen and it was hard work. I ate healthily then, tucking into proper meals on my lunch and at the end of the day. 'But once I started an office job sat at my desk all day, and eating cakes people brought in, my clothes were getting tighter.' The turning point came for the pair after staying with Tony's sister Anna who was having success with the Slimming World diet, they both decided to sign up in April 2012. As well as changing his diet Tony took up Zumba too which he grew to love. Three years on and Tony has lost 21st and Debbie says he is a changed man inside and out. 'I've got the man I married back, he's so confident. He's a completely different person than I've known over the last ten years. 'And he loves being around the ladies at Zumba, he's a bit of a charmer. It doesn't phase him being the only bloke there.' The pair booked a trip to Florida for their 25th wedding anniversary but had to cancel because of Tony's size . After seeing Tony's success Debbie decided to take up Zumba too but says she was no match for her light-footed husband. 'By January 2013, I couldn't keep up with him. Tony had lost eight stone so we both joined Zumba classes but I have two left feet. I was stumbling everywhere but Tony had a whale of a time.' Tony has continued his Zumba classes to insure he doesn't slip back into his old ways. He said: 'Once a week I go off with other women, but Debbie doesn't mind. Doing Zumba helps to keep the weight off and I can't believe how light on my feet I am now.' Debbie has also had success with Slimming World. By June 2013, she had reached her target weight of 10st. Tony has even started working for Slimming World as a consultant and runs his own weight loss group. And Debbie doesn't worry about the competition from other women. 'He knows I'd kill him.'","Tony Orrell reached 38 stone after living off takeaways .

"In 2018, Nasa will launch the Orion spacecraft using the largest, most powerful rocket booster ever built; the Space Launch System (SLS). Tucked inside the stage adapter - the ring connecting Orion to the top propulsion stage of the SLS -will be 11 self-contained small satellites, each about the size of a large shoebox. Now, the space agency has revealed three missions that will use these small satellites during the test flight to help develop technologies for astronauts travelling to deep space. A concept image of the Near-Earth Asteroid Scout mission, one of 11 missions that will be secondary payloads to the first test flight of Nasa's Space Launch System . 'Nasa is taking advantage of a great opportunity to conduct more science beyond our primary focus of this mission,' said Jody Singer manager of Nasa's Flight Programs and Partnerships Office. 'While this new vehicle will enable missions beyond Earth orbit, we're taking steps to increase the scientific and exploration capability of SLS by accommodating small, CubeSat-class payloads.' The first is a Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout, using solar sail propulsion, will fly by a small asteroid, taking pictures and making observations. It aims to improve the current understanding of the asteroid environment and yield key information for future astronauts exploring an asteroid. BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit . Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout, using solar sail propulsion, will fly by a small asteroid, taking pictures and making observations. It aims to improve the current understanding of the asteroid environment and yield key information for future astronauts exploring an asteroid. Lunar Flashlight will scout for locations on the lunar surface that are rich in resources that, once broken down into their component molecules, could be used in future exploration. The hope is future astronauts can use the technology to produce building materials, propellant, oxygen and water. BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit. This will help scientists understand the effects of the deep space environment on biological systems as we plan to send humans farther into space than ever before. 'A solar sail works best when deployed in deep space and SLS will get us there,' said Les Johnson, principal investigator for NEA Scout at Marshall. 'It will take us out of Earth orbit and to interplanetary space - where we need to be to deploy the solar sail. It's a perfect ride to begin our mission.' Nasa's Lunar Flashlight will scout for locations on the lunar surface that are rich in resources that, once broken down into their component molecules, could be used in future exploration. The hope is future astronauts can use the technology to produce building materials, propellant, oxygen and water. Lunar Flashlight will use a large solar sail, similar to the NEA Scout sail, to reflect sunlight and illuminate the moon's permanently shadowed craters and then the science instruments will measure the surface water ice. Meanwhile, BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit. This will help scientists understand the effects of the deep space environment on biological systems as we plan to send humans farther into space than ever before. The BioSentinel mission will be the first time living organisms have travelled to deep space in over 40 years and the spacecraft will operate in the deep space radiation environment throughout its 18-month mission. The experiments will be launched by Houston-based Nasa in 2018 during a test flight of the Orion spacecraft using the largest, most powerful rocket booster ever built; the Space Launch System . The missions are a key part of the historic test flight, dubbed Exploration Mission-1. About 10 minutes after Orion and its service module escape the pull of Earth's gravity, the two will disconnect and Orion will proceed toward the moon. Once Orion is a safe distance away, the small payloads will begin to be deployed, all at various times during the flight depending on the particular missions. These CubeSats are small nano-satellites designed to be efficient and versatile. The masses of these secondary payloads are light - no heavier than 30lb (14kg). They will essentially piggyback on the SLS flight, providing what otherwise would be costly access to deep space. 'We are expanding the capabilities of this particular SLS test flight,' said Joseph Pelfrey, deputy manager of the Exploration and Space Transportation Development Office at Marshall. 'The rocket will be the strongest ever built by Nasa and we want to take advantage of that design. 'Flying secondary payloads is something we plan to do for missions to come and provide the science community an opportunity they haven't had before.' They will essentially piggyback on the SLS flight, providing what otherwise would be costly access to deep space.

"The Block’s up market South Yarra apartments are set to go under the hammer later this month with listing agents claiming the lavish apartments are worth between $1.3 million and $1.5 million. Thousands of fans will finally get the opportunity to see the four trendy Darling Street apartments for themselves when Channel Nine opens the doors to the public over the weekend. Although the show’s producers are remaining tight lipped about the reserve prices, realtors have been running VIP showings since construction wrapped up to give genuine buyers a feel of the renovated homes before the hammer falls on April 28. Scroll down for video . The trendy South Yarra apartments have been valued between $ 1.3 million and $1.5 million by listing agents . After last year's bitter disappointment Darren and Dea are hoping they've created a sophisticated apartment that potential buyers will like . The controversial pair made a return for 'Triple Threat' after winning only $10,000 on the 'Glasshouse' auction day . Jellis Craig agent Andrew McCann is telling potential buyers to expect Darren and Deanne’s chic apartment to sell for around $1.5 on auction day, reported Domain. He said the couple’s upmarket wine cellar and generous terrace had parties excited to return for a second look. The controversial pair made a return for 'Triple Threat' after winning only $10,000 on the 'Glasshouse' auction day. Darren and Deanne blew the judges away with their classy master bedroom . The couple were always praised for their 'simple' and 'beautiful' styling which was featured throughout their breathtaking en suite . Although this was Josh and Charlotte's first crack at the renovation reality show 'The Block' they have become fan favourites after putting plenty of work into the renovation of 'Apartment 1' Josh and Charlotte produced a beautiful wine cellar for their luxe three bedroom apartment . Josh and Charlotte's apartment has garnered a lot of attention with 750 prospective buyers having already inspected the property . Since the apartments were listed on the market last week,  Josh and Charlotte's apartment garnered a lot of attention with 750 prospective buyers having already inspected the property. The agent taking care of Josh and Charlotte’s campaign, Hocking Stuart agent Mark Konishi, took 17 couples through the apartment on Easter Saturday and said the pair’s light-saturated apartment impressed buyers. Although the couple were disqualified from the Master bedroom reveal, despite a 'perfect score' from the judges, agents are confident the high ceilings and exposed beams will be a big draw card for buyers. Fresh and clean: Mr Konishi said buyers were impressed with the couples 'light filled' apartment . The Block's judges praised the couple for their 'thoughtful' styling and clean grey palate . Tim and Anastasia are confident that they will come out on top when the apartments go on sale next month . Tim and Anastasia's sophisticated apartment has been valued at around $1.3 million . Real estate agents said potential buyers were impressed with the property and thought it looked much better than on television . Tim and Anastasia’s apartment is being sold by Russell Cambridge and Doug Doyle of Biggin and Scott. Mr Cambridge said the property has been well received by potential buyers who think the property looks a lot better in person than on TV. Three contracts were issued after Mr Cambridge showed the property to over over 30 groups. He is telling prospective buyers the ‘sophisticated’ apartment will sell for upward of $1.3 million. After realtors showed around 30 groups through Tim and Anastasia's property, three contracts were issued. Ayden and Jess are facing stiff competition however their realtor valued the property at around $1.3 million, the same figure as Tim and Anastasia . When it goes under the hammer next month Ayden and Jess hope that the effort they put into their 'Scandanavian' apartment will be rewarded . Adam Joske from Gary Peer’s is running Ayden and Jess’s campaign and he said there has been a lot of interest coming from online buyers. The first time renovators on the Block won the very first room reveal of the season and  received positive reviews over the course of the program. Mr Joske told prospective buyers the 'Scandinavian' styled apartment will go sell around $1.3 million at auction. Judges think Ayden and Jess' bright apartment will appeal to a younger buyer . This was also Ayden and Jess' first shot at the Block with the judges giving the couple good reviews over the course of the series . All four apartments have been marketed without featuring the kitchen, stairs or terrace of the apartments as they haven’t been formally revealed on the reality series. This has given realtors ample opportunity to spark interest in the million dollar properties before auction date without disappointing dedicated fans who tune in each week for ‘room reveal’. Teams will be hoping to do better than The Block Glasshouse duos after three couples only pocketed between $10,000 and $40,000 for months of hard work and time away from their family. Contestants keep any money made over their reserves and the team that makes the most receives a $100,000 bonus. This season only registered bidders, buyers advocates and a small group of media will be present at the filmed auctions. The winners will remain a secret until the auctions are aired during the season finale. Channel Nine are opening the doors of 'The Block' apartments this weekend with around 40,000 fans expected to show up .","The Block’s four apartments are now on the market with the auction date set for April 28 .

"Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table looking at a range of living standards. Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings. With figures showing that almost one in four of the population is obese, Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure. Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting us outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world. Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table, put together by a Harvard Business School academic, looking at a range of living standards . Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world . Despite national earnings that make us the world’s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity. We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a ‘social progress index’ suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers – for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: ‘Overall, within Europe the UK’s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world’s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) ‘The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK’s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.’ The table – which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world – lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd. For Press freedom, the UK is ranked 27th. Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, who headed the research, said: ‘A striking finding is that gross domestic product is far from being the sole determinant of social progress.’","Britain ranks as just 27th best country in the world for health and wellness .

"Donning stilettos, lipstick and mascara, the young men take to the streets of one of Washington DC's most violent neighborhoods. But under their clothing - and in some cases, in their Louis Vuitton bags - they are carrying knives, brass knuckles and pepper spray. Meet some of the more than 200 members of Check It, the only documented gang of gay and transgender youths in America. The teenagers and young adults, who have faced discrimination  throughout their entire lives, are the subjects of a new independent documentary. The film, also named Check It, explains how many of the youths have been stabbed or shot at, while others have served time in juvenile prisons . But now, the 'tight-knit' gang members, who are aged 14 to 22, are fighting to break the cycle of poverty and violence that they have grown up in. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Documentary star: This is one of more than 200 members of Check It, the only documented gang of gay and transgender youths in America . Impoverished area: The gang members, many of whom have been stabbed and shot at, have faced discrimination throughout their lives . Transformation: They are now the subjects of a new independent film, which tells of how some of them have served time in juvenile prisons . Dressing up: But now, the 'tight-knit' gang members (including this member), who are aged 14 to 22, are fighting to break the cycle of poverty and violence that they have grown up in. They are working on their own clothing label, putting on fashion shows and working stints as models . Contrast: The documentary describes how the gang members have to deal with violence and fights on a regular basis (left) but have now launched their own fashion label (right: a youth models for the label) in a bid to escape their 'often brutal' lives in Trinidad, Washington DC . They have set up their own clothing label and are putting on fashion shows in the north-east neighborhood, according to the film and an Indiegogo page. And some of them are even working stints as runway models. All the while, they are offering each other unconditional love and support. 'At its heart, the film explores the undying friendship that exists between these kids - an unbreakable bond that is tested every day,' the page states. However, amid their achievements, the youths often encounter setbacks, with the community they live in 'relentlessly trying to beat them down'. 'When The Check It are not taking small steps forward on the catwalk, they too often take massive steps backwards,' the page explains. The documentary follows the members, led by ex-convict Mo, as they get into fights, are ridiculed by passerbys and struggle with their fashion plans. In its trailer, Dana Flor, who co-directed the film with Toby Oppenheimer, says: 'A lot of times just being black, you have a lot of odds against you.' According to the Washingtonian, she continues: 'Being gay and black... it's like a nightmare waiting to happen.' Close: 'At its heart, the film explores the undying friendship that exists between these kids - an unbreakable bond that is tested every day' Hard life: Formed in 2005 by a group of 'bullied 9th graders', Check It now has more than 200 members, all of whom live a life that is 'brutal' Transgender: Because the youths - many of whom live transgender lives - are so close, their gang was difficult for filmmakers to infiltrate . Violence to fashion: Gang members are pictured getting into a fight (left), and participating in a fashion show (right) in the independent film . Formed in 2005 by a group of 'bullied 9th graders', Check It now has more than 200 members, all of whom live a life that is 'brutal' but also 'full of hope'. Because the youths - many of whom cross-dress or live transgender lives - are so close, the gang's structure was difficult for filmmakers to infiltrate. However, over a three-year-period, Ms Flor and Mr Oppenheimer gradually managed to immerse themselves in the members' lives in Trinidad. 'These kids have been let down by everybody in their life,' Ms Flor said. 'You have to assert them that you're for real, that you're not going to go away.' He added: 'The documentary will not only go into the challenges members face, but also depict their dream of launching a fashion line.' Actor Steve Buscemi, of New York-based Olive Productions, is producing the documentary, alongside Ms Flor and Mr Oppenheimer. Let down: 'These kids have been let down by everybody in their life... You have to assert them that you're for real, you're not going to go away' Raising money: Filmmakers are raising money to help fund the final editing stages of the film (pictured). They have so far raised $62,630 . They hope the film will expose the discrimination that the gang faces - and show the 'amazing things' the youths are capable of. They also hope it will 'encourage a similarly open-minded conversation about HIV, anti-gay discrimination, and poverty both nationally' and locally. Filmmakers are raising money to help fund the final editing stages of the film. On Saturday, they surpassed their $60,000 goal.

"The Arizona police officer who rammed his car into an armed suspect was previously involved in a lawsuit while working for the New York Police Department. Michael Rapiejko was accused of approaching a man as he got out of his car in October 2005 and pointing a gun at him before handcuffing him and threatening to shoot him in front of his wife and four children. The plaintiff, Luis Colon, also claimed that Rapiejko choked him and ordered that he get back into his car. Scroll down for videos . Michael Rapiejko (above) was accused of approaching Luis Colon as he got out of his car in October 2005, pointing a gun at him and threatening to shoot him . According to NBC 4, Rapiejko's defense team said that while their client did point a gun at the man and order him back into his car, the other claims were untrue. Colon was charged with obstructing governmental administration, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, all charges that were dropped in April 2006. In the end, the city settled with Colon for $20,000 under the condition that he dismiss all other claims. The settlement was reached in December 2008, the same time Rapiejko left the New York Police Department and joined the Tucson Police Department. This as Rapiejko is under fire for using possible excessive force when he mowed down an armed suspect (above) in his police vehicle . The officer joined the Marana Police Department roughly a year-and-a-half ago, where he is now being investigated by Internal Affairs. Rapiejko, a Cross Fit devotee, calls himself Robocop. Video of the February 19 incident emerged earlier this week, and shows Rapiejko, 34, running into suspect Mario Valencia, who was carrying what appears to be a rifle, and who seems to point the weapon to the sky and fire off shots. A police officer in one of the patrol cars says: 'One round just went out. He's definitely loaded.' He then tells his colleague, Officer Michael Rapiejko, in the other vehicle: 'Stand off, the gun is loaded.' Mario Valencia (above) was in the hospital for two days after being hit by Rapiejko . But apparently ignoring his advice, Rapiejko overtakes the officer's car, before speeding straight toward Valencia. Seconds later, his vehicle mounts the curb and smashes into the suspect's body. Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall before coming to a halt amid debris. The other officer can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down.' Valencia was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in serious condition following the crash and was eventually booked into jail two days later. Sergeant Chris Warren said at the time that Valencia 'was a dangerous felon who'd been on a crime spree throughout the morning'. This crime spree allegedly involved theft at a convenience store at, vandalism and burglary at the Tucson Baptist Temple, a home invasion and theft of a car. It culminated with the alleged theft of a rifle from Walmart, after which he was hit by Rapiejko's police vehicle. Rapiejko was put on standard administrative leave after the crash, but soon reinstated after the Pima County Attorney's Office cleared the officer of any wrongdoing. Valencia is facing several felony charges for his alleged crime spree.","Michael Rapiejko was accused of approaching Luis Colon as he got out of his car in October 2005, pointing a gun at him and threatening to shoot him .

"An online campaign by Woolworths has backfired spectacularly and led to accusations that the supermarket is trying to cash in on Anzac Day. Woolworths launched 'Fresh in our Memories' last week, inviting Australians to upload images  to remember those who fought for their country, which it then branded with its logo and a 'fresh in our memories' slogan. The supermarket has since been forced to halt the campaign it was branded 'disrespectful' and 'disgusting' by social media users who unleashed a barrage of memes poking fun at Woolworth's attempt to embrace Anzac Day. An online campaign for Woolworths has caused outrage on social media . 'Fresh in our Memories' was launched just last week in the lead up to the Anzac centenary . The campaign invites Aussies to create a profile picture and cover photo for their Facebook page, in memory of the men and women who have fought for their country . Customers took to Facebook and Twitter to vent their anger over the campaign. One appalled consumer threatened to boycott the store, writing on the Woolworths Facebook page: 'Hey Woolworths, my family did not fight and die in the wars for you to hijack the ANZAC tradition with that tasteless promo. Take it down now please or my money's going elsewhere.' The campaign was branded 'disrespectful' and 'disgusting' Supermarket customers took to Facebook and Twitter to vent their anger . The supermarket has been inundated with comments like this one . Another wrote: 'Your latest ANZAC campaign is absolutely disgusting. Trying to use the memory of our diggers for advertising is reprehensible! Pull the campaign and apologise!' The campaign unleashed a barrage of memes with social media, with many using leading political figures such as Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Kevin Rudd, John Howard and Jacqui Lambie to mock the supermarket. A spokeswoman for Woolworths told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday night that 'Fresh in our Memories' is not a marketing strategy. 'It is a website designed in consultation with the RSL for people to share their photos, stories and memories,' she said. 'As one of Australia's largest employers, Woolworths has spent months collecting stories from our staff for the site. All profits from the sale of merchandise on the site goes to the RSL. 'We are proud to support the RSL and our diggers. Like all Australians, we pay our respects to service people past and present. 'Our small logo on the site is in line with other corporately sponsored Centenary of ANZAC activity.' Twitter was flooded with memes of the Woolworths campaign. Pictured is Prime Minister Tony Abbott . This meme shows former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd . Other memes were of Bill Cosby (top right), Adolf Hitler (top left) and other well-known figures . The spokeswoman later confirmed the website had been taken down. 'The site was developed to give our staff and customers a place to put their stories to mark the Centenary of ANZAC,' she said. 'We regret that our branding on the picture generator has caused offense, this was clearly never our intention.

"It was thought that Edward Snowden was living in a secret location in Russia after his 2013 leaks made him a wanted man by the US Government – but it seems he’s actually set up shop in the middle of the White House. At least, that’s where the whistleblower is according to Google Maps. A business called Edward’s Snow Den has appeared in the US President’s headquarters thanks to the clever work of security consultant Bryan Seely. A business called Edward’s Snow Den has appeared in the US President’s headquarters . It is thought that Edward Snowden was living in a secret location in Russia . Nothing happens when the icon for it is clicked, but for a short while it was listed as a snowboard shop, open between 5am and 11pm, according to thenextweb.com. Several reviews appeared underneath the listing, including one which gave it a five star rating and described it as a ‘great source of classified information’. Mr Seely, from Seattle, told MailOnline that he created the fake listing during a TED Talk in Kirkland to demonstrate a flaw in Google Maps that could be exploited to cause more serious problems. He said: 'The point was to demonstrate how a year ago, I'd shown the same type of flaw on Google and they have not fixed it. I wanted wanted to show it's still broken, in a funny way. 'And anyone could do this without any special equipment or code.' It follows claims that at least three terror groups plotting attacks against Britain have changed their communication methods since the leaks by Snowden. The Al Qaeda-linked networks have altered their tactics since the fugitive stole intelligence files from GCHQ and the US National Security Agency, according to a report. Extremist websites have also moved to protect their digital communications by releasing encryption programmes for followers, making it harder for extremists to be tracked down. Evidence of the harm done to intelligence agencies across the world after the former CIA contractor leaked 1.7million classified documents in 2013 is compiled in the first comprehensive public analysis of the leaks by the Henry Jackson Society security think-tank. The Snowden files revealed details about covert attempts by agencies to view citizens' private information by gathering internet histories, emails, text and call records and passwords. Now the Henry Jackson Society has found that at least three Al Qaeda affiliates are known to have altered their communications. The think-tank has also found other groups using human couriers instead of email and mobile phones. Edward Snowden is being ‘exploited’ under a deal he made with the Russians to guarantee him asylum, a leading spy analyst has claimed. Mr Snowden may have been told not to speak out on Russian surveillance but continue attacking America in order to save himself from jail in the US, Andrei Soldatov said. He accused the former US spy of not being ‘transparent’ and said he was being ‘secretive’ about his arrangements with the Russian authorities. After Mr Snowden, 31, revealed himself in June 2013 as the civilian CIA worker who stole a vast tranche of classified documents, he fled to Hong Kong and then Russia where he was given asylum. The decision by Russian President Vladimir Putin was seen as a snub to US President Barack Obama at a time when relations between the two countries are strained. But the details of the arrangement have never been made public, and Mr Snowden has never addressed them. Mr Soldatov, who runs a website which is an online watchdog of Mr Putin’s intelligence agencies, spoke out in an interview with the Daily Beast, a US news and culture website. Mr Soldatov is also an author, investigative journalist and analyst who has been working on the Russian security state for a decade. He said: ‘I think there is some sort of a deal with the Russian authorities. ‘It seems Snowden insisted that he’d never be used by Russian propaganda. ‘He never made it onto (Russian TV station) RT or other state media outlets and of course they would be happy to have him. ‘He’s clearly being exploited - after all, many repressive measures on the Internet in Russia were presented to Russians as a response to Snowden’s revelations.’ Mr Snowden is still a wanted man in the US where, if he returns, he will face espionage charges that could see him jailed for life if convicted. The White House is one of the most heavily guarded buildings in the world . Jihadist websites also released three 'significant' encryption programmes 'within a three- to five-month time frame of the leaks', meaning fanatics are harder to detect and encrypted emails take longer to decipher. Report author Robin Simcox said: 'The focus has been about the so-called mass surveillance by GCHQ and the NSA but these leaks have allowed extremist groups and jihadists to look at our capabilities – what we can and can't do – which has given them a great insight. 'At a time when the range of threats against the West has never been greater, with Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Al Qaeda in Pakistan, it is astonishing the focus has been more on the shortcomings of our intelligence agencies and not the fact Snowden has helped terror suspects drop off the radar. 'He has caused severe damage to our ability to fight extremism.' MI5 director general Andrew Parker has called the traitor's actions a 'gift to terrorists'.","Edward's Snow Den was listed for a time as a snowboarding business .

"Forget packing snorkels or body boards this summer, the latest beach craze for those wishing to spend their days in the surf has a more mythical twist. The Merfin, a  monofin made from recycled rubber that lets you experience what it might be like to swim like a mermaid, looks set to be the essential piece of beach play kit this summer. The product is the brainchild of Australian professional freediver Kazzie Mahina. The 37-year-old, from Byron Bay in New South Wales, created the flippers in the shape of a mermaid tail to allow kids and adults alike to streak through the ocean like an underwater creature. Scroll down for video . Wouldn't you like to be a mermaid? The Merfin, a rubber monofin that mimics the experience of swimming like a mermaid has arrived on UK shores. The product retails at £99 in the UK . The novelty swimming product has taken off around the world and can be used by kids and grown-ups alike. Designer Kazzie Mahina says the Merfin can also help to tone abs and thighs . After taking off Down Under, the Merfin is now available to buy in the UK, with the country's sole stockist, online retailer Gigi Brooks, reporting brisk trade. Ali Lovegrove from the Lincolnshire-based stockist  told FEMAIL that the Merfin has been 'very popular' in recent months with a rush expected as beach-goers prepare for their summer breaks. 'As the weather has been warming up in recent weeks we have seen an influx in sales from surfing hotspots in the UK including Cornwall, Devon and Wales and, as we ship worldwide, we have sent them as far as Japan.' She added that the company had been attracted to the Merfin because 'there is absolutely nothing like them in the market'. Diver Mahina, who can hold her breath for a startling five minutes, says she spent years perfecting the product. She said: 'I started designing the fins in the middle of 2006. I went through lots of samples, prototypes, lots of trial and error.' Mermaid entrepreneur: After spending years bringing the product to the market, Mahina has found herself in demand, with Urban Outfitters chasing an adult version of the product to sell in the US . In character: The freediver and part-time mermaid, who can hold her breath for five minutes, is due to launch a new product this summer . 'People now would go ""oh, that seems to obvious"" or ""it looks so simple"" but it wasn't back then.' In 2011, she launched a website and started selling the Merfins out of Australia, and by the next year they were in stores around the country. The diver says that after a successful launch in Australia, she was then  'hunted down' by US retailer Urban Outfitters, who chased the brand for an adult range of the fins. 'They hunted me, they wouldn't leave me alone. I was like ""What is going on? This is one of the coolest stores in America.""' The fins come in four sizes, ranging from child's to adult's, ensuring that grown-ups can flip and swoosh in the water alongside their little ones. Colours range from coral to aqua to a striking sunset orange. Prices start at £99 for a child's fin and £120 for adult's. Gigi Brooks is currently the only UK stockist and has the fins in Coral and Aqua. The retailer said the product has been 'very popular' There's an easy-release ankle clip too to ensure that should you prefer to have your feet separated, you quickly can. Designed to be used in the pool or the sea, the Merfin is also being promoted as a fitness aid which can help to tone abdominal and thigh muscles. Mahina said she is already working on her next product, set to be released in time for next summer, and can't believe how lucky she is to have found something she is so passionate about. 'Sometimes I pinch myself and say how did it work out that I am the luckiest girl in the world. 'Dreams and ideas belong to the world they don't belong to any one person and anybody could tap into them and I think I just happened to be connected and passionate and listening enough. 'The mermaiding is lots of fun, and the gift of being able to give that gift of fun [means ] my fun is just multiplying to  know that other people are enjoying themselves.'","Recycled rubber Merfin designed by Australian freediver Kazzie Mahina .

"Rubbish teams refused to empty a recycling bin because it had an empty crisp packet on its lid. Binmen said the bag of Walkers prawn cocktail crisps fell foul of the rules – even though it had been dropped there by a litterbug. Elsewhere they left another bin full of rubbish because there was a scrap of cellophane on top. The binmen in Farnham, Surrey, said the bag of Walkers prawn cocktail crisps fell foul of the rules – even though it had been dropped there by a litterbug and not by the owner of the bin (file image) Now enraged residents in Farnham, Surrey, have branded waste collection squads as 'little Hitlers' for enforcing recycling rules to the letter. Homeowners have been told to remove any non-recyclable material from the wheelie bin lids. Dozens of people have now taken to social media to complain that their blue wheelie bins have been left full ofwaste by the collection teams which are  'trying to make a point' over recycling rules. Tracy Porter said on Facebook 'I am so angry about this. 'I live opposite a shop and some kind person, not wanting to litter the area, put their crisp packet in the top of my recycling bin, and for that I have to be penalised. 'They would not empty the bin. It's not my fault, not even my rubbish. What is the place coming to?' Another resident, Peter Smith, said he had been left with a wheelie bin full of rotting waste after the collection team refused to empty it because they saw a piece of cellophane paper. They ruled the cellophane was not recyclable and broke the rules, but Mr Smith said 'Why not take that little bit off and take the rest? 'They are behaving like little Hitlers.' Waverley Council defended the binmen, saying they had 'nowhere suitable' to put non-recyclable items. The council has suggested placing overflowing recyclable waste in cardboard boxes alongside the blue wheelie bins. Enraged residents in Farnham, Surrey, have branded waste collection squads as 'little Hitlers' for enforcing recycling rules to the letter . But resident Teresa Johnstone responded 'We live in England - will they bother to pick up rain-sodden boxes which have disintegrated when they can't even lift a crisp packet from the bin in the first place? I very much doubt it.' A council spokesman said 'To prevent a whole truck of materials ending up in landfill, undoing the good work of a majority of residents who are recycling correctly, the council enforces the non-collection of contaminated recycling bins. 'All collectors working for Waverley's contractor have stickers to place on bins which detail why it has not been collected and remind residents what should and should not be in the blue bin.' The online discussion was not completely one-sided, with some residents posting messages of support for the council's stance and questioning some people's commitment to recycling. Zoe Tudor said 'I don't think it's the recycling collectors' job to sort through each bin - as if their job isn't hard work enough.'","Binmen refused to empty bin because it had empty crisp packet on lid .

"Young father: Michael Owen was preparing for his daughter's fifth birthday when he was killed along with his friend Kyle Careford in East Sussex . Tributes have been paid to two young friends who tragically died after their car crashed into a church wall. The men, named locally as Michael Owen and Kyle Careford, were killed in the road accident in Crowborough, East Sussex in the early hours of Sunday morning. Mr Owen, 21, had just received news of a  job offer and was preparing for his daughter's fifth birthday when he was killed. His grieving family have spoken of how loved he was and say they still can't accept he's gone. Describing Mr Owen's relationship with his daughter Lily-Rose Iris, his father Stephen, 50, said: 'He was only 16 when he had her but he was responsible and loved her to bits. 'He was with her any second he could be. He was always so safe. Did something fail on the car or did they hit the curb?' Mr Owen's stepmother Sylvia added: 'Everybody loved him. He had so many friends and everyone's absolutely devastated. 'He was a lovely person and he was a brilliant father. 'Until we see him we can't accept it. We keep getting up in the night and looking for his car down the road.' Kyle Careford, the other man in the car, is thought to have died just days before turning 21. It is believed that one of the men lost control of the Renault Clio they were travelling in as it came round a bend, smashing into a church's stone wall before finishing on its roof. Skid marks lead up to an approximately ten metre long gap in a sandstone wall that was destroyed in the crash. Flowers and tributes have been left at the scene by family and friends. One heartbreaking card to Mr Owen reads: 'To daddy, I love you so much. I'm gonna miss you every day. Love u daddy. Lily and Josh.' Mr Owen was still at school when he fathered Lily-Rose with his former partner Lauren Molloy. A card signed by Lauren, believed to be Lily-Rose's mother Ms Molloy, read: 'I can't describe how heartbroken I am. I love you so much and so does our beautiful princess. 'You was an amazing dad and was always there for me. I'm so sorry I didn't let us be a family again. Tragic: Flowers and tributes have been left at the scene of the accident, which happened in front of a church . Crash scene: The wall hit by the car is almost completely demolished and there are skid marks on the road . 'If only I could turn back time I would take you back straight away. I will do everything for our daughter I promise and I will tell her how amazing you are.' The 21-year-old worked in book printing but on Friday he was told he had landed a new job in window screen repair at the same firm as his stepbrother Karl Rabbitt, 36. The brother of Mr Careford led tributes to the pair. In a card left at the scene, brother Ben wrote: 'I can't explain how I am feeling. When you left us this morning to be in God's arms you took a piece of me away. 'I'm not quite sure how to tell your niece Grace that her uncle Kyle is now in heaven. I'm sure he will treasure her Frozen onesie even more now.' Tributes have also been paid to the men on Facebook, with friend, Tyler Scales, writing: 'My deepest sympathy and thoughts go out to all those who have loved and lost. 'Be safe, and think about how lucky you really are. Life can be taken so quick it's unbelievable and very unfair. Big love to all those affected by the loss of life.' Another friend, Sheri Pitman added: 'RIP Kyle. You were such a good kid and never deserved that.' Both men were from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, not far from the crash scene. Moving: One of the many notes left by grieving friends and family at the scene of the crash . After hearing a loud bang, local residents quickly called the emergency services, but the men, who had suffered horrific injuries, are thought to have died instantly. Firefighters had to cut their bodies out of the mangled wreckage. There were no other cars involved in the crash. A spokesman for Sussex Police said: 'At about 12.40am on 12 April a collision occurred in Rotherfield Road, Crowborough. A Renault Clio collided with the wall of the church and overturned. 'There were two male occupants on the car and sadly both were declared deceased at the scene. 'Police are carrying out an investigation into the cause of the collision and to identify the two men in the car. 'Police are appealing for witnesses and anyone with information should contact 101 quoting Operation Lapwing.' It is believed both men will be formally identified tomorrow morning. A spokesman for East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service added: 'We attended the scene and the car was on its roof. There were two young males trapped inside who were declared dead at the scene. 'We had to use cutting gear to get them out but they were already dead.'","Crash victims named as Michael Owen, 21, and Kyle Careford, 20 .

"An identical twin whose sister was murdered by her stalker ex-boyfriend has revealed she wishes she had done more to save her. Grieving Nikki Thomas, from South Wales, says she wants to turn back the clock and tell Jenna that she didn't have to 'put up' with her former partner's obsessive behaviour, including bombarding her with hundreds of calls and texts a day. But Jenna, who was strangled to death by Philip Packer in a jealous rage in 2008, never reported his behaviour to police - and paid the ultimate price. Scroll down for video . Nikki Thomas appeared on This Morning to tell how her sister was murdered by her obsessive ex . Now Nikki, 27, is warning others to learn from her sister's tragic story and not tolerate stalking behaviour. As part of Stalking Awareness Week, Nikki, from North Cornelly, ­appeared on today's This Morning in honour of her sister. She told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden how Jenna had started a relationship with Packer, who was 28 years older than she was, when she was a teenager. But shop worker Jenna found Parker, a nightclub doorman, could be obsessive and controlling so she eventually ended their relationship. However, Nikki said he then wouldn't leave her sister - then aged 21 - alone. She recalled: 'In 2009 she left him saying she wasn't happy. He was very controlling, obsessive and jealous. 'He wouldn't stop contacting her. He would ring 300-400 times a day and that was just phone calls. There were also texts and visits.' Jenna was strangled to death by Philip Packer, pictured, who used to hound her with calls and messages . Nikki said neither she or Jenna realised how far Packer would go and 'kind' Jenna didn't consider reporting him to the police. Nikki said: 'My family and I were worried but she thought she had a handle on it. She never said she was frightened for her safety. 'She wasn't scared of him but it was unwanted attention - she made that clear to him but he persisted. She didn't go to police as she thought she could deal with it.' Nikki said Packer would often turn up unannounced at Jenna's house to drive her to work, or if she was waiting at the bus stop, he could pull over and offer her a lift. This is what happened on June 24, 2009, but Jenna never made it to her work place. After offering her a lift, Packer, then aged 49, took her to a layby and strangled her to death. He then drove to a police station and told them he had a dead body in his car. Six months later he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court where a jury found him guilty of murder. Nikki and TV presenter Rav Wilding, left, appeared on This Morning to promote Stalking Awareness Week . He was jailed for a minimum of 18 years (later reduced to 16 years). Nikki now wishes she had urged her sister to put a stop to Packer's stalking behaviour. She could have sought a restraining order preventing him from contacting or going near her. Nikki said: 'If we could turn back the clock I'd tell her you don't have to put up with this.' She is hoping others will heed her warning as figures from the National Stalking Advocacy reveal that one in six women and one in 12 men are stalked at some point in their lives. TV presenter Rav Wilding is also supporting the campaign after being the victim of a stalker himself. He revealed on This Morning how a woman used to bombard him with hundreds of 'vile and grotesque' messages. Rav had to take out a restraining order on a woman who was harassing him . He said: 'She was eventually convicted for harassment  and now I have a restraining order - that's all I wanted. Now she can't contact me directly or indirectly.' Rav added that if people are concerned about harassment, they shouldn't think they are being silly and should rest assured the police will take them seriously. 'You don't have to put up with it,' he said. 'If you are getting unwanted attention you can go to the police and get action.'","Jenna Thomas, 21, was murdered by ex boyfriend Philip Packer .

"An invitation to a White House state dinner has always been one of Washington's most sought-after tickets. There's the elegant setting, VIP guests in tuxedos and designer gowns and a four-course meal served up by America's most famous kitchen. But don't get your hopes up. President Barack Obama has held the fewest number of state dinners since Harry S. Truman, who left office 62 years ago. In his first six years, Obama held just seven state dinners and will hold at least two more this year: for the leaders of Japan, on April 28, and China, later in the year. Scroll down for video . Frugal entertainer: President Barack Obama (center) offers a toast on stage to French President Francois Hollande at the State Dinner on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington. Obama has held the fewest number of state dinners since Harry S. Truman, who left office 62 years ago. Obama hosted just seven . One of the lucky few: First lady Michelle Obama and President Barack Obama welcome French President Francois Hollande for a State Dinner at the North Portico of the White House in February 2014 . Truman, who became president in 1945, held six dinners during nearly eight years in office. Shrouded in pageantry, a White House state dinner is the highest diplomatic honour the U.S. reserves for allies and other countries. It's also one of the most lavish affairs the government puts on. The State Department pays the entire tab, which averaged about $500,000 each for Obama's seven dinners, said White House spokesman Patrick Ventrell. Ventrell and others said cost was a concern when Obama took office in January 2009 amid the worst economic slide since the 1930s. Officials were sensitive to the economic distress blanketing the country and were looking for other ways the president could cement relationships with foreign leaders without spending hundreds of thousands of public dollars on an opulent black-tie dinner. Obama held his first state dinner toward the end of his first year in office, honoring then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Obama held his first state dinner toward the end of his first year in office, honouring then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (pictured, above with his wife Gursharan Kaur (far left) Other dinners included one for  British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha in March 2012 . Barack Obama has held seven state dinners so far and plans at least two more this year. 2009: Then-Indian PM Manmohan Singh . 2010: Then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon . 2011: Then-Chinese President Hu Jintao . 2011: German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 2011: Then-South Korean President Lee Myung-bak . 2012: British Prime Minister David Cameron . 2014: French President Francois Hollande . 2015: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, scheduled for April 28 . 2015: Chinese President Xi Jinping . Later dinners were for Mexico, China, Germany, South Korea, Britain and France. Aides say Obama's overall level of engagement with foreign counterparts and the different ways he interacts with them is more important than the number of state dinners penciled on his calendar. 'State dinners are one tool of diplomacy that can be used and used effectively and sometimes we use them,' Ventrell said. Obama has met hundreds of times with his counterparts and other foreign officials in settings as formal as the Oval Office and as casual as a Hawaiian golf course. They also speak by phone. 'There's no concern that should be raised by the number of state dinners,' said Capricia Marshall, who led the State Department team that oversees visits by foreign dignitaries until she stepped down in 2013. Lyndon B. Johnson topped the 11 presidents who followed Truman, cramming 54 state dinners into his 62-month tenure in the Oval Office, White House Historical Association data show. Ronald Reagan, the actor-turned-politician who knew a thing or two about entertaining, held 52 dinners during two terms. Even Jimmy Carter, who liked to project an image of frugality, managed 28 state dinners in four years as president. A state dinner for a foreign leader marks the finale of a state visit, which opens with herald trumpets and cannon salutes on the South Lawn of the White House, followed by meetings, a joint news conference with the U.S. president and an elaborate State Department luncheon. Then comes the state dinner, where a tuxedo-clad president raises a glass and toasts relations between the countries in front of hundreds of invited guests, ranging from Cabinet secretaries and other senior administration officials to members of Congress, business leaders, celebrities and others, as well as the working media. President Gerald Ford dances with Queen Elizabeth during the state dinner in her honour in July 1976 . 'Make no mistake about it: every country wants to have a state visit,' said Ann Stock, a White House social secretary under President Bill Clinton. Obama and recent presidents have used multiple formats and settings apart from a state dinner to forge ties with their counterparts. In 2013, Obama met Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Sunnylands retreat in Southern California. Obama returned there the following year to consult with Jordan's King Abdullah II. Obama also took German Chancellor Angela Merkel to dinner at the upscale 1789 restaurant in Georgetown; French President Francois Hollande to the Virginia estate of Thomas Jefferson, a former president and former U.S. ambassador to France; and British Prime Minister David Cameron to an NCAA tournament game in Ohio. On Hawaii vacations, Obama has shared his golf game with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. George W. Bush welcomed more than a dozen foreign leaders to his Texas ranch, which became a popular venue for Bush's brand of casual diplomacy. He even treated then-Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to a tour of Graceland, the Memphis, Tennessee, home of Elvis Presley, one of Koizumi's musical idols. Reagan welcomed Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to his Santa Barbara, California, ranch. Richard Nixon received Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev at his home in San Clemente, California. The origins of the state dinner were rooted in the the early 19th Century when they were held to honor the president's cabinet, Congress or other dignitaries, according to the White House Historical Association. At the time, the city consisted of a collection of isolated and separated villages that were almost inaaccessible, so large receptions or dinners were rare. It wasn't until the late 19th Century that the term state dinner referred specifically to a meal hosted by the president for a foreign head of state as the guest of honour. The first ruling monarch to attend a state dinner at the White House was King David Kalakaua of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), hosted by President Ulysses S. Grant on December 12, 1874.","Obama's record is lowest since Truman left office in 1953 having hosted six .

Last Saturday’s inept capitulation to Aston Villa was the most recent occasion: a soft goal down after 45 minutes and an expensively assembled team which looked as if it had been recruited from the local JobCentre half an hour before the kick-off. Stephen Dodd took this photograph of Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula praying at Anfield last month . Had I actually gone through with it, however, within seconds I’d have been hauled to my feet by the stewards and steered unceremoniously towards the exit. They are especially vigilant when it comes to anyone blocking the gangways or stairwells. And given football’s tragic history, from Ibrox to Hillsborough, their caution is well-merited. So it was surprising, to say the least, to see that photograph of two Muslim Liverpool supporters praying to Mecca at half-time in an FA Cup match. They had rolled out their prayer mat at the foot of some stairs beneath the stand, apparently with the full consent of safety staff. One of the men, solicitor Asif Bodi, 46, from Preston, explained that because the televised game didn’t kick off until 4pm, the final whistle would have blown too late for them to pray outside the ground. So perhaps we can point the finger at television. Matches are shifted all over the shop by the schedulers, for purely commercial reasons. For instance, those irritating lunchtime games are designed for the benefit of bookmakers and betting syndicates in the Far East, not season ticket holders. Travelling fans often complain that evening games mean it is impossible for them to catch the last train home. But this may be the first time that a late kick-off for the convenience of television has played havoc with the Muslim call to prayer. The extraordinary scene was captured on a mobile phone camera by Liverpool supporter Stephen Dodd. He tweeted the photograph with the caption ‘Muslims praying at half-time at the match yesterday #DISGRACE.’ In no time, predictably, the balloon went up. With the customary restraint for which social media is renowned, the usual online lynch-mob were branding him a ‘bigot’ and a ‘disgrace to humanity’. The incident took place when Liverpool were playing Blackburn Rovers at Anfield in March . Needless to say, someone reported the tweet to Merseyside Police, who for once exercised commendable sanity and decided not to get involved. But Liverpool FC is investigating, saying discrimination will not be tolerated and promising to take ‘appropriate action’. To their enormous credit, Mr Bodi and his partner in prayer Abubakar Bhula are urging restraint. ‘I’ve supported Liverpool for 40 years and I used to be a season ticket holder,’ Mr Bodi said. ‘From what I understand, this guy doesn’t live too far from the ground and is probably a boyhood fan, so I wouldn’t want him excluded from the ground or anything. ‘He should be given a talking to and made to go on an awareness course or educating.’ Why? Most people would agree that labelling the photograph a #DISGRACE was an intemperate over-reaction. But this was a real ‘Oi, Doris!’ moment. You don’t expect to stumble over Muslims praying in a stairwell at a football ground midway through a Cup tie. Quite apart from the safety considerations, even those of us who believe people should be free to practise their religion of choice also believe there is a time and a place. And Scousers go to Anfield to worship at the shrine of Shankly, not Allah or the Almighty. How would the management have reacted if some devout Catholics had decided to stage a holy communion at half-time? Or the queue for the gents’ was obstructed by a conga line of chanting Hare Krishnas? What if a handful of Liverpool fans had turned up at the local mosque and started singing You’ll Never Walk Alone in the middle of Friday prayers? Would their claim to be exercising their democratic right to celebrate their religion stop the Old Bill steaming in and nicking them for ‘hate crime’? What do you think? Mr Bodi seems to be an eminently reasonable and civilised man. What I’d like to ask him would be when, in his four decades of supporting Liverpool, he first started praying during games at Anfield? I may be wrong, but my guess would be that this is a fairly recent phenomenon. As the Muslim population of Britain has grown to three million, Islamic ‘rights’ have become increasingly more assertive. We have de facto Sharia law in some areas of our cities; halal food imposed in schools, hospitals and works’ canteens; and now even gelatine-free halal Pick’n’Mix counters in supermarkets. Over the past decade or so, what we have seen is British society being obliged to bend to the demands of Islam. Such is the contradiction inherent in our State-imposed ‘multiculturalism’ tyranny that more latitude is extended to Muslims than any other group or religion. Look, I’m a supporter of the FA’s anti-racism Kick It Out campaign. Football crowds are gradually becoming more diverse, and not before time. This remarkable photograph from Anfield is evidence of that. The game is awakening to cultural differences. At the League Cup Final in Cardiff a few years ago, they were selling balti pies at the Blackburn end, while knocking out over-priced smoked salmon bagels in the Spurs’ section of the stadium. Someone must have told them Blackburn has one of Britain’s biggest Asian populations and Tottenham has a large number of Jewish supporters. So no stereotyping there, then. Balti pies are one thing. But back to more serious matters. Didn’t it occur to Mr Bodi and Mr Bhula that if the kick-off at Anfield clashed with their religious obligations then perhaps the wisest course of action would simply be to give the game a miss? OK, so there were only two of them this time. But what if next season there’s a dozen, or two dozen, or 200, all expecting the right to pray where they like? Where do you draw the line? At this rate, it won’t be long before Muslim fans start demanding special prayer rooms at football grounds, just as there are already in public buildings and police custody suites. Soon it will become a legal requirement. When it does, remember: you read it here first. A Polish prince, Yanek Zylinski, has challenged Nigel Farage to a duel in London’s Hyde Park, accusing the Ukip leader of stirring up hatred against Eastern European immigrants. Brandishing a sabre, he threw down the gauntlet: ‘Are you up for it, Mr Farage?’ He’ll have to get Farage out of the pub first. Maybe it would be better if he challenged him to a vodka drinking contest. I’d be happy to referee, in exchange for a couple of bottles of Wyborowa. If it’s a duel he’s after, Zylinski should invite Cameron. Dave probably learnt to fence at Eton. Come to think of it, instead of bothering with the campaign, why not a series of Generation Game-style contests to decide the election? William ‘14 pints’ Hague could represent the Tories in the drinking round. Cleggover and Miliband could stage a winner-takes-all bacon sandwich eating competition. And how about a mud-wrestling tournament, involving Theresa May, Harriet Harman, Wee Burney, that Welsh bird and the Aussie madwoman from the Greens? It would certainly beat the hell out of last night’s Leaders’ Debate. Bristols at dawn! Sorry, but I don't agree with Nick . When the BBC’s political editor Nick Robinson went off air in March to be treated for a tumour on his lung, I wished him a speedy recovery. I’m an admirer of Robinson and at the time described him as a beacon of impartiality in a bog of BBC bias. This week he returned, but with such a raspy, whispery voice it was difficult to make out what he was saying. Nick Robinson's eagerness to resume work is understandable, but he should have been told to complete his recovery . His eagerness to resume work is understandable, but he should have been told to complete his recovery. He’s not doing the viewers or, more importantly, himself any favours. It’s like Andy Murray going on to Centre Court with one arm in plaster. Get well, soon, Nick. And don’t worry about the election for now. You’re not missing much. A woman cried rape when her boyfriend found out that she had taken part in a threesome with a married couple, Aberdeen Sheriff Court has been told. But Hannah McWhirter had been a willing participant and exchanged texts with the couple telling them how much she’d enjoyed it. This week she admitted wasting police time and was remanded for reports. Given the bracing weather in Aberdeen, she should have told her boyfriend they were only huddling together to keep warm. Fore! That's a long drive . The day after I wondered why fitness freaks have to wear electronic wrist-bands to monitor their every bodily function, the British Medical Journal published a report claiming health apps are positively harmful — because they convince the ‘worried well’ that there’s something seriously wrong with them. Spooky, or what? You can also get wrist-bands which tell you the distances to the holes on every golf course in Britain. A friend of mine checked his app as he was driving home from a golf tour of Scotland. It told him he was 253 miles from the 18th green at Gleneagles.","Image shows two men praying at half-time during FA Cup clash .

"Societies with less access to food and water are more likely to believe in an all-powerful deity, according to new research. The study uncovered a link between belief in God and other societal characteristics, such as a strong social hierarchy. Scientists suggest that religious beliefs help people cope in inhospitable habitats. A study suggests that societies with less access to food and water are more likely to believe in all-powerful, deities. Here, people carry bags of popcorn through a Christian cemetery, to sell in a shanty town in Lima, Peru . ‘When life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods,’ said Russell Gray, a professor at the University of Auckland and a founding director of the Max Planck Institute for History and the Sciences in Jena, Germany. ‘Prosocial behaviour [actions that help others] maybe helps people do well in harsh or unpredictable environments.’ Together with other experts, he found that communities that believe in a high, controlling God or gods who enforce a moral code, tend to live in politically complex groups with a social hierarchy beyond the local community - and often tend to animals. While the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors, the study by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Centre (Nescent) in Durham, North Carolina, implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological, historical, and cultural factors. ‘When life is tough or when it's uncertain, people believe in big gods,’ said Russell Gray, a professor at the University of Auckland. Here, devotees prepare ritual rice dishes to offer to the Hindu sun god as they attend Pongal celebrations, at a slum in Mumbai . The UK is one of the least religious places in the world, according to a new survey. In a global ranking of 65 countries, the UK came sixth from last, with only 30 per cent of the population calling themselves religious. This compared to 53 per cent who said they were not religious and 13 per cent who are ‘convinced atheists’, with the remaining Britons saying they ‘did not know’. In contrast, 94 per cent of people in Thailand deem themselves religious, with Armenia, Bangladesh, Georgia and Morocco completing the top five, with 93 per cent each. At the bottom of the list was China, where 61 per cent of people are atheists, with only six per cent regarding themselves as religious. It was followed by Japan where just 13 per cent are religious, Sweden with 19 per cent and the Czech Republic on 23 per cent. Globally two-thirds of people consider themselves religious. Those under the age of 34 tend to be more religious than other age groups, the survey by market researcher Win/Gallup International Association found. People without a formal education were also more likely to practice a faith. ‘When researchers discuss the forces that shaped human history, there is considerable disagreement as to whether our behaviour is primarily determined by culture or by the environment,"" said primary author Carlos Botero, of North Carolina State University. ‘We wanted to throw away all preconceived notions regarding these processes and look at all the potential drivers together to see how different aspects of the human experience may have contributed to the behavioural patterns we see today.’ The study, published in PNAS, took into account variables associated with the environment, history, and culture and involved experts in biology, ecology, linguistics, anthropology, and theology. It began when evolutionary ecologist Dr Botero plotted ethnographic data of societies that believe in moralising, high gods and found that their global distribution is quite similar to a map of cooperative breeding in birds. He took the link to mean that ecological factors must play a part in the spread of religion, and another study has recently found a connection between a belief in moralising gods and group cooperation. Professor Gray said: ‘Although some aspects of religion appear maladaptive, the near universal prevalence of religion suggests that there's got to be some adaptive value and by looking at how these things vary ecologically, we get some insight.’ While the emergence of religion has long been explained as a result of either culture or environmental factors, the study  implies that it arises from a mixture of ecological, historical, and cultural factors. Here, Muslims on the outskirts of New Delhi participate in Friday prayers at a slum area during the holy month of Ramadan . The team used historical, social, and ecological data, such as plant growth, rain and temperature, for 583 societies to illustrate the multifaceted relationship between belief in moralising, high gods and external variables. They used the Ethograhic Atlas, which was collated during the last century, to pinpoint communities around the world and access data about religious beliefs, agriculture, and animal husbandry. ‘The goal became not just to look at the ecological variables, but to look at the whole thing. 'Once we accounted for as many other factors as we could, we wanted to see if we could still detect an environmental effect,’ Dr Botero said. ‘The overall picture is that these beliefs are ultimately shaped by a combination of historical, ecological, and social factors.’ Dr Botero believes that this study is just the tip of the iceberg in examining human behaviour from a cross-disciplinary standpoint. The team plans to further their study by exploring the processes that have influenced the evolution of other human behaviours including taboos, circumcision, and the modification of natural habitats. Being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous - a phenomenon known as The Scrooge Effect, after the Dickens character (shown) Being reminded of our own mortality makes us more generous, according to a new study. It also boosts the feeling of pleasure we get from doing a good deed. ‘Acting pro-socially in the face of mortality thoughts effectively soothes death anxiety, and in turn produces psychological satisfaction,’ researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison wrote in a study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. The study builds on the terror management theory, which says that humans deal with our fear of death by believing in an afterlife or devoting our lives to a cause that will live on, Pacific Standard reported. Previous work found that Americans reminded of their own mortaility gave more money to a charity that said it would help people in the country, than one that had an international focus. It suggested that thoughts of death made people strengthen their beliefs - such as allegiance to a religion or country – and is known as The Scrooge Effect. The new study included an experiment, where people were asked to split $8 between themselves and a stranger, while reporting their own satisfaction. Before this, Polish student participants were asked to fill out a survey about death, or dealing with a trip to the dentists, then complete a crossword. The researchers found that volunteers who had previously thought about death gave more money to the stranger and said they felt happier doing it. The experiment seems to bolster The Scrooge Effect and suggests that reinforcing a person’s self-image of being generous, or supporting a cause, are effective ways of managing fear of dying.","Study was conducted by National Evolutionary Synthesis Centre, Durham .

"He is known for being meticulous in his preparations for major tennis tournaments. But when it comes to the biggest event in his life, Andy Murray is happy to take a back seat. The 2013 Wimbledon champion and Olympic gold medalist has revealed he has left the vast majority of planning next week's wedding to his fiancée, Kim Sears. Scroll down for video . Murray will marry long-term girlfriend Kim Sears at Dunblane Cathedral next week - he is pictured as best man at brother Jamie's wedding to Alejandra Gutierrez at the Cromlix House Hotel in 2010 . Murray was presented with a cake to mark his 500th ATP Tour victory cake in Miami this week - for his wedding he has said he was involved in the cake tasting, but has left the majority to his fiancee . Miss Sears, 27, pictured in Miami, has been been entrusted with planning the pair's wedding next week . Murray and Miss Sears, both 27, will tie the knot at Dunblane Cathedral next week, and the tennis star has admitted he 'couldn't care less' about the finer details of the day saying 'I try to stay out of all that sort of stuff'. However Murray, a self-confessed foodie, will have some input for the wedding as he has chosen the menu based on a series of food tasting sessions. In an American interview, the 2012 US Open winner, said: 'I think in a lot of cases it's just better to let the woman have it how she would like. 'In terms of flowers and colour schemes and those sorts of things, I couldn't really care less about that, to be honest. 'The only thing I wanted to do was to be involved with the food. Because I like my food - I like good food. 'I went along and did the food tasting, and I also did the cake tasting as well. So that would be the thing that I would say I have been most involved in.' He added: 'The music is something we chat about together as well.' Miss Sears is in charge of colours schemes and flowers as Murray admits 'he couldn't care less about that' The 27-year-old has been a permanent fixture at the court side since she and Murray started dating in 2005 . Sussex-born Miss Sears, who is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears, met Murray at the US Open in 2005 . The couple have dated since they met in 2005 . Murray and Miss Sears, who have been together for a decade, will wed at the 1000-year old Dunblane Cathedral and not, as anticipated, in the tiny chapel at his Cromlix House Hotel, near the Perthshire town where he grew up. The 12th century cathedral is much larger than the chapel in the grounds of Cromlix, which seats only 28. Murray purchased the 15-bedroom country home for £1.8m in 2013. Thousands are expected to line the streets of Dunblane on the day to celebrate the wedding of their most famous son. Murray attended the primary school in 1996 when gunman Thomas Hamilton killed sixteen children and one teacher in the Dunblane massacre. Murray's uncle Niall Erskine said: 'I'm sure it will be a popular decision, as he's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. 'Andy is looking forward to bringing all his family and friends to Dunblane. I'm sure lots of people will come down to see the cars as they go past and it will be a very popular day.' The cathedral's minister, the Rev Colin Renwick, added: 'There is excitement because there is a great deal of affection for Andy in Dunblane and a great deal of pride in him. I think people are genuinely very pleased for him.' Tom Casey, chair of Discover Dunblane, the organisation which represents the town's traders, said the couple would be 'Dunblane's royalty'. He said: 'A number of shops will be doing individual things to mark the event as they normally do when Andy is playing tennis. 'As a town, we are going to put up some bunting and wedding bows along the high street and decorate the shops with messages. 'Of course we will be making extra efforts to celebrate the wedding of Dunblane's most famous son of modern sense. He is our royalty. 'But it is also important we respect the family's wishes.' Next week's ceremony will take place at the 12th century Dunblane Cathedral (pictured) The reception will then be at Cromlix House (pictured), the five-star 15-bedroom country hotel Murray bought for £1.8million two years ago . The couple announced their engagement in November last year. Breaking with tradition, Murray will have three best men at his wedding, his brother Jamie, close friend and tennis player Ross Hutchins (who recovered from cancer to return to tennis) and former training partner Carlos Mier. It is believed Miss Sears will have four bridesmaids. Murray said: 'The thing for me is it's double standards in a way with the guys and girls because Kim has four bridesmaids and I was saying well, ""why is that fine for you?"" 'Imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends which you've had since you were at school. it's very difficult to chose one. 'She was like, ""Come on, come on, pick one"". I said, ""No, it's difficult, so I think I'm going to have two for sure possibly a third if he can come'."" Murray has previously played best man at Jamie's wedding when he married Alejandra Gutierrez at Cromlix House in 2010, and when Ross Hutchins tied the knot with Lindsay Wood last year. The tennis star roars in celebration after defeating Tomas Berdych in the Miami Open semi final yesterday . In previous interviews on the subject, Murray has said he is not fazed by the prospect of marriage. 'Kim and I had spoken about getting married a lot for the past couple of years but, if you go back a couple of years, we were still only 25. 'We've been together since we were 18. Because we were so young when we started - and we do spend a lot of time apart - it just felt like the right time for both of us.' Sussex-born Miss Sears, who is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears, met Murray at the US Open in 2005. She was once described by future mother-in-law Judy Murray as 'the best thing to happen to Andy'. They split briefly in 2009, before rekindling their relationship. The couple live in Surrey with their two Border terriers, Maggie and Rusty. Back on the court, Murray will face world number one Novak Djokovic in the final of the Miami Open tomorrow. Third seed Murray beat Czech eighth seed Tomas Berdych 6-4 6-4 yesterday to reach the final for a fourth time.","Murray says he has left majority of planning the day to fiancée, Kim Sears .

"Mad Men star Jon Hamm's secret college bullying shame has been exposed by court documents unearthed from the actor's time at the University of Texas at Austin. According to shocking arrest warrants and summons seen by Star magazine, the 44-year-old Golden Globe winner allegedly set fire to one pledge after viciously beating him and using a claw hammer to drag him by his genitals during a hazing ritual gone wrong. The documents claim that Hamm, 44, was eventually charged with assault in connection with the sadistic November 1990 initiation, but he managed to get the charges dismissed before he began his ascent to superstardom. Scroll down for video . College student: Jon Hamm is pictured here in the University of Texas at Austin yearbook for 1990 (left) - the same year he was allegedly involved in a hazing scandal at the Sigma Nu fraternity. The actor is pictured (right) this week . According to the explosive court documents, Hamm was in his sophomore year at UT-Austin when a prospective 21-year-old pledge was called to the Sigma Nu house at 2.30am. When he got there, according to Travis County Court documents, Hamm - who was then aged 20 - and other frat brothers ominously told him, 'It's going to be a long night!' The unidentified junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity. The alleged victim told police that Hamm and other members hit him with a paddle 30 times and then lifted the pledge off the floor by his underwear, 'pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion', causing 'great pain'. The pledged then claimed that Hamm led him to a basement 'Pit' where he slammed the junior's face into the ground while he was doing push-ups and then allegedly stood on his spine with his full weight. Shockingly, after this, Hamm is then supposed to have set fire to the pledge's pants and refused to let him pat the flames down, but instead made him blow them out. Shame: The allegedly assault saw Hamm and seven other frat brothers set fire to a 21-year-old pledge and beat him with a paddle . At the end of the vicious hazing ritual, the pledge was taken to a part of the frat house called the 'Party Room' where Hamm 'hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his genitals and led him by the hammer around the room'. Allegedly not content with this, Hamm then went onto to break into another potential pledge's room that night and subjected him to a similar torturous initiation. However, the morning after, the mother of the first pledge was called to his room to find him 'hiding in a closet at his apartment, his buttocks and legs black with brusises.' Despit pleading with his mother not to go public, saying 'They'll come kill me!', she reported the incident to the police. High school senior: These pictures of Jon Hamm are from 1989, the year he graduated from John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri and one year before his admission to University of Texas at Austin . Early career:  Jon Hamm is pictured here on the 1996 show The Big Date - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident . Huge hit: Man Men and the character of Don Draper has given Jon Hamm his biggest role to date - winning a Golden Globe for his work on the AMC series . Eight warrants were issued for Hamm and seven other frat members, which was shut down for a time after the alleged incident. Three members of Sigma Nu were sentenced to 30 days in prison for the hazing ritual and Hamm was eventually hit with hazing and assault charges in 1991. In the wake of the hazing incident, the Sigma Nu fraternity was shut down in 1990 after the pledge's mother made her son's alleged assault public by going to the police. In 1990, the AP reported that Sigma NU would close and that seven students were being punished after pledges were 'physically and psychologically attacked'. The-then national president of Sigma Nu, James Cherry, said that he was revoking the charter of its UT-Austin, saying, 'Basically, we're out of business on this campus'. 'But our fraternity was founded in opposition to hazing in 1869 and we will not tolerate any form of hazing today.' A warrant was issued for Hamm's arrest in 1992 but the actor reached a plea deal with authorities in 1995 and the charges were dismissed. He returned home to live with his family in Missouri and the actor - who recently emerged from a 30-day stint in a rehab facility - began his acting career. A friend told Star that although shocking, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.' Hazing incident: Following the alleged assault of the 21-year-old pledge, the Sigma Nu fraternity at UT-Austin (pictured) was shut down . Recently, the Mad Men star has admitted that playing the complex role of Don Draper has taken its toll. In an interview he gave just weeks before he checked himself into rehab last month for 30 days, Hamm opened up about the effect that playing Madison Avenue ad man Don Draper had on his psyche. The 44-year-old star told Variety: 'Playing this guy does not come without its own difficulties, it’s not fun to live in this guy’s headspace year after year.' He added: 'People ask, ""What’s the difference between you and Don?"" Look, I drink, I get drunk. I’m not immune to that, . 'And (creator) Matt (Weiner) will tell you, the darkness in Don has not abated, it’s gotten worse year after year. It’s relentless. And it can be hard on you as a person. I love coming to work; I love the people I work with. But it’s been rough.' As he reflected on being offered similar roles and being typecast as the dark, brooding, alcoholic womanizing character, Jon revealed he wants to distance himself from that persona.","Mad Men star was charged with assault for November 1990 hazing incident .

"A healthcare worker who recently returned from West Africa has been taken to a hospital after displaying symptoms which could be the deadly Ebola virus. The unnamed woman has been placed in an isolation ward at Canberra Hospital for treatment on Friday with doctors and nurses wearing full protective clothing. The woman did not treat any cases of the deadly virus where she worked at an Ebola treatment clinic in Liberia before she arrived in Australia on April 5. The woman is being treated in complete isolation with doctors and nurses wearing full protective clothing . Health officials say it's most unlikely she has Ebola and her symptoms - a fever and stomach upset - are consistent with many other conditions. She's being treated in complete isolation in a single room under the hospital's Ebola protocol. Chief medical administrator for ACT Health professor Frank Bowden said this was a precautionary measure with strict protocols to protect the patient, staff and the community. 'We believe that this patient has an extremely low risk of having Ebola,' he told reporters. The woman developed symptoms which could be the deadly Ebola disease after returning from West Africa . The unnamed health worker is in isolation at Canberra Hospital where she is being treated for Ebola . Professor Bowden said it would be 72 hours before her diagnosis was definitely known. He said the community should not be alarmed. 'We are taking every precaution,' he said. 'Here where the patient has an extremely low risk of Ebola, we know there is no risk to the public of Ebola.' Dr Andrew Pengilley, acting ACT chief health officer, said this could be a normal stomach bug, malaria or a viral illness which affected people in West Africa as they did in Australia. 'Ebola is not a particularly transmissible infection under normal circumstances. It's transmitted by direct contact with bodily fluids so we are confident there is no risk to the wider community,' he said.","An ill female health worker is being treated for Ebola on Friday .

"Two women who were part of a group that repeatedly searched Mississippi's capital city for black people to assault were sentenced Thursday to multiple years in federal prison for their role in the 2011 hate killing of 47-year-old James Craig Anderson. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate on Thursday sentenced Shelbie Brooke Richards, 21, of Pearl to eight years in prison on one count each of conspiracy to commit a hate crime and concealing the crime by lying to police. In a separate hearing earlier Thursday, Wingate also sentenced Sarah Adelia Graves, 22, of Crystal Springs to five years in prison for one count of conspiracy to commit a hate crime. Went in search of black men to assault: Shelbie Brooke Richards, 21 (left) was sentenced to 8 years in prison and Sarah Adelia Graves, 22, (left) was given 5 years for their role in the horrific 2011 murder of 47-year-old Jackson, Mississippi man James Craig Anderson . Horrific: Graves and Richards were in the car when a group of white teens drove from their suburban town after a party with the specific intent of assaulting black men in Jackson, which they called 'Jafrica'. James Anderson was one of their victims. He died after being beaten and run over by a truck . Both women were riding in a truck that fatally ran over Anderson in June 2011. Anderson died after being beaten and run over. Both women read letters of apology to Anderson's bereaved family, writes the Clarion-Ledger. 'It was the worst decision of my life,' Richards said as she wept. 'I followed a lot of people with hate in their hearts...and I'm sorry for the actions I didn't take to save Mr. Anderson's life.' Graves told the court she's haunted every day by Anderson's face. 'I was a teenager who partied too much and wanted to fit in with the crowd, and I've asked myself so many times, 'Why was I so afraid?' Graves said. 'I pray that not only God and Mr. Anderson can forgive me, but that his family can one day forgive me.' Their day of sentencing was not that day. Anderson's sister told the girls: . 'You sat, watched, encouraged and rallied around as my brother was beaten...your thirst for the blood of an innocent African American caused you to pour more fuel on the fire.' Hiding their faces: The family of Shelbie Richards hide their faces from photographers outside the federal courthouse in Jackson following Richards' sentencing Thursday . Lost a brother: Anderson's sister Barbara Anderson Young told Richards and Graves in court Thursday, 'You sat, watched, encouraged and rallied around as my brother was beaten...your thirst for the blood of an innocent African American caused you to pour more fuel on the fire' Maximum sentence: Attorney Merrida Coxwell reflects on the sentencing of his client Shelbie Brooke Richards to eight years in prison on one count each of conspiracy to commit a hate crime and concealing the crime by lying to police . Unthinkable: Hotel surveillance video obtained by  media outlets shows a Ford truck back up and then lunge forward at 5:05 a.m. Anderson's shirt is illuminated in the headlights before he disappears under the vehicle next to the curb. Anderson's partner James Bradfield was similarly unforgiving. The days are never the same. Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries...On a sunny day, all I can see is Craig out there working in the yard, trying to do everything he could for his family, and you took his life for no reason,' he said. 'And you didn't want to turn yourself in. You thought you'd get away with it.' Six white men, sentenced earlier by a different judge, received prison terms ranging from four to 50 years for Anderson's death. Two more men await sentencing after Thursday's hearings. Both Richards and Graves have acknowledged that they helped recruit people at a birthday party to take part in the venture that eventually led to Anderson's death in Jackson, which they called 'Jafrica.' Richards admitted that she encouraged Deryl Paul Dedmon to assault Anderson when they arrived in a hotel parking lot, and then yelled a racial slur and encouraged Dedmon to run over Anderson when Dedmon returned to the truck. Hotel surveillance video obtained by The Associated Press and other media outlets shows a Ford truck back up and then lunge forward at 5:05 a.m. Anderson's shirt is illuminated in the headlights before he disappears under the vehicle next to the curb. Richards also acknowledged that later that month she lied to Jackson police detectives about the incident and her participation. The 10 defendants have pleaded guilty to other racially motivated attacks, including the beating of a black man near a Jackson golf course, the beating of another man who tried to sell the suburbanites drugs, attacks on pedestrians using beer bottles and a slingshot, and an attempt to run down another black man. Prosecutors said the suspects usually sought out people who were homeless or drunk. Other than Anderson, the black people who were assaulted have not been identified.

"In a hurry: Katrina Maddox, 23, with baby Edward, who was born in the back of an ambulance . In an unusual twist of fate, described as a 'million to one shot', a young mother has given birth in the back of an ambulance for the second time in as many years after her baby boy was born on the same stretch of busy main road as his brother. Katrina Maddox, 23, pulled off the double against all the odds after having baby Edward on the way to hospital in the early hours of last Thursday. Her second little boy came along on the A47 in Norfolk two years after Mrs Maddox, of North Pickenham, near Swaffham, had her first child Reuben in exactly the same way. The surprised mother said: 'I can't believe it's happened twice! 'I can't imagine there are many people who have both their children like this - it must be a million to one.' Mrs Maddox's labour with her first son, Reuben, was three hours long. The toddler, who is now two, ended up being delivered by his dad, Peter Maddox, 30, in the back of the ambulance as they were driven through North Tuddenham. Little Edward took just 72 minutes to arrive as the ambulance travelled past Longwater Retail Park at Costessey, Norwich. 'I really didn't want it to happen again and I was so adamant I was not going to have Edward in an ambulance,' laughed Mrs Maddox, who is training to be an accountant. 'But then it did get to that point when I realised I was not going to make it to the hospital again. 'At least this time Peter was able to be by my side rather than delivering his son himself.' Mrs Maddox, whose husband is a self-employed forester, added: 'I didn't even know I was in labour with my first son Reuben until I was pushing. 'Peter was an absolute saint and so calm for me. He was the best midwife I could have had. 'Both times everything happened so quickly I didn't even have time to panic or think about it.' This time the couple were at home in bed when Mrs Maddox realised Edward was on his way at about 3am. They knew they did not have time to hang around for Peter's parents to arrive. Luckily, a Good Samaritan neighbour popped in to look after Reuben as he slept upstairs, blissfully unaware of the second great baby drama unfolding. The route: This shows where both Reuben and Edward were born on the A47. Reuben came along near North Tuddenham and Edward as the ambulance travelled past Longwater Retail Park at Costessey, Norwich . Happy family: Edward followed in the footsteps of his brother Reuben (pictured), two, who was delivered by his father Peter Maddox as he and wife Katrina rushed to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital . Mrs Maddox said she had considered it might have been easier to have a midwife go to her, but was told home births were not available in her area. The mum-of-two opted to go to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital instead of Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, as she knows Norwich and the hospital far better. And the couple joke that they are old hands when it comes to registering an 'in transit' birth. Mrs Maddox, who grew up in nearby Saham Toney, said: 'For Reuben they had to put his place of birth as being in transit on the way to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, at North Tuddenham, so I imagine it will be just the same for Edward.'","Katrina Maddox, 23, from Norfolk, said the odds must be 'a million to one'

"The UK is one of the least religious places in the world. In a global ranking of 65 countries, the UK came sixth from last, with only 30 per cent of the population calling themselves religious. This compared to 53 per cent who said they were not religious and 13 per cent who are ‘convinced atheists’, with the remaining Britons saying they ‘did not know’. Britain was sixth from last in a list of the world's most religious countries with only 30 per cent of people practising a faith (file image) In contrast, 94 per cent of people in Thailand deem themselves religious, with Armenia, Bangladesh, Georgia and Morocco completing the top five on 93 per cent each. At the bottom of the list was China, where 61 per cent of people are atheists, with only a meagre 6 per cent regarding themselves as religious. It was followed by Japan where just 13 per cent are religious, Sweden with 19 per cent and the Czech Republic on 23 per cent. Globally two-thirds of people still consider themselves religious. Those under 34 tend to be more religious than other age groups, the survey by market researcher Win/Gallup International Association found. Those without a formal education were also more likely to practise a faith. 'Religion continues to dominate our everyday lives and we see that the total number of people who consider themselves to be religious is actually relatively high,' said Jean-Marc Leger, president of Win/Gallup International Association. 'Furthermore, with the trend of an increasingly religious youth globally, we can assume that the number of people who consider themselves religious will only continue to increase.' The poll  questioned 63,898 people - around 1,000 in each country - at the end of last year. Thailand was the most religious country at 94 per cent.

"An arrest warrant has been issued for disgraced AFL premiership player Ben Cousins after he failed to appear in a Perth court on traffic offences. Cousins, 36, has been on bail and was due to face Fremantle Magistrates Court on Wednesday morning but he did not appear. His lawyer claimed the former West Coast Eagles captain had conflicting medical appointments, and said he had a photograph of the document, but the court requires a hard copy. The magistrate had ordered Cousins to produce written evidence of the conflicting appointments before 4pm WST or an arrest warrant would be issued. Scroll down for video . Ben Cousins, 36, who has a history of substance abuse, has made headlines several times in the past fortnight after a string of alleged incidents .

He was charged with reckless driving, failing to stop and refusing a breath test . Just before 4pm, a spokeswoman at the court confirmed an arrest warrant had been issued. The 2005 Brownlow medallist was arrested on March 11 after allegedly leading police on a low speed chase from Bicton to Mosman Park. He was charged with reckless driving, failing to stop and refusing a breath test. Cousins has twice been hospitalised for mental health assessments following that incvident - the first time after he breached security at an SAS base in Swanbourne. The second time followed seemingly bizarre behaviour in Canning Vale, including climbing on the roof of a house. The former West Coast Eagles captain has not been charged over those incidents. Cousins retired from the AFL in 2010. He was arrested on March 11 after police saw him driving erratically in Bicton and was eventually caught several suburbs away in Mosman Park .

"Few people would describe an 11 hour flight as calming, but British Airways' new Mindfulness Programme is attempting to make long-haul air travel as relaxing and refreshing as possible. The Mindfulness for Travel series was developed for launch of the airline's new Airbus A380 service between London and San Francisco, known for its laid-back California vibes. Providing fliers with meditation techniques, as well as additional healthy flying tips, the programme hopes to inspire a relaxed, positive state of mind for all travellers - even if the journey doesn't go exactly according to plan. To celebrate British Airways' new A380 service between London and San Francisco, the airline has launched a mindfulness programme . The airline consulted with mindfulness expert Mark Coleman, also the Founder of the Mindfulness Institute, to develop the recommended practices. Coleman and British Airways created several videos - tailored to pre-flight, mid-flight, and pre-arrival exercises - which will be available on board for all fliers to view. He recommends wearing comfortable clothing, choosing lighter meals on board, moderating alcohol, coffee and tea intake and 'gentle exercising,' such as stretching, during the flight. Coleman also advocates strategic napping to help travellers adjust to a different time zone and feel revitalised upon landing. Along with healthier meal options, the Mindfulness for Travel series is full of tips to ensure a worry-free flight . The brand also tapped mindfulness expert Mark Coleman to develop a series of meditation videos . Coleman recommends 'gently exercising' on board, eating lighter meals and wearing comfortable clothes . 'Embracing the spirit of travel involves living fully in the moment, which can be cultivated through mindful practice,' Coleman said in a statement. 'The video series I created in partnership with British Airways will help travellers develop the clarity, calm and focus necessary to get the most out of their travel experiences.' While undoubtedly it's a bit easier to stretch out and find your inner zen if you're flying in Club World or First class, we'll try just about anything to help us feel refreshed after long-distance travel.","Mindfulness for Travel series includes meditative videos and other tips .

"A Muslim women's rights advocate and outspoken critic of Islam has championed the U.S. as the best country in the world to live as a  woman and as a black person. Somali-born author Ayaan Hirsi Ali, 45, emigrated to America in 2006 after facing death threats in the Netherlands, where she had been a member of parliament and a target for extremists after renouncing her faith and becoming an atheist. Hirsi Ali, who describes herself as a liberal, has accused her fellow liberals of failing to have a proper sense of perspective about life in the U.S. and for not being more critical of Islam. Muslim women's rights advocate and outspoken critic of Islam Ayaan Hirsi Ali has championed the U.S. as the best country in the world to live as a woman and as a black person . 'We are so blessed as women to live in the United States. The best place to be a woman in the world is in the U.S. The best place to be black in the world is in the U.S.,' she told The Daily Beast. 'Is it perfect? No. Are we confronted with threats? Yes. But it's the perfect place to fight [them] off.' Ali said that the law in the U.S. and the fact that the majority of the population are accepting of differences make it easier for all types of minority groups including woman, black people, gays and Jews. 'I cannot imagine what it is like to be a black man living in Saudi Arabia, in Iran - even where the majority of people are black, like Africa,' she said. 'I cannot imagine a better place to be gay than in the U.S. I know that all European countries have accepted gay marriage and here in the U.S. we're still struggling to accept that. 'On the other hand, when the jihadists in Europe attack gays in the streets, the governments don't protect them. 'The best place to be Jewish in the world, besides the state of Israel, is in the U.S. The best place to be Christian is in the U.S.' Hirsi Ali was raised in a strict Muslim family, but after surviving a civil war, genital mutilation, beatings and an arranged marriage, she renounced the faith in her 30s. Hirsi Ali is married to British historian and public commentator Niall Ferguson, right, who left his wife of sixteen year for the Somali intellectual . Hirsi Ali releases her new book, Heretic: Why Islam Needs A Reformation Now, later this month . In 2007, she helped establish the AHA Foundation, which works to protect and defend the rights of women in the West from oppression justified by religion and culture, according to its website. The foundation also strives to protect basic rights and freedoms of women and girls. This includes control of their own bodies, access to an education and the ability to work outside the home and control their own income, the website says. Hirsi Ali told The Daily Beast that in comparison to the rest of the world woman in the West have little to complain about. 'Listen, if you're not allowed into a golf club, that doesn't sit well with me, but if I were to prioritize, I would say: This girl, she's just been denied her right to school, she's just been forced into marriage, she's just been genitally mutilated. That's the sort of thing that we need to be, as women, signing up against.' Hirsi Ali releases her new book, Heretic: Why Islam Needs A Reformation Now, later this month. The book includes her thoughts on the January shootings in Paris at the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. Her previous books include the best-selling memoir Infidel. She has written and spoken extensively of her experience as a Muslim girl in East Africa. She moved to the Netherlands as a young woman, and she was later elected to the Dutch Parliament. She wrote the screenplay for Submission, a 2004 film critical of the treatment of Muslim women. Shortly after its release, the director, Theo van Gogh, was murdered on an Amsterdam street by a radical Islamist, who also pinned to the victim's body a threat to kill Hirsi Ali. She is married to British historian and public commentator Niall Ferguson, who left his wife of sixteen year for the Somali intellectual. They married in September 2011 and Hirsi Ali gave birth to their son three months later.","Ayaan Hirsi Ali has championed the U.S. as the best country in the world to live as a woman and as a black person .

"Muslim communities in parts of Britain have a 'cultural problem' where they view women as commodities to be abused, according to the Culture Secretary. Sajid Javid declared some values prevalent in certain Asian communities were 'totally unacceptable in British society'. His comments come after inquiries into the sexual abuse of vulnerable girls targeted by Asian men in Rochdale, Rotherham and Oxford found that the authorities had failed to protect them. Sajid Javid declared some values prevalent in certain Asian communities were 'totally unacceptable in British society' Mr Javid told the Daily Telegraph a 'misplaced sense of political correctness' prevented police and social workers from properly investigating claims of abuse. Mr Javid said: 'Well, first of all the perpetrators were disproportionately Asian Muslim men, and I absolutely think there has been a misplaced sense of political correctness that prevented authorities, whether social workers or police, from properly investigating what was going on. 'If we are to learn proper lessons from this, we have to look at the cultural side of some communities in Britain and see why it is that in some communities there are men that have a view of women that is completely unacceptable in modern British society. Why do they have such a low value of women that they see them as commodities to be abused?' The Tory minister said the authorities had to 'get to the bottom of this' and emphasised that 'we have to look at the cultural aspects of it'. The Tory minister's comments come after inquiries into the sexual abuse of vulnerable girls targeted by Asian men in Rochdale, Rotherham and Oxford found that the authorities had failed to protect them . He urged Asian communities to look into 'what might be going on that we don't know about'. Mr Javid said: 'We can no longer be held back in any sense by political correctness. 'I know plenty of people, British Muslims, men and women, who would 100 per cent agree with that, not only out of a sense of shame but also because of the fear of what else might be going on. Some of the values that certain people in some communities have, in their attitudes to women or on the question of freedom of expression, are just totally unacceptable in British society. 'We do no one any favours when we don't investigate or talk about them.' Mr Javid revealed in a speech to the Union of Jewish Students in 2014 that he had experienced racism at school. He said he was called a 'Paki' by a classmate. He said: 'I did what any cool, calm future Cabinet minister would do. I hit him. And then he hit me, and I hit him back and things sort of went downhill from there.' Mr Javid, whose background is remarkably different to many of his colleagues, has been tipped as a future Tory leader. His parents came to Britain from Pakistan in 1961.

"The Duchess of Cambridge has the power to send sales of high-street designs sky-rocketing, so it's little surprise that her offspring have the same effect.

Style and brand expert Nick Ede added: 'It’s refreshing to see that he’s not too trendy he’s just the perfect English gent. The George effect is due to him wearing clothes that are not designer labels but are wearable, affordable, on-trend colours and perfect for the royal spotlight. 'A style icon is someone who creates a trend and with his nautical stripes, dungarees and baby grows with royal blue piping he certainly doing that.' And dressing baby sons around the world is clearly popular - the young royal even has his own style blog, What Prince George Wore, dedicated to all things baby style. But while the Duchess of Cambridge might still be a dab hand at selling out whatever she wears, even she cannot compete with her son when it comes to sheer selling power. From £44.95 swaddling wraps to knitted tank tops, the royal baby effect shows no sign of petering out - much to the excitement of childrenswear designers and eBay entrepreneurs contemplating another year of buoyant sales to come.

EXCLUSIVE: Hilary Clinton and husband Bill go for a stroll  while holding hands in a park in Chappaqua, New York. The aspiring leader of the free world and her husband were spotted wearing blue ball caps - Hillary's bearing the Clinton Foundation logo - and matching dark blue polo shirts as they soaked in the sun . CHECK-UP: The Scooby vans had made the 1,000 miles trip back from Iowa since Hillary flew home commercial last week . SPARKLING: The secret of keeping the Scooby fleet immaculate is regular washing . TUNE-UP: Clinton's presidential campaign prepared to hit the road again on Saturday, taking the two armored Scooby vans to a car shop for inspection . Mrs. Clinton will hit the campaign trail again today in New Hampshire, where she'll hold a round table at a family-owned business this afternoon . Clinton is seen here on Saturday, walking with her Secret Service agent. She's currently on a two-day swing through the Granite State . Clinton starts the second leg of her endeavor to win the vote of 'everyday' Americans on the heels of a news report showing she makes more money for an hour's worth of work than the country's top CEOs. The former secretary of state was banking $300,000 for paid appearances before she ditched the speaking circuit for an offensive on the White House. The average CEO's hourly rate is $54,213, the Washington Examiner, pointed out. She makes more on the days she's paid a premium to give remarks than big wigs of the likes of Ralph Lauren, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners co-founder Richard Kinder and former Vornado president and CEO Michael Fascitelli. Taken in the context of a full work week, though, Clinton's rate drops far below what corporate heads are hauling in. She receives checks for just over a tenth of what America's highest paid CEO, John Hammergren of medical supply company McKesson Corporation, earns in a week. Bill joined her for the outing and walked alongside her with his Secret Service agent . First Scooby tour: Vans made return trip after Hillary left on Wednesday and were in Chappaqua on Saturday . A multimillionaire who has spent the better part of the last two and a half decades living in Washington, D.C. and New York, Clinton has struggled to shed her image as an up-tight politician who cares more about winning the keys to the kingdom, so to speak, than she does boosting blue collar workers. The negative connotations kept Clinton her from beating Barack Obama in 2008 and already threatening to wreck her second attempt at the nation's highest elected office. While driving with one of her aides from New York to Iowa for a first round of campaigning last week, the two women stopped off at Chipotle for lunch. They work dark sunglasses, kept quiet and went unrecognized. It took security camera footage to prove they were ever there.

"You might think seemingly endless sales would be guaranteed to tempt shoppers through the door. But high street retailers are boosting their fortunes – by scrapping them. Debenhams and Mothercare have called a halt to long-running promotions which fail to excite shoppers, replacing them with shorter events that have more impact. And both have announced revived figures since making the change. Experts claim prolonged sales can devalue products and encourage shoppers to delay buying an item until it is reduced. High street chains, including Mothercare, are calling time on cut-price promotions that seem to go on forever . Figures show a third of all fashion purchases are now made in a sale or promotion, and there have been warnings that shoppers are being ‘trained’ not to buy at full price, undermining profits. In the past, retail analysts mocked Debenhams for being ‘Never Knowingly Not On Sale’ – a pun on the John Lewis slogan ‘Never Knowingly Undersold’. Now, the department store has reduced its endless blue cross sales and promotions, which it admitted sometimes ‘create noise but don’t create value’. Debenhams said that despite fewer sale events, feedback suggests customers now think the store is actually better value. The move follows similar cuts to the number of supermarket promotions. Sainsbury’s recently dropped some of its popular offers – including three for £10 on some meat and fish products – in favour of lower prices on more everyday items. In the past year, Debenhams has held 39 fewer sale days, meaning it spent a month less in a promotional period. It has also put more emphasis on ensuring pre-sale garments are ‘better value’ and that the ‘first price is the right price’, cutting the cost of some menswear, womenswear and home goods. Debenhams said despite fewer sale events, feedback suggests customers now think the store is better value . Chief executive Michael Sharp said: ‘It’s not about ending promotions, but being more focused and removing events that create noise but don’t create value.’ Mothercare also expressed a desire last year to return to being a ‘full price retailer’. Chief executive Mark Newton Jones said this week: ‘In the UK, our strategy of reducing promotional and discount activity and returning to be a full price retailer has continued to stabilise margin.’ Its latest Christmas period sales lasted three weeks instead of an incredible eight weeks in 2013-14. Diane Wehrle, of retail analysts Springboard, said: ‘There is a strong argument that the more sales you hold, the more you have to hold. Consumers get used to the store always being in sale and hold out from shopping there until the next one.’ Neil Saunders, of retail analysts Conlumino, added: ‘The model of continual discounting is damaging for a retailer, not least because it erodes margins and dissuades shoppers from purchasing at full price. ‘It’s like a drug – the more a retailer does it, the more they have to keep doing it to generate a sales hit. ‘In some ways, unless it is part of a specific business model, constant discounting is a sign of failure.’","Debenhams and Mothercare have called a halt to long-running promotions .

"Mothers and babies have been banned from special screenings at an independent cinema after staff became fed up with clearing away dirty nappies and oversized prams. The manager of The Rex Cinema in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, cancelled the regular Tuesday baby matinees due to a combination of 'whingeing, bitching, snitching and the law'. James Hannaway, who restored and reopened the traditional cinema in 2004, announced the decision on the company's website. Scroll down for video . Ban: James Hannaway, manager of Rex Cinema in Berkhamsted, has banned babies from special screenings . He explained that the special screenings, which were introduced in 2007 after complaints over babies being allowed to all matinees, were to allow parents to enjoy adult films with their children. Mr Hannaway said he was fed up with the whingeing from those attending the screenings without babies, even though they declared they 'might contain babies'. 'Rex staff have enjoyed collecting still-warm nappies from under tables, and who put up with difficult first time mothers with armoured tanks (prams) and a not always helpful attitude as they spread everything from the tank everywhere,' he said. And Mr Hannaway also claimed that the cinema has been forced to reconsider over the ratings on the Tuesday films. He said: 'Those who threatened us with the authorities if little-faces turn up in prams for a 15 certificate. Clearly babies of 0 to six months are under 15. 'Thank you for such moral vigilance. There's only so much whingeing, bitching and snitching from all sides one can take. Eight years of it is enough.' Screenings: He says he has cancelled the baby matinees (stock image) due to 'whingeing, bitching, snitching and the law' The issue had been picked up by members of the public, including Teresa Boad, who wrote on social media that she had 'complained about this a few years ago'. Some have been left disappointed by the ban, blaming other parents. Gillian Walters said: 'Shame how some spoil it for others leaving dirty nappies under tables is disgusting.' Clare Ball posted on the cinema's Facebook page: 'Very, very, very sad to see Tuesday matinee times have changed to 2pm, see you in a few years when I no longer have school runs in the afternoon.' The 1930s original Art Deco cinema has one screen in its proscenium and was described by Visit the Chilterns tourist site as 'possibly Britain's most beautiful cinema'. It opened on May 9, 1938, with Heidi starring Shirley Temple and in the early 1970s the balcony was boxed off to create two screens in the upper circle. The proscenium was soon closed and turned into a bingo hall while films still played in the smaller upstairs screen. On February 28, 1988, the cinema was closed and it would be 30 years before a film would be projected onto the screen. Beautiful: The 1930s original Art Deco cinema has one screen in its proscenium and was described by Visit the Chilterns tourist site as 'possibly Britain's most beautiful cinema' After its revival in 2004, complete with large, comfy seats and a full wine and snack menu, it has received great plaudits and opens with new titles most days and nights. The cinema claims to follow a simple formula involving 'civilised and enticing surroundings' with a 'warm atmosphere'. They also boast of cheap tickets and don't sell popcorn or hotdogs. Downstairs, in the stalls, are big red, swivel chairs at small, round, candlelit tables, with white tablecloths to the floor. Guest speakers over the years have included Martin Freeman, Imelda Saunton and Judy Dench among dozens of other familiar faces. From April babies are banned for, among other things, being under age. Not an easy decision. Here’s why: Matinees included babies from the outset in 2005. The experiment proved difficult, too many complaints. so late in 2007 we had to restrict babies to Tuesdays only. It was included in the programme for young mums & dads to enjoy their first six months of bewilderment with a popular grown-up film at the Rex. Here, for a few short hours, they could be reminded that the world they had left was still here. It became, a meeting place, an escape into the latest films everybody (else) was talking about. Now, due to a combination of whingeing, bitching, snitching and the law, it is over. Whingeing: some without babies, upstairs would rarely miss the chance to complain, even though Tuesdays matinees declare 'might contain babies' and DO, DOES, DID! Bitching: as above but with the added missionary misery of Rex staff, who have enjoyed collecting still-warm nappies from under tables, and who put up with difficult first time mothers with armoured tanks (prams) and a not always helpful attitude as they spread everything from the tank, everywhere. Snitching: Those who threatened us with the Authorities if little-faces turn up in prams for a 15 certificate. Clearly babies 0to6 months are under 15. Thank you for such moral vigilance. There’s only so much whingeing bitching and snitching from all sides, one can take. Eight years of it is enough. Finally, the Law, with little to resemble intelligence, decrees: only 12A, PG, U Certs with little or no adult bite, can be screened when babies are present. Sorry babies and parents your time is up. However, Saturday kids matinees are always under Certificate 15. So providing you can resist all of the headings above, take your warm nappies etc home, and leave the tanks outside, you’re welcome. All matinees will start at 2pm.","Manager of Rex Cinema in Berkhamsted cancelled regular baby matinees .

"Nine council workers have been sacked for inappropriately accessing confidential social work files on tragic toddler Mikaeel Kular. The three-year-old was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya, who beat him for being sick and left him to die in agony for three days before hiding his body in a suitcase and dumping it in woods. She then told police the boy had wandered off, sparking a huge manhunt before eventually leading officers to the body near Kirkcaldy in Fife, in January last year. Scroll down for video . Victim: Fife council workers looked at Mikaeel Kular's (left) confidential files after he was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya (right) Police Scotland probed the claims and an internal investigation was launched by Fife Council last year when up to 25 staff were alleged to have accessed confidential social work files belonging to the youngster. It has now been revealed at least nine workers were subject to disciplinary action and subsequently dismissed after looking at documents relating to the high-profile case without permission. Adekoya, who had frequently left her children home alone to go to nightclubs and take cocaine, was jailed for 11 years in August last year but could be free within seven. She repeatedly beat her son before putting his lifeless body in a suitcase and leaving it in woodland behind her sister's home. Investigations found her internet history included searches 'I find it hard to love my son', 'I love all of my children except one', 'why am I so aggressive with my son' and 'get rid of bruises'. Five thousand local residents signed a petition protesting against the failure of prosecutors to pursue a murder charge against her. Social services were also widely criticised for failing Mikaeel after it emerged he was twice taken into care by social workers. At the time of the trial, the court was told how Fife social services monitored Adekoya and her young family until December 2013 – the month before Mikaeel's death. Tragic: Scores of tributes were left near to the youngster's home in Edinburgh following a massive search to find him . Grim discovery: The three-year-old's body was found in woodland behind his auntie's house in Fife . However, Adekoya was not on the radar of social workers in Edinburgh, despite having moved to the Scottish capital. Craig Munro, Executive Director of Education and Children's Services at Fife council said: . 'We have a clear internal process for dealing with discipline issues and we don't comment publicly on the individual circumstances of staff.' A seperate investigation into whether Mikaeel's death could have been prevented is due to be published in a matter of weeks. Police Scotland said they would not be taking the matter further. A spokesman said: 'No criminal complaint had been made so we consider it an internal matter for Fife Council.'","Fife Council launched internal investigation following accusations .

"Hundreds of passengers on a New York City subway train were evacuated from cars in an underwater tunnel after a fire during the Monday morning commute. A train heading from Queens into Manhattan was stalled underneath the East River around 8.30am Monday morning and its conductor saw smoke coming from the board along the track's third rail. The train's 542 passengers were taken by a rescue train to Grand Central Station in Manhattan, an MTA spokesman told Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video .

"The International Space Station is to have an Italian espresso maker so astronauts can have a break from instant coffee to 'boost spirits' SpaceX is scheduled to launch its unmanned rocket with the espresso maker — and 4,000 pounds of food, science research and other equipment — on Monday afternoon. The experimental espresso machine is intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. Scroll down for video . This undated image shows a prototype of Lavazza and Argotec's 'ISSpresso' machine. The final version will be the first real Italian espresso machine on The International Space Station . On Monday a version of the coffee maker is scheduled for launch to the International Space Station aboard a supply capsule which will also include 4,000 pounds of food, science research and other equipment . It was supposed to arrive in January, shortly after her arrival, so she could get some relief from the station's instant coffee. But it ended up on the back burner after a station shipment from Virginia was lost in a launch explosion. The espresso machine was originally intended for astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy so she could get a break from the station's instant coffee . The espresso maker is dubbed ISSpresso — ISS standing for International Space Station. Italian coffee giant Lavazza joined forces with the Turin-based engineering company Argotec and the Italian Space Agency to provide a specially designed machine for use off the planet. NASA certified its safety. It is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity on the ISS, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth. It uses a 'capsule system' to fill plastic pouches with espresso and other hot drinks such as tea. The machine can also be used to rehydrate food. In order to handle liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space environment, the plastic tubing inside the normal coffee machines has been replaced with a steel tubes designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar. The ISSpresso machine uses a standard coffee capsule, which is posted in the top of the machine. Water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated. The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' The ISSpresso machine is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on earth . Hovering up to 270 miles (435 km) above the Earth, the International Space Station (pictured) is a long way from home and astronauts have reported missing creature comforts such as coffee and beer . Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. The machine is much heavier than a normal model, which typically weighs 29lbs (13kg). The space-bound machine weighs around 44lbs (20kg) because there are backups of all the critical components, for safety reasons, and in accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the ISA. NASA's space station program deputy manager, Dan Hartman, said it's all part of making astronauts feel at home as they spend months — and even up to a year — in orbit. Already, Mission Control gives astronauts full access to email, phone calls, private video hookups, and live news and sports broadcasts.

The granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch, which is securely fastened to the machine using a 'rapid coupling/uncoupling system.' Astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw. 'The psychological support is very, very important,' Hartman told reporters on Sunday. He continued: 'If an espresso machine comes back and we get a lot of great comments from the crew... It's kind of like the ice cream thing, right, when we fly ice cream every now and then. 'It's just to boost spirits. Maybe some rough day, a scoop of ice cream gets them over that hump kind of thing.' The SpaceX Dragon supply ship also holds experiments for NASA's one-year space station resident Scott Kelly, who moved in a couple weeks ago. Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko also will remain on board until March 2016. This will be the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. For the third time, SpaceX will attempt to land its leftover booster vertically on an ocean barge. Both previous tests failed. Improvements to the first-stage booster and floating platform — based on lessons learned from the January and February attempts — should boost the odds of success this time to 75 per cent or maybe 80 per cent, said Hans Koenigsmann, vice president of mission assurance for SpaceX. SpaceX's billionaire founder Elon Musk wants to save time and money by reusing the boosters normally discarded in the Atlantic. In fact, the company is transforming a former missile-launching site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station into a landing pad for its revolutionary flyback boosters. Monday's launch time is 4.33pm. Forecasters put the odds of good weather at 60 per cent. Once the coffee is brewed, it's dispensed in a pouch, which astronauts drink straight from using a straw .","The espresso maker, named the ISSpresso maker after the International Space Station, is set for lift off on Monday .

"This is the brilliant young honors student who was brutalized by Mad Men star Jon Hamm in a sadistic fraternity hazing ritual. Seen here for the first time, Mark Allen Sanders was beaten with a paddle, dragged around a room by his genitals and had his pants set on fire. Golden Globe winner Hamm was one of seven Sigma Nu brothers who tormented and humiliated Sanders when he was a young pledge at the University of Texas at Austin. The young man was hit so hard during the warped 1990 initiation that he suffered a fractured spine and nearly lost a kidney. Scroll down for video . Hazing hell: Today Mark Sanders is a doctor and lawyer in Fort Worth Texas. But after he graduated high school  in 1988 he entered the University of Texas at Austin and pledged the Sigma Nu fraternity. That's when he met John Hamm and his hazing hell began . Football hero: Jon Hamm the year he graduated from John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri and one year before his admission to University of Texas at Austin . Partners: Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt attended the ""Girls"" season four series premiere after party at The Museum of Natural History on January 5, 2015 in New York City. Sanders subsequently withdrew from the university and sought counselling to cope with the shameful episode which resulted in a police inquiry and the fraternity chapter being disbanded. Hamm, a sophomore, was identified as a ringleader and arrested in 1993, long before he became one of America's most recognizable actors playing boozy advertising exec Don Draper. An assault charge was dismissed, however, and he completed a period of probation instead of receiving a conviction for hazing. Our exclusive photos show Sanders in his senior year at Richland High School in North Richland Hills, Texas where he excelled in his studies, played for the basketball team and was treasurer of the school council. Despite his ordeal at UT he was able to resume his education at Texas Christian University, before going to further institutions to study both law and medicine. The 45-year-old lives now with his wife Anada, 41, and their two children in Fort Worth, where he works both as a doctor and an attorney specializing in medical malpractice and personal injury. He has declined to speak publicly about his ordeal but the harrowing details are laid bare in court documents dating back more than two decades. In a 1991 interview transcript obtained by Daily Mail Online, Sanders tells investigators with the Travis County's Attorney's Office how he suffered 'repeated beatings and assaults' at the hands of Sigma Nu 'actives'. He also alleged that he and his fellow pledges were subjected to 'repeated confinements' in a series of tiny compartments carved into the frat building's foundations - including 'the pit', 'the hole' and 'the grave'. Sanders listed Hamm as one of his chief tormentors, recalling how the future star ordered him to recite a six-page list of phrases pledges are told to memorize called the 'bulls*** list' When Sanders forgot the last of Hamm's nicknames, which included MC Hammer and Young Bobby, he recalled how Hamm got ""mad, I mean really mad' Sanders told officials the worst of the hazing happened in the early hours of November 10, 1990 when he was summoned to the house and warned by Hamm: 'It’s going to be a long night.' The junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity. Mark Sanders in his 1988 high school yearbook from Richland High School in North Richland Hills . He listed Hamm as one of his chief tormentors, recalling how the future star ordered him to recite a six-page list of phrases pledges are told to memorize called the 'bulls*** list'. When he forgot the last of Hamm's nicknames, which included MC Hammer and Young Bobby, he recalled how Hamm got ""mad, I mean really mad'. Hamm and his frat cohorts' retribution was to spank Sanders repeatedly with a paddle. 'I'm hurting bad, I mean being hit right where the kidney is, it's killing me,' Sanders told his interviewers. Hamm and another fraternity member then lifted Sanders up by his underwear, pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion. 'I don't know how far underwear stretches, I don't know how far I was off the ground,' he recalled. 'I was hurting really bad and I remember I was looking up at the ceiling and I was gritting my teeth and squinting my eyes ... it was sawing and it was hurting.' Sanders told investigators how Hamm then led him to 'the pit' where he ordered him to do press-ups and pushed his face into the ground. The distraught pledge felt someone, possibly Hamm, standing on his back. Hamm is then supposed to have set fire to Sanders' pants and refused to let him pat the flames down, instead making him blow them out. Finally he was led upstairs to the 'party room' when Hamm hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his testicles and pulled him around the room 'for at least a minute'. Suave Don Draper has had to his own dark past on the hit show Mad Men. But for Jon Hamm, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident,' said a friend . Despite his ordeal, Sanders was able to resume his education at Texas Christian University, before going to further institutions to study both law and medicine. The 45-year-old lives now with his wife  in Fort Worth, where he works both as a doctor and an attorney specializing in medical malpractice and personal injury . In the wake of the hazing, Sanders fled to a friend's room to escape further brutality before eventually showing his bruises to fellow students. He later claimed to have suffered nerve damage to his ribs, kidney spasms and a lineal spinal fracture . Sanders' horrified mother Margaret reported it to UT authorities, triggering a police investigation and prompting the fraternity to permanently close its UT chapter. University records show Hamm, now aged 44, left the college at the end of the semester without a degree and returned to his hometown in Missouri. Sanders later launched a lawsuit against Sigma Nu seeking 'unspecified actual and exemplary damages for willful and wanton misconduct'. It was dismissed with the agreement of both parties, however, in 1993, possibly signalling that an out-of-court settlement had been reached. That same year Hamm was arrested by the Austin Police Department but court documents show that in 1995 he received deferred adjudication, allowing him to avoid a criminal conviction by serving a period of probation. His hazing shame went unreported for two decades until Star magazine broke the story last week in the midst of the final Mad Men season airing on AMC. Hamm is yet to comment but a friend told Star: 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.' Shame: The allegedly assault saw Hamm and seven other frat brothers set fire to the pledge and beat him with a paddle . Early career: Jon Hamm is pictured here on the 1996 show The Big Date - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident . Three Sigma Nu members also pleaded no contest to charges of hazing, a misdemeanor, and were ordered to serve 15 to 30 days in jail. They were subsequently allowed to complete a community service or work-release program instead. Another member was convicted of a lesser hazing violation and fined $500. Sander's attorney, Bill Whitehurst, did not return calls asking for comment. A warrant was issued for Hamm's arrest in 1992 but the actor reached a plea deal with authorities in 1995 and the charges were dismissed. He returned home to live with his family in Missouri and the actor - who recently emerged from a 30-day stint in a rehab facility - began his acting career. A friend told Star that although shocking, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.'

"A host of the nation’s favourite stars have been announced to perform at a concert to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day. Status Quo, Katherine Jenkins and West End star Elaine Paige will perform at the event. It is set to be one of the highlights of a three-day commemoration of the end of the Second World War, running from Friday, May 8 to Sunday, May 10. Concert: Status Quo will perform at the event marking the 70th anniversary of VE Day. Members Rick Parfitt (pictured left) and Francis Rossi (right) Katherine Jenkins will be West End star Elaine Paige, boy band Blue, R&B singer Jamelia, pop star Pixie Lott, jazz vocalist Gregory Porter and tenor Alfie Boe . Other stars include boy band Blue, R&B singer Jamelia, pop star Pixie Lott, jazz vocalist Gregory Porter and tenor Alfie Boe. The 1940s-themed concert will take place on Saturday 9 and will be broadcast on BBC1, hosted by Chris Evans. The singers will be joined by four Strictly Come Dancing couples and readings from Pointless host Alexander Armstrong and Absolutely Fabulous actress Jane Horrocks. The extensive commemoration is a victory for the Daily Mail which highlighted growing concerns that the anniversary risked being overshadowed by the election on May 7. Singer Dame Vera Lynn, the 98-year-old Forces’ Sweetheart, was among those who called on the Government to do more to mark the occasion. It is likely to be the last major anniversary which will be attended in strength by the generation that fought at home and abroad during the war. David Cameron asked Cabinet minister William Hague in February to draw up plans for three days of national commemorations and last month Chancellor George Osborne earmarked up to £2million in the Budget towards marking the event. The timing of the anniversary makes it even more of an extraordinary occasion, starting the day after a general election which is likely to result in another hung Parliament. The 1940s-themed concert will also include readings from Pointless host Alexander Armstrong (left) and Absolutely Fabulous actress Jane Horrocks (right) Ministers and their shadows are likely to gather for celebrations not knowing for sure who will be in power of the country after coalition negotiations. The three-day commemoration will begin with a Service of Remembrance on VE Day (May 8) at The Cenotaph and a national two-minute silence at 3pm, marking the moment Winston Churchill broadcast his historic speech formally announcing the end of the war in 1945. A chain of more 100 beacons will be lit across the country in the evening. Ahead of the star-studded concert on the Saturday, sports fans will honour the day with clapping and singing during fixtures and cathedrals are encouraged to ring their bells in celebration at 11am. On the Sunday there will be a Service of Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey attended by The Queen, followed by a parade to St James’s Park, where the Royal British Legion will host a lunch reception for 2,000 veterans. People across the country are encouraged to host street parties and deck out homes and community halls with bunting to recreate the celebrations of 70 years ago.

"A Washington television reporter had to duck for cover during his live broadcast when he was stung by bees after a truck carrying millions of them overturned on Friday morning. Jeff Dubois of KIRO, struggled to get through his report without swatting and waving his hands around as the bees buzzed around Interstate 5. 'Ay yiy yiy! They're flying all over the place,' a panicked Dubois says. 'It's unnerving, to tell you the truth.' During the unexpectedly dangerous report, cameraman Damien Glitch was stung more than 20 times. Scroll Down for Videos . Ouch: Jeff Dubois swats away one of the hundreds of bees that swarmed around him and his cameraman on Friday morning in Washington . 'They were pissed off,' Dubois told the Daily News. 'It was probably the wildest live report I can remember. You're trying to maintain composure, make sense on TV and not get stung by thousands of bees swarming around your head.' All the while Dubois was reporting live, tens of white-suited bee-keepers rushed to save as many of the insects as they could. The truck had just merged onto Interstate 5 around 3:30 a.m. when it tipped on its side, dumping its load of 448 hives, or about 13.7 million bees, Washington State Patrol Trooper Travis Shearer said. The driver, a 36-year-old man from Idaho, was not hurt. The company that owns the insects, Belleville Honey and Beekeeping Supply of Burlington, sent beekeepers to recover as many as possible, and bees covered their protective suits as they worked. Calmer: Dubois and his cameraman moved to safer distance away from the crash and were not bothered by the bees . Millions of bees: Beekeepers attend to a semi-trailer truck that overturned with a cargo of bees on a highway . Aftermath: Bee keepers inspect hives after a semi-truck rolled over early Friday spilling a load of honeybees on the Interstate 5 median . Rush to save the bees: Workers clean up after a semi truck filled with over 400 behives overturned on Interstate 5 . Formulating a plan: Bee keepers stand next to a semi-truck that rolled on Friday morning releasing millions of bees . Bee keepers try to salvage some of the bee hives that were dumped when a semi-truck rolled on Friday . Everywhere: Bees swarm onto a beekeepers truck along northbound Interstate 5 after the crash on Friday morning released them . The bees became more active as the sun rose and the weather warmed, and firefighters had to spray a layer of foam on some of the boxes, killing the insects for safety. Many of the hives were still along the highway more than seven hours after the accident, when a front-end loader began scooping them up and dumping them into a dump truck, Shearer said. The majority of the hives had been crushed. 'I'm sure they'll take that somewhere and try to save as many as they can, but they can do that someplace safer, away from the I-5 corridor,' he said. The bees were being transported from Sunnyside, in central Washington, to a blueberry farm in Lynden, a city near the Canadian border about 100 miles north of Seattle, Shearer said. The company that owns the insects sent beekeepers to recover as many as possible before the firefighters drowned them with foam .

The bees became more active as the sun rose and the weather warmed, and firefighters had to spray a layer of foam on some of the boxes, killing the insects for safety . First responders and reporters alike swatted at the bees as they tried to do their jobs. 'I think everybody there got stung,' Shearer said. Seattle television station KIRO posted a video compilation of its on-scene reporter swatting the insects as he reported on the accident. Shearer urged drivers to keep their windows up and to '(hash)beesafe when traveling through that area,' as he wrote on Twitter. A man who answered the phone at the beekeeping company said he couldn't immediately answer any questions related to the accident.","Jeff Dubois of KIRO was stung during broadcast from site of crash .

"The Queen has spent a second day enjoying the spring sunshine in Windsor Great Park this week. Her Majesty, who is approaching her 89th birthday, was spotted riding her faithful black Fell pony, Carltonlima Emma, as she was joined by Lord Vestey and her Head Groom Terry Pendry in the beautiful park close to her Windsor Castle home on Monday. She was well prepared for any spring showers in a lightweight waterproof, and, as is her wont, eschewed a helmet in favour of one of her silk scarves. Scroll down for video . Outing: The Queen has spent a second day enjoying the spring sunshine in Windsor Great Park this week . On Thursday the Monarch was seen trotting through the park again with Pendry as the sunshine lit up the blooming flora. Today's second riding partner, Lord Vestry, is a close friend of the Royal Family and also the Queen's Master of the Horse, regularly photographed with the Monarch at equestrian events and important ceremonial occasions. The multi-millionaire, 72, is one of Britain's richest men thanks to the Vestey family's estimated £750million fortune through the family meat business, Vestey Foods Group. Active: Her Majesty, who is approaching her 89th birthday, was spotted riding her faithful black Fell pony, Carltonlima Emma . Park life: The Queen was joined by Lord Vestey and her Head Groom Terry Pendry . Whilst Lord Vestry and Pendry wore hard hats for the ride, the Queen wore only a light, floral headscarf. She finished the look with some pale jodphurs and deep, brown riding boots. Despite being encouraged to use a riding helmet in the past the Queen has reportedly never worn one because of her hair. Speaking in an interview last year, her racing trainer Ian Balding recalled the moment he asked why the monarch never wears a riding hat. The Queen is said to have replied: 'I never have and you don’t have to have your hair done like I do.' Her Majesty is famous for her love of horses and first found herself in the saddle at the age of four after being presented with a Shetland pony, named Peggy, aged four. Since then, the royal stables have been home to a succession of steeds, among them Betsy, a black farm-bred horse who was her mount of choice in the 50's, and Surprise, a grey gelding whom the Queen famously galloped down the course at Ascot in 1961. No helmet: The Queen, pictured here on Friday, never wears a riding helmet preferring instead to ride in a silk headscarf . Cutting back: She has ridden less in recent years as a result of a niggling knee injury . Recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over Trooping the Colour on horseback. Nevertheless, the Queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and, according to sources, is a familiar sight at her Windsor stables. She is also said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. Along with her thoroughbred race horses, the Queen also breeds Fell ponies and has a stud specialising in Highland ponies at Balmoral. First love: The Queen's first pony was a tiny Shetland named Peggy who was given to her at the age of four . Familiar sight: The Queen riding her much-loved horse Burmese during Trooping the Colour . Seal of approval: A Fell pony foal similar to those being bred by the Queen at Hampton Court . One of the oldest equine breeds on the planet, Fell ponies like the Queen's mount Carltonlima Emma, have roamed the moors of Cumbria since the Neolithic period. Docile, hardy and thick-set, the majority of Fell ponies are black, grey or bay and measure between 13 and 14hh. Highly prized by the Carvetii, the Iron Age tribe who occupied the region more than two millennia ago, the ponies later caught the eye of the invading Romans and were used as trade goods all over the Empire. The Romans also helped develop the breed into the relatively large animal it is today. Originally thought to have stood around 12hh tall (similar to Dartmoor and Exmoor ponies), by the end of the Roman period, the average Fell was more than a hand higher. Another invader to fall in love with the Fell pony was the Vikings, who used the animals as pack ponies; a use continued by the Normans. By the 13th century, the Fell's usefulness as a pack animal was well-established and the pony played an important role in British trade until the end of the 18th century. Following the Industrial Revolution, Fells were used to transport iron ore and coal from mine to town, as well as underground when the height of the shaft allowed. Although previously used in trotting races, the Fell pony really came into its as a riding horse in the 1950s, when its gentle nature and pretty looks made it the pony of choice for families. Today, the pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages, among them the Queen who breeds Fell ponies at her Hampton Court stud.

"From a man obsessed with looking like Kim Kardashian to a woman who had cement injected into her face, reality TV’s favorite doctors are back to taking on some of the world’s most shocking plastic surgeries gone wrong. Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif, the resident experts on the popular E! series Botched, which is due to begin its second season tonight, spoke to Cosmopolitan.com about the 'jaw-dropping' cases they were faced with while filming the upcoming season of the show, explaining that many of the various cosmetic blunders featured go beyond anything either of them had ever been faced with before. 'These cases are not found in any textbook,' Dr Dubrow said. 'You can't call any surgeon and say, ""Have you ever seen this?"" because no one has ever seen this.' Scroll down for video . Dynamic duo: Dr Paul Nassif (L) and Dr Terry Dubrow (R) are back to taking on plastic surgery gone wrong on the second season of the E! reality show Botched, which premieres tonight . Regrettable decision: One of their clients this season, Rajee Rajindra Narinesingh (pictured), had her face injected with 'cement' at an underground cosmetic filler party . He added that, not only are these seemingly unrepairable surgeries shocking, but they are made even more astonishing by the fact that he and Dr Nassif 'have to do something' to help these patients – even it seems at times as though nothing can help to repair the damage that has been done. During the interview, the duo, who have seen their fair share of cosmetic disasters, also stressed that cosmetic procedures are 'as serious as brain surgery' - which is one of the reasons why there are so many terrible outcomes. Dr Dubrow, who said that he and Dr Nassif were 'floored' by 60per cent of the surgeries they had to fix this season, noted that the show's producers had to give them time to figure out what they were going to do before they proceeded with a client's surgery so that they could come up with an effective means of fixing the often horrifying mistakes made by other plastic surgeons. He explained that he started this season by putting the cases in the photo section of his cell phone and every morning he would wake up, look at them and ask himself: 'How can I make this possible?' He referred to this season as a 'David and Goliath' story because the problems they came across were so impossible to face. Barbie world: Justin Jedlica, who is known as Human Ken, stops by the office to meet with Dr Dubrow . One of their patients this season, Rajee Rajindra Narinesingh, received black market injections from a self-proclaimed ‘physician’ who had her face filled with cement at a 'pumping party'. Dr Nassif said that Rajee, who is transgender, underwent the controversial – and incredibly dangerous – procedure 'an underground party where people get injections of black market product'. The unknown 'fillers' can be anything from non-medical grade silicone to food products to even caulking used for the bathtub, and Dr Nassif noted that people performing these risky procedures are not professionals - they are rarely even physicians. And the results are often disastrous. 'Once you have something put in your body, you're screwed,' she said. 'I obviously don't want to use that word, ""You're screwed,"" but you're permanently ruined.' Reality star: Jordan James Parke (pictured) has spent more than $100,000 on plastic surgery to make him look more like his idol Kim Kardashian . Dr Nassif added: 'You can't reverse it most of the time. People say, ""Oh, it's no big deal, go get some fillers!"" Wrong. Incorrect. Be careful.' Other times the outcomes can even be deadly. 'The chances that it could go south, that you could have a complication is real and it's more than one per cent,' he said. The doctors also acknowledged that there is a 'circus act component' to the show, particularly when they are dealing with patients who are obsessed with looking like human dolls or their favorite celebrities, including Jordan James Parke, who has spent thousands to look like Kim Kardashian. While they don't want to help people become 'famous internet freaks', Dr Dubrow explained that it is important for them to fix the patient's surgical problem because 'they still deserve the right to be back in society normally'. Costly obsession: This woman says she has had 300 cosmetic procedures . Seeking perfection: This man said his nose has been 'chopped up more than ahi tuna' before he visited the show's doctors . And giving people that opportunity is a part of what makes the show so rewarding. According to Dr Dubrow, the patients featured on the series have often been 'turned down by every good plastic surgeon in the nation', so he and Dr Nassif are often their 'last hope'. They even had patient this season who went homeless because of trying to correct a botched surgery. 'If we don't use our experience, our education, our training on them, some numbskull with no experience and no education or training is going to try and it's going to get worse,' he said. On tonight's premiere of the show, the doctors are trying to help former reality star Tiffany 'New York' Pollard from VH1 series I Love New York fix her sagging breasts. The doctors will also treat former Baywatch star Nicole Eggert and musician Guillermo Eiland from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, among others, this season.

"The fashion designer who created Qantas uniforms modelled by Miranda Kerr will now turn his talents to redesigning the attire for the airline's pilots. Melbourne-born, Paris-based Martin Grant will refresh the uniforms worn by Qantas' domestic and international pilots which have not been changed for more than a decade. A key focus of the redesign will be the female uniform, with CEO Alan Joyce saying there are an increasing number of women joining the ranks of Qantas pilots. Melbourne-born, Paris-based designer Martin Grant (centre) will refresh the uniforms worn by Qantas' domestic and international pilots. He is pictured here with crew wearing the current dress . The fashion designer also created new Qantas uniforms for cabin crew in 2013, modelled by Miranda Kerr . The Qantas uniform has evolved considerably since the 1930s (left). Pictured right is a pilot in the 1980s . 'A key part of the design process will be asking our pilots what they would like to see in the new design,' Mr Joyce said. 'It's important that our crew feel proud to wear the Qantas uniform around the world, every day. 'They represent the national carrier so we want them to feel confident and comfortable sitting in the flight deck, standing in the cabin or walking through an airport.' Mr Grant – who has more than 30 years' experience working as a in the fashion industry – will spend time talking to pilots, travelling with them and sitting in a flight simulator before he begins to design the new uniforms. 'Early feedback from Qantas pilots is that they want to retain the traditional image but give it a modern makeover to be more elegant and more wearable,' he said. This image was taken in 1935, when the first international services between Brisbane and Singapore began. Qantas pilots first wore a khaki military-style tunic . The uniforms had a nautical style in 1938 before reverting back military style khaki uniforms in WWII (pictured) The crews who flew between Perth and Sri Lanka were over enemy patrolled territory for much of the journey and it was thought that military uniforms would better protect crew if captured . 'The female pilots are also hoping for a more feminine line so I will have that front of mind when I begin the design stage.' Qantas Chief Pilot Richard Tobiano said comfort and durability were important to pilots, who spend up to 16 hours in the cockpit at a time. The new uniforms are expected to be rolled out next year. Mr Grant will take inspiration from historical Qantas uniforms, which have evolved considerably since the 1930s. In the 1950s (pictured) pilots wore nautical-style jackets and trouser with white caps . The uniform for the iconic Australian airline kept a similar design during the 1960s . In this promotional image from 1965 a Qantas pilot can be seen posing with a female passenger . Qantas pilots first wore a khaki military-style tunic when the first international services between Brisbane and Singapore began in 1935. The uniforms took on a more nautical theme before reverting back to a military khaki design during the Second World War. Pilots wore a 'mid-blue' colour in the 1970s, before uniforms became nautical again in 1980. Australian label George Gross and Harry Who designed uniforms featuring a navy jacket and trousers in 1993. The last time the uniform was redesigned was in 2003 by Australian designer Peter Morrisey. In the 1970s a a mid-blue uniform was introduced, reflecting broader style trends of brighter colours at the time . In this black and white photo from the 1970s four Qantas pilots can bee seen organising paperwork . In the 1980s Qantas pilot uniforms changed back to the traditional nautical style in 1980.

"The shocking moment cyclists dodged the safety barriers at a level crossing to race through the path of a speeding train has been caught on camera. During the Paris-Roubaix race - Sir Bradley Wiggins' last for Team Sky - competitors approached a crossing over a train track. But as the barriers came down to signal a train was passing through, the racers can be seen swerving to avoid them in a desperate attempt to gain seconds on their rivals - and putting their lives at risk. Scroll down for video . Cyclists weave and dodge the safety barriers to gain precious seconds on the race, despite the oncoming train . A tired looking Sir Bradley Wiggins sits in the Roubaix Velodrome after coming 18th in his final race for Sky . A cyclist nips across the track in spite of the police warning - and seconds before a train passes through . The racers are still on the edge of their seats as they wait for the train to pass and level crossings to rise . A policeman on a motorbike pulls up to take charge of the situation and stop more cyclists risking their safety for the race - yet another three daredevils slip past him and onto the crossing. Mere seconds later a TGV rushes along the train tracks. BBC sports commentator Rob Hayles said the competitors had had a close shave. 'This could have ended in disaster. You could see riders nipping across but that train wasn't slowing down', he said. Around 85km into the race, the cyclists desperately try to cross the traintracks before the barriers descend . Sir Bradley Wiggins took part in the race - renowned for its demanding route - for the last time for Team Sky . Cyclists who did cross the rail-tracks could yet be disqualified from the race, as they are expressly banned from crossing a level crossing when the barriers are down. The one-day road race, which runs from Compiègne, 50 miles outside Paris, to the northern town of Roubaix, was won by German cyclist John Degenkolb. The race is known for its challenging 254km route, which includes 27 cobbled sections and level crossings. It was the last time British Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins would compete for Team Sky, and told their official site before the race it was a great way to finish. Riding in his final race for Team Sky, the Olympic and World time-trial champion failed to win the prestigious Paris-Roubaix one-day race . 'It's probably the only race other than the Tour de France where riders plug on to get to the finish. he said. 'Even if I've been dropped or crashed, I'll ride on with a broken collarbone just to come into the velodrome as it's my last race. No other race would be like that.' During the race his teammate Geriant Thomas - who managed to avoid the level crossing incident - suffered a puncture. It was a fitting end for Wiggins, who was among the first riders to join Team Sky for its inaugural season in 2010 . Mathias Hamar shared the competition rules on Twitter - stating that it is 'strictly forbidden' for cyclists to cross level crossing. Offending riders should be disqualified from the competition, the rules add . 'Riders plug on to get to the finish', Sir Wiggins said before the race - where cyclists risked life and limb to cross a closed level crossing and beat the pack.

"A New York woman has worn the same ensemble to work every day for three years. Matilda Kahl, an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi, wears the exact same ‘uniform’ – an outfit made up of black trousers, white shirt and a custom leather rosette – every single day because, as she explains to DailyMail.com: 'When at work, I want to be judged on my work and my work only.' In an article for Harper's Bazaar, Matilda explained that the unique sartorial idea came to her after a particularly stressful morning when, with 'a fairly important meeting on the horizon' she began trying on a variety outfits to no satisfaction. Scroll down for video . Empowering: Saatchi & Saatchi art director Matilda Kahl has got everyone talking about her everyday work 'uniform' 'I'm given complete freedom over what I wear to the office, but that still left me questioning each piece that I added or subtracted from my outfit,' she wrote. '[I kept thinking], ""Is this too formal? Is that too out there? Is this dress too short?"" I finally chose something I regretted as soon as I hit the subway platform.' Arriving at her meeting late, frazzled and wearing an inside-out sweater, while her male colleagues and new boss looked relaxed and at-ease, left her feeling frustrated and wondering why she'd bothered with the stress of it at all. 'I knew my male colleagues were taken seriously no matter what they wore - and I highly doubted they put in as much sartorial time and effort as I had,' she writes. 'But gender issues aside, I needed to come up with a solution to simplify this morning struggle.' Vowing to never let herself feel that way again, Matilda made the decision to make the same simple, easy wardrobe choices as many of her male colleagues did, wearing the same outfit each and every day, thereby eliminating the seemingly endless struggle to determine what to wear. Simple, yet effective: Matilda achieved her look by buying blouses in bulk and pairing them only with black trousers . She found her sartorial salvation in the form of 15 identical white silk blouses and several pairs of simple black trousers. For a 'personal touch' she added a custom-made leather rosette in homage to her mother, who used to love putting bows in her hair. She also throws on a black blazer for the chillier days. 'I’ve always thought black and white looks stylish, so it was a pretty easy decision on the color,' she explains to Daily Mail Online, adding that she took her time deciding on the exact designs. 'I finally fell for the white shirt for its diagonal button line and the cuts in the sleeves. 'New York gets really hot in the summer, so as an alternative to the 6 pants I bought 2 matte black skirts. Simple and sweet.' With her identical every day look, Matilda is following in the footsteps of many high-powered individuals, from Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg - who says he owns 20 identical grey t-shirts for work. All tied up: Matilda tops off her look with a simple black leather bow, which she calls her 'personal touch' inspired by her mother's affinity for bows in her hair . But despite many people trying out the trend before her, Matilda admitted that she faced 'mixed reactions' to her new uniform idea from her co-workers. She was asked if she had lost a bet, joined a cult and some even assumed she was too destitute to afford other work clothing. But when confronted with endless questions about her new look, she shot back with: 'Have you ever set up a bill for online auto-pay? Did it feel good to have one less thing to deal with every month?' Many critics also wonder: why doesn't she just choose her outfit the night before? 'To me, that would only move the problem to another time of day, not really solving it,' she says. 'It would just make me go to bed later and lose valuable sleep. 'Nor would it solve the pressure of constantly feeling that I have to express my creative ability through my way of dressing, which is something I feel relieved from now with the uniform.' According to Matilda, the criticism has done nothing but reassure her of her choices. 'People have really put it to the test, and I’m happy to say the more questions I get the more sure I become of that I’m happy with my choice of wearing a uniform,' she explains. All in all, Matilda is immensely pleased with her decision, saying it has saved her huge amounts of money– and also removed a source of stress from her life completely. She also claims it has given her a new sense of control. Coming up to three years in her look, Matilda doesn't see herself stopping anytime soon - but insists that if the mood strikes her, she could go back to planning her daily wardrobe. 'I still feel like it does a good job for me so I see no reason for stopping wearing the uniform,' she says. 'But if I would wake up one day and feel like start spending time on picking out an outfit every morning, I’d no problem with giving it up. The uniform is here for me, I’m not here for the uniform.' She does however admit that she has had to re-stock her collection of white shirts - because the 15 that she bought originally have become so worn out that she is no longer able to wear them. 'They are all exactly the same and have been for almost three years, up until a week ago,' she added to Harper's Bazaar. 'The shirts had gotten worn out, others stained....So last weekend I spent two days on a rather intense hunt for a new hero shirt. I finally found it at Zara.'","Matilda Kahl, an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi, owns 15 of the same white shirt and several pairs of plain black trousers .

"The return of Game of Thrones has sparked a surge in internet piracy with fans making more than 100,000 illegal downloads per day. More than seven million episodes from seasons one to four were illegally downloaded between February and April this year as fans of the hit HBO show caught up or re-capped before its eagerly-return on Sky Atlantic on Sunday night. Figures by anti-piracy and security firm Irdeto revealed overall illegal downloading of show is up 45 per cent year-on-year, jumping from 4.9 million  for the same two-month period in 2014. Popular: Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen in the first series of the hit show. New figures reveal it is the most illegally downloaded show in the world . The top country for illegal downloads of Game of Thrones episodes was Brazil, which accounted for almost one million of them, followed by France in second, the US, Canada and the UK. The snapshot also revealed the top five TV shows illegally downloaded during the same period were period were The Walking Dead (5.7m), Breaking Bad (3.8m), Vikings (3.4m) and House of Cards (2.7m). Worldwide following: There were seven million illegal downloads of Game of Thrones, which features Natalie Dormer as Margaery Tyrel above, . Appeal: Fans of the hit HBO show have been rushing to download old episodes featuring Jack Gleeson as King Joffrey, left, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister, right . Lack of access for global audiences is used as a defence of pirates, as many of their favourite films and shows that debut in the US are delayed by weeks or months. So to make it easier for people to watch legally, HBO announced in March that the forthcoming season will air across 170 countries at the same time. This week the cable network also launched a new internet streaming service, HBO Now, in an attempt to curb piracy and recapture revenue, although it is only available in the US. The return of Game of Thrones, starring Nathalie Emmanuel as Missandei, above, has sparked a surge in internet piracy with fans making more than 100,000 illegal downloads per day . 'Piracy is a tidal wave that cannot be controlled, only managed,' said Irdeto in its report.

"Walter Scott was jailed in 1987 on a charge of assault and battery, it has been revealed. A report released by the Charleston County Sheriff's Department on Friday says deputies responded to a call about a fight between Scott and another man. When deputies told the two to break it up, the report states, Scott began shouting obscenities at the other man as well as a deputy before shoving the officer. Scott suffered a cut and was treated at a local hospital before being transported to the jail. The disposition of the case was not immediately known. Previous: Walter Scott was jailed in 1987 after shouting obscenities at a man and pushing a deputy . The news comes as another excessive force complaint, as well as a lawsuit, is filed against Michael Slager stemming from his time on the North Charleston Police Department. Slager is the white officer fired this week after being charged with murder in the shooting death of a black man that was captured in a dramatic video. Two years ago, a man said Slager used his stun gun against him without reason. On Friday, a Charleston County man came forward alleging that Slager did the same thing to him during a traffic stop last year. Justin Wilson's suit says that when he was pulled over by police Aug. 24, he produced a valid Georgia driver's license but was placed under arrest for having a suspended South Carolina license. The suit alleges that Wilson was pulled from his vehicle, forced to the ground and then, although he was cooperating with authorities, Slager shot him with his Taser. Wilson's lawyer said he would release a statement next week. The historic details are unraveling amid an ongoing investigation into Scott's fatal shooting on Saturday. No warrant had been issued for Walter Scott's arrest when he ran from Officer Michael Slager moments before he was shot dead. Court records show he was $7,500 behind on child support when he was pulled over on Saturday and had already been jailed three times for missing payments. His family believe the fear of being thrown back in prison was the reason he tried to flee during the deadly traffic stop. But there was nothing directing officers to bring him in to face a family court judge, despite the fact his last payment was only in 2012. Escape: Dashcam footage released on Thursday shows Walter Scott running away from his car minutes before he is shot dead by Officer Michael Sager. His family believed he fled over fears he would be arrested for being behind on child support payments . History: Scott had already been jailed three times over missed payments, but court records have revealed there was no warrant out for his arrest when he was pulled over. Minutes later he was shot dead . In 2008, after a traffic stop in which he was charged with an open-container violation and driving under suspension, he was sent to jail in Charleston for six months for failing to pay about $6,800. In 2011, bench warrants ordered deputies to bring him in, and Scott spent a night in jail when he was $7,500 behind. In 2012, he spent another night in jail when he owed $3,500. On Thursday a police dashboard camera video released Thursday shows Scott bolting from his Mercedes after he pulled over. The camera on Slager's patrol car captures him telling Scott his third brake light is broken, before asking him to produce insurance papers. Scott, who appears to be accompanied by a person in the passenger seat, explains he does not have any documents as he has yet to officially buy the car. 'I haven't bought it yet, I'm about to do that Monday.... My car is down,' he says. The officer appears calm, checks his licence, then tells him: 'I'll be right back with you.' When Slager returns to his vehicle, Scott flees, running towards the park where he would die moments later. Off camera, a scuffle can be heard, with shouts of 'Taser, Taser, Taser!' and 'Get on the ground!' Slager's account has been called into question after a shocking video taken by a witness shows the officer shooting Scott in the back. In the dash cam footage, captured from Slager's patrol car, the officer explains, 'The reason I've pulled you over is because your third brakelight is out.' The conversation is muffled, with music playing in Slager's car obscuring the sound. Horrifying: Scott was gunned down as he ran away from Sager, who has since been charged with his murder . Killing: Walter Scott, left, was killed by Michael Slager, right. Scott was in the Coast Guard for two years, and is pictured left in uniform. Slager is being held in jail on murder charges, and is pictured right in his prison mugshot . He can be heard asking Scott for his licence, registration and insurance card. Scott responds that he doesn't have papers as he has not yet to bought the car. 'Alright let me see your licence,' Slager replies. 'So you don't have any papers in the glove pocket?' Scott repeats that he does not and he is paying for the car on Monday. Slager returns to his car. A minute later, Scott opens the door, and gestures to Slager, who shouts, 'you've got to stay in the car!' Scott then sits back inside the car - and moments later flees. The only other footage of the incident shows the moment Scott was shot. Released earlier this week, it begins in the vacant lot apparently moments after Slager fires his Taser. Wires which administer the electrical current appear to be extending from Scott's body. As Scott turns to run, Slager draws his pistol and, only when he is 15 to 20 feet away, starts to fire the first of the eight shots at his back. The video shows Slager handcuffing Scott's lifeless body.","Walter Scott shouted obscenities at a man and pushed a deputy, was jailed .

"A couple in their 40s became unusual victims of age discrimination after their bank rejected a £250,000 mortgage application because it deemed the husband to be too old. HSBC was ordered to pay them compensation after the banking industry watchdog found it ‘relied on untested assumptions, stereotypes or generalisations in respect of age’ in the case. The banking giant was criticised for refusing to grant the £250,000 loan because the husband would have been over 65 when the 18-year-deal finished, according to The Sunday Times. A couple in their 40s became unusual victims of age discrimination after HSBC rejected a £250,000 mortgage application because it deemed the husband to be too old . In the first case of its kind, the Financial Ombudsman Service found the lender guilty of being ‘unfair’. HSBC was ordered to pay £500 to the couple for their ‘distress and inconvenience’ over the ‘unfair application of its age policy’, and was told to reconsider their loan application. Bosses at the bank defended their decision and argued it was ‘entitled to apply a maximum age policy’, according to ombudsman documents seen by the newspaper. But the ombudsman said: ‘The bank relied on untested assumptions, stereotypes or generalisations in respect of age.’ The couple, who do not wish to be named, applied for the joint interest-only mortgage over 18 years on their home, in which they held substantial equity. HSBC had issued a decision in principle, indicating that they would be prepared to lend the money, but it then refused to proceed due to the husband’s age. The husband, however, does not plan to retire at 65 and his final salary pension would be large enough to cover the monthly repayments. He also has pension pots and his wife would have been able to pay the loan from her income alone, if necessary. The couple complained and claimed they had been victims of discrimination. The complaint was upheld by the ombudsman - the first time it has done so specifically on the grounds of age for a mortgage. HSBC said its decision was based on its age restrictions for interest-only loans, a type of mortgage that allows borrowers to pay off the interest but none of the capital. HSBC was ordered to pay £500 to the couple for their ‘distress and inconvenience’ over the ‘unfair application of its age policy’, and was told to reconsider their loan application . The bank – like many other lenders - has tightened its criteria, and does not offer interest-only loans with a term beyond a borrower’s 65th birthday. For repayment mortgages, the age ceiling is 75. The bank told The Sunday Times: ‘As a responsible lender, we need to ensure our customers’ ability to repay their mortgage. ‘With interest-only lending we also need to understand how a customer will repay the capital when the mortgage matures. ‘Regulatory requirements to show responsible lending and the repayment vehicles associated with interest-only loans have become more stringent since this application was made. ‘It’s important to stress that when we look at a mortgage application we take a number of different factors into account, which includes assessing each customer’s individual circumstances.’ The ombudsman’s decision offers hope for borrowers who have struggled to get mortgages due to strict policies on age and income.","HSBC was ordered to pay £500 to couple for ‘distress and inconvenience’

"Two warring sisters were yesterday stripped of the right to control their aged mother’s fortune because of the intensity of the hatred between them. The hostility between the women – one a 61-year-old retired GP and the other a 58-year-old radiographer – meant they would never be able to make rational decisions about how to deal with the 97-year-old widow’s property, a judge said. Senior Judge Denzil Lush said the elder sister could be jailed for attempting to alter a legal document, so she could gain greater control over her mother’s money. The mother, who has dementia, lives in a care home in Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire. She owns a £600,000 house, has savings and shares worth £100,000, and has an income of £1,200 a month. The Court of Protection case was brought by the Office of the Public Guardian (pictured) - the regulator of agreements for people without capacity . The judge said both sisters were unsuitable to control her affairs ‘because of the intense acrimony between them’. Instead he appointed a court deputy to carry out this role. The ruling was made in the secretive Court of Protection in which hearings are routinely closed to the public. The judge ordered that none of the family be named. Senior Judge Lush said the ‘daughters don’t see eye to eye. In fact, they detest each other.’ According to the GP, the judge said, ‘the two of them have been in the same room together on five occasions during the last five years, and on each occasion her sister has refused point blank either to speak to her or even acknowledge her presence. The only communication between them is by email, and this is usually rancorous in tone.’ The disastrous relationship between the two sisters and their failure to handle their mother’s affairs as she slipped into dementia were revealed in a ruling by the secretive Court of Protection. The sisters agreed with their mother in 2007 that they should draw up an agreement to control her money and property if she became unable to do so herself. The mother, a widow since 1984, owns a house in Marlow worth between £550,000 and £600,000, savings and shares worth about £100,000, and has an income of around £1,200 a month. Since suffering from dementia she has lived in a care home in Stoke Mandeville that costs £940 a week. However, the sisters have rowed over their mother’s care. The dispute has involved the younger sister, the radiographer, objecting to her elder sibling’s choice of care home - which is a two-hour journey away from her own house. It has also involved an accusation from the GP that her younger sibling only visits their mother once a week or once a fortnight. The document drawn up by the sisters in 2007 to control their mother’s affairs - an Enduring Power of Attorney - was put into effect in 2013. Since suffering from dementia the mother has lived in a care home in Stoke Mandeville (pictured) costing £940 a week . But Senior Judge Lush said that at some stage the elder sister had attempted to alter the document. She attempted to change the attorneys’ appointment from ‘joint’ to ‘joint and several’. It meant that the doctor could take decisions on her own about the money, without reference to her sister. The judge added that when she registered the new document the GP ‘knew that this statement was false.’ The Court of Protection case was brought by the Office of the Public Guardian - the regulator of agreements for people without capacity. The OPG told the court that there were no witnesses to the alteration of the document. Judge Lush said there were criminal penalties for dishonestly tampering with an Enduring Power of Attorney . Laura Knight of the OPG told the court that ‘it is more difficult to believe that a professional person with the responsibilities of the GP would misunderstand the difference in appointment types’. Miss Knight added that the GP said that her late aunt had agreed that the document should be changed, but ‘while this seems plausible, it is alarming to see an attempt by reasonably educated people at amending an important legal document without any witnessing being attempted or legal advice being taken.’ Judge Lush said there were criminal penalties for dishonestly tampering with an Enduring Power of Attorney. He said the punishments could run up to two years in jail but any charges were a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service. He added that he thought prosecution would not be in the interests of the mother, who would be caused ‘significant distress’. The judge said of the doctor: ‘Notwithstanding the natural love and affection between them and the undoubted support she has provided to her mother in recent years, I find her unsuitable to be the donor’s attorney.’","Sisters, one 61 and the other 58, unable to agree because of  mutual hatred .

"A Nebraska man has found an innovative way to make his Craigslist ad stand out by shooting a commercial for the car he is trying to sell. Django Greenblatt-Seay, 33, said he decided to make the video for the 2002 Ford Taurus, which he is selling for $3,000, because he thought it would help spike people's interest. 'While the 2002 Ford Taurus is a fine car, it's not exactly exciting with just a couple of photos on Craigslist on its own,' he told the Daily Mail Online. 'I thought I would add a little flair to it, plus I was bored on a Sunday.' Django Greenblatt-Seay, 33, made a Craigslist ad for his 2002 Ford Taurus stand out by filming a commercial for the car he is selling for $3,000 . Greenblatt-Seay used a drone to film this cinematic overhead shot at Hummel Park in Omaha, Nebraska . The video begins from far overhead, showcasing the silver car as just a speck among the vast expanse of trees at Hummel Park in Omaha, Nebraska. Greenblatt-Seay used his drone, a DJI Inspire 1 model, to capture the cinematic effect before dramatically zooming in on the car's tires, headlights, dashboard and seats like a classic car commercial. Perhaps the best effect of the ad is that it is soundtracked with an old-fashioned 1987 Ford Taurus commercial. In the video, Greenblatt-Seay  sometimes interjects the audio with a dubbed voice over to make the information relevant to his 2002-model car. 'This is Ford Taurus the sensation (used) car that's getting all the rave reviews,' the booming announcer's voice begins as Greenblatt-Seay interrupts. 'For its design innovations, its high technology, the way it handles and rides,' it continues. 'If you haven't driven Taurus, see your (Craigslist ad) right away,' the commercial ends, replacing 'Ford dealer' to advertise Greenblatt-Seay's post, before the final line: . 'He's got one now, with your name on it'. Greenblatt-Seay said he picked the 1987 ad because it made his girlfriend Cora (pictured together) laugh the hardest . The ad is soundtracked with an old-fashioned 1987 Ford Taurus commercial, which Greenblatt-Seay sometimes interjects with a dubbed voice over to make the information relevant to the 2002 car . Greenblatt-Seay, who shot the ad over the weekend and posted it on Monday, said he first got the idea to make a commercial for his car after seeing another person do a well-done ad for their Nissan Ultima. But he said he didn't want to 'completely rip off that guy's idea', so he decided to put his own spin on the concept by searching for Ford Taurus commercials on YouTube. Greenblatt-Seay said he picked the 1987 ad because it made his girlfriend Cora laugh the hardest. Cora gave Greenblatt-Seay the Ford Taurus, one of his two vehicles, in exchange for a 2008 Suzuki so that he could sell the car and use the money to buy an 'adventure van'. Greenblatt-Seay, who works as the manager of video communications at the Union Pacific Railroad, is hoping to use the van to go on trips and pursue one of his major passions, taking time lapse videos of the night sky.

"A U.S. father who enlisted the help of social media users to record a message for his son from the tooth fairy - whom the youngster believes is from Australia - has thanked the man who answered his appeal. Jacob Hall invented the ruse that the tooth fairy lived thousands of kilometres away  Down Under for his seven-year-old son, Evan, when he was late paying up the last time around. Father-of-three Jeff Pyrotek, from Seymour in Victoria, answered Mr Hall's call for help and uploaded his finished product on SoundCloud. Scroll down for audio . Jacob Hall, from Iowa, asked Australian redditors to make a recording from the tooth fairy for his son, Evan . Mr Hall, from Iowa, said his son was 'totally overjoyed' with the message. 'My son woke up this morning and found a reply to his letter saying ""Evan, thank you for leaving me another tooth. I left something special for you on dad's phone"",' Mr Hall said. 'He burst into my room and woke me up at 6am of course, frantically explaining to me that I have to check my phone because the tooth fairy told him so.' Mr Hall told Daily Mail Australia Evan had not stopped talking about his 'Australian tooth fairy' ever since this happened. He added he was 'so humbled' by the overwhelming response he had received. 'Initially, I hoped to get one or two responses to my request, but the outpouring of kind words and support from the [Australia subreddit] community was unbelievable,' Mr Hall said. Evan (pictured with dad Jacob), 7, believes the tooth fairy is from Australia because once the fabled creature was 'a little late' in coming to leave money for the child in exchange for his tooth . Jeff Pyrotek, from Seymour in Victoria, made the message for the little boy named Evan on the request of Mr Hall . Mr Hall said Evan believed the tooth fairy was from Down Under, so the U.S. father had to enlist the help of an Australian to compose the message. Mr Hall said his son had not stopped talking about his 'Australian tooth fairy' ever since this happened . 'The only problem was that last time he lost a tooth, the tooth fairy showed up a day late... so I told him his tooth fairy had to travel from Australia, and sometimes that can take a while,' he said. The man behind the recording told Daily Mail Australia he wanted to make Evan's day by recording the message. 'I was doing someone a favour and spreading love around the world,' Mr Pyrotek said. 'If I can make a child's life a bit happier and more magical, I'll do it. Children are the future of the world. 'It took five minutes of work that could make a kids day. It felt good doing it.' Mr Hall's post, which he uploaded under the psuedonym SafetySecond, has attracted more than 100 comments in less than 24 hours after social media users weighed in on what the message for Evan should be. He said his seven-year-old son wrote letters to the tooth fairy and he wanted to do something to 'really put a smile' on Evan's face. One redditor Captain A**ehole suggested: 'G'day little fella. Thanks fer wroitin' moi another great letter. All the teeth yer leave me are real shoiny, they're beaut. 'I know yer have a few teeth ter lose, but it won't be a problem for a little battler like yerself. 'Gotta get back down under now, me hubby is about ter run outta tinnies and strewth we wouldn't want that would we. Hooroo mate!'

'Have to head back down to the missus now; but I'll see your little mug again in no time.' But Mr Pyrotek settled on a message with less Australian slang. 'Hi Evan, thanks for writing me another great letter,' he is heard reciting in a broad Australian accent. 'All the teeth that you leave me are so shiny. I know you still have a few teeth to lose but that won't be a problem for a tough boy like you. 'I have to get back home to Australia now but I will talk to you again soon. Don't forget to brush your teeth. 'Thank you from the tooth fairy. By the way my name’s really Bruce.'

"Sister Gertrud Tiefenbacher (not pictured) was found in her bedroom, with a towel on her face . An 86-year-old nun was reportedly gang-raped before being murdered in her bedroom at a South African missionary. Gertrud Tiefenbacher's hands had been tied with a typewriter cord and a towel placed over a face, say local police. Her body was found by other nuns at the Sacred Heart Missionary in Ixopo, a small town 85 miles south-west of Durban. Police in KwaZulu-Natal are waiting for the results of forensic tests to confirm that Sister Gertrud was sexually assaulted. They say she was suffocated but they are unsure how many men attacked her. A small sum of money - thought to be in euros - had been stolen from her room. The victim's friend Betty Firmstone, 85, told South Africa's Daily News: 'I met Sister in 1952 when I started teaching at a school attached to the mission. We worked very closely together. She loved her work with children. 'This really was an act of savagery against a gentle, caring soul.' Sister Gertrud had lived at the missionary for 60 years after moving to South Africa from her native Austria. Police spokesman Major Thulani Zwane said there were no signs of forced entry into the room - and the number of intruders was 'unclear'. 'It is alleged that the victim was at her residence when she was approached by a suspect who allegedly tied her hands with a typewriter cord,' he added. 'She was also covered with a towel over her face, causing the victim to suffocate. Rape is also suspected in this matter. 'We are following all leads. We are also appealing to the community to come forward with any information.' Nuns at the mission where the murdered sister lived have been serving the local community since 1923 . The attack at the weekend is the first to be reported at the mission, which opened in 1923 for nuns wanting to serve the local community. It is also a home for young women who are considering becoming nuns. Sister Gerald, who lives at the mission, said Sister Gertrud had dedicated her life to helping impoverished children and adolescents. Despite her advanced age, she was working for the mission's educational outreach programme at the time of her murder. 'She had a very kind heart and was loved by everyone,' said Sister Gerald.","Sister Gertrud Tiefenbacher had been bound with a typewriter cord .

"Dozens of children witnessed a giraffe being gored to death by an antelope at a Norwegian zoo on Easter Monday. Melvin the giraffe had got his head stuck in a fence when he was attacked by an eland antelope walking in the same enclosure at Kristiansand zoo, around 200 miles south of Oslo. Zoo vets rushed to the scene, but were unable to save the five-year-old giraffe, who died in front of shocked families. Tragedy: Melvin the giraffe was attacked by an antelope walking in the same enclosure at Kristiansand Zoo in southern Norway . Around 30 people witnessed the unprovoked attack at Dyreparken Kristiansand on Monday. Melvin was a firm favourite among young visitors, having been named in a readers' competition in a national newspaper when he was born at the zoo in 2010. Witness Øivind Hansen, who was visiting the zoo with his family and photographed the event said even his 23-year-old daughter had come home crying after the incident. 'It was very traumatic. People were crying everywhere,' he told Verdens Gang. Melvin had gotten his horns stuck in the enclosure's fence when suddenly the eland, the second largest antelope in the world, suddenly attacked. Deadly attack: The large eland antelope gored five-year-old Melvin to death in an unprovoked attack after giraffe had gotten his head stuck in the enclosure's fence . Horrible scenes: Around 30 people, many of them children, witnessed Melvin, who was born at the zoo in 2010 and named in a local newspaper competition, die in the enclosure . 'He was panicking and tugged and tore to free himself, and then came a rather large animal with sharp horns and ran right into him,' Mr Hansen adds. 'It is incredibly sad,'  Dyreparken's chief executive told Dagbladet.no. 'He was alive when our veterinarian came to the scene, but died while he tried to save him.' 'Melvin was gored right near his lungs and heart, and the injuries were so serious that they killed him,' veterinarian Rolf Arne Ølberg, who was called to the scene, said. Mr Ølberg added that the two animals have been walking in the same enclosure since Melvin's birth in 2010 and has no idea why the antelope launched the deadly attack on the young giraffe.","Melvin the giraffe was killed by an antelope at Norwegian zoo .

"A cancer patient has told how a large tumour underneath her left breast 'dissolved away' after a pioneering new treatment. The 49-year-old woman showed a staggering response to a new combination of two drugs, to treat skin cancer. Doctors at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York have hailed their patient's recovery 'one of the most astonishing responses', ever seen. Scientists at the hospital have conducted a trial, treating patients diagnosed with advanced melanoma with a new type of treatment. They combined a standard drug already used, ipilimumab, with another, nivolumab. A 49-year-old cancer patient's giant tumour underneath her left breast (starred left) was 'completely destroyed' and 'dissolved away' (right) after she received a pioneering new drugs cocktail to treat melanoma . They hope the new therapy could save thousands of lives in future. A case report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, reveals that after just one dose of the two drugs, the 49-year-old woman reported her tumour 'kind of dissolved'. Four years ago doctors removed a 4.2mm melanoma from her back. After treatment, and a year-and-a-half later, doctors discovered the cancer had returned. Then five months ago, another growth was removed from under the patient's left breast. But despite surgery, the disease returned. When the patient arrived at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, she had developed a huge tumour underneath her left breast, which protruded through the skin. The woman was given her first dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab, without complaining of any side effects. When she returned to the hospital three weeks later, for her second dose of the drugs combination, she revealed to doctors the huge mass underneath her left breast had 'disappeared', leaving a hole in the skin. Doctors treating her said: 'This patient had a rapid eradication of a large tumour mass after a single treatment with combination immunotherapy.' She now, no longer has any detectable melanoma. 'This is one of the most astonishing responses I have seen,' said medical oncologist Paul Chapman. 'It reminds us of the potential power of the immune system if we can remove the ""brakes"" that keep it from attacking cancer cells.' The World Health Organisation estimates that worldwide there are 66,000 deaths annually from skin cancer, with approximately 80 per cent due to melanoma. Researchers at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, led by medical oncologist Michael Postow, examined 142 patients with advanced melanoma, as part of their trials. Patients were randomly assigned to receive ipilimumab and nivolumab or ipilimumab plus a placebo. Those selected to receive ipilimumab with a placebo to start with, were later allowed to receive nivolumab if the first drug was ineffective. In a staggering 61 per cent of patients receiving the combination therapy, the researchers found significant tumour shrinkage. That was compared to just 11 per cent of the patients receiving ipilimumab plus a placebo. Patients receiving both drugs also lived longer without their disease progressing. The patient was treated as part of a clinical trial to test the effects of a new drugs combination on patients with advanced melanoma, pictured. The study found 61 per cent of those treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab showed signs of their tumours shrinking . But the side effects experienced by the patients on the combination therapy were worse, though they were still manageable. Dr Postow said: 'The incredibly high response rate seen in this trial for patients receiving the combination - approximately 60 per cent - now lets us tell patients that they have a high chance of significantly shrinking their melanoma with this treatment. 'More research is still needed, however, to know if it is necessary to give all patients this combination, or if patients should receive drugs like nivolumab and ipilimumab in sequence.' Senior author, Jedd Wolchok, chief of the melanoma and immunotherapeutics service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), said: 'We are excited about these results and believe they support the principle that rationally combining effective medicines is an approach to achieving better outcomes for patients.' The US Food and Drug Administration approved nivolumab late last year. Doctors at MSK helped spearhead clinical trials testing the drug's safety and effectiveness and continue to conduct studies using the drug to treat melanoma and other cancers. The findings were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research Annual Meeting.","Doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York were trialling a new combination of drugs to treat advanced skin cancer .

"Best-selling author Sarah Wilson has hit out at a woman’s website after they published her photograph alongside a story about an apparent eating disorder. The journalist and lifestyle guru behind the ‘I Quit Sugar’ book and website complained to Mamamia after her image was used to illustrate a story about orthorexia nervosa – a condition defined by an obsession for eating ‘healthily’. Wilson’s face was plastered on the article alongside controversial wellness blogger Belle Gibson, who has been accused of faking terminal cancer, and Paleo diet preacher Pete Evans. Celebrity chef Evans' cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, was recently dropped by its publisher after the Public Health Association of Australia found that 'a baby may die' if they consumed one of its particular recipes. Former Cosmopolitan editor Wilson fumed on Monday: ‘Is this how such things should be done?.’ Sarah Wilson hit out at the Mamamia website after it published her photograph alongside a story on an eating disorder . The I Quit Sugar author was pictured (centre, right) alongside Paleo chef Pete Evans (left) and controversial wellness blogger Belle Gibson (centre, left) ‘Take a sound, evidence-based article on orthorexia nervosa written by an academic and published on The Conversation, republish it (without attributing author) and then festoon it with images of people not mentioned in the article so as to implicate that they have an eating disorder!? S**t, I hope not,’ Wilson said. Also used in the article was a photo of a green smoothie – a much loved favourite of those involved in the ‘clean living’ movement. The Conversation article, which was seemingly republished on Mamamia by way of a content sharing agreement, said: ‘There is a blurry line separating “normal” healthy eating and orthorexia nervosa, but one way to define the condition is when eating “healthily” causes significant distress or negative consequences in a person’s life.’ Mamamia founder Mia Freedman and Wilson are said to have had a long-running feud . Wilson, who has an autoimmune disease, quit sugar in 2011 ‘as an experiment’ but liked the results – including increased energy, better skin and wellness – so much that she continued her sugar ban and wrote a best-selling book in the process. Wilson complained to Mamamia and they agreed to remove her image from the article. ‘UPDATE: Mamamia has pulled my image and updated their post after I flagged the issue,’ she wrote on Facebook. Editor-in-chief of the Mamamia network, Jamela Rizvi, told Daily Mail Australia: 'I agree that the choice of images originally used to illustrate this story weren't ideal. Ms Wilson complained to Mamamia and the site agreed to remove her image from the article . 'While the intention was to examine the idea of extremely strict diets masking potential eating disorders amongst devotees; that is not what was achieved. 'Once the issue was drawn to my attention, the images were immediately changed and I emailed Sarah to apologise. 'I'm glad that Sarah has accepted that apology.' In 2013, Mamamia’s founder Mia Freedman blasted Wilson over her anti-sugar stance and called her ‘obsessed’. Wilson wrote a blog post about eating two chocolate croissants while on holiday and how for ‘the rest of the day’ she felt incredibly ill. Freedman responded by commenting on Facebook ‘the fastest way to become obsessed with something is to try and ban it entirely from your life’. She later deleted the comment. Celebrity chef Mr Evans' cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, was recently dropped by its publisher . The Public Health Association of Australia found that 'a baby may die' if they consumed one of the recipes in Mr Evan's book . Last month wellness guru Wilson weighed in on the Belle Gibson controversy, saying too many health bloggers do not understand their power and responsibility. Gibson, founder of the popular Whole Pantry app, has faced intense criticism since doubts were raised about whether she has terminal cancer. Wilson told Daily Mail Australia that the incident was 'unfortunate' and that health bloggers have a huge responsibility to their followers. 'The real issue that's going on is there's a lot of people out there not taking on board the responsibility that comes with all this,' she said. 'I don't know that you need to be a dietitian to share information about your health journey. 'If you are somebody who works online and you claim to be a (health) blogger you have to take on certain responsibilities. 'You have to ensure you train yourself up in all of that (science). That's what I see isn't happening. 'There's a lot of people out there who are't taking on the responsibility of being a disseminator of information. 'We've got to be very transparent and acknowledge the science is not categorical - but respect the science that is there.' Wilson has said in a blog about the issue that 'diet can't cure disease'. Controversial wellness blogger Belle Gibson is being investigated over claims she faked her cancer battles, despite reports police dropped the investigation . Ms Gibson, who invented The Whole Pantry app and cook book,  found fame on social media after claiming her diet had helped cure her cancer .","Mamamia used a photo of Wilson on a story about orthorexia nervosa .

"A ‘unique and beautiful’ teenage girl was killed by a driver who crashed a stolen car while drunk and high on cocaine and cannabis. Xana Doyle, 19, was a passenger in the Toyota Avensis, which flipped and landed on its roof in an accident in the early hours of the morning. Driver Sakhawat Ali, 23, was more than twice the drink-drive limit and had been taking class A and B drugs before getting behind the wheel. Xana Doyle (pictured) was killed after driver Sakhawat Ali crashed a stolen car while high on drugs . The Toyota Avensis flipped and landed on its roof after the crash in the early hours of the morning in January . A court heard he was driving at ‘excessive speed’ in the moments before the crash, which did not involve any other vehicle. Miss Doyle, who suffered a ‘blunt head injury’, was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales. Ali admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday. Judge Neil Bidder QC told the court: ‘The driver was well over twice the drink-drive limit and it is accepted there was excessive speed.’ The judge said he wanted more information on how much cocaine and cannabis the driver had taken on the night of the smash before sentencing. Ali, of Newport, was remanded in custody ahead of a hearing in July. Sakhawat Ali (pictured right) admitted causing death by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking . The driver’s cousin, Shabaz Ali, 21, admitted allowing himself to be carried in a stolen car following the smash in January this year. The July hearing will decide whether he ‘contributed’ to the accident by pulling the handbrake from the back seat. Floral tributes were left at the scene of the accident and hundreds of people attended the funeral of Miss Doyle, a former Duffryn High School student, in January. In a tribute, her mother Emma O’Donoghue wrote that Xana was an ‘unusual name for a unique and beautiful girl’. Before the crash, Miss Doyle, from Newport, had recently begun working at Wetherspoons as a cook and was also a trained beautician after completing an apprenticeship. Ms O’Donoghue said yesterday: ‘No sentence will ever give me back my daughter or my children their sister. She is dearly missed and this terribly traumatic experience will remain with us for ever. ‘I am pleased that Sakhawat Ali has pleaded guilty, not that he could dispute any of the evidence presented. Miss Doyle suffered a 'blunt head injury' and was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport, South Wales . Ali was remanded in custody and a hearing in July will determine if his cousin also contributed to the crash . ‘Xana was a beautiful, funny and loving girl and every day is a struggle to live on without her in our lives, we can only hope that justice is served and those responsible are held accountable.’ Paying tribute to Miss Doyle at her funeral, her mother said: ‘You had a smile that would stop this world spinning around. ‘I always knew that you were kind and loving and even through your difficult teenage years you never forgot to tell me how much you loved me and appreciated my support. ‘In the last two years you blossomed into a beautiful young woman, independent and hard-working, making us all so proud of you.’ She added that she had fond memories of her daughter playing and fooling around with her sisters, Lauren and Eve, and her brother Zane. Miss Doyle, whose white coffin was adorned with red roses, gave ‘unquivering friendship and support’ to her friends and family throughout her life, her mother added.","Xana Doyle was killed after Toyota Avensis flipped and landed on its roof .

"The toxic pesticide that poisoned a U.S. family on vacation in the Virgin Islands has also been improperly used in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday after a federal investigation. Officials said documents suggest methyl bromide may have been improperly applied in various locations in Puerto Rico. EPA regional administrator Judith Enck said the agency and Puerto Rico's Department of Agriculture are investigating where and when the pesticide was used and how much was applied. Steve Esmond (left) and his wife, Dr Theresa Devine (right), and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their stay at a resort on the island of St. John. The toxic pesticide that poisoned the family has been found in various locations in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday . 'The EPA is taking this very seriously,' she said in a phone interview. 'I can't tell you how widespread this is... We're very early in our investigation.' Sean, 16, (pictured) and his 14-year-old brother Ryan remain in comas two weeks after being hospitalized due to being poisoned by methyl bromide . Enck said she is not aware of anyone sickened by methyl bromide in Puerto Rico. The EPA banned the chemical for residential use in 1984, primarily for health concerns. Nancy Feliciano, agriculture department spokeswoman, said Puerto Rico officials would comment soon. The chemical sickened a family of four from Wilmington, Delaware, last month in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Two teenage boys went into comas after being exposed at the Sirenusa Condominium Resort in Cruz Bay, St. John. The Esmond family was staying in the second floor of a unit whose first floor was sprayed with the pesticide to eradicate an indoor beetle that eats wood, officials have said. Steve Esmond and his wife, Dr Theresa Devine, and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their stay. They began having seizures and were airlifted to separate hospitals in Philadelphia suffering major respiratory trauma. Sean, 16, and Ryan, 14, were in critical condition. Family attorney and spokesman James Maron did not respond to messages for comment. He said in a statement last week that the boys remained in critical condition while their mother had been discharged and their father was recuperating. EPA regional administrator Judith Enck said the agency and Puerto Rico's (pictured) Department of Agriculture are investigating where and when the pesticide was used and how much was applied . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released information on the illegal use of methyl bromide after conducting a federal investigation . The EPA has said a certified applicator working for Tennessee-based Terminix used the pesticide at the Virgin Islands resort. Sea Glass Vacations LLC, which rents units at Sirenusa, terminated its contract with Terminix last week. Terminix has said it is conducting its own investigation and is cooperating with the EPA. The U.S. Justice Department also is investigating. EPA officials said Thursday the pesticide used in the Virgin Islands came from licensed distributors in Puerto Rico, where inspectors are visiting pesticide applicator companies, including Terminix. 'This has been prohibited since the 1980s,' Enck said. 'There should be no confusion.' Methyl Bromide, which is odorless, can be fatal or cause serious damage to the central nervous system and respiratory system, according to the EPA. It is acutely toxic, and only permitted to be used outdoors by certified professionals in the US. The family was staying at the $875-a-night Sirenusa Condominium Resort on St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands when they fell ill .

"Vitamin and mineral supplements are becoming more and more popular as health conscious shoppers focus on good nutrition, but do we really need pills to optimise our diet? Not according to nutritionist and author Sarah Flower, who says that cooking with the right ingredients should give you all the goodness you need. 'The cleaner your diet - using fresh ingredients and cooking at home - the less likely you are to need to rely on supplements to boost your health.' she told MailOnline. Scroll down for video . It's time to ditch vitamin pills for a diet rich in clean, fresh and unprocessed foods, says Sarah Flower . 'The typical western diet is heavily processed and sugar ridden,' explains Sarah, 'this makes us more susceptible to vitamin and mineral deficiencies.' And while it may seem like common sense to eat more unprocessed and raw foods, Ms Flower believes we are still not doing enough. 'We are living in a society where it is possible to be overweight and deficient in essential nutrients.' she continued. 'A diet rich in oily fish, whole grains, lean protein, fruit and vegetables should provide enough nutrients,' she said. Other factors to consider include your ability to absorb the food - digestive complaints can often impede our ability to absorb nutrients. 'Pregnancy, ill health and the elderly may need more support,' she said. And menstruating women may benefit from adding oils (Evening Primrose Oil) and a multivitamin rich in magnesium to help alleviate PMS symptoms (Ms Flowers recommends magnesium citrate). Always opt for steaming over boiling vegetables and eat as many raw pieces as you can every day . 'Fruit and vegetables not only contain vitamins but also vital phytonutrients, which have an amazing ability to protect us against degenerative diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and heart disease,' Ms Flowers said. 'The more colourful your plate, the healthier the meal. Junk food tends to be bland and beige. 'Children especially need to be encouraged to try a variety of vegetables. One great incentive is to set up a reward chart for every new food they try. 'Get them into the kitchen as playing with food helps them become less fussy eaters.' The nutritionist is also a keen advocate of incorporating as much healthy fat as possibly into your diet. 'We have all been encouraged to follow a low fat diet, but we need to start embracing fats,' she said. 'Oily fish, nuts and seeds contain vital nutrients so ignore the calorie counts and give your body the healthy food it craves and needs. 'Healthy fat doesn’t make you fat; a diet rich in processed carbohydrates and sugar makes you fat. 'A high carbohydrate, sugar rich diet keeps you hungry but also stops you absorbing vital nutrients, causes depression, fatigue and energy dips. Instead of taking supplements, eat 100g of dark chocolate (left)  or six oysters (right) for zinc . 'Eat real food and your body with thank you for it.' The foods listed below are some of the highest per vitamin and mineral. However, how you cook and prepare the food is vital. Vitamins are depleted during processing and cooking, so try to steam vegetables instead of boil, give a quick stir-fry and eat as many raw whole fruits and vegetables every day.' VITAMIN A . RNI (Reference Nutritional Intake): 700ug (micrograms) for men and 600ug for women per day. Eat: One portion of liver a week will ensure adequate Vitamin A. Why you need it: Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin. We can produce our own Vitamin A by eating carotenoids. Think orange or yellow foods such as carrots, mangoes, papayas and sweet potatoes. Liver, eggs, cheese and yoghurt also contain the best sources of Vitamin A. Ensure you have adequate levels of zinc and iron as deficiencies in these can deplete Vitamin A. CALCIUM . RNI: 700mg a day but this figure does vary depending on your personal circumstances and health. Think about how to boost your everyday foods as basic switches can really boost your nutrient content. Eat: 120g (or one tin) of sardines provides 500mg of calcium; spring greens contain 200mg per 100g; sesame seeds contain 160mg per tablespoons; three dried figs contain 150mg of calcium . Why you need it: Calcium  makes up your bones and keeps them strong. 99 per cent of the calcium in your body is stored in bones and teeth. The remaining one per cent is in your blood and soft tissues, and is essential for life and health. Increase your green leafy vegetables for usable calcium. Other sources include dairy, nuts, soya beans and fish. Too much refined sugar and high protein diets can increase your need for calcium. VITAMIN B12 (Cobalamin) RNI: 1.5ug or 2.5mcg per day. Eat: 4g of yeast extract (roughly what you would use on one slice of toast). A 200g to 240g salmon fillet provides 5mcg of B12; shellfish; cow's liver; crab; fortified tofu products; red meat, cheese, and eggs. Why you need it: B12 deficiency can cause anemia, fatigue, depression and has even been linked to dementia. Vegans need to be especially careful to maintain their B12 levels. Although you can get a little B12 from some vegetable sources, it is hard to digest and utilise so look at adding yeast extract and nutrition yeast flakes which give a ‘cheesy’ flavour to foods. If in doubt, use a multi vitamin or blend of B vitamins. Best sources are found in liver, red meat, chicken, and oily fish. You can also find B12 in dairy products. VITAMIN C . RNI: 40mg a day. If you take too much vitamin C (probably through supplementation), you will get loose stools and stomach cramps, so that is your indication to cut back. Eat: A 250g punnet of strawberries gives you 145mg of Vitamin C; one kiwi fruit gives you around 64mg of vitamin C . Why you need it: Vitamin C is needed to keep our immune system in tiptop condition but is also needed for collagen formation, wound healing, gum health and cardiovascular health. You need vitamin C to utilise iron so if you are anemic, ensure you have adequate amounts of both. Cooking can destroy vitamin C so it is important to try to get some raw sources into your diet every day. 100g of liver (left) will give you 23mg of iron. Spread a yeast extract such as Marmite on your toast (right) for Vitamin B12 . VITAMIN E . RNI: 4mg per day. Eat: 100g of almonds provides you will 26mg; 100g of sunflower seeds give you 36mg; 100g of wheat germ provides you with 30mg of Vitamin E. Why you need it: Vitamin E is another fat soluble vitamin and as a powerful antioxidant, helps protect us from free radical damage, helps ease PMT, heals skin, reduces cholesterol and protects against cardiovascular disease. Vitamin E works better alongside vitamin C and selenium. The best source of vitamin E is wheat germ, oils made from seeds (sunflower oils, olive oil, almond oils) and nuts and seeds. ZINC . RNI: Men require slightly more zinc than women; 9mg for men and 7mg for women. Eat: Six oysters will give you 30mg of zinc; 100g of dark chocolate is one whole bar of Green & Blacks. Why you need it: Zinc is another great antioxidant, helping to support the immune system, aiding protein synthesis, maintaining sex health, and plays an vital role for maintaining a healthy heart. Processed foods and high sugar diets can lead to a deficiency in zinc, so opt for a diet rich in lean protein, eggs, seafood’s, nuts, seeds, whole grains and some dairy. VITAMIN K . RNI: On average you need 1mcg per kilogram of weight; for example, someone who is 70kg would need 7mcg per day. Eat: 100g of kale gives you over 800mcg of Vitamin K. Why you need it: Vitamin K is needed for blood clotting, wound healing and bone health. The richest sources of vitamin K are found in green leafy vegetables, particularly Swiss chard, kale, broccoli and spinach. You can also find sources in tomatoes, olive oil, parsley and pepper. MAGNESIUM . RNI: 300mg per day. Eat: 125g fillet of mackerel gives you 116mg of magnesium; 100g of pumpkin seeds provides you with 530mg; spinach gives you 70mg per 100g; dark chocolate gives you 327mg per 100g. Why you need it: Magnesium is vital for health and most women are deficient. It works in balance with calcium, helps combat stress and eases muscle tension. There is very little magnesium is not involved in. from energy synthesis right through to the metabolism of carbohydrates. When boosting your magnesium levels, opt for whole grains, nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, lentils and figs. Calcium makes up your bones and keeps them strong. 120g of sardines provide 500mg of calcium . IRON . RNI: 8.7mg per day and up to 14mg for menstruating women per day. Eat: 100g of liver will give you 23mg of iron; pumpkin seeds 15mg per 100g; dark chocolate 17mg per 100g. Why you need it: Iron is needed to transport oxygen around the body and deficiency can cause anemia and fatigue. If you are increasing your iron intake, ensure you also increase your Vitamin C as this is needed to utilise iron efficiently. Iron is found in red meats, particularly liver, nuts, seeds, beans, whole grains, and green leafy vegetables. The good news is it is also found in dark chocolate. VITAMIN B6 (also known as pyridozine) RNI: 1.4mg per day. Eat: One large banana gives you roughly 0.50mg of B6; one tin of tuna gives you 1.2mg of B6; . 100g of sunflower seeds provides you with 1.3mg of B6; 100g of bananas gives you 0.37mg; 100g of black-eyed beans gives you 0.36mg of B6. Why you need it: Vitamin B6 is needed for the breakdown of proteins and plays a vital role in energy production. It also works alongside iron aiding the transportation of oxygen and maintaining heart health. B6 also works well alongside magnesium and Vitamin E in aiding PMT and mild depression. Once again, rich sources are found in liver, whole grains, brown rice and pulses.","Nutritionist Sarah Flower recommends vitamin-rich foods we should eat .

"A young mum who was crippled after she dived 40 feet off Appley Bridge quarry in Wigan has described how her children inspired her fight back to health. Natalie Prescott, 26, was not expected to survive after she dived into a quarry in a dare-devil stunt which went horribly wrong. Her family was warned she was unlikely to pull through and that if she did, she would almost certainly lose her legs. Mum-of-three Natalie Prescott, 26, with Harley, 5, (left), 19 month old Scarlett, and Saskia, 7, (right), nearly lost her legs after leaping off Appley Bridge Quarry, near Wigan, back in 2012 . Through perseverance, she is finally on the way to recovery – and says her children are her inspiration. But after learning that a teenage boy tragically drowned in the same quarry on Friday, Natalie is campaigning to have the area closed off to the public. Mother-of-three Natalie, from Wigan, said: 'This tragedy brought it all back to me. I almost died there too – and I want all young people to learn from my stupidity - please stay away from lakes and rivers because tomb-stoning can kill you. 'But in a way, I'm glad it happened to me, because it taught me what's important in life. All that matters to me now are my three lovely children.' After the incident, it was revealed that her ankles were pulverised and her knee cap was smashed . She had several operations during a three-month hospital stay, including metal plating in her ankle . The accident, in June 2012, happened at Appley Bridge quarry, Wigan, near the farm owned by Natalie's mother, Susan. Susan was later to see the air ambulance over her farm – unaware it was carrying her own daughter. Natalie, who is mother to Saskia, 7, Harley, 5, and 19 month old Scarlett, says: 'I hooked up with some old friends and on a sunny afternoon we went for a day out to a beauty spot, where rocks overhang a disused quarry. 'My mum lived nearby and she was looking after my two children whilst I went out with my friends. 'We were daring each other to jump in the water, and even though I knew it was stupid, I went along with it. I had never done anything like that before. 'I just fancied doing something crazy. I wasn't thinking about my children, I was thinking about myself.' As Natalie jumped, her nerves got the better of her and she hesitated. She smashed against an overhanging cliff, before hitting the water. After the accident, although the doctors managed to save her legs, she was unable to walk or stand, and had to learn all over again . At the time of the accident in 2012, the 26-year-old had two children, Saskia, now 7,  and Harley, now 5 . She says: 'As I hit the water, I saw a large gaping hole in my knee. I had no pain but I was shaking and in shock.' Natalie's friends dragged her onto the banking and gave her mouth to mouth resuscitation as she began to struggle with her breathing. Unconscious, she was flown to hospital by a mountain rescue team and placed in ICU. Natalie says: 'My mum and my children saw the air ambulance land near their farm, and they watched it – unaware that it was me who was injured.' Her family was at first warned she might not survive – and were then told she would lose both of her legs. Natalie says: 'My memories of those first days in hospital were very hazy. 'I was in so much pain and my legs were just a mush. My knee cap was smashed and my ankles were pulverised.' In August 2013, Natalie gave birth to her third child, Scarlett, now 19 months. The mum-of-three has stated that her children have been her inspiration for recovering from the horrific incident . Before and after: Natalie finally took her first steps one year after the accident, and then gave birth to her new baby, Scarlett in August 2013 . She had several operations during a three month hospital stay, including surgery to fit metal plating in her ankle and an artificial knee joint. Though doctors managed to save her legs, she was left unable to walk or stand. She was transferred to rehab, where she began to learn to walk again. Natalie said: 'It was a very low point for me. I felt so guilty that I had put my family through so much pain and worry. 'Every time my children visited me in hospital, they would cry and beg me to come home. 'My son, Harley, said to me: 'Get out of that big pram mummy and start walking again.' 'It was very painful and so frustrating, but I just had to work hard, every day, to get myself well again.' Natalie finally took her first steps one year after the accident. And in August 2013, she gave birth to a new baby, Scarlett. Natalie says: 'Scarlett's birth really inspired me to get back on my feet. I had to get better, because I had a new baby to look after. 'I feel like I'm back to being a mummy again': Although Natalie still has a limp and isn't able to ride horses, she can look after her children better . 26-year-old Natalie is now better able to care for her children, including Saskia, now 7, and younger brother Harley, now 5. She has vowed to start a petition to have the area closed to public after hearing of the drowning of teenager Miracle Godson . 'I was determined to look after her on my own because I've needed so much help with my older children. 'I feel like I'm back to being a mummy again, and that is such a precious role and one I won't take for granted ever again. 'I won't ever be back to how I was; I have a limp and I can't walk far. I won't ever be able to ride horses again. 'But in a way, I'm grateful for the accident. 'It made me grow up and appreciate what is important in life. 'When I heard that the young boy had drowned in the same spot it sickened me, and I now I'm going to do everything I can to get the area closed off. 'I'm starting a petition because I want people to listen to me before another life is lost.'","Natalie Prescott, 26, had to be flown to intensive care by air ambulance .

"Mitya the bear  waves a tiny fluffy paw as one of his carers at a Vlativostok animal park tells his tale. The little cub was found abandoned outside the city's circus in February, and was taken to Sadgorod Zoo. He is one of many bear cubs rescued by special groups across Russia this spring, often after illegal hunters kill their mothers. Scroll down for video . All alone: Mitya the baby bear, was found abandoned outside a circus in Vladivostok, east Russia, earlier this year . Not camera shy: Mitya was taken to Sadgorod Zoo where he joined two young cubs also believed to have been orphaned as a result of hunting . Also at Sadgorod Zoo in Vladivostok, eastern Russia, are two one-month-old twins who were found all alone in the wild. Zoo owner Alyona Asnovina said: 'They were left with no mother in sight and wouldn't be able to survive on their own. When the twins grow up, perhaps they'll be put in the forest.' Mitya has since been moved to a private zoo where he has found a permanent home. Four time zones to the west, in Omsk, three bears have been taken in after their mother was shot by a hunter. Named as Busya, Musya and Vorchun they are being fed cow's milk with honey and enjoy playing with furry toys and on a wooden stairway. Play time: One of three bear siblings rescued in Omsk after a hunter killed their mother plays with a carers glove and a fluffy toy .

Back east, in Siberia, Masha the bear cub is being hailed as a real life Paddington after being flown business class to a new home in Moscow. The fluffy native of the Russian Far East was found as a new born cub on a doorstep in the Russian Far East. Masha and her brother were left outside a family home in the city of Khabarovsk, perhaps by the hunter, and were fortunate to be rescued. . 'It is thought their mother was killed by poachers,' reported The Siberian Times. The abandoned Hymalayan or black bears were taken to the local zoo, but the male cub sadly died. 'Masha has flourished and now three-months-old, she has a new life at an animal sanctuary in Moscow. Transaero airline provided a free ticket for animal protection officer Natalya Kovalenko, with pictures showing Masha with her in the business class cabin. 'On board Masha was conveniently accommodated in its carrying case and curiously examined the aircraft cabin and passengers, who were amazed and enjoyed to see such a nice fellow traveller,' said a statement issued by the airline. Big journey: Masha the bear was rescued in Siberia before finding a new home at a sanctuary in Moscow .

'Like all kids, the little bear slept peacefully and soundly for most of the eight-hour flight. The bear was fed warm goat's milk with a bottle several times during the flight.' In fact the images show the bear enjoying the view out of the plane's window and being looked after by attentive staff in the business class cabin on the eight hour 20 minute flight. 'She was treated as if she was Paddington Bear with no comfort spared,' said one source. In Moscow, the bear was brought to her new home, where she will live with other bears. Finally, a baby brown bear needed rescuing after being gifted as a birthday present to a young child in Perm in the Ural Mountains. A friend of the wealthy parents evidently gifted the orphaned cub. The parents took to the internet to check on what bears are like as they grow up, and were shocked to discover it could ravage their child. After a week in their home, they appealed for a new owner and the bear is to undergo training at Perm Circus. Animal trainer Yuri Nizhelsky said: 'The bear is good, and has no fear. 'Dogs did not attack it and people had no time to hurt, so the baby's mental state is stable.'","Spring in Russia means increase in bear cubs being rescued as hunters kill their mothers .

"Sometimes, putting up a billboard just isn't quite enough - so a group of Russian entrepreneurs have come up with a new way to get you message out: on the breasts of a beautiful woman. Companies Tittygram and Titisign have popped up in Russia offering the eyebrow raising service and are, by all accounts, causing quite a stir. Indeed, it has already caught the attention of one big company, which jumped at the chance to advertise its whoppers. Cleavage: Burger King has become one of the first big companies to take advantage of thi type of advertising . From the heart of Russia: Two companies now offer to write on a woman's cleavage and take a snap . Burger King's Russian branch posted a picture of a woman with 'I love Burger King' emblazoned across her chest, courtesy of Tittygram, on its VK page, the country's version of Facebook. The message above reads: 'Do you want your name to be written here? 'Every week the most active participant will get such a named postcard from us! 'Not only our whoppers are prepared on fire, everything we have is on fire as well!' And it has certainly brought them a fair amount of attention, with hundreds of 'likes' and countless comments - although they are not all positive. What's more, as advertising campaigns go, it is incredibly cheap: for as little as $6, or £4, they promise to get your message across in a way which is certain to grab attention. Versatile: The picture can then be used as either a personal message, or advertising, and cost just £4 . Eyebrow raising: But the use of a woman's cleavage as advertising space has not been universally popular . According to the Global Post, Tittygram was set up earlier this year, with Titisign following in its footsteps more recently. Both offer a similar service, asking people to send their messages in, at which point a model writes the message on her breasts and then takes the requisite photo. The English website for Titisign boasts: 'Stave off boredom! Send your communication on the bosom of Russian beauties – knock your friends’ socks off, advertise your business and make unforgettable gifts! 'Say hello from the heart of Russia!' Boasts: 'Knock your friends’ socks off, advertise your business and make unforgettable gifts,' says Titisign . Alexey Gavrilov, co-founder of Titisign, revealed to MailOnline the company gets a range of requests for messages - from 'Farewell, Semyonych. With best wishes for your wedding day' to 'Do not play with heart - it is one. Play with boobs - there are two of them'. The women, he reveals, are not all professional models. 'We invite not only professional models who are interested in our project and like our idea, but beautiful girls,' he explained. 'Some of our models we find in professional community - we have photographers in our team - and some of them we find through social networks, others find us themselves.' However, as one VK user points out, when advertising 'it is necessary find something that is interesting to everyone' - and this certainly is not.","Two Russian companies have started offering unusual service this year .

"Sofia Vergara is fighting back in the bitter battle with ex Nick Loeb over the fate of frozen embryos the couple created in November 2013, six months before they ended their relationship. The Hot Pursuit star's lawyer Fred Silberberg told People late Friday that the 42-year-old 'has never wanted to destroy her embryos.' However, she's not planning on using them either, the attorney said in the statement, adding that Vergara 'is content to leave the embryos frozen indefinitely as she has no desire to have children with her ex.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Sofia Vergara's attorney said Friday the actress has no intention of destroying the frozen embryos she created with ex Nick Loeb but has no plans to use them either as she has moved on with her life . Vergara's legal representative spoke out after court documents published this week by In Touch show Loeb, 39, wants a judge to order that the female embryos may not be destroyed, but that Vergara has refused to 'agree to their preservation under all circumstances. However, Sliberberg told People that ""the claims made against Sofia Vergara by Nick Loeb are uncredible and hold no merit.' He went on to say that Vergara 'has always maintained that they be kept frozen, a fact of which Loeb and his counsel have always been aware, despite Loeb's statements to the contrary.' The attorney also pointed out that the agreement between his client and her ex clearly states that no unilateral action may be taken by either party and that both sides must consent to any action taken with regard to the frozen embryos. Legal fight: Businessman Loeb, seen here with Vergara in 2011, filed a lawsuit against his ex-fiancee asking a judge to order her not to destroy the embryos. It's been reported that he wants to use them to have a child . Gossip website TMZ claimed Saturday that a source close to the Colombian actress says she won't destroy the frozen embryos because she's afraid it would anger 'a lot of her fan base, which believes life is created at inception.' The bitter feud between the warring couple made more headlines this week when it was reported that the Modern Family star had allegedly insisted her 44-year-old assistant be the surrogate for her and Loeb's child. According to Page Six, Loeb claimed that Vergara demanded her friend and employee serve as the surrogate over his 'objections as well as the recommendations of the parties’ doctor'. According to the legal papers, filed under pseudonyms Jane and John Doe, the pair fertilized embryos using Vergara's eggs and Loeb's sperm. In limbo: Vergara's attorney told People that the Modern Family star is content to leave the embryos frozen in storage 'indefinitely.'

Lovers + Friends Mahalo Maxi Dress at Shopbop (Now $56.70) Visit site . The couple split in May 2014. Vergara has been engaged to actor Joe Manganiello since December 2014. Loeb's lawsuit was first filed in August 2014 before it was refiled again on April 1 with updated information and after Loeb sought new legal representation. Another claim in the documents is that, previously, the pair twice had eggs implanted in a surrogate, but the procedure failed. The New York Post column also reported that the American businessman said the actress paid her friend $200,000 in gifts and mortgage payments and that a embryo was implanted in the woman on two separate occasions in 2013 with neither surviving. Moving on: The Colombian actress, 42, is now engaged to Joe Manganiello, 38, and there are rumours the couple are planning to have children of their own via a surrogate . A source for the publication added: 'Sofía insisted on it. She said the assistant was the only person she could trust.' The insider added that Loeb would like to keep the embryos intact to have his own children: 'He told Sofía he would raise the children himself, they would be very well taken care of. He wouldn’t sue her for child support. She would have no parental responsibility. She refuses to allow him to take charge of the embryos.' Elsewhere in the lawsuit, it is claimed 42-year-old actress Vergara - who got engaged to True Blood hunk Manganiello on Christmas Day after six months of dating - was 'physically and mentally abusive' to Loeb. The documents state: 'She punched him in the face on two occasions, kicked him, and threw her phone at his head. She also routinely bullied him, calling him a ""loser,"" ""worthless"" and other degrading names.' Wrangle: The lawsuit has been filed under the pseudonyms John and Jane Doe . No directive: Ultimately, the outcome will be at the discretion of a judge, but it would be unlikely that Loeb would be able to use the embryos without Vergara's consent, according to a legal expert who spoke to In Touch . Complicated matter: In this page of the document it states the former couple were planning on using a gestational surrogate to start a family and that the actress insisted on using a 44-year-old friend and employee . Arduous process: After the first two embryos failed to implant in the first surrogate the couple looked for another suitable candidate . Getting ugly: Page five of the document further detailed disagreements over the usage and disposal of the embryos and also alleged Vergara was physically, emotionally and mentally abusive to Loeb . In April 2013, Vergara - who has a 23-year-old son Manolo from her first marriage - spoke publicly about having frozen her eggs and her desire to have more children. She revealed that she and Loeb - who she dated on-off for almost four years - planned to use a surrogate on the account that she had thyroid cancer in 2000 and, as a result, had a lot of radiation. Meanwhile, Vergara  recently told Vanity Fair magazine that she may be emabrking on the baby-making process again with Mangianello, 38. While having another child would be 'weird', she said in an interview, it is something she might do if it made her new partner happy. She told the magazine: 'My son, Manolo, is 23 years old, which is going to be really weird if I have another baby. But, you know, Joe wants babies and if it's going to make him super-happy, then...'

"The girlfriend of a British man who bled to death in Thailand after injuring himself kicking a mirror in the bar where she works has denied having anything to do with the incident. Iain Mackay, 40, is believed to have argued with Nilobon Patty in a separate venue in Hua Hin, a resort some 125miles southwest of Bangkok, shortly before his death. Ms Patty, 35, also known as Patty Patrick, has been accused of 'indirectly causing his death' as seeing her with another man had angered Mr Mackay, but claims she has done nothing wrong. Tragic: Iain Mackay's Thai girlfriend Nilobon Patty, known as Patty Patrick, has denied any involvement in the death of the 40-year-old Scot . According to Ms Patty, the couple had been seeing each other for three years, but that Mr Mackay ended their relationship last month as his work overseas prevented him from settling down with her. She claims she was not with another man, but out with friends, when an 'obviously drunk' Mr Mackay appeared in the bar around 1am. Tragic: Mr Mackay, 40, allegedly got into a fight after discovering Ms Patty talking to another man . Ms Patty claims Mr Mackay, from Stornoway, Scotland, shouted at her, accused her of laughing at him, after which she decided to go home. Police informed her of Mr Mackay's incident in her place of work the next day, she told The Daily Record. 'I was told that Iain had gone there at 3am looking for me and I wasn't there,' she told the paper. 'People have been phoning me and making threats and saying I should leave Hua Hin. But I have done nothing wrong,' 'I don't know why anyone would say that I had anything to do with Iain's death. That is not true. It was just a terrible accident.' Thai police said Mr Mackay was in a rage when he cut himself with a piece of glass at a pool bar near to the venue where he had spotted Ms Patty and the mystery man. Friends of Mr Mackay say that had posted links to his Ms Patty's Facebook page on the evening of his incident which showed her pictured with another man. Onlookers called paramedics after he was found bleeding profusely at the pool shop but they were unable to save him. He later died in hospital. Officials said that no crime had been committed. Location: The resort where Mr Mackay died is in Hua Hin - a coastal city 125 miles south of Bangkok . Arguement: Mr Mackay bled to death after getting into a furious row at a bar in Hua Hin city . One friend said: 'Iain was obviously upset and referred to the woman who seemed to be his own girlfriend and a mystery man as lovers.' Mr Mackay, an underwater research specialist, is believed to have been employed by seismic research company Polarcus, which is based in Dubai. Sources at the company confirmed that Mr Mackay was on leave from his vessel and had told colleagues that he planned to spend his time off in Thailand. Thai officials said that Mr Mackay had died at 3pm on Saturday but relatives claim that they were told of his death on Friday. The Foreign Office also confirmed that Mr Mackay had died on Friday.

"Passengers on board a Virgin Atlantic flight from Las Vegas to Gatwick who endured a 33-hour delay have described the incident as 'excruciating' and 'an absolute nightmare.' Flight VS44 should have left  McCarran airport at 4.30pm local time on Easter Monday. But a series of delays meant the 403 passengers did not get away on their flight to Gatwick until early on Wednesday. The long delays were too much for some passengers who took to the airport floor to rest . A catalogue of events took place that saw passengers bound for London from Las Vegas delayed by over 33 hours . This shot was snapped by passenger Paul Glogiewicz; the passengers were eventually told there was a problem with the plane's rudder . And now, some passengers are considering legal action against Virgin. Jennifer Glogiewicz, who was travelling with husband Paul and celebrating her 40th birthday, told MailOnline Travel that they were shunted back and forth from the airport to the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel, only to find out each time that there were more delays. 'They just kept telling us the air con wasn't working and plane to warm to board. Then  later they said there was also a rudder issue,' said the mother of two from Bromley. 'The part needed was in the UK and that it would be flown in on tomorrow's inbound Vegas flight, then it would fitted and we would be flown home.' After being seated for two hours on the runway at the culmination of the 33-hour delays, the plane finally set off to the UK at 4am local time. 'We were very worried the entire flight hoping it had been fixed properly. 'Luckily it was a pleasant flight. Every announcement on board began with 'again we apologise'. 'We Landed at Gatwick and were given two letters and £20 per person to spend in M&S; a bit late if you ask me. 'The main point of all our complaints was the lack of communication and awful customer skills of the Virgin Vegas ground staff. The lack of proper communication made the whole thing an absolute nightmare.' Unbelievably some passengers remained in good spirits despite being forced to an unscheduled check-in at the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel . Passenger Charlie Nolan captured this photo of the plane after repairs had been halted because of the winds . Another passenger, Charlie Nolan, claimed that a Virgin employee who was updating the passengers over the tannoy lost his cool when the 400 passengers sarcastically clapped and whooped at the news that the engineers had decided to move the plane to a sheltered area to repair. The wind at the airport had meant the repairs could not be carried out quickly . Nolan told MailOnline Travel that 'another Virgin employee at the gate almost broke down in tears over the tannoy and that 'she claimed she had been working for 48 hours and wanted to go home to her children.' Banker Michael Jazanovich, 30, from Crouch End, north London, who was returning from a stag do, told London's Evening Standard: 'It was an absolute nightmare for everyone involved. The delays were unacceptable and excruciating as they were pushed back and back and people had to sleep in the airport. 'We are expecting a lot more (than €600). We have lost our time and had an awful experience. 'We deserve a lot more and, by taking a group action, we can work together to get this. We could share a lawyer, we are willing to take it as far as we need to.' They were given hotel accommodation on Monday evening but spent Tuesday night in the airport terminal. Mrs Glogiewicz added: 'I do feel Virgin should just refund everyone their flight cost and be done, not make us all claim. 'This ending has tarnished a great time away with my husband and made me wary of future travel.' Passengers were taken to the Tropicana Las Vegas on numerous times during the long flight delay . Stranded passengers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations over the eventual 33-hour delay . Virgin has said that eligible passengers would be getting EU compensation of €600 (circa £434) plus out-of-pocket expenses, but some are demanding much more. A Virgin Atlantic spokesman said: 'We always try our best to get things right for our customers and we are very sorry for the inconvenience caused by the delay of flight VS44 from Las Vegas to London Gatwick on April 6. 'On this occasion, the initial delay was caused by a technical fault with the aircraft and the delay was then extended because of strong winds around the McCarran airport area which hampered our engineers carrying out the repairs. Over 400 passengers endured a nightmare delay to their journey back to the UK from the US . The Virgin Atlantic flight eventually took flight some 33 hours behind schedule after technical problems (file photo) Passengers explained how they had been shipped back and forth to the airport with no solution . 'All of our customers were provided with hotel accommodation and meals while they waited, and we will reimburse them for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 'In addition, we will be providing eligible customers with EU compensation to the equivalent of €600 per person. 'Customers should visit www.virginatlantic.com/euclaimapplication for advice, details of the claims process and to download an application form.

"No wonder James Freedman’s super-nimble hands are insured for a huge sum — for the fingers he uses to steal wallets are the tools of his trade. ‘You can pinch anything off anyone — apart from their shoes!’ he says. Now he’s exhibiting his ‘skills’ on stage in a one-man pickpocket show, called Man Of Steal, in which he even takes off someone’s tie without them realising. Scroll down for video . The watch: James Freedman removes Harry Mount's timepiece without him noticing in his pickpocketing lesson . For years he’s been giving pickpocket demonstrations to teach people how not to become victims of street crime. He has also advised the Metropolitan Police and taught the ‘art’ to actors — showing the boy who played the Artful Dodger in Roman Polanski’s film Oliver Twist how to pick a pocket or two. Freedman, 49, describes himself as ‘the only honest pickpocket you will ever meet’. So I ask him to show me how those crooks we all fear go about their surreptitious trade. First, he says, they ‘fan the mark’. The ‘mark’ is the victim. So ‘fanning’ is using your hand with the fingers spread out to feel for valuables, usually using the back of the hand. ‘It’s a light, fluttering motion and, if executed correctly, the victim isn’t aware of it,’ says Freedman. Next — and this is vitally important — distract your victim: pat them on the shoulder with one hand as you ask the time and use your other hand to lift their wallet. Or just look into their eyes, so their peripheral vision doesn’t see your hand darting into their pocket. The wallet: Harry is now without his cash and cred cards thanks to Freedman's nimble fingers . The phone: Daylight robbery and Mount doesn't even feel a thing . Or — a much more simple ruse — ‘accidentally’ bump into them. ‘A classic trick is to pretend you are helping them. For example, carry a sachet of mayonnaise or ketchup, put a pin in it and squirt it at someone from a distance. Go up to them and start cleaning up their jacket. While you’re doing it, pick their pocket.’ To describe his activities, Freedman uses old-fashioned pickpocket patter, much of which dates back to 18th-century thieves. ‘Poke’ is slang for a wallet. ‘Skinning the poke’ means stealing one, taking out the money and throwing away the empty wallet. The easiest target is one who has their wallet (or phone) in the most vulnerable place: the back trouser pocket. Freedman uses two fingers in a pincer-like movement to steal it. His favourite ploy is to strike as the victim walks away from him — because they are less likely to feel a hand in their pocket while they are moving. Shady business: Freedman shows how a folded newspaper can be used to steal a pair of sunglasses . Freedman shows how to remove a pair of expensive sunglasses hanging from a jacket breast pocket by flicking them out and catching them with a folded newspaper. When he does it to me, I don’t feel a thing. Crucially, he ensures he doesn’t ‘tip the bit’ — that is, draw attention to the pickpocketing action. He thought he’d tipped the bit when he stole the pen from my pocket and it made a clicking noise. Needless to say, I didn’t notice. Not surprisingly, the most difficult target is a watch. I challenge him to remove mine without me noticing. It is tightly held on my wrist with a leather strap. It isn’t just buckled, but it also goes through a tight retaining loop. Fixing my gaze, Freedman puts his hand lightly on top of my watch, unbuckles it and whisks it away. I don’t feel anything in the entire operation and don’t look down because our eyes are firmly locked. More oddly, I don’t notice the watch’s absence once removed. ‘People have a muscle memory,’ says Freedman. ‘They don’t notice if something’s gone, however heavy it is, whether it’s a handkerchief — or your notebook.’ With that, he hands me back my hefty notebook, which I thought had been securely tucked inside my breast pocket. Somehow, he’d removed it. For all his skill as a pickpocket, Freedman says he has never used it for anything other for entertainment. ‘I never steal.’ However, he admits one exception: he once saw a woman being pickpocketed outside Harrods, decided to pickpocket the pickpocket and gave the purse back to the victim. Proudly, Freedman says the smartly dressed thief — who realised too late what had happened — went up to him afterwards and said: ‘Nice work.’ Freedman first became interested in pickpocketing as a child when he was mugged. ‘They took my pocket money and beat me up,’ he says. Not long after, he saw a theatrical pickpocket on TV — and then saw his father being pickpocketed on a trip to Paris. He now uses his skills to expose quite how vulnerable we all are to the growing number of pickpockets on our streets. Apparently, Prague and Barcelona are the most dangerous places for pickpockets in Europe; London is listed tenth. As we walk down London’s Oxford Street, he points out some easy prey: a woman sitting on a bench with an open bag next to her and a man with an unzipped pocket, a phone clearly visible inside it. Daylight robbery: The pickpocket specialist offers Harry directions while slipping a hand inside his pocket . Distraction: As Harry looks into the distance, his mobile phone has been stolen and is about to disappear into Freedman's pocket . He can identify the model of a phone by the shape of the bulge in your pocket. ‘Samsung . . . iPhone . . . iPhone,’ he says as we pass people whose phones, inside their pockets, are invisible to me. Once, pickpockets concentrated on loose change and handkerchiefs, but now mobile phones account for half of pickpocketing crimes. Freedman says: ‘If I stopped everyone and told them how vulnerable they are, I’d never have any time left to do anything else.’ Mobile phones are the perfect item for pickpockets — ‘It’s called Apple or BlackBerry picking’ — but the information about the owner contained on the Sim card is more useful to the thief than the phone’s intrinsic value because it contains a wealth of personal information and possibly even bank details. These days, with clever software, criminals don’t even have to steal the phone. They can ‘skim’ it — place their own phone over it and copy all your data. Pickpockets carefully look for the moment you use your phone. They’ll watch to see which pocket you put it back in — and pounce. Ironically, a favourite spot is near signs that say: ‘Beware of Pickpockets.’ According to Freedman: ‘When we see such signs, we instinctively pat our pockets to check our valuables are OK. And the pickpocket is watching to see where the item is kept.’ After spending time with this cunning man, I can’t help keep patting my pockets obsessively as I walk along the street. I hope a real pickpocket — rather than a master showman — isn’t watching me. MAN Of Steal is at the Menier Chocolate Factory, London SE1 1RU, until April 27.","Harry met James Freedman, who has his own one-man pickpocket show .

"Police are hunting for a man who walked into a house in Los Angeles on Sunday and shot a sleeping eight-year-old boy (above) in the head . Police are hunting for a man who walked into a house in Los Angeles on Sunday night and shot a sleeping eight-year-old boy in the head, leaving him critically injured. The suspect, who is described as Hispanic, medium build and wearing a grey hoodie at the time, apparently had no motive for staging the attack in the 11000 block of Wagner Street in Del Rey. According to the victim's father, the attacker walked in through an unlocked front door around midnight and proceeded to fire shots after a heated conversation. The father then ran into the boy's bedroom to shield him as the gunman followed shooting, authorities said. Ammunition plowed through the wall and the bedroom door, although it was unclear which bullets struck the boy. The lath and plaster of the wall are believed to have slowed the shots. The boy was rushed to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where he underwent surgery for a head wound. As of Monday, he was listed in critical but stable condition. His great-aunt confirmed to NBC LA that his condition was continuing to improve. 'I know that at some point he did say something. They said he was going to be OK,' she said. No other family members were injured in the incident. The young victim's mother and 17-year-old brother were also reported to be in the bedroom,  while the boy's grandmother was in another room. Apparently the front door and security gate had been left open as the father had been expecting his 20-year-old son to return.

Nicole Alberca said at a news conference Monday afternoon. The names of the family members have been withheld but a photo of the boy has been released. The image shows him smiling with long, wavy, golden-brown hair down to his shoulders.

"An eight-year-old girl, who lost her leg in a terrible accident last year, has given her first solo dance performance since she became an amputee eleven months ago - earning a standing ovation for her moving routine. Alissa Sizemore, from Vernal, Utah, was only seven-years-old when a truck ran over her foot and immediately severed it. Although the dancer, who has been taking lessons since she was four-years-old, had to have her right leg amputated below the knee, she was determined to get back in the dance studio as soon as possible. 'I just didn't want to give up,' Alissa told People. 'Dancing has been my favorite thing since I was four. I don't have part of my leg, but I can't let that stop me. I still want to dance.' Scroll down for video . Major Inspiration: Alissa Sizemore can be seen dancing on a wooden bench during her first solo dance performance since she lost her leg in an accident last May . Alissa, who was fitted for her prosthetic leg in September, chose Colbie Caillat's hit Try, a song that she and her mom felt accurately reflected her emotional journey over the past year, for her debut performance, in which she removed her artificial limb as a part of her routine. Alissa's mom Heather proudly shared a video of her daughter's performance last month on her YouTube channel. The clip shows Alissa donning a seafoam green ballet costume as she confidently walks toward a bench set up in the middle of Vernal's high school gymnasium, where the recital took place. The impressive little girl performs a series of leg stretches and even a cartwheel before she removed her prosthetic limb. Unstoppable girl: The eight-year-old lifted her prosthetic limb while balancing on one leg for her routine, which was set to Colbie Caillat's hit Try . Dare devil: She even did a cartwheel in the middle of her performance at a high school gymnasium in in Vernal, Utah . Determined: Towards the end of her emotional dance, Alissa removed her artificial leg and continued her routine on the floor, where she did a bridge and a forward roll . After removing her artificial leg, she continues her routine on the floor, proving that she will always be able to dance - with or without her leg. The teary-eyed audience was so moved by her dancing that she was given a standing ovation - a fantastic end to an emotional year. And one which will hopefully help to dull the memory of the horrific accident which left her in pain for months. Last May, Alissa was playing outside with her sister Cyley, 10, and some of her friends when she ran past a few garbage cans that were pulled to the curb just as a truck was breaking to a stop. Alissa's right foot was pinned underneath the tire. She was immediately flown to Vernal to Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City, but doctors were unable to save her leg. Amazing recovery: Alissa was photographed warming up for ballet class at Powerhouse Dance Studio last month . In sync: She can be seen performing a routine with the other girls in her class . Star treatment: Alissa got her hair done before she was filmed dancing in the music video for Utah musical trio Gentri's song Dare . Alissa was reliant on a wheelchair or crutches before she was fitted for her artificial leg, but she was secretly doing uncomplicated dance moves in the studio her father had built for her and her sisters. While Alissa adjusted to her new reality, her neighborhood community banded together to help raise money for her surgeries and her prosthetic leg, which weren't completely covered by the family's health insurance. When her mom took her and her sisters to Powerhouse Dance Studio last summer for fall tryouts, it was thought that Alissa would help with the music until she was ready to return to dance - but she had other plans. Say cheese: The little girl posed for this photo with Casey Elliott, Brad Robins and Bradley Quinn Lever, who make up the group . Inspiring words: In the music video, Alissa holds up a sign that reads: 'Dare to dream.' 'She handed me her crutches and said she was trying out,' her mom told People. 'She hopped to the middle of the room and gave it her all. She wasn't going to let anybody hold her back.' Alissa's amazing story inspired Utah musical trio Gentri to feature her in the music video for their song Dare. Throughout the clip, which debuted earlier this month, Alissa can be seen attaching her prosthetic leg before she starts dancing. The footage also shows her holding up pictures of herself during her recovery last year, as well as a newspaper article about her recent dance recital. Towards the end of the video, Alissa raises a sign that reads: 'Dare to dream.'

"A Western gray whale has made the longest known migration by any mammal. The female, named Varvara, swam 14,000 miles (22,500km) from the east coast of Russia to breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico, and back, without even stopping for a snack when she was nine years old. Her return journey across the North Pacific raises questions about the critically endangered creature’s conservation status. A Western gray whale (pictured) has made the longest known migration by any mammal. The female, named Varvara, swam 14,000 miles (22,500) from the east coast of Russia to breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico, and back, reportedly without stopping for a snack . Until now, scientists believed there were two distinct groups of gray whale - the Eastern gray whale, which travels along the west coast of US, and the much rarer Western gray whale, which journeys along the coast of eastern Asia. The researchers used satellite-monitoring tags to track three Western North Pacific gray whales from their primary feeding ground off Russia’s Sakhalin Island across the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the US to Baja, Mexico. The experts have been monitoring the species living off the coast of Russia for years and tracked the record-breaking journey over five-and-half months between 2011 and 2012. Gray whales typically don't feed during migration, which has led researchers to believe Varvara didn't eat during the long journey either. They found that Varvara, which is Russian for Barbara, visited the three major breeding areas for Eastern gray whales, which are found off North America, according to the study published by the Royal Society in the journal Biology Letters. Her return journey across the North Pacific raises questions about the critically endangered creature’s conservation status. Experts have been monitoring the species living off the coast of Russia for years and tracked the record-breaking journey between 2011 and 2012. A Western gray whale is shown . ‘It is very impressive,’ Professor Bruce Mate, of Oregon State University, told MailOnline. ‘These whales have the same body temperature as you and I, so they are obliged to make these big journeys to get to warmer or cooler waters. But this is a record.’ ‘Until now we thought they were not very good navigators,’ he continued. Varvarva is a 13-year-old Western gray whale. She is now famous for making the longest migration of any mammal when she was aged nine. The whale was tagged off Russia's Sakhalin Island in September 2011. Experts expected her to swim along Asia's Pacific shoreline down to the South China Sea. But instead, she turned up off Mexico's Baja Peninsula instead and mingled with Eastern gray whales near their nursery lagoon in Mexico. Experts tracked Varvara to find that she made a swam 14,000 miles (22,500) from the east coast of Russia to breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico, and back. Her journey is helping scientists make a surprising new discovery about migration patterns. ‘We thought that they just stuck to the coast, keeping the sound of the surf on one side, going up and down the coast until they met their destination.' On the way from Russia she is believed to have crossed the northern extremity of the Bering Sea, before hitting Alaska and going south until she reached the warm seas off the Baja peninsula to breed. But on her way back to Russia, she made a more direct route, cutting across deep water. ‘We do not know how she did it but the fact that she took different routes each way means we have to accept that these whales are very accomplished navigators,’ Professor Mate continued. The study said: ‘Her 22,511 km round-trip is the longest documented mammal migration and strongly suggests that some presumed Western gray whales are actually Eastern gray whales foraging in areas historically attributed to Wester gray whales.’ The previous longest journey made by a mammal was held by a humpback whale, who swam more than 11,706 miles (18,839km) in 2011. The migration from the feeding grounds was also made by two other whales who were being monitored, called Flex and Agent, who were all tagged seven years ago. Western gray whales were thought to have gone extinct by the 1970s before a small population was discovered in Russia off Sakhalin Island. The group is now estimated to be 150 strong and has been monitored by scientists from Russia and the US since the 1990s. The migration from the feeding grounds was also made by two other whales who were being monitored, called Flex and Agent, who were all tagged seven years ago. Here, experts observe the animals breaching . Like their western cousins, Eastern gray whales were decimated by whaling and listed as endangered, but conservation efforts led to their recovery. There are now thought to be more than 18,000 of them swimming the oceans. But not all scientists believe that Western gray whales are a separate, distinct species, raising the possibility that only Eastern gray whales survive today. Scientists previously thought that gray whales 'hugged' the coastlines, either in Asia or North America. They thought they set their path by watching or listening to the shore. The whales learn their migratory route from their mothers, who take them on their first journey from the breeding grounds to more northern feeding grounds and repeat the journey the following year. But Varvara travelled to Russia by swimming across the Bering Sea, with few landmarks or shallow waters to guide her. She even swam a new path on the way back by following the Alaskan coast. One of the routes is thought to have been passed on by her mother, demonstrating previously unknown navigational skills. ‘The fact that endangered Western gray whales have such a long range and interact with Eastern gray whales was a surprise and leaves a lot of questions up in the air,’ said Bruce Mate, director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University and lead author on the study. ‘Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species, but this suggests we may need to take a closer look.’ Valentin Ilyashenko of the A.N Severtsov Institute for Ecology and Evolution, who is the Russian representative to the International Whaling Commission and co-author of the study, has proposed since 2009 that recent western and Eastern gray whale populations are not isolated. He said that the gray whales found in Russian waters are a part of an eastern population that is restoring its former historical range. ‘The ability of the whales to navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive and suggests that some Western gray whales might actually be eastern grays,’ Dr Mate said. ‘But that doesn’t mean that there may not be some true Western gray whales remaining. ‘If so, then the number of true Western gray whales is even smaller than we previously thought.’ Protecting the endangered Western gray whales has been difficult, with five whales dying in Japanese fishing nets within the last decade. Their feeding areas off Japan and Russia include fishing areas, shipping lanes, and oil and gas production, as well as future sites oil sites, while their largely unknown migration routes may include additional hazards.","Western gray whales were tagged seven years ago to monitor migration .

Why can't we have an investigation into where the money actually goes?' she claimed. When told by the interviewer that there was no basis to any of these claims Ms Hanson replied: 'Why do Australians have to pay tax for halal certification? It is a money making racket. Why do Australians have to pay extra when they buy this product?' Ms Hanson added that an investigation was needed into halal certification in Australia.

Ms Hanson, who narrowly lost her fight for a seat in the 2015 Queensland election, joined hundreds of protesters in King George Square in Brisbane on Saturday. Many were draped in the Australian flag and carried signs denouncing sharia law and halal certification for Australian products. She denied that there was any violence or vitriol at the rally. 'There was no violence at the Brisbane rally whatsoever. Islam is not a race so therefore we're not talking about racism here whatsoever. Criticism is not racism.

"Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan will today find out if their last-ditch legal appeal against their death row sentence will be allowed to proceed. A Jakarta court is due to decide  whether the pair’s lawyers can challenge Indonesian President Joko Widodo’s decision to deny the two Australians clemency. The unusual appeal in the state administrative court is likely the pair's last legal avenue to save them from the firing squad for their part in the 2005 Bali Nine heroin smuggling bid. Sydney men Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, are currently awaiting execution on the death island of Nusakambangan with seven other prisoners after they were transferred from their home of almost ten years – Bali’s notorious Kerobokan prison – in a dramatic show of force, over a month ago. Scroll down for video . Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will find out if their last-ditch legal appeal against their Indoesian death row sentence will be allowed to proceed on Monday . Shackled and handcuffed: Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran cut sad figures as they were escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Korobokan prison in Bali to their final destination, Death Island . The court in February rejected their legal challenge for clemency, determining the decrees by President Widodo were not within its jurisdiction. If it overturns this decision on Monday, lawyers will then argue Mr Joko did not fulfil his obligations when he issued a blanket rejection of clemency to Chan and Sukumaran, as he plans to do to more than 50 other death row drug offenders. If the court upholds its earlier decision, it's not known what move the lawyers will take next in their efforts to spare the men. Lawyer for Chan and Sukumaran, Leonard Arpan, last week said they had done their best for their Australian clients. President Joko Widodo previously rejected the Australian pair's clemency bids . The pair are currently being held in isolation on the prison island . Family members of Australian death row prisoners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran leave Nusakambangan prison island after visiting the two prisoners on March 9 . On Sunday, Jakarta's Catholic Archbishop, Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo, told reporters he was saddened by Indonesia's use of the death penalty, which he described as a ""failure of humanity"". Also distressing for the archbishop was the severe treatment of Chan and Sukumaran when they were moved last month from their Bali jail cells to Nusakambangan, which involved a fighter jet escort. ""These men were handcuffed, was it necessary to be guarded by Sukhoi?"" he told reporters after his Easter Sunday service.

"Scott Kelley, now 50, has been arrested a decade after he fled the U.S with stepdaughter Mary Nunes, and her mother Genevieve Kelley . A teacher who fled the U.S. with his stepdaughter and her mother ten years ago has finally given himself up in Costa Rica. Scott Kelley, now 50, and stepdaughter Mary Nunes, now 19, gave surrendered at the U.S. embassy on Monday and were flown back to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport, where Kelley was arrested. The pair fled New Hampshire in 2004 along with Genevieve Kelley, Mary's mother, during a custody dispute with Mark Nunes, Genevieve's former husband and Mary's father. Genevieve, now 50, handed herself in last November, but refused to give up the location of her husband and daughter, who had not been seen for a decade until this week. Speaking to People magazine, Scott Kelley said: 'It was time to come home.' He is now facing a charge of custodial interference, the same charge his wife is due to face in court next month. Kelley's case dates back to December 2004 when Mark Nunes, a physician, was granted custody of daughter Mary, then eight, to take her for treatment for an unspecified illness. However, Genevieve, also a physician, refused to hand the girl over, instead taking her to Colorado for a second opinion, where a doctor diagnosed her with acute post traumatic stress disorder. While in Colorado, Genevieve alleged that Mr Nunes had sexually abused the girl, and then fled to South America along with current husband Scott. The state Division of Children, Youth and Families investigated and said any claims of abuse were 'unfounded,' and instead concluded that Genevieve instead likely abused the girl. Charges were never brought, however, because by that point the Kelleys, along with Mary Nunes, had already vanished. Mary Nunes, disappeared when she was aged 8 (left), and is now aged 19 (digitally aged version, right). The Kelleys fled after Mark Nunes, Mary's biological father, was granted custody of his daughter in 2004 . Genevieve (pictured) refused to hand her daughter over to Mr Nunes, and took the girl first to Colorado, then boarded a flight to South America and was not seen again for a decade . Despite well-publicized searches of the U.S., Canada, and South America, and dozens of other appeals, there was no sign of the family until February last year. Shortly after Mary turned 18, and was therefore no longer subject to the family court, Genevieve made contact with the authorities, but refused to come forward. Then, on  Monday, November 13, she finally appeared, saying she needed medical treatment for a son she gave birth to with Scott while she was in hiding. But despite pressure from officials, and pleas from her former husband, she refused to reveal the location of Mary, or husband Scott, saying only that the girl was safe. Then, on Monday, officials were alerted that Scott and Mary had come forward after the pair went to the U.S. Department of State office in Costa Rica to get travel documents to return home. Deputy Marshal Jamie Berry, New Hampshire case manager for the Kelley case, said marshals were alerted to the family's travel arrangements, and stopped them as they landed. Genevieve, now aged 50, was arrested by authorities in November last year after she came forward asking for medical treatment for a son that she gave birth to while in hiding . Scott and Mary were taken into custody at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (pictured) on Monday. Mary is now living at an undisclosed location in the U.S., while Scott is in police custody . Mr Berry said: 'Investigators talked to her and made sure she was OK. We asked if she wanted any other arrangements, and she said no. We wanted to make sure she was there of her own free will. 'It's been a long ten years. We had a lot of lookalikes we had investigated. We followed a lot of false leads, but we had to follow them all. Mary's safe, and that was the overall goal for us.' Mary has been released from custody and is now staying at an undisclosed location in the U.S., officials said. It was confirmed that she plans to testify at her mother's trial, which is due to begin next month. Genevieve Kelley had previously argued that her daughter should be allowed to testify by video, but a judge turned this request down, saying she needed to be questioned by prosecutors. Scott Kelley was jailed in Atlanta and couldn't be reached for comment. If he doesn't agree to return to New Hampshire, Berry said, extraditions proceedings will begin.","Scott Kelley, now 50, and Mary Nunes, now 19, went missing in fall 2004 .

"We're either guilty of it or we have a friend or family member who is a bandit for it: oversharing photos of our children on social media. While posting an image of your child smiling into the camera  covered in food may seem like a playful and cute move to you - it could be dangerous for your child in the long run. When it comes to uploading baby photos on social media, some feel like the more comments and  likes they get the better, but who is really looking at your photos and how far do they reach  on the net? Scroll down for video . Snap happy: We all know someone who overshares on social media - but could they be putting their kids' lives at risk? Just last week, Australian woman Jade Ruthven was lambasted on her social media account by her friends, who were so sick of her  constant updates about her baby daughter that they wrote her a scathing letter demanding she stop. The shocking letter, littered with expletives and exclamation marks told the mother that they were 'so over' the running commentary on her daughter's life. And while this may be a harsh reaction to her social obsession, social media expert Sarah-Jane Kurtini believes people need to more aware of their ramblings on the web. 'I think people just have this inbuilt need to share,' Ms Kuritini told Daily Mail Australia. Know your privacy settings . It is amazing how many parents leave on their Instagram location settings. Set your location settings to off if you do not want people to be able to figure out where you and your children live. Only share with people who care . Ask yourself if all the people you're sharing your photos with really want to see them and will they protect them in a way you would. Explore private social networks . Private social networks offer a secure way to share the pictures of your children with your family and friends. Don't take any digital photos . Ultimately the only way to be 100 per cent sure that you don't  have a digital footprint is not to have any digital photos taken but this isn't a road the vast majority of people want to go down. 'In a lot of cases it probably is fine but when you’re giving away exactly where your family life is taking place, there's a risk and it’s probably more sensible not to do it. 'People have started to be less self-aware and when everything happens they put it online. What they don’t think about is who they’re sharing it with.' While Ms Kurtini said that she understands why people can get fed up of people oversharing their kids' lives on social media sites, she was disturbed at the letter Ms Ruthven received from her so-called friends. 'Everyone came out in support of her which they should have done because bullying shouldn't be tolerated and that letter was horrific,' she said. Too many posts: Jade Ruthven, 33, pictured with Addison, has been sharing endless pictures and statuses about her baby daughter on Facebook . 'No one has come out and said that the limit is one baby photo a week or one a month, but everyone seems to know when someone has stepped over the mark.' The entrepreneur said it's hard for people to know where the line stops when it comes to posting personal details online. While a person may thrive off 'checking in' at the city's fanciest restaurant or showing friends what they're missing at the local pub, they can't treat their children's photos in the same way and should not look for the same social validation. 'One of the scary things about social media is how it makes you check yourself the whole time and second guess whether people will receive it well and it can make new mums quite anxious,' Ms Kurtini said. Harsh words: The letter was sent to an 'baby spamming' mother after the author got fed up with the amount of pictures and statuses she was writing on Facebook about her child - and it has now been shared worldwide . 'As soon as your friends like it you're just putting it into a new feed and it’s not clear where they’re going.' Ms Kurtini, who is the co-founder of Tinybeans, a private social media network for families said that although parents are worried about what the dangers of sharing on social media are, they choose to ignore the warnings. In a recent survey of social media awareness, conducted by the University of Michigan, over 74 per cent of respondents claimed they had doubts about posting baby images on the web, however they followed the crowd and did it anyway. Worryingly, 51 per cent of parents offer up personal information alongside their photos that could identify a child's location and 27 per cent have shared inappropriate pictures of their baby. They also found that more than half of mothers and one-third of fathers discuss child health and parenting on social media - and nearly three quarters of parents saying social media makes them feel less alone. 'A thing we always say is to share with those who care and don’t waste your precious family moments on people who don’t want to see them,' she said. Social validation: Nearly 70 percent of parents said they use social media to get advice from other more experienced parents and 62 % said it helped them worry less . 'The people I share with would never share them on and would protect them as much as I would. Ms Kurtini believes the message has yet to sink in with parents who continually post inappropriate snaps on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and even tag their location in the photos. Ms Kurtini believes enabling the geographical location to appear on the picture is the most worrying trend of them all. A recent study found when sharing parenting advice on social media, common topics included : . Getting kids to sleep (28%) Nutrition and eating tips (26%) Discipline (19%) Daycare/preschool (17%) Behaviour problems (13%) 'The scary thing is that they don’t know it’s happening,' she said. 'I know my privacy setting so I know that level of comfort with what I'm going to share but it looks like people don't. Especially on photo-sharing site Instagram, doting parents are sometimes inadvertently declaring their whereabouts and over time it can become clear exactly where they live. Ms Kurtini said she has spoken to mummy bloggers and celebrities who are horrified to learn that their photos can be tracked back to their home address just by the switch of one button. 'If you leave your location settings on, there’s a location tag and you can hit it and the majority of people add their photos at home so you can pretty much guess where they live,' she said. 'It terrifies me. 'I keep seeing people doing it and I want to email them saying stop it, especially high profile people.' Stories of oversharing gone wrong have been rampant in the news, with one of the most extreme examples including a phenomenon called 'digital kidnapping' reported on earlier this year. Parents were shocked to learn that strangers were 'stealing' their kids' online photos and re-sharing them as if the children were their own. Sand selfie: Despite parents being concerned over their privacy settings on social media sites, they continue to post photos online, sometimes giving away their geographical location . In other cases, children's photos have become the target of cruel jokes and cyber bullying. Among the most notorious cases in recent years was that of a Facebook group that made fun of 'ugly' babies. 'Many people are often lulled into a false sense of security thanks to the familiarity of social media and don't realise that the images or stories they post of their children may in fact be shared with a broader audience,' Ms Kurtini said. 'Parents need to approach their child's digital footprint mindfully.' The best way to do this is to know your privacy settings inside out. In many instances, it can take only a matter of mere seconds to deduce the road someone lives on from their social media post. Other precautions to take are to only share your snaps with people you trust and use a personal, private social media network.","There has been a rise in 'sharenting' - sharing photos of children online .

Chloe Owens, 27, from Swanley, Kent, came up with the idea for Bump 2 Breast when she was pregnant with daughter Lola, now three months old. Like most first-time mums, Chloe and husband David, had no idea what to expect when they brought their first child home from hospital. Chloe Owens, 27, from Swanley (left, with Lola and right with Lola and husband David) came up with the idea for Bump 2 Breast when she was pregnant . Tech-savvy mum Chloe, who designed the new app, with baby Lola, now three months . Chloe said: 'I had absolutely no idea what to do - I was forever turning to Google to find out information, and some of the things I found weren't right.' She also admits she even struggled to remember which boob she had used last when breastfeeding so included a breast-tracking feature. The mum-of-one designed the mobile app to contain a huge amount of information on everything from late stage pregnancy and birth to breastfeeding. The app, which is available on all mobile platforms, has already been downloaded 20,000 times and is getting rave reviews.

The mobile app to contain a huge amount of information on everything from late stage pregnancy and birth to breastfeeding . Users say they like it because it contains all the information in one easily-accessible place. Chloe, 27, said: 'I wanted every single piece of advice in one app. 'It prepares women for birth and labour, goes through all of the pain relief you can have and then teaches them how to look after babies after birth.' As well as breastfeeding the app covers important issues such as colic, and constipation, as well as post-natal depression and how to perform CPR in an emergency. It also contains a tracker so tired mums do not need to remember which breast they fed their child with last. Dave Owens with Chloe's bump baby during her pregnancy with Lola. Chloe's specially-designed app helps breastfeeding mothers  remember which breast to use . Mum-of-one Chloe Owens (pictured with daughter Lola) came up with the idea for Bump 2 Breast when she was pregnant, because she had no idea what to expect . Feeding from the correct breast is important so the baby has a constant supply of hindmilk, the creamier milk which takes longer to produce. App users can also share their own tips and secrets. One online reviewer wrote: 'This is just what I've been looking for - whoever designed this is a hero. 'I am so tired I keep forgetting what I need to do, so this is so helpful.'. Chloe says: 'I'd never made an app before, and never really spent much time on computers.' But it took Chloe just eight weeks to teach herself app development and she then managed to get her app accepted onto the Windows, Android and Apple stores. The app, which went live on Android on March 10, costs £1.99.

"Hollie Tillbrook, 17, was saved by two off-duty police officers when she had a heart attack in Basildon, Essex . A teenager battling bulimia who 'died' on the street from a heart attack was saved by a pair of off-duty police officers who gave her CPR. Hollie Tillbrook, 17, was out with her boyfriend in Basildon's Festival Leisure Park, Essex, when she suddenly collapsed. Doctors believe her potassium levels had plummeted to such a low level that her heart completely stopped. But luckily, two officers, believed to be from the Met Police, rushed to her side and gave Hollie life-saving CPR until an ambulance arrived. She was then rushed to Basildon hospital, where she was put into an induced coma. But the teenager then made an unexpected recovery which stunned medics. She is now recovering at her home in Leigh, Essex, despite her mother Denise Bennett being told to expect the worst. The family are now trying to find the police officers who saved Hollie so they can thank them in person. Hollie said: 'I don't remember much about what happened that day but I owe the doctors and the off-duty officers everything. 'I feel very tired still and I know I have a long recovery ahead. It's been really horrible but I am so thankful to be alive.' Ms Bennett added: 'I would love to be able to meet the police officers who saved my daughter's life and for them to get in touch . 'I really want to thank the two off duty police officers that saved my daughter's life. They are just absolute heroes. 'And also the critical care team at Basildon Hospital - the treatment she received there was brilliant.' The drama unfolded while Hollie was waiting outside the Chiquito's restaurant while her boyfriend Gary Hobbs went to park his car. When he came back, he found Hollie laying on the floor with a crowd gathered around her. Ms Bennett then received a phone call, telling her what had happened. The 17-year-old, who suffers with bulimia, had collapsed because she had a dangerous level of potassium in her body. She is now recovering at home with her mother Denise Bennett (right) Humans need potassium in higher amounts than any other mineral. Adults need around 3,500mg in their body per day. Potassium plays a fundamental role in maintaining the fluid and acid/alkaline balance of the body. It is vital for the transmission of nerve impulses and helps the heart to beat regularly. It also counterbalances sodium in the body, and is known to help lower blood pressure. To get enough you need to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, which are especially good sources because they also provide a low level of sodium. The Dietary and Nutritional Survey of British Adults (HMSO 1990) showed that the average intake of potassium is 3,187mg in males and 2,434mg in females. Compared with the daily recommendation of 3500mg intakes they are therefore low. People most at risk of marginal potassium include the elderly, athletes and manual workers who sweat out a lot of potassium and people taking certain diuretic drugs. Heavy coffee and alcohol drinkers may lack the mineral and should try to increase their dietary intake. She said: 'Fortunately a young bouncer working at the park had the presence of mind to take her phone and ring me. 'He said to me ""your daughter has collapsed and is receiving CPR"". I asked if she was responding and he just went quiet and said ""no"". The drive from Leigh to Basildon was awful. It was terrifying.' Hollie was transferred to Basildon Hospital where doctors told Ms Bennett that her heart had stopped. She had technically died for a short time, they said. The teen was then put into an induced coma. Doctors told Ms Bennett to return in the morning but to prepare for the worst. She said: 'I went home to Hollie's bedroom and was just clutching the coat she had been wearing. I was crying and crying.' But, the next morning, doctors began to bring Hollie out of the coma and she started to breathe on her own. Five days later she was allowed home. Ms Bennett said: 'I really want to warn other young people about the effects of bulimia. 'I know it is an illness but it is beyond my comprehension why these kids do this. It is not a game. It can have life-threatening consequences.' Hollie suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), which her mother believes caused her to become depressed and develop bulimia. Doctors believe that Hollie had been so sick that her potassium levels had dropped to a dangerous level.","Hollie Tillbrook's heart momentarily stopped after she fainted in Basildon .

"Nick Clegg has been accused of blaming 'everyone but himself' after making a series of excuses for the party's disastrous poll ratings. In an interview, the Lib Dem leader listed a range of reasons why different groups of former supporters are 'p***** off' and have deserted the party since 2010. And he said all those reasons were more important than any policy decisions he made including on tuition fees. Scroll down for video . Collapse: Nick Clegg has told the Economist there was a range of reasons why different groups left. Pictures: The Lib Dem leader on the campaign trail in north west England on Tuesday, April 7 . Blame game: But Mr Clegg has said none of them were to do with his policy making decisions . He was asked in an interview with the Economist magazine why Lib Dem support had 'collapsed' in the last five years. He blamed protest voters who supported the party but deserted it after it entered coalition because they didn't want to take any 'responsibility'. He also blamed the fact the Lib Dems had entered into coalition with one of the major parties. He said going in with Tories meant it was 'inevitable' that support would fall in 'anti-conservative' parts of Britain. And he said public sector workers had left because their pensions were hit and some faced job cuts. Mr Clegg said there was 'clearly a section of the support we had in 2010 that was virulently anti-Conservative'. Coallition: Mr Clegg said going in with the Tories meant they would lose 'virulently anti-Conservative' voters . Cuts: Public sector workers had left because their pensions were hit and some faced job cuts, he claimed . He said: 'They're the ones who still scream and shout blue murder and have done so without pause for breath for half a decade. And they're loud and they're noisy and they're angry. 'And that was a significant chunk of support that basically wanted to be associated with any party that didn't have the remotest sniff of power. 'There just is a constituency out there that wants to be entirely bereft of any responsibility. So they're clearly also very pissed off. It was 'wholly predictable and totally unsurprising' that public sector workers were at risk of being 'disenchanted'. He added that those factors are 'probably more important explanations than tuition fees, or this decision or that decision, although those obviously play a part'. Mr Clegg said some areas of country are a Lib Dem 'desert' and the party is now running a 'defensive' campaign focusing on winning where it retains support. 'Petulant': A Tory source has told the Daily Mail: 'This sums Nick Clegg. Its everyone's fault but his own' He admitted there are 'great parts of the country now where there is just no Liberal Democrat presence' citing the North of England and areas where they are fighting against Labour. He added: 'We're not going to waste any time, any effort, any money, any energy on places where we're not going to win—which, by the way, is the vast majority of the country.' In 2010 the Lib Dems won 23 per cent of the vote but national polls in recent months have put them on single digits. A Tory source said: 'This sums Nick Clegg. Its everyone's fault but his own. He is like a petulant child.' Despite his party facing the prospect of losing dozens of seats, Mr Clegg used the interview to stake a claim for a particular government department his party would like to run if he is back in coalition after May 7. He said he would call for the Lib Dems to be given control of education, and criticised the 'fruitless and fruitcakey' policy 'spasms' under former Education Secretary Michael Gove.","Nick Clegg lists why Lib Dem support 'collapsed' in Economist interview .

"Police searching for missing student Karen Buckley have arrested a 21-year-old man in connection with her death after discovering human remains on a  farm outside Glasgow. Officers made the grisly discovery last night as they combed rural land on the outskirts of Milngavie, some nine miles from the Scottish city. Although formal identification is yet to take place, a police spokesman said Miss Buckley's family had been informed. Police hunting for Karen Buckley have found 'human remains' on a farm outside the city and arrested a man 'in connection with her death' Police have taped off High Craigton Farm near Milngavie to the north of Glasgow after making the discovery . A number of plastic barrels were examined during the search, as well as a large metal container . Investigating: Two police stand near a sign for High Craigton Farm near Bearsden, outside Glasgow . Probe: A Police Scotland van was among the vehicles parked at High Craigton Farm near Bearsden last night . Yesterday, police investigating the nurse's disappearance said they were following a 'definite line of enquiry'. Last night police moved their search from a park in Glasgow - where the nurse's handbag had been found - to a farm, graveyard and golf course near a rural road in the Stirlingshire countryside. Police then cordoned off land to the north of Glasgow, near High Craigton farm and Windyhill Golf Club. The land lies near Bearsden, on a country road between Milngavie and Drymen. One of the fire service vehicles was said to be an Environmental Protection Unit, which deals with incidents involving hazardous chemicals and environmental contamination. Earlier this morning, a Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Police Scotland officers have recovered human remains on a farm in the north Glasgow, on the outskirts of Milngavie. 'Formal identification has yet to take place, however, police believe that they may be those of missing woman Karen Buckley. Relatives are aware. Enquiries are continuing.' Miss Buckley's parents, who had flown over from Ireland to join the hunt, said yesterday that their daughter's disappearance was totally out of character and that they were 'desperate' for her safe return. The probe had been stepped up amid 'grave concerns' for the 24-year-old's welfare. Ms Buckley, originally from Cork, was last seen on CCTV leaving the city's Sanctuary nightclub with a man at 1am on Sunday. Karen Buckley, 24,  pictured (far left) with friends before going to a nightclub on the night she went missing . A spokesman for Police Scotland said last night that officers are now following 'a definite line of inquiry' Police yesterday sealed off High Craigton Farm near Bearsden, outside Glasgow, in the search for Ms Buckley. Sniffer dogs, forensic teams and specialist divers were all involved in the search . Last night, there was  intense activity at the farm when fire engines and major incident trucks moved in . This map shows the outbuildings in woods near to High Craigton Farm, between Glasgow and the Stirlingshire village of Drymen, where 'human remains' were found . He told police he thought she was fine and had arranged transport home, some four miles across the city. But she never arrived. Yesterday, officers searched a park in the north-east of the city, Dawsholm Park. Miss Buckley's black handbag - which she was carrying on the night of her disappearance - was later found there by a member of the public. Divers also searched the River Kelvin, which borders the area. A police helicopter also circled between the villages of Milngavie and Drymen, where a grey car linked to the search was seen on Monday. With the time since Miss Buckley went missing passing 70 hours, police stepped up the search yesterday . Yesterday, forensics teams searched around the flat where she was last seen, as concerns grew about her safety . Detective Superintendent Jim Kerr has said: 'Our absolute priority is to find Karen Buckley' The student is said to have left a flat in the north-west of the city at 4am intending to walk home . Friends say Miss Buckley had left the nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning without collecting her coat, telling them she was going to the toilet. They have since said that Miss Buckley had been drinking but was not drunk. CCTV cameras filmed her talking to a man outside the club before getting into a car and travelling to his flat in nearby Kelvindale. Miss Buckley, who is brunette and 5ft 2in, was wearing a black jumpsuit and red heels when she was seen leaving the flat in Kelvindale at around 4am. A team of police officers resume the search for Miss Buckley in Dawsholm Park in Glasgow yesterday morning . The family of Miss Buckley, who is from Cork in the Republic of Ireland, have flown to Scotland to help with the search for the Glasgow Caledonian University student. Her mother Marion told a press conference in Glasgow: 'We just want Karen home safely, we are desperate. She is our only daughter, we love her dearly. 'If anybody has any information please come forward, we would dearly appreciate it.' Her father John Buckley, 62, added: 'We are extremely concerned for her. We are desperate to get her back and safe with her family - she is our only daughter, we love her dearly and just want her to come home safe and sound. 'She always keeps in contact with her family and friends to let them know where she is and what she is up to. 'To not return to her flat or be in contact with her pals - not responding to texts and calls to her mobile is very, very worrying as it is so out of character.' Two months ago Miss Buckley  moved to Glasgow two months ago to study occupational therapy at the university. She previously worked as a nurse in Essex. Police have found Miss Buckley's handbag, believed to be that circled (left), in a park where the search continued yesterday (right) As well as a thorough search of Dawsholm Park, officers were seen scouring the gardens near a flat . They taped off a large pile of rubbish around the back of the building and sifted through the bins and waste . Detective Superintendent Jim Kerr, from Police Scotland's major investigations teams, said yesterday: 'We've traced the man she was with in Dorchester Avenue. He believes he was intimate with her at his flat consensually in the early hours of Sunday.' The police officer added: 'From what we can see, she does not appear to be under duress, there's no signs of a struggle or reluctance on her part to leave the club.' Police are also keen to find out more about a grey car that was seen on the roads between Milngavie and Drymen north of Glasgow between 11am and 3pm on Monday. Mr Kerr said: 'The activity of this grey car on the Monday is something that we're a wee bit concerned about. This car has been seen at various locations on these roads and I want to know why.' Speaking of Miss Buckley, Mr Kerr added: 'We know she left the club with her handbag – which has been found - but left her coat behind and so far has not returned to pick it up. 'Why she left so suddenly without telling her friends we just don't know – it was very much out of character – she is usually very good at keeping in touch with pals.' Miss Buckley's parents Marian and John have travelled to Glasgow from Cork to help in the search . He added: 'We are gravely concerned that Karen has come to some harm, whether that is down to foul play, criminality or she has taken unwell or had an accident is obviously still to be established.' Meanwhile, in Ms Buckley's home in north Cork a special prayer service was arranged for local people to show support for the family. The private Mass of Hope, as it was being described, was held last night at the Church of Saint Michael The Archangel, Mourneabbey, near the town of Mallow. William Crean, Catholic Bishop of Cloyne, led the prayers and urged the people of Mourneabbey to pray for Ms Buckley's safe return and to pray for her parents, and her brothers Brendan, Kieran and Damian. 'I invite all people of goodwill to join with me in prayer for everyone who is involved in the search for Karen at this time,' he said. The search continued this morning as officers combed the area  for potential clues .

"David Bulman (pictured) left his wife Lubova with a black eye after repeatedly punching her in the face . A bad-tempered managing director repeatedly punched his wife in the face after he shouted at her for not doing the ironing. David Bulman, 55, and his wife Lubova had a row after he criticised her for not doing the chores or checking to see if his shirt buttons were missing. His wife threw all his shirts outside, but he followed her and shouted at her before he pulled her hair and punched her several times in the face. Neighbours called the police after Bulman drove away, damaging a gate post and a van, leaving his frightened wife with a black eye and a lump on her head. Bulman was given a 12-month community order after he pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Bristol Crown Court. Recorder Jim Tindal also ordered Bulman to complete rehabilitation and programme requirements, and not to intimidate, harass or pester his wife. He said: 'As a result of an argument in which things were said on both sides you lost your temper, you lost control and you behaved appallingly. 'You punched your partner several times and got into your car. 'You hit a wall and your blood was up. You were not thinking straight and as a result your partner sustained unpleasant injuries.' He added: 'We sometimes say behaviour is out of character. 'Sometimes the public is a little bit sceptical about that, but in your case it is true. 'You have had almost 40 years of keeping out of trouble in which you have been running a business, employing people and participating in society in a number of ways.'

He was also ordered not to intimidate, harass or pester his wife . Julian Howells, prosecuting, said the 'defendant was doing less' and the relationship deteriorated, with the pair arguing and her mentioning his 'personal habits'. They argued about the ironing and he attacked her, before leaving in his car from their home in Clevedon. Sam Jones, defending, said Bulman had not been in trouble with the law for 30 years and had suffered a stroke a number of years ago. He added: 'These proceedings have had a punitive element for him. He shows deep remorse and very real upset at the breakdown of the relationship with his wife. 'Mr Bulman is a successful businessman, the managing director of a company in Bristol. 'It has a significant turnover. He is a director and they employ 15 people.' Bulman was also ordered to pay £500 compensation, £260 court costs and a £60 victim surcharge and as he left court the recorder told him: 'The onus is on you to keep your temper.'","David Bulman, 55, left his wife with a black eye and a lump on her head .

"This time last year the world was shocked by the abduction of 276 Nigerian schoolgirls who were kidnapped from their school by Boko Haram militants. A-listers from Michelle Obama to Angelina Jolie lent their support to the #bringbackourgirlscampaign in the hope the children could be saved. But Unicef have revealed that a year later, more than 200 of these girls remain in captivity while scores of other children have gone missing since. Scroll down for video .

Children as young as four are being used within the ranks of Boko Haram – as cooks, porters and look-outs. Those are the lucky ones, others are trained to fight, forced to be suicide bombers or sold as sex slaves. According to accounts by escapees, young women and girls who have been abducted have been subjected to forced marriage, forcible religious conversion from Christianity to Islam, physical and psychological abuse and forced labour and rape. Thanks to the violent conflict in the region, 1.2m people have been forced to flee their home, displaced inside Nigeria or crossing into neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger. Many have had to run away in fear as their homes and villages were attacked by Boko Haram militants, causing a large number of children to be separated from their parents amidst the violent chaos. One of them is 15-year-old Ahmid who is the subject of one of Unicef's latest campaign films.

I worried most about hunger there was nothing to eat and nowhere to sleep. I worry about my parents.' Ahmind has been supported at a Unicef Centre where children are encouraged to express their grief through art and given access to education. He said: 'It was a policeman who urged me to go to school. At first I couldn't be bothered because I was thinking about my parents. 'I have nobody here but he told me to go to school. He said one day I will see my parents again if they are still alive. So now I go to school everyday.' Mohammed Tijani, a social worker, left, speaks with Shatumi Samon, 17, in the Gire 2 camp for internally displaced people, near Yola, the capital of Adamawa .

The teacher told us that Boko Haram was here and he told us to run to the river. So we run away. 'Our teacher started to cross the river and then he stopped to make sure that we could also cross. But we could not cross, it was too deep. 'Then a man came on a motorcycle. He said he wasn't from Boko Haram and he was looking for help. He asked us to come with him to look for food. When we got out of the water, he took out his gun and pointed at us saying he was Boko Haram. Then he took us.' Sani was freed thanks to his father paying for him to be released and his family are now at a Unicef run refugee camp in outside Diffa city in the Southeast of Niger. He remains psychologically scarred by his experienced, which he has been encouraged to express through art. Pupils in a school at a refugee camp for people displaced by the Boko Haram conflict, many of the children at such camps have been separated from their parents . Unicef and COOPI are working hand in hands with the Government of Niger to find a way to reach all children in need of help and give them support and education . 'I did this drawing to show what Boko Haram did to us,' he said describing one of his pictures. 'They came, shot people and cut the throat of others. Here it's a member of Boko Haram burning a vehicle. Here it’s someone who had his throat cut. There burnt cars and here a burnt phone antenna.' Like Sani, many children saw terrible things during the attacks. While it is often hard to talk about the days they left their home to run for their life, drawing is an easier way to address what took place. Children participate in group activities to help them express themselves. They can also channel their trauma through song, and games. These recreational events also give them a sense of normalcy during this tenuous time. Yagana, 10, pictured drawing about her experience when Boko Haram attacked her village .

Unicef and COOPI are working hand in hands with the Government of Niger to find a way to reach all children in need of help. Many have seen parents, siblings, relatives or neighbours killed, tortured or abducted. Many have had to run for their lives and walk for days to reach safety. Others have been exposed to extreme violence and abuse. 'Some children are very shy,' said Marzia Vigliaroni from COOPI, a Unicef partner in charge of managing a child-friendly space in Diffa. 'They won’t speak or participate in our activities; they need psycho-social support. Unicef wants to free children from abuse and fighting so they can have the happy childhood they deserve . 'We ask them to make drawings of their experience during the attack. They draw people with slit throats and people drowning in the river. This shows us how deeply affected children are. We work with them individually; we try to help them forget the traumatizing events they have experienced and continue their lives like other children and forget what they had to live through.' As well as helping children through the refugee camps, the charity are also working to return abducted children to their families and demobilise children involved in fighting.
