"My son is ahead of me, his kayak skimming across the slate blue water. A fish jumps. A battalion of cormorants lands on a tree. I pull up my paddle and the air settles around me, as serene as the lake. Then James comes shooting across, spraying me with water as he turns on his paddle. ‘There’s a great beach over there. Let’s swim.’ James is nearly 16, and I’m painfully aware that my years of holidaying with him are coming to a close. My last choices all ended in teenage snits. Then a friend suggested a back-to-nature break in Poland. Unknown: Wigry National Park, in north-east Poland, is the furthest outreach of the Masurian Lakes . Our destination is Wigry National Park, in the north-east of the country, close to the Lithuanian border. It is the furthest outreach of the Masurian Lakes (Poland’s Lake District), and the most sparsely populated. Our base is an unassuming but pristine hotel right on the Wigry lakeshore. The National Park snuggles around it, a mass of primeval forest and waterways that are home to otter and beaver, wolf and elk. The area is unspoiled, but it is also exceedingly well set-up for outdoorsy pursuits. The hotel rents mountain bikes and Nordic walking poles, and you could cycle or hike for days around the well-marked trails. Come and discover: The area is unspoiled, but it is also exceedingly well set-up for outdoor pursuits . Or you can take to the water. Whichever way you turn, there is another beach, another jetty, another twisting corner of Wigry — the name means ‘winding’ — and it has the longest and most meandering shoreline of all of Poland’s lakes. The food is solid, verging on stolid, big piles of comfort stacked high and priced low — a lightweight £3 a plate. We need the calories, with the amount of exercise we are notching up. We cycle through the forest, keeping a hopeful eye out for wildlife. But we are too noisy, what with our clanking gears and my muffled grunts as I hit yet another tree root. A holiday of an old-fashioned kind: Jane found a refreshing simplicity to this pretty corner of Poland . It is all so wholesome that, as we sit by another pristine lake, watching the sun dip down, I find myself singing old campfire songs as James takes another swim. The place has somehow transported me back to my own teens, to a time when holidays did not need to be sophisticated. ‘You know what? I’ve loved this holiday,’ says James, as we sit for the last time on the hotel jetty, sharing a bar of chocolate and watching the stars. I can’t argue. ‘Me too,’ I tell him. A wealth of water and wow factor: Jane chose the region for an active holiday with her teenage son . Ryanair (0871 246 0000, www.ryanair.com) flies from Stansted to Kaunas from £49 return. Double rooms at the Hotel nad Wigrami, Gawrych Ruda (0048 87 563 59 59, www.hotelnadwigrami.pl) cost from £50 per night B&B. Mountain bikes and kayaks can be hired.

"An aspiring model sobbed uncontrollably yesterday as she was convicted of luring a professional gambler to his death. Leonie Granger, 25, targeted playboy Mehmet Hassan, 56, after spotting him flashing a roll of £50 notes at a casino in London’s West End. The honeytrap killer used her good looks to befriend the poker player, who showered her with gifts, cash and trips to fancy restaurants. Scroll down for video . Killing: Leonie Granger, left, has been found guilty of manslaughter over the death of Mehmet Hassan, right . But after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and a second thug could get inside. They tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings. Police found damning mobile phone footage of Granger and the men laughing and throwing around £50 notes. Yesterday, Granger wept as an Old Bailey jury cleared her of murder but found her guilty of the manslaughter of Mr Hassan. Lure: Granger, pictured with Mr Hassan in the casino, took advantage of him being a 'soft target' Her boyfriend Kyrron Jackson and his friend Nicholas Chandler, both 28, were convicted of murder, robbery, false imprisonment and firearms offences. The men were leading members of a gang who twice held up a South Kensington casino at gunpoint weeks earlier. Violence erupted in the dock within moments of the verdicts as Chandler swore at the judge and sparked a scuffle. He was dragged out in handcuffs. Granger cowered in the corner of the dock, shouting: ‘Are you mad?’ at a woman prison officer as she pulled shut the door to prevent anyone escaping. The tattooed killer was a care worker at a home in Gillingham for elderly dementia patients. But the ‘party girl’ toured West End nightspots every evening dressed in daring outfits with plunging necklines, stalking wealthy revellers. Granger wept in the dock as she was found guilty of luring Mr Hassan to his death in March last year . Haul: Chandler is pictured throwing around £50 notes which he stole from Mr Hassan . Granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two . She met Mr Hassan at Palm Beach Casino, Mayfair, in February last year and introduced herself as ‘Rachel’. They exchanged phone numbers and he asked her out, texting: ‘Maybe with your brains and my money we can make you into a great player.’ The next month the pair met up for drinks and gambling. Mr Hassan won £2,000 and gave her £1,000 ‘spending money’. A taxi driver overheard Granger talking on her mobile phone, reporting: ‘This guy is a professional gambler. He has never worked a day in his life.’ The next time the pair went to a casino, Mr Hassan told staff he was on a date and appeared tipsy on champagne. Other employees remembered joking that the kissing couple should ‘get a room’. At midnight, they went back to Mr Hassan’s Islington flat – where police believe Granger helped Jackson and Chandler get inside before leaving. As she was driven home, another taxi driver heard her say: ‘Don’t tell me the money’s not there. I saw it … look in the drawer … look under the cabinet.’ Facing jail: Jackson, left, and Chandler, right, have both been convicted of murder . Gang: Granger, left, helped Kyrron Jackson, centre, and Nicholas Chandler, right, rob and kill the gambler . The accomplices met up later that day and were filmed spraying a room with £50 notes, while Jackson, wearing a gas mask, stuffed cash into his underwear. Police found Mr Hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm. His knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek. Investigators found he had suffered a ‘vicious and sustained attack’ – probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money. Honeytrap: Granger, 25, convinced the 56-year-old victim she wanted a relationship with him . 'Couple': The pair are pictured together in the Palm Beach Casino in central London before Mr Hassan's death . They fled with £3,000, his TV and mobile phone, but were caught after Granger’s phone records were examined. Speaking after the verdicts yesterday, Mr Hassan’s family said his murder will ‘haunt them forever’. His daughter Stephanie Hassan added: ‘Every day we miss him and we love him.’ Granger admitted being part of a honeytrap robbery plan. She was convicted of manslaughter and false imprisonment. Jackson and Chandler were convicted of murder, robbery and conspiracy to falsely imprison – as well as two other casino robberies. All three will be sentenced on April 28.

"Nasa has spotted an exoplanet 13,000 light-years away, making it one of the most distant planets ever found. Known as 'Ogle-2014-BLG-0124Lb,' the gas giant was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Ogle Warsaw Telescope in Chile. The planet is half as massive as Jupiter and could help astronomers gain a better understanding of the distribution of planets in the Milky Way. Astronomers have spotted one of the most distant planets ever found. Known as 'Ogle-2014-BLG-0124Lb,' the gas giant was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Ogle Warsaw Telescope in Chile. Most of the planets we know about are around 10-100 times closer . The planet was discovered using a technique known as microlensing. This happens when one star happens to pass in front of another, and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify and brighten the more distant star's light. If that foreground star happens to have a planet in orbit around it, the planet might cause a blip in the magnification. Astronomers are using these blips to find and characterise planets tens of thousands of light-years away in the central bulge of our galaxy, where star crossings are more common. Most of the planets we know about are around 10-100 times closer than Ogle-2014-BLG-0124, claims Jennifer Yee of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. 'We don't know if planets are more common in our galaxy's central bulge or the disk of the galaxy, which is why these observations are so important,' she added. The discovery demonstrates that Spitzer - from its unique perch in space - can be used to help solve the puzzle of how planets are spread out in our galaxy. The planet was discovered using a technique known as microlensing. This happens when one star happens to pass in front of another, and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify and brighten the more distant star's light. If that foreground star happens to have a planet in orbit around it, the planet might cause a blip in the magnification. Astronomers are using these blips to find and characterise planets tens of thousands of light-years away in the central bulge of our galaxy, where star crossings are more common. Our sun is located in the suburbs of the galaxy, about two-thirds of the way out from the centre. The microlensing technique as a whole has yielded about 30 planet discoveries so far, with the farthest residing about 25,000 light-years away. 'Microlensing experiments are already detecting planets from the solar neighborhood to almost the center of the Milky Way,' said co-author Andrew Gould of The Ohio State University, Columbus. 'And so they can, in principle, tell us the relative efficiency of planet formation across this huge expanse of our galaxy.' This infographic explains how the Spitzer Space Telescope can be used in tandem with a telescope on the ground to measure the distances to planets. The planet was dicovered via microlensing which happens when one star passes in front of another, and its gravity acts as a lens to magnify the more distant star's light . Microlensing complements other planet-hunting tools, such as the Kepler mission, which has found more than 1,000 planets closer to home. But it faces one key problem: This method can't always precisely narrow down the distance to the stars and planets being observed. While a passing star may magnify the light of a more distant star, it rarely can be seen itself, making the task of measuring how far away it is challenging. Of the 30 planets discovered with microlensing so far, roughly half cannot be pinned down to a precise location. The result is like a planetary treasure map lacking in X's. That's where Spitzer can help out, thanks to its remote Earth-trailing orbit. Spitzer circles our sun, and is currently about 128 million miles (207 million km) away from Earth. That's farther from Earth than Earth is from our sun. When Spitzer watches a microlensing event simultaneously with a telescope on Earth, it sees the star brighten at a different time, due to the large distance between the two telescopes and their unique vantage points. This technique is generally referred to as parallax. 'Spitzer is the first space telescope to make a microlens parallax measurement for a planet,' said Yee. Data from the microlensing event is seen here.  If the foreground star is circled by a planet, the planet's gravity can alter the magnification over a shorter period, seen in the plot in the form of spikes and a dip . 'Traditional parallax techniques that employ ground-based telescopes are not as effective at such great distances.' Using space telescopes to observe microlensing events is tricky. Ground telescopes send out alerts to the astronomy community when an event starts, but the activity can quickly fade, lasting on average about 40 days. In the case of the newfound planet, the duration of the microlensing event happened to be unusually long, about 150 days. Both Spitzer and Ogle's telescopes detected the telltale planetary blip in the magnification, with Spitzer seeing it 20 days earlier. This time delay between viewing of the event by Ogle and Spitzer was used to calculate the distance to the star and its planet. Knowing the distance allowed the scientists also to determine the mass of the planet, which is about half that of Jupiter. 'We've mainly explored our own solar neighborhood so far,' said Sebastiano Calchi Novati, a Visiting Sagan Fellow at Nasa's Exoplanet Science Institute. 'Now we can use these single lenses to do statistics on planets as a whole and learn about their distribution in the galaxy.'","Most of the planets we know about are around 10-100 times closer .

"Police are using tiny plastic Lego figures in a campaign to warn people about the rising tide of housebreakings in Scotland. Officers from Police Scotland’s Edinburgh division – which has seen break-ins soar by nearly 40 per cent – posted pictures of the Lego models on their Facebook page as part of a move to raise awareness of crime. Last night, victims branded the move as ‘insensitive’ and ‘a joke’. Hands up: Plastic Lego figures are being used by police as part of a quirky campaign to warn people about the dangers of housebreaking. But the move received a backlash, with victims branding it as 'a joke' The police internet posting showed scenes of Lego criminals attempting to break into people’s homes before being arrested by officers – and were accompanied by a Scots dialect poem giving advice. But the publicity stunt was met with criticism from politicians and victims who said officers should concentrate on solving real crimes. Break-ins in Edinburgh rose by 38.7 per cent in the 12 months to April 2014, with 4,101 homes hit. Across Scotland, housebreakings rose 4 per cent to 22,272 over the same period. The row will fuel concerns over the number of officers spending their days in police stations, rather than pounding the beat. Last year, critics claimed many officers were having to ‘backfill’ – being taken off beat duties to carry out office jobs previously covered by civilian workers. Be vigilant: The Lego figures are arranged into scenes with robbers and police officers to provide safety tips and highlight the importance of securing people's homes. Last night Police Scotland defended the campaign . Last night, Police Scotland defended the campaign, pointing out that the photos have been viewed almost 350,000 times. But Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: ‘With housebreaking on the increase, officers should be out solving real crimes, rather than relying on Lego to try and prevent it.’ The pictures are part of an anti-housebreaking drive, Operation RAC. They were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling the city’s housebreaking problem. One image shows a Lego figurine in a hat and standing beside a door. Another shows a man standing on a ledge with another figure below. Poems were posted alongside the pictures, with one reading: ‘Staying in or goin oot? Lock the windaes ‘n’ front door. A simple step maybe, that’ll prevent access tae them on the chore.’ ‘Keep yer hame safe when yer oot on the go, . By usin’ timers on lights ‘n’ even the radio, . Timers are cheap ‘n’ it takes seconds tae do, . And it cuid prevent ye fae calling the boys in blue.’ ‘Look how ye get access tae the back o’ yer hame, . If it’s easy others wull dae the same, Restrict access tae the rear, . And help prevent others fae choring yer gear.’ One victim of housebreaking, Tamara Swanson from Newhaven, Edinburgh, was not impressed. The 20-year-old was alone in her home last July when an intruder attacked her as she was getting out of the shower. The man grabbed her from behind, punched her and then tried to strangle her before she managed to escape. Speaking last night, she said police had done little to help her since the incident. ‘We had to keep phoning them [Police Scotland],’ she said. ‘I’m still going to a psychiatrist and they’re putting a lot of anxiety down to this. I wasn’t sleeping for months. I didn’t feel safe at all.’ Speaking about the online campaign, she said: ‘They’re [people online] not going to look at it and think, “That’s interesting” and do anything about it.’ Her father, Peter Swanson, added: ‘Why would they bother doing that? Lego? It’s a joke. Police Scotland is a waste of time. ‘It’s a money-saving thing, obviously to the detriment of policing. The cartoons are stupid. Get the guys back on the street.’ Another housebreaking victim, Michael Wright said the pictures were ‘terrible’ and ‘insensitive’. His house in the Inch area of Edinburgh was broken into just before Christmas, with thieves taking money he had set aside for presents, as well as his Ford Fiesta. Mr Wright, whose young son was at home sleeping at the time of the incident, said: ‘Could they not have used the resources elsewhere, rather than reconstructing scenes of burglaries with Lego sets? ‘When I saw that, I thought it was just insensitive to the victims of burglaries. They have nothing better to be doing than sitting behind their computer on Facebook.’ Watch out: The campaign was shared on social media with fun poems. Pictures were uploaded days after police vowed to target a group of 40 criminals suspected of fuelling Edinburgh's housebreaking problem . He added: ‘Most of the people who are being targeted are older folks in their 80s. They don’t have Facebook or social media, so how are they supposed to get the message?’ Chief Supt Mark Williams, Edinburgh divisional commander, said: ‘Over 354,000 people have already seen this campaign on social media giving us significant reach for crime prevention messages. ‘Social media is an important tool for communicating with the public. It allows us to provide vital information on crime prevention and advice on keeping safe.’","Officers posted pictures of Lego models on their Facebook page .

"A romantic boyfriend gave his partner the surprise of her life when he asked her to marry him by hiring a giant billboard at the side of a road she passes on her way to work. Paul Bakewell, 35, from Walsall, West Mids, secretly designed a poster which he then had emblazoned on the 20ft-tall advertising hoarding and covered over. The dad-of-one arranged for his partner Tara Barber, 32, to be driven past the billboard by her boss who pretended they were going to a business meeting on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Paul Bakewell, 35, proposed to partner Tara Barber, 32, by asking her to marry him using a giant billboard on the A34, in Walsall, West Mids . Hairdresser Tara (pictured left), was shocked when her car pulled up to the billboard and her partner, gas fitter Paul (pictured right) got down on one knee . 'Tara, you've changed my life. Will you marry me?': The billboard was 20ft-tall and 30ft-wide and also featured pictures of the couple . But the pretty hairdresser was left speechless when the car stopped at the 30ft-wide poster on the side of the A34 in Walsall, West Mids. The billboard featured pictures of the couple and the words: 'Tara you've changed my life. Will you marry me?' Romantic Paul - who had arranged for friends and family to hide on the other side of the road - then went down on one knee and proposed to Tara, who said yes. Gas fitter Paul, who lives with Tara in Walsall, said he didn't sleep for two days because of nerves from planning the big surprise. Paul left the house at 4am on Friday to help put the poster on the giant billboard - telling Tara he had been called out to an emergency gas leak . Surprise! Unsuspecting Tara Baker (pictured right), was driven to the billboard by her boss (pictured left), and was shocked by the scene in front of her . Drive-through proposal! A big crowd of family members and friends had gathered on a green opposite the billboard to watch the proposal, and cheered and tooted horns after Paul got down on one knee . It's a yes! Tara Barber, 32, admitted that it was a well-kept secret and that she had no idea . He added: 'It was definitely the scariest thing I have ever done in my life. I was putting myself out there in front of so many people but I was confident she would say yes. 'I have never been so nervous in my life planning this. It was completely nerve-wracking, I hadn't slept for two days before Friday. 'I had been to ask her dad first to do it the traditional way and her family said she would say yes. 'I'm from just down the road and I know Tara drives this way into work in Walsall every day so I arranged for her boss to drive her there pretending they had a meeting. 'When she arrived she was so shocked and I think more nervous than me when she realised what was happening. 'She didn't have a clue. I thought it would be something special to make a grand gesture.' The 20ft-tall 30ft-wide billboard featured images of the couple from their relationship . The billboard was positioned on the side of major road, the A34 in Walsall, West Mids, a route that Tara regularly takes to work . 'I wanted to do something different. Anyone can propose at a table at a restaurant or at home but I wanted it to be something she would remember.' Mother-of-one Tara, who has a son Carrick, six, from a previous relationship, added: 'I was totally clueless, it was the best kept secret. 'My boss pulled over and I thought there had been a car accident because there were so many people by the side of the road. 'Then she started crying and I saw the billboard and my legs just went to jelly, I couldn't feel them at all. 'I had no hesitation to saying yes. It was incredible, we'll never forget this. 'It was the best day of my life and I am glad he did a grand gesture.' The 35-year-old gas fitter from Walsall had wanted to do something different to ask his partner to marry him . Paul left the house at 4am on Friday to help put the poster on the giant billboard - telling Tara he had been called out to an emergency gas leak. When he originally planned the proposal, he was disappointed to find out that the advertising space had been bought up for several years by Homeserve. But fortunately, the company agreed to let him use the advertising space.

"A not-for-profit group that organised seminars featuring US anti-vaccination campaigner Sherri Tenpenny before she had to cancel due to threats of violence has had its charity status cancelled. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) made the announcement about Get Rid of Sids Project on Wednesday. The organisation is run by well-known Brisbane anti-vaccination campaigner Stephanie Messenger who has penned a number of children's books, including Melanie's Marvelous Measles. Scroll down for video . Get Rid of Sids, which had been organising events featuring anti-vaccination campaign Sherri Tenpenny, has had its charity status revoked . In a statement, the ACNC said it had revoked Get Rid of Sids Project's charity status after a review into its operations and activities. The decision was effective from April 1 and the organisation had 60 days to lodge an appeal. The ACNC was unable to provide any more details of why this had happened because of 'secrecy provisions' within its Act. This means Get Rid of Sids Project will lose its right to tax concessions and its deductible gift recipient status. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the organisation for comment. Earlier this year, Get Rid of Sids Project ran into controversy when it invited Dr Tenpenny to speak at a number of seminars across Australia. The organisation is headed by prominent Brisbane anti-vaccination campaigner Stephanie Messenger . Her planned trip caused uproar and was repeatedly boycotted by Australian doctors and venues. Following a number of cancellations, Dr Tenpenny made the decision to cancel her remaining talks due to consistent threats of violence from 'anti-free-speech terrorists'. Sherri Tenpenny was due to speak at a number of events in Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne and the Gold Coast. In a statement posted to social media at the time, she cited a number of reasons why she had decided not to come to Australia, saying a large number of violent threats, including bomb threats, had been made against venue owners and their families. 'The determination was made to protect the speakers, the public and the venue owners as pro-vaccine extremists have made continual, anonymous threats of vandalism and violence,' the statement read. Earlier this year, Get Rid of Sids Project ran into controversy when it invited Dr Tenpenny to speak at a number of seminars across Australia . Dr Tenpenny revealed that she had also cancelled a private holiday in Australia due to concerns for her own personal safety. 'I was coming to speak as an invited guest. However, given the level of hostility that has transpired over the last three weeks, and for the sake of my own personal safety, I have also cancelled my planned vacation in Australia,' she said. Stephanie Messenger, who heads Get Rid of Sids Project and had invited Dr Tenpenny to speak, is the controversial author of Melanie's Marvelous Measles. The message of the book, which tells children having the measles is fun, was panned by reviewers on Amazon. Messenger said the aim of her book was to 'educate children on the benefits of having measles and how you can heal from them naturally and successfully'. But people on the internet had other ideas about her picture book, with the book receiving 872 ratings of one star. While the reviews sarcastically thanked Messenger for her contribution.","Anti-vaccination group Get Rid of Sids has had its charity status revoked .

"A Mayfair mansion that was once the site of a milking parlour has gone on the market for £25million. The four-bedroom property in central London's Farm Street has all the trappings of modern luxury with an indoor swimming pool, gym, lift, cinema room and roof terrace. One hundred and fifty years ago however it was used to house cows for milking on one of London's busiest trading streets. Originally used as a milking parlour, it  became a depot before being knocked down in the 19th Century. In 2011 developers took over the site and demolished the house to make way for the plush mansion which now sits in its place. At 8,139 square ft, it is on the market for £25million. A newly-built mansion that was constructed on the site of a former milking parlour in Mayfair has gone on the market for £25million . The house is decorated throughout with modern furnishings and plush carpets. Among its features is a private lift and guest cloakroom . A grand piano sits in the marbled hall on one of the floor's houses. A 14-piece dining table is also featured in the luxury dining room . An indoor swimming pool now takes the place of what once would have been a milking shed in the 18th and 19th Century . A cinema room is one of the many modern features in the property. It was built in 2011 after developers knocked down the original structure . Impressive artwork throughout the house adorns its walls. It is being sold for £25million by estate agents Wetherell and Knight Frank . An opulent 14-place dining table is found on the first floor of the luxury property which also has its own lift . London's milking parlours date back to Tudor times, with Farm Street serving as hub of agricultural trade for years. Cows were brought there from the grazing areas of Peckham, Holland Park and Hampstead heath and sold to local butchers. Alongside the parlours was an abattoir and pub, the Punch Bowl, which remains. Guy Ritchie and Madonna bought the pub while they were married and it quickly became a celebrity favourite. Mr Ritchie sold it in 2013 to the Alexander Langlands Pearse. Inside the modern mansion are four bedrooms including a master suite which occupies the entire second floor. The lower ground floors feature a swimming pool complex with mosaic-lined pool, steam room, gym, shower and changing facilities, kitchenette, guest cloakroom and media room. It also has a private lift, marble flooring, a sweeping spiral staircase and a dining room which can seat 14. Speaking of the property, Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'This recently built house is an outstanding example of contemporary living in historic Mayfair at its very best. 'As the location of Mayfair’s dairy, the interesting and unusual history allowed for the construction of a house on a commercial depot site, without the usual restrictions of historic listing controls. 'The result is an open flowing family house providing spacious rooms and generous ceiling heights rarely found in historic Mayfair.' The house has four bedrooms which all come with their own en suite bathrooms and is set over four floors. It was built in 2011 . One of the four bedrooms in the house is finished with sleek white, grey and black furniture and soft furnishings throughout . Another of the guest rooms in the luxury mansion furnished in cream and peach. The house has been described by estate agents as a 'flowing family house' One of the double bathrooms in the house has a deep marble bath, his and her's sinks and a large, walk-in shower . The property's master suite takes up the entire second floor with a huge bedroom and 'living space' which features a stunning fireplace . The dressing room in the master suite boasts high-gloss white wardrobes, fluffy white carpet and a grey bench for resting .

"A former college student is suing her school over claims she wasn't allowed to audition for the dance team because of her weight. Phylise Davis-Bowens, who attended Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, for their 'transformative leadership' program at the age of 37, launched a lawsuit after she alleged she was not allowed to try out for the 14 Karat Gold dancers. Mrs Davis-Bowens, a substitute public school teacher in Miami who married last Valentine's Day, told Daily Mail Online on Monday that she was discriminated against because of her weight and missed out on part of the academic experience. Phylise Davis-Bowens, 42, who attended Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, is suing her former college because she was not allowed to try out for the 14 Karat Gold dancers in 2009 . The 14 Karat Gold dancers are regular performers at sporting events related to the Florida university . The student, who had been dancing since the age of 16, had wanted to join the dance troupe to use her performance work as part of her thesis in 2009. Band director Donovan Wells told her she could try out for the team if she lost 20lb, she said. Mrs Davis-Bowens went on to lose 16lb in one month in order to try out but was still denied an audition for the dance troupe. After around a year, she had lost a total of 60lb. She told Daily Mail Online: 'I wanted to join because of my talent but the coach said I didn't have the body type. But to me, I have two arms and two legs which is what I needed.' The weight discrimination is of particular importance to Mrs Davis-Bowens because she lost her sister at the age of 37 to a gastric bypass because she was obese and felt under pressure to quickly lose weight. The 42-year-old said she also has ongoing health issues from losing weight quickly. According to their Facebook page, the 14 Karat Gold dancers are made up of college students who perform alongside the Marching Wildcats during college sporting events. In a statement to Daily Mail Online on Monday, a university spokeswoman said: 'Bethune-Cookman University was made aware today that a complaint was filed. 'We are currently investigating this matter. B-CU is an equal opportunity institution and encourage all students to be actively involved in our campus extracurricular offerings.' Ms Davis-Bowens' lawyer, David Glasser, told Daily Mail Online on Monday that his client had brought the lawsuit to make a point about discrimination and was seeking unspecified damages in district court which can award more than $15,000. The 42-year-old graduated from the college in 2011 and went on to teach in the Miami-Dade public school district. She also claimed that the school did not allow her to attend the graduation ceremony and sent her diploma in the mail. The 42-year-old woman (left) said she lost 16lb in a month to try out for the dance troupe but was still denied an audition. She went on to lose 60lb in a year .

"Doctors are putting the health of women and their babies at risk by performing caesarean sections too readily, UN officials warn . Doctors are putting the health of women and their babies at risk by performing caesarean sections too readily, UN officials warn. They say the procedure should only be carried out when ‘medically necessary’ because it can lead to infections and even death. Just over a quarter of women giving birth in England now have a caesarean and the rate has more than doubled since the early 1990s. This includes a growing number of women opting to have planned caesareans because they are very anxious about giving birth naturally. But last night experts from the World Health Organisation, the UN’s public health agency, said this figure should ideally be between just 10 per cent and 15 per cent, due to the dangers and costs involved. In a statement, they said: ‘Although it can save lives, caesarean section is often performed without medical need, putting women and their babies at risk of short- and long-term health problems.’ They added that the procedure can lead to ‘significant complications, disability or death’ and diverts precious money away from the needs of other patients. A planned caesarean costs the NHS an average of £2,369, compared to a natural birth at £1,665. The WHO statement sharply contradicts current NHS guidelines, which say the procedure should be offered to women even when there is no medical justification. The watchdog NICE issued revised recommendations in 2011 allowing women to have the operation if they were very anxious about childbirth, a condition known as tokophobia. Just over a quarter of women giving birth in England now have a caesarean and the rate has more than doubled since the early 1990s . Women are also advised to have planned caesareans if they have had a previous complicated birth, are over 40 or have a medical condition such as asthma, diabetes or depression. But the WHO said that doctors were carrying them out too often, and underestimating the risks. Previous research has found that as many as one in ten caesareans cause infections.","UN officials say procedure should only be done when ‘medically necessary'

"A man had to be airlifted to the hospital after being bit by a shark Friday afternoon while spearfishing on the coast of Florida. The bull shark took a bite out of his back, torso and head, according to witnesses in Palm Beach, Florida. Blood covered the boat which was anchored off the Jupiter Inlet, a hot spot for fishing. Horrific: This is the man who was bitten by a shark on the right side of his head as well as his back and torso . The victim, who has not been identified, was airlifted to St Mary's Medical Center's trauma unit. An update on his condition wasn't immediately available. The man had a cobia fish and sling-type spears aboard the boat, where he was fishing with a man and a woman, who both spoke Spanish. 'He was bleeding quite a bit,' witness Peter Pinello told WPBF. 'It looks like a shark had gotten him in the torso. You could see his wetsuit was embedded in it, and it looked like it took a good chunk of it out.' The man was spearfishing off Jupiter Inlet when he was bitten, according to ABC affiliate WPBF-TVin West Palm Beach. Pinello told WPBF he saw the victim when he was being brought back to shore. Palm Beach County Fire Rescue Battalion Chief John Vanek told WPBF that the victim was bitten on the head but was conscious when he was flown to the hospital. Bull sharks are common near the coast, particularly in Florida, with a preference for water less than 100 feet deeo. They target their prey in murky water where they are not easily visible. According to a study on the behavior of sharks at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, bull sharks are attracted to colorful clothing - but have the ability to recognize brightly-colored netted traps.","Victim had been fishing off Palm Beach's Jupiter Inlet when he was bitten .

"Another 19 Kids and Counting star is one step closer to saying 'I do'. Josiah Duggar, 18, has revealed that he has entered into a courtship with 17-year-old Marjorie Jackson, who he met while the pair were taking Spanish lessons together. And just like several of his siblings before him, as the two embark on the path towards a potential marriage, Josiah and his new love interest will have to follow his family’s incredibly strict courting rules, which require the couple to go on chaperoned dates, with ‘side hugs’ the only permitted form of physical contact. 'I met Marjorie a few years ago, when I was taking Spanish lessons at her house and I was very impressed with the way she was with her siblings and her love for the Lord,' Josiah told People. Scroll down the video . Future wedding bells? Josiah Duggar, pictured, is the latest 19 Kids and Counting star to announce that he has entered a courtship . The teens' courtship officially began on April 6 - the same day his 23-year-old older sister Jill gave birth to her son Israel David, her first child with her 26-year-old husband Derick Dillard. Per the Duggar family's rules of courtship, hand-holding is forbidden until they are engaged and they must also save their first kiss for their wedding day. While Josiah has known Marjorie for a number of years, he explained that he first started thinking about her in a romantic way when they both went on a mission trip to El Salvador in December. 'She really caught my eye,’ he said. 'That is really where I noticed her.' Josiah, who works at his father Jim Bob's construction company, noted that their courtship has been 'going very well'. And Marjorie also hails from a big family. The teen, who was born to Greg and Analucia Jackson, is one of five girls. Special day: The 18-year-old, who can be see with his parents Michelle and Jim Bob, revealed that he officially started courting 17-year-old Marjorie Jackson on April 6 - the same day his sister Jill gave birth . Love story: Josiah met Marjorie a few years ago when he was talking special classes at her house . She admitted to 'liking' Josiah since she met him in Spanish class a few years ago. 'For me it was an immediate thing,' she told People. 'I have always admired him and his family.' Interestingly, when the Duggars recently weighed in on who would be the next family member walk down the aisle, the 18-year-old was not mentioned. Josiah and Marjorie's budding relationship will likely be chronicled on his family's reality series, just like his sisters Jill and Jessa were filmed getting to know their now husbands. The news of Josiah's courtship with Marjorie is just one of the Duggar family's major announcements in the past year. Jessa, 22, and her husband Ben Seewald, 19, revealed that they were engaged in August with the two saying 'I do' in November. Big day: Derick Dillard and Jill Duggar welcomed their son Israel David into the world on April 6 - the same day Josiah officially started courting Marjorie . Unexpected changes: This snapshot of Derick in scrubs led to speculation that his wife had to have a cesarean sections . Meanwhile, Jill and Derrick announced in August that they were expecting their first child - just two months after they walked down the aisle. Their son Israel was born weighing 9lbs10 two weeks past his due date on April 6. Last week, a snapshot of Derick wearing scrubs shortly after the birth sparked speculation that Jill, who is a trainee midwife, may have undergone a cesarean section. While the family admitted that 'not everything went as expected', fans will have to wait until May 5 to watch the momentous occasion on the TLC reality show. Yesterday, Derick posed next to his wife for an adorable post-baby photo he shared his Instagram account. 'As Jill and I are settling in back at home after the birth of our firstborn, we wanted to thank everyone for the amazing support we've received from so many during this time,' he wrote.

"The mother of a primary school pupil who told a Labour MP he supported Ukip because he wanted to get 'all the foreigners out the country' has admitted she's embarrassed by the exchange. Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, was visiting the primary school in Derby where he was filmed asking the year six pupil who he would vote for in next month's election if he could. Video of the conversation shows the Labour MP was stunned by the statement, which a  Ukip spokesman claimed shows the schoolboy had been 'drinking in propaganda' from the party's rivals. The mother of the 10-year-old has said she has now sat down her son and explained 'it isn't about being foreign'. But she added: 'I do personally support an Australian points system.' Scroll down for video . Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, had asked the youngster who he would vote for in next month's election if he could take part . The mother, who wished to remain anonymous, told MailOnline she was 'embarrassed' after the video went viral online. She added: 'I can see the funny side, but it is a but embarrassing. 'I don't really think my son understands the impact of what he said. I think he's just heard people talking. 'His dad agrees with some of UKIP's policies, but I haven't decided who I am going to vote for yet. 'When my son told me what he'd said, I sat him down and explained it isn't about being foreign. But I do personally support an Australian points system - if you have something to offer the country when you are coming in that's fair enough.' Mr Hunt, who was visiting a primary school in Derbyshire as part of the election campaign, asked the year six child: 'Do you know who you would vote for?' When the child said Ukip, Mr Hunt replied, 'Very good' and asked why. The youngster replied: 'To get all the foreigners out the country.' A Labour spokesman admitted to MailOnline that Mr Hunt had been taken aback by the schoolboy's remarks. He said: 'We at a school in Derbyshire, in a classroom. I'll admit we were a little bit surprised by the remark.' A Labour shadow minister was left gobsmacked after a primary school pupil told him he supported Ukip – because he wanted to get 'all the foreigners out the country' Mr Hunt appeared taken aback by the child's support for Ukip to get all the foreigners out the country . The exchange at Howitt Primary School at Heanor, Derbyshire, was recorded by BBC East Midlands and broadcast last night. Today the headteacher said that the unnamed boy's comments were 'not representative of the school'. The school has more than 400 pupils aged three to 11 and spent the last two years in special measures until January this year. Its latest Ofsted report says: 'Most pupils come from White British backgrounds. There are very few pupils from other heritage groups or who speak English as an additional language'. In the town of Heanor, which is 10 miles north of Derby, 98.2 per cent of the population is white. Nigel Farage yesterday insisted Ukip was not anti-immigration . In 2006 a Channel 5 documentary dubbed the town the 'skinhead capital of Britain' when the BNP came second in a council by-election and a government advisor said later that it was one of a few 'unhealthily all white' towns in the UK. The remarks come just 24 hours after Ukip claimed it was not an anti-immigrant party. A Ukip spokesman today claimed the boy had been brainwashed by the media. He said: 'Sadly I suspect the child has been drinking in all the propaganda. This is the information that people are continually being told, but it's not true. 'I thought it was rather sad that he thinks that is what Ukip is for. But it is not a surprise because that is how we are portrayed in the media.' The party's manifesto chief Suzanne Evans cast doubt on the party's promise to ban unskilled workers for five years before telling supporters that Ukip was not anti-immigration. In remarks which risk angering supporters opposed to foreigners arriving in the UK, Mrs Evans said: 'Ukip is not anti-immigration. Immigrants are not the problem. It's our current immigration system that is the problem. 'We will not pull up the drawbridge, we will simply start to control who walks over it.' However the manifesto includes a pledge to limit net migration to 50,000 and introduce a total ban on unskilled migration for five years. Yesterday it emerged Ukip has abandoned hopes of winning dozens of seats at the General Election and is now targeting just ten. The party reduced the number of constituencies where it is concentrating resources as it loses ground in the polls. A party strategist said 'something extraordinary' would now need to happen for it to win in places outside its target list. Since October, support for Ukip has tumbled from 19 to just 12 per cent as voters focus on the big choice between Labour and the Tories at the election.","Primary school pupil told Tristram Hunt he would vote Ukip if he could .

"Jack Black the friendly jackdaw (pictured) has become so well-loved one fan has set up a Facebook page for him with over 450 members . As a popular member of the community he often pops into people’s houses, goes with them on the weekly shop and has even joined them for Christmas dinner. He’ll also accompany the local children as they walk to school – perched on their shoulders. He is Jack Black the friendly jackdaw and he has become so well-loved in Penryn, Cornwall, that one fan has set up a Facebook page for him. The page has more than 450 members who share their pictures, videos and stories about Jack and keep up to date with his daily activities. Jack was hand-reared by a vet as a chick in 2013 after being discovered with no feathers, before being released into the wild. He then started popping into homes and gardens but has since broadened his network to a ten-mile radius, visiting houses and flats and even college and university campuses, offices, schools and sports clubs. He has become so relaxed around humans that he regularly falls asleep in the laps and hands of residents. He taps on windows to signal he has arrived and even pops into supermarkets and perches on trolleys as residents shop. Locals, who keep bird food and treats in their homes, are able to distinguish him from other jackdaws because of a silver tag tied to his right leg. Grace Chapman-Duke, a 20-year-old student, got to know Jack well before moving house. She said: ‘He used to be my personal alarm clock every day. He would tap on my window to let me know he was there. ‘Once I let him in, he would sit on my shoulder as I got ready for uni and then would continue on my shoulder until I got to my lecture. Jack was hand-reared as a chick after being discovered with no feathers, before being released into the wild . 'Our friendship progressed to such a degree that he would perch on my shoulder as I showered.’ One resident wrote on Facebook: ‘I used to go into the kitchen on a wet winter’s day to find he had sneaked through the window and was asleep on the back of the chair! Joined us for Christmas dinner and all sorts.’ Bird specialist Lloyd Buck, who trains birds for film and TV productions, said: ‘It sounds as though this bird has developed the bond it would normally have with birds with humans.’ He has become so relaxed around humans that he regularly falls asleep in the laps and hands of residents .","Jack Black the friendly jackdaw is a welcome resident in Penryn, Cornwall .

"The Ministry of Defence was under fire after vital details of the RAF's main base on the Falklands Islands were published on their website. The secret document, which has the exact GPS co-ordinates of vital facilities as well as information on the depth of concrete on the runway were published unencrypted on the MoD's website. The details could be used as 'an invasion guide' by Argentina, with the technical information providing excellent intelligence to any Argentine bombers sent to attack the islands. The Falklands Islands are defended by a squadron of RAF Typhoon aircraft operating from Mount Pleasant aerodrome on West Falkland, supported by a refueling tanker to extend their operational area . The aerodrome also operates as a Search and Rescue location with Sea King helicopters, pictured . The airstrip, pictured, is home to four Europfighter Typhoon aircraft tasked with defending the islands . The Aerodrome Manual was accidentally uploaded onto a public section of the MoD's website and could have been downloaded by Argentine intelligence agents to help prepare a mission to recapture the islands. A senior military source told The Express: 'This is exactly the kind of intel foreign powers send spies to get. 'It's practically an invasion handbook. Taking out the runway could cripple Britain's ability to fight off invaders in the ongoing sovereignty dispute.' The MoD admitted the manual had been available on the internet but the link had been disabled. They denied the information was particularly sensitive. The blunder occurred as Argentina was described as a 'very live threat' by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. This comes as Argentina is preparing to lease 12 Sukhoi SU-24 long-range bombers from Russia. The Falklands Islands are defended by modern Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft, supported by Rapier surface-to-air missiles and 1,200 troops. The Royal Navy also patrols the area and nuclear-powered submarines are also thought regularly travel to the region. And the MoD recently announced the £228million purchase of new anti-aircraft missiles to boost island defences. The jets are housed in hangers just off the main runway where they can be airborne quickly to intercept any potential aircraft inbound from Argentina in the event of a new conflict . Argentina is considering leasing 12 Suhkoi SU-24 bombers, pictured, from Russia. The Cold War-era jets have a range of 650 miles and would be able to bomb Mount Pleasant without the need to refuel . The MoD published the Aerodrome Manual on their website where it could be downloaded by anyone . The Cold War-era jet has a maximum range of 650 miles - which means it could attack the Falklands Islands and return to Argentina without the need to refuel. It also can carry 3,000kg of bombs as well as air-to-air missiles. The jets, despite being designed in the 1960s, are also capable of supersonic travel. This comes as tensions between Britain and Argentina have increased over plans by UK firms to drill for oil in the South Atlantic. Argentina's minister for the Malivinas - the name it uses for the Falklands Islands - Daniel Filmus threatened to prosecute any British firms exploring for oil near the islands. He said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We have always been very clear that this is an unlawful assertion of jurisdiction over the Falklands Islands' continental shelf, which we reject, and we will raise it will the appropriate authorities. 'We are satisfied that the Islands have the right to develop their hydrocarbons sector as a legitimate commercial venture with international oil and gas companies, and will continue to support them as they move forward. Argentine domestic law does not apply to the Falkland Islands.'","The MoD accidentally published information on Falklands RAF base online .

"They say you should never judge a book by it's cover, and it couldn't be more true of the tough looking, full-bodied tattooed English model Stephen James Hendry. The 24-year-old, better known as simply Stephen James, is now quickly becoming one of the most in-demand models in the industry, and one of the first ever to be a full tattooed one at that. He has lucrative contracts with Calvin Klein and Diesel under his belt, has starred in numerous men's magazine shoots, and graced the runway at Fashion Weeks. Scroll down for video .

Fan frenzy: Since Hendry touched down, he has already experienced girls screaming and stalking his hotel . Popular with the ladies: Girls arrived at the meet and greet eager to snag a photo with Hendry . And this week, he has landed Down Under to start work on a new campaign with Windsor Smith shoes. The news of his arrival was met with much excitement and hysteria from his Australian fans, who make up a hefty chunk of his 498,000 Instagram fans. Some allegedly have even been following the model to his hotel. 'You just have to take it in your stride to be honest,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Like today for example, I just went about doing my modelling job and it just happens to be that you have to deal with it [the fame] when it comes up in that moment.' Humbled heart throb: Despite rubbing shoulders with Madonna, model Stephen James remains very humble . The ladies of Australia may be in luck if thye manage to catch the busy model's eye. 'I'm only recently single - it's not bad, I'm having fun,' he revealed. For Hardy, tattoos were never about impressing people or gaining popularity amongst the tatt loving community - he says it's always been about expression, art and staying grounded. 'They're all about different experiences and things that have happened in my life. One of my favourite tattoos for example is of Morrissey, as I listened to The Smiths a lot growing up.' Single and ready to mingle: British supermodel Stephen James said he is recently unattached and having fun . When quizzed about the Hindu face that covers his torso, Hendry admits it comes from a deeply, personal place, despite the ridiculing tongue poking out that might suggest otherwise. 'It's about a private moment in my life when I needed more balance,' he said. 'It features symbols from Hinduism, with the tridents acting as a symbol of protection. It also reflects mandalas in my head and is a way for me to express it and keep balance.' He likens it to a guiding spirit in his life, as a sort-of expression of his religion and a constant reminder to keep his sanity grounded. No time to waste: Hendry says while fame has happened quickly he plans to just run with it and look back later . 'With fame and all the pressures of having these expectations of being the person you’re meant to be, well this is my own little thing to hide behind.' And if the humbled heart throb, couldn't make girls swoon anymore, he is a big fan of poetry and has portrait tattoos of Oscar Wilde and artist Frida Kahlo, not just because he  likes them but thinks there's more to them than a face. 'I'd rather have a picture of their face, even though Frida Kahlo has one eyebrow, it's about liking them for on the inside, not judging about what they're like on the outside.' Fan girl mania: English supermodel Stephen James whose famous for his tattoos has landed in Sydney . And while he adds Sydney is very cool and suited to his lifestyle, his time here will be brief as he works on a campaign with shoe label Windsor Smith before jetting off to Adelaide - where for lucky South Australians he will be doing in-store appearances. While Hendry has a busy time ahead of him, he's excited to just take it and run with it. 'Right now everything in my life is happening so quick, in a year I've become one of the top models and have one of the largest social followings for a model on Instagram. But for now I just like to take it in my stride,' he said. 'Maybe when it’s all over I can be like, ""wow!""'","London-based model Stephen James Hendry famed for his full body tattoo .

"An 11-year-old Chinese schoolboy has become mute after he drank a glass of water which had been laced with perfume and chalk dust as part of a prank. Pupil Xiao Gao, from Fujian Province in south eastern China, has not said a word in five days after a classmate who had allegedly bullied him gave him the water, reports People's Daily Online. But medical experts are at a loss to explain his sudden inability to talk and say that the combination of water, perfume and dust - while nasty - should not have caused that type of damage. Pupil Xiao Gao, aged 11, (pictured) from Fujian in south east China, has not spoken a word in five days after a classmate he 'does not get on with' gave him the water which had been laced with perfume and chalk dust . Gao, who is in Year Two at Haidu Number 8 Middle School, is now awaiting further medical examination as well as an appointment with a psychologist. School officials told reporters that after Gao lost his voice the classmate who gave him the water 'became very afraid' and told teachers it was meant as a joke and that she did not think he would drink it. She said she only added perfume and chalk dust to the water - and not nail varnish as was rumoured. She said when Gao drank the water his classmates told him to spit it out but by then he had already swallowed it. Gao, who is a pupil at Haidu Number 8 Middle School, (pictured) is now awaiting further medical examination . Gao's form teacher was informed of his condition and immediately notified his family before taking him to hospital. The unnamed girl has now been excluded from the school. A doctor at Fujian Provincial Hospital told reporters that in all the years he has practised medicine he has never seen a case like this before. Qiu Bin Gaosu said as perfume consists mainly of alcohol, perfume fragrance and methanol, consuming a small amount would not impact the body, although a large amount would irritate the throat and stomach. He said consuming small amounts of chalk dust, which is nontoxic, should also not have this sort of effect. Xiao Gao's cousin told reporters that a number of doctors have seen Gao and they found no physical abnormalities. Gao claims the girl who gave him the water let him drink it and then said 'You will die after drinking this' Relatives told reporters that Gao's mother was ill and his father worked at a vegetable market. They said the boy was well-behaved and doubted the condition was a hoax - particularly as he had been unable to speak for five days. His form teacher, Mr Lin, said Gao was a little introverted, quiet and very honest and was often bullied by other children in his class. He said: 'Whenever a teacher saw any bullying we would chastise the offender and teach them about why their behaviour was not acceptable.' Gao's classroom - a doctor said that in all the years he has practised he has never seen a case like this before . Through written messages Gao told reporters that he was thirsty so he drank the water his classmate handed him - but after swallowing a couple of mouthfuls he realised something wasn't right. He claims it was then the girl took away the water and said 'You will die after drinking this.' Gao told reporters that he didn't get along with the classmate who handed him the water. The story has gone viral in China and has been reported on all the main news websites. The People's Daily reported that the local Public Security Bureau has started an investigation into the incident.","Schoolboy Xiao Gao, 11, drank water spiked with perfume and chalk dust .

"A restaurant which accidentally served an alcoholic drink to a 10-year-old girl has blamed the mix-up on her mother for leaving her daughter on her own to go out for a cigarette. Ashley Dodds, 29, visited the Red Hot World Buffet on Deansgate, Manchester, with her daughter, Dennon, and her daughter's friend. After ordering a non-alcoholic Sweet Kiss 'mocktail' for the girls, Ms Dodds was disgusted when she heard that her daughter had actually been drinking an alcoholic version. The menu: Ashley Dodds, 29, holds up the 'mocktails' list she ordered drinks from for daughter Dennon at the Red Hot World Buffet in  Manchester. Restaurant staff accidentally served the girl a drink with alcohol in it . Restaurant bosses admitted to making the mistake but blamed the incident on Ms Dodds for leaving her daughter alone while she went for a cigarette. Ms Dodds, from Salford, said: 'It is unbelievable. They are so unprofessional. 'How dare they blame it on me. It makes me out to be a bad mother but they made the mistake.' Explaining what happened, she added: 'I ordered my daughter and her friend Sweet Kisses, and a bit later me and my friend decided to go for a cigarette. 'I went to the counter to ask for two more Sweet Kisses to be taken over to them, then went downstairs for a cigarette. When I came back up my daughter just blurted out saying ""mum, I've had alcohol"".' Dining out: Inside the Red Hot World Buffet in Deansgate, Manchester. The restaurant admitted to the mishap but blamed Ms Dodds for leaving her daughter and a friend unattended and going outside for a cigarette . Ms Dodds, who works at a Nando's restaurant, was horrified to learn that instead of Sweet Kisses, staff at the Red Hot World Buffet had placed two Sex on the Beach cocktails in front of the girls while the adults were away from the table. She said: 'I took a big swig of the drink and thought, wow these have alcohol in them. I was baffled why there wasn't a manager out to explain what had happened.' The order had been mistaken for a non-alcoholic Safe Sex on the Beach, but accidentally made as a normal Sex on the Beach with vodka. The unhappy mother, who said she tries to shelter Dennon from anything too adult for her age, also thinks mocktail menus should not be alluding to anything sexual. Poor service: Ms Dodds with her receipt from the Red Hot World Buffet, which shows the two Safe Sex on the Beach cocktails she ordered after visiting the restaurant . The Red Hot World Buffet said: 'We did serve something wrong, however putting it into context the issue was the lady went outside for a cigarette and left the children unattended. We were quite bothered by that' 'I wouldn't even let Dennon look at the menu because it said Sex on the Beach, and a Virgin Mojito, and I don't want her reading that stuff,' she said. 'I don't even want her thinking about that kind of stuff. 'I told the manager that at the end of the day the mocktail menu is non-alcoholic so you are mainly aiming at children, but was told that wasn't necessarily the case.' A spokesman for Red Hot World Buffet said: 'We did serve something wrong, however putting it into context the issue was the lady went outside for a cigarette and left the children unattended. 'We were quite bothered by that as it's quite unusual to leave two small children out of sight. This was an accident and there was some confusion with the order, but there is a responsibility for parents to stay with their children.'","Ashley Dodds, 29, left speechless when daughter told her what happened .

"A TV cameraman has been banned from the Aaron Hernandez murder trial after admitting he followed jurors at the end of a court session. Superior court Judge Susan Garsh punished Robert Cusanelli of WHDH-TV after two jurors told the court they were trailed by a van as they tried to get into their cars on Wednesday. 'He cannot come into this building or be driving a WHDH vehicle for the purpose of doing reporting work on this case,' Garsh said from the bench after Cusanelli testified under oath. Two jurors informed the court Thursday morning that they saw someone watching them in a Ford Explorer. One took a picture of its license plate. Two jurors from the Aaron Hernandez (pictured in court on Thursday) murder trial told the court they were followed by a TV van as they made their way home in Boston . Robert Cusanelli of Boston's WHDH-TV was banned from the Bristol County courthouse and was told he was not allowed to drive a vehicle for the 'purpose of reporting this case' Cusanelli acknowledged that he followed the jurors, saying he made the decision to do so on his own to find out where jurors were parking. He said he didn't talk to the jurors, didn't take their picture or write down their license plate numbers and at the time thought he wasn't doing anything wrong. 'I see now that it was a mistake,' he said. The van was allegedly behind the jury bus as it headed towards an off-site parking lot where the jurors are dropped off at the end of the day. After learning of the allegations, Garsh called the former New England Patriot player and his lawyers up to have a private discussion at the bench after they arrived in court on Thursday morning. According to WCVB, she said the incident could have resulted in mistrial. According to the Boston Globe, both the jurors are remaining on the panel. 'We're at a stage of this case where it is obviously both vital and legally required that absolutely no juror be approached or questioned or followed in any fashion,' Garsh said at the time. 'It is the court's view that there have to be consequences for that.' Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh has warned the TV station there could be repercussions following the incident that was reported in court on Thursday . The station was told to 'investigate' the matter before reporting back to the court. The 12 jurors spent a combined nine hours deliberating on Tuesday and Wednesday. They continued deliberating after the judge questioned the jurors involved and spoke to the attorney but did not reach a verdict on Thursday. They will return on Friday as Hernandez awaits his fate. Hernandez is charged with the June 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister. Lloyd was shot six times in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home. Jurors must deliberate every day from 9am to 4:30 pm., and may go later if they wish. On Wednesday they asked the judge for clarification on weapon and ammunition possession charges Hernandez faces. The judge brought the jury in Wednesday afternoon after receiving two questions about the possession charges. Hernandez is charged with illegally possessing a .45-caliber handgun and .22-caliber ammunition. The former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez speaks to defense attorney Charles Rankin in the courtroom of the Bristol County Superior Court House on April 8, 2015. The jury are now deliberating . Two friends of Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, are also charged with murder and will be tried separately. Prosecutors contend that the three men, in the early hours of June 17, 2013, picked Lloyd up at his home in Boston and drove him to the industrial park where his body was found riddled with bullets later that day. During the trial, which began in January and featured more than 130 witnesses, prosecutors showed video footage of Hernandez coming and going from his home around the time of Lloyd's death. Investigators did not recover the gun that was used to shoot Lloyd, a .45-caliber Glock pistol. Hernandez faces a charge of murder and two firearms-related violations. If convicted of first-degree murder, he would be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. A second-degree murder conviction would lead to a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 15 years. Hernandez had been a rising star in the National Football League with a $41 million contract when he was arrested on June 26, 2013. The Patriots dropped him within hours.","Two jurors said a vehicle, believed to be from WHDH-TV, trailed them .

"Two Air India pilots have been removed from duty after they reportedly got into a fight inside the cockpit of a plane shortly before it was scheduled to take off. The altercation involving the captain and co-pilot erupted while the plane was being prepared for a 50-minute journey from Delhi to Jaipur last night. Both pilots have been derostered after the captain of flight AI611 complained that the co-pilot had misbehaved and struck him, the Times of India reported. An Air India captain claims a co-pilot misbehaved and struck him during an altercation in the cockpit (file) An Air India spokesman told the newspaper: ‘Both the pilots have been derostered. An inquiry has been ordered into this.’ The airline insists the altercation was limited to a verbal argument, and there was no physical violence. The Times of India, quoting a source, reported that the captain was assaulted after he asked the co-pilot to record ‘critical take-off figures’ for the flight, including the number of passengers on board, take-off weight and fuel. Instead of immediately reporting the incident in Delhi, which would have led to the cancellation of the flight, the captain flew the plane to Jaipur and then informed Air India staff. Indian aviation officials have launched an investigation into the incident to determine whether any of the parties involved should be disciplined. Reports suggest that the captain was assaulted after asking the co-pilot to record information before take-off . A report by the Times of India said that the co-pilot has faced similar accusations in the past. Three years ago he told the captain of a flight to exit the cockpit, ‘remove the stars on his shirt collar’ and fight him, while a complaint filed two years ago from another captain questioned the co-pilot’s mental health and claimed he was ‘rude and unbecoming’. Last night’s incident comes at a sensitive time for the commercial aviation industry following the tragedy involving Germanwings flight 4U9525. Investigators believe 27-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane into the French Alps – killing everyone on board – after locking the captain out of the cockpit on a flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf. German newspaper Bild reported that Lubitz searched the internet for information on suicide and depression using the name ‘Skydevil’.","The captain claimed that the co-pilot assaulted him, Indian media reported .

"A series of earthquakes that rattled a small Texan community have been linked to nearby oil and gas operations. In 84 days from November 2013 to January 2014, the area around Azle, Texas, shook with 27 magnitude two or greater earthquakes. Now scientists believe these earthquakes were the result of high-pressure injection of drilling wastewater into the ground. A series of earthquakes that rattled a small Texan community have been linked to nearby oil and gas operations. In this image red squares are injector locations; pink arrows, approximate location of two large brine production wells that are located both near the faults and near reported earthquakes swarms . The oil and gas industry uses injection wells to get rid of wastewater, which can have chemicals, heavy metals, salt and radioactive material. The scientists determined this based on where and when the earthquakes happened; computer models that track pressure changes; and company data from nearby wells. Matthew Hornbach, a Southern Methodist University geophysicist, said the timing and location of the quakes correlates better to the drilling and injection than any other possible reason. 'There appears to be little doubt about the conclusion that the earthquakes were in fact induced,' USGS seismologist Susan Hough, who wasn't part of the study team, said in an email. 'There's almost an abundance of smoking guns in this case.' This adds to other studies that linked injecting wastewater from energy wells to a tremendous jump in earthquakes in Oklahoma and southern Kansas. The map shows inferred faults (dashed) at the top of the Blenburger formation, injection wells (red squares), two production wells (API 36734045 and 36734139) with significant brine production near the faults (pink arrows) and earthquake epicentres (coloured circles) recorded by the temporary seismic network (triangles) In these areas, there have been more than 950 magnitude 2 or higher quakes so far this year, according to the USGS. Earlier today, the Oklahoma Geological Society said it is 'very likely' that most of the earthquakes that have shaken the state in recent years have been triggered by the subsurface injection of wastewater from oil and natural gas drilling operations. The society released a statement following an investigation into dozens of earthquakes recorded in central and north-central Oklahoma. The fluid pressure in the pores and fractures of the rocks is called the 'pore pressure.' The pore pressure acts against the weight of the rock and the forces holding the rock together. If the pore pressures are low - especially compared to the forces holding the rock together - then only the imbalance of natural in situ earth stresses will cause an occasional earthquake. If, however, pore pressures increase, then it would take less of an imbalance of in situ stresses to cause an earthquake. This type of failure is called shear failure. Injecting fluids into the subsurface is one way of increasing the pore pressure and causing faults and fractures to 'fail' more easily. Earthquakes can be caused by injecting fluid into the subsurface or by extracting fluids at a rate that causes subsidence and slippage along planes of weakness in the Earth. Source: US Department of Energy . Unlike other research that linked quakes to the injection of wastewater, the SMU study also sees a secondary link in another part of the drilling process. Massive amounts of brine taken out of the ground with the gas, said study co-author William Ellsworth of the USGS. Removing the saltwater changes the underground pressure. But the deep injection of the wastes still is the principle culprit, Ellsworth said. Azle sits atop the large underground Barrett Shale natural gas formation. The findings come amid heightened debate over oil and gas regulations, including efforts in some communities to ban drilling. Earthquakes can be caused by injecting fluid into the subsurface or by extracting fluids at a rate that causes subsidence and slippage along planes of weakness in the Earth. This infograpic shows the natural and man-made stress changes that may trigger earthquakes in Azle . In Texas, lawmakers are considering bills that would limit cities' abilities to do so. 'Cities across the state should be very, very worried,' Sharon Wilson, an organiser based in Dallas for the environmental group Earthworks, said in a statement. 'It is only Texas state regulators and lawmakers who are living in denial.' The Texas Railroad Commission, the state's oil and gas regulator, hired its first seismologist last year to investigate potential links between quakes and fracking after Azle residents asked the agency to halt oil and gas activities. The seismologist has not offered any conclusions. Remi Oldham, an SMU geophysics graduate student, runs a cable to connect the seismometer to communications interface equipment housed in the orange metal box in Willow Park, Texas. The interface equipment allows the transmission of the data collected by the seismometer back to SMU . Azle is a city located in Tarrant County in Texas. It sits atop the large Barrett Shale natural gas formation .","Azle has recently been shaken by 27 quakes with magnitude two or greater .

"He has been painted by history as a wicked hunchback, but Richard III kept the disease that curved his spine secret through out his life, a historian has claimed. The last Plantagenet king of England was described by William Shakespeare as a 'poisonous bunch-back'd toad' in his play depicting the monarch. But research on the king's skeleton discovered under a council car park in Leicester revealed that this may have been an exaggeration of a spine deformity known as scoliosis. Scroll down for video . Richard III's skeleton found under a car park in Leicester was found to a distinctive scoliosisof the spine . Now a new academic paper claims that even this condition, which caused one of his shoulders to be slightly higher than the other, was probably not known about until after his death. Dr Mary Ann Lund, from the University of Leicester's school of English, said tailoring and specially fitted armour probably helped to disguise the curve in his spine. The genetic analysis showed that Richard III almost certainly had blue eyes and likely had blonde hair - although it may have darkened with age. Richard III was depicted by William Shakespeare as a tyrannical hunchback who murdered two princes in the Tower of London. But scans of the king's skeleton show he wasn't a hunchback, but only had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance or prowess on the field of battle. The notorious description by Shakespeare of a ‘hunchback toad’, a Machiavellian villain suffering a twisted body, a limp and withered arm, was almost certainly an attempt to blacken his reputation, experts claim. Instead, a 3D reconstruction of the king’s spine shows 65 to 85 degrees of ‘scoliosis’, or sideways bending of his spine to the right. The condition, which would have developed in his early teens, means he was very far from being a hunchback. Despite having one shoulder slightly higher than the other and a short trunk in comparison with his arms and legs, there is no evidence he walked with a limp. She said: 'It is highly likely that Richard took care to control his public image. 'The body of the king was part of the propaganda of power, and even when it was revealed in order to be anointed as part of his coronation ceremony it was simultaneously concealed from the congregation. 'Tailoring probably kept the signs of his scoliosis hidden to spectators outside the royal household of attendants, servants and medical staff who dressed, bathed and tended to the monarch's body.' Writing in the journal Medical Humanities, Dr Lund argues that like other monarchs Richard III's body image would have been carefully controlled. It was only after his death at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 that his physical shape was made public when his corpse was stripped and displayed. Dr Lund said that it was this treatment that later led to his reputation as a hunchback - something that was later picked up by Shakespeare. She said were no surviving descriptions of Richard III's distinctive physique from during his lifetime. Instead she says that his appearance became increasingly distorted through out the Tudor period. Dr Lund said: 'Stage history has reincarnated Richard as monster, villain and clown, but recent events have helped us to re-evaluate these physically defined depictions and strip back the cultural accretions that have surrounded his body. This reconstruction of Richard III, based on his skull, has revealed what the king looked like 500 years ago . Scientists studying the skull of Richard III (above) found he had suffered several brutal blows before he died . Scientists used 3D scanning to reconstruct how Richard III's (right) skeleton may have been deformed (left) 'The care he in all probability received for his scoliosis from his surgically trained physician was large in scale: traction and manual manipulation needed specially designed equipment, space and assistants. 'Yet, it may have been only a relatively small group of people in Richard's trusted circle who knew of his condition. The absence of contemporary testimony does not prove this, however. 'What is certain is that, after his death, the exposure of Richard's body went beyond the two days of its exhibition in Leicester. 'That moment after Bosworth inaugurated a longer and more brutalising process, in which an ever-more twisted physique was revealed to the public eye, his own body becoming deployed as a major tactic in the rhetorical strategy against him. The skeleton of Richard III, with the curve in his spine clearly visible, was found under a car park in Leicester . 'When Shakespeare's Richard boasts of his shape-changing potential, he registers too the bending course of history and myth making.' Analysis of Richard III's skeleton, which was discovered buried in a shallow grave at the site of Grey Friars Abbey in Leicester in 2012, showed that many depictions of the king's appearance had been exaggerated. A 3D reconstruction of his spine showed that it had 65 to 85 degrees of scoliosis - a sideways bend of his spine to the right. The condition would have developed in his early teens, but was far from being a hunchback. The scientists at the University of Leicester who examined the skeleton said there was also little evidence that the king would have walked with a limp. However, there are some that point to the alleged murder of Richard III's nephews Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury - the so called Princes in the Tower - as evidence of the king's character. They say this act of infanticide is what earned the Plantagenet king his blackened reputation rather than his physical appearance. The blow that killed King Richard III in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull, scientists studying his remains have revealed. Forensic pathologists at University of Leicester, discovered two wounds at the base of the king's skull along with a large indentation inside the cranium. The findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull. Genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton, discovered under a council car park in Leicester three years ago, has confirmed that it did belong to Richard III. Scientists studying the remains believe the king was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet. Using modern medical scanners, they established that the English monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.","Historian Dr Mary Ann Lund believes Richard III used good tailoring and clever armour to hide the scoliosis in his spine that curved to the right .

"A top justice judge has said that Australian women should have the choice to be paid to be a surrogate mother. Speaking at the University of Queensland in Brisbane on Friday night, Justice Diana Bryant told a room full of journalists that surrogacy laws currently in place need a major overhaul to prevent cases of abandonment. She said she believes that because commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia, hopeful parents are forced to enter into unlawful arrangements overseas. Scroll down for video . A top judge in Brisbane has said that surrogacy laws need to be overhauled to prevent a repeat of the baby Gammy (pictured with his mother) case . 'I personally think we should regulate and allow commercial surrogacy in Australia,' she said. 'If we allow it in Australia, we then can regulate it and ensure that it's done on ethical terms.' Her statement is backed up by a recent bout of child abandonment cases, where parents have  refused to carry through with overseas surrogacy deals. This week an Australian couple were slammed after they left a baby boy born to their Indian surrogate with his mother after she unexpectedly gave birth to twins. Documents revealed the shocking details of the case that saw a couple return to Australia with a baby girl while leaving her twin brother behind. Justice Diana Bryant (pictured) has spoken out about Australia's surrogacy laws . The couple reportedly told staff they wanted a baby girl to 'complete their family'. They was told the boy would be left stateless if they followed through on plans to abandon him, because India does not recognise surrogate children as citizens. The Indian case is similar to the controversial baby Gammy scenario. Gammy was born in Thailand to a surrogate mother, however after reportedly learning that he had a disability, his Australian parents, West Australian couple Wendy and David Farnell, only brought  his twin sister home with them. The Farnells returned to Australia with Gammy's twin sister Pipah, while Ms Chanbua remained with Gammy in Thailand's Chonburi province. Mr Farnell, a convicted child sex offender, retained custody of Pipah late last year after an investigation by the WA Department for Child Protection. Gammy pictures with his Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon 'Goy' Chanbua during a trip to the beach . In November, WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said there would be 'continual and rigorous testing' of a safety plan that had been developed for Pipah. Following these cases the Thai government  passed a law criminalising surrogacy and prohibiting foreigners from seeking surrogacy services. The law, which prohibits the act of hiring women commercially to carry foetuses to term, aims to stop Thailand from being a surrogacy hub for foreign couples. Currently in Australia, it is illegal for women to act as surrogates, except in the Northern Territory where there are no laws in place to stop the act. In NSW, ACT and Queensland, arranging a contracted surrogacy overseas is also considered a criminal offence. Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of Gammy's twin sister Pipah, pictured with David and Wendy Farnell . 'I think the Government could eliminate some of the worst aspects of international surrogacy by devising some ethical requirements that need to be met before intending parents are permitted to bring a child back into Australia,' Justice Bryant said. Justice Bryant also said Australian surrogacy should be legalised as many of the children who are currently born to surrogates overseas will never get the chance to meet their biological mothers. 'That child is never going to know their biological mother, and in those cases, there is absolutely no opportunity for them ever to find out,' she said. 'The knowing the biological parentage for me would be one of the first steps and I think we have a responsibility as a country to make sure the worse aspects of commercial surrogacy are overcome.'","Top judge said Australian commercial surrogacy needs to be legalised .

"Most women would kill for a size six figure and a gap between their thighs. But Amelia-Jane Harris, 20, says her new 'dream body' is actually a nightmare, as Crohn's disease means she is in constant pain and cannot eat. The illness has seen Miss Harris lose more than 18 stone (252lbs) in 20 months, as she regularly vomits up her food and suffers excruciating bowel pain. At her largest, when she weighed 27st 10lbs (388lbs) and was a size 32, she dreamed of pulling off skimpy outfits. But now, weighing just 8st 9lbs (121lbs) and wearing size 6 clothes, she says she would give anything to get back her fuller figure back and be able to eat normally again. Scroll down for video . Amelia-Jane Harris, 20, used to weigh 27st 10lbs and was bullied at school and called 'Fatty Bum Bum' (left). She developed Crohn's disease and lost 18 stone in 20 months to become a slim size six (right). But rather than being delighted at her new figure, she describes her situation as a 'nightmare' Her condition leaves her in constant pain and she can barely keep food down, so she can never enjoy eating or go out for dinner with her friends. She so tired from being malnourished she cannot work, and her fingernails, eyebrows and hair all regularly fall out. Miss Harris, of Chelmsley Wood, Birmingham, said: 'I get lots of compliments on my figure, but I have constant, underlying pain. 'Sometimes it feels like really severe stomach cramps, but I also get really bad stabbing pains that won't go away. 'I get no enjoyment out of food anymore. Eating feels like a chore because I know it's going to cause me pain. 'It seems pointless to make a healthy meal because I'll just throw it up. 'With strong painkillers I can cope, but it feels like a curse - I'm going to have to take this medication for the rest of my life.' Miss Harris was a happy and healthy child but her weight began to increase through her teens despite making no change to her diet. Miss Harris says her 'dream body' is actually a nightmare as she cannot eat and vomits daily . By the age of 14, she was dubbed 'Fatty Bum Bum' by playground bullies. She said: 'I ate whatever mum gave me, which was healthy because she was always watching her weight. 'As my waistline expanded, my confidence shrank and it wasn't until I left school - and the bullies - behind me that I stopped worrying about my size. 'At college, I ate what I wanted and although I reached nearly 28 stone, I still made an effort with my clothes, hair and make-up. Fat didn't have to mean ugly.' With the humiliation of her school days behind her, Miss Harris gradually started to embrace her size 32 frame. But then shortly after her 17th birthday, having finally made peace with being overweight, she fell seriously ill. She said: 'I started vomiting 10 times a day. I just couldn't keep anything down. 'Within 20 months I'd lost more than 18st. It didn't make any sense to me and I was terrified.' Concerned by the rapid and unprompted weight loss, she consulted her GP. In June 2014, after months of tests, her doctor diagnosed her with Crohn's disease, a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system. There is currently no cure for Crohn's disease - treatment simply aims to relieve the symptoms of the digestive system becoming inflamed. Miss Harris was immediately prescribed a cocktail of pills, which she is required to take every day. She said: 'On a good day I have to take up to 70 pills, but it can go up to 100 on a bad one. 'The weight kept falling off until I reached size six. People congratulated me on the weight loss and told me I looked fabulous – but the truth was I'd never felt worse' She now weighs 8st 9lbs, which means she is very slim for her 5tf 7in height. She said: 'I'll never be big again. I can only keep down around 10 per cent of what I eat, and right now I'm even struggling to keep down water.' Before the sickness started, Miss Harris would tuck into a healthy bowl of cereal for breakfast. Before being diagnosed with Crohn's disease, Miss Harris had four jobs. Now, she is so tired she cannot work. She said: 'I know it sounds unbelievable, but I'd give anything to be 27 stone again' For lunch she'd have a salad or a sandwich, and dinner was a meal cooked by her mother, such as a healthy portion of spaghetti bolognese made with reduced fat Quorn mince. Now, her condition means she cannot eat fats or oils. She has not eaten junk food for the past three years and has been on a strict diet of boiled meat and vegetables. She said: 'I know it sounds unbelievable, but I'd give anything to be 27 stone again. This time last year I held down four jobs, but now I'm too ill to work. 'Being curvy is part of what it means to be a girl. I had that before, but now I just look like a boy.' 'My fingernails have been known to drop off because I'm not getting any nutrients. 'I've also suffered really badly with hair loss. I wore a wig for the entire summer of 2013, which was hot, itchy and just generally uncomfortable. 'I even lost my eyebrows, which made me look like an alien. 'I can't go out and eat with my mates because I'll be sick. 'In the past when I've lost weight on purpose and people complimented me, I felt proud. Now, when people say ""well done"", I feel nothing.' Alarmingly, her weight is still decreasing and doctors are still baffled as to why her weight has not stabilised. She said: 'There's talk about admitting me back to hospital, but I'd give anything to avoid that. 'To some, I have the dream body - but to me, my size six figure is nothing but a nightmare. I can only pray that the doctors find the answer soon.' For more information and support, visit www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk . Crohn's disease is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system . Crohn's disease is a condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system. Inflammation is the body's reaction to injury or irritation and can cause redness, swelling and pain. Crohn's causes ulcers to form in the gut and inflammation that affects the body's ability to digest food, absorb nutrients and eliminate waste in a healthy way. The disease is one of the two main forms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).The other common form of IBD is Ulcerative Colitis. Crohn's is described as chronic, meaning it is a life-long condition. Sufferers will have periods of good health, remission, as well as times when their symptoms flare up or relapse. There is currently no cure for the disease, but drugs and surgery can give patients long periods of relief from their symptoms. The cause of Crohn's disease is not well understood. Experts believe the condition is, in part, inherited, while an abnormal reaction of the immune system to certain bacteria in the intestines is thought to contribute. Viruses, bacteria, diet, smoking and stress have all been suggested as environmental triggers, but there is no definitive evidence that any one of these is a cause of Crohn's. Symptoms include: . Abdominal pain and diarrhoeaTiredness and fatigueFeeling generally unwellMouth ulcersLoss of appetite and weight lossAnaemia - a reduced level of red blood cells . It's estimated around 250,000 people suffer from the condition in the UK. It can start in any age, but usually appears for the first time between the ages of 10 and 40. The disease can cause complications including perforations. They happen when a severe blockage ruptures the bowel, making a hole. The contents of the bowel can leak through and form an abscess. It causes pain and a fever. Source: Crohn's and Colitis UK .","Amelia-Jane Harris was 27st 10lbs at  17 and was called 'Fatty Bum Bum'

"Nearly half of the British public believe the Duchess of Cornwall should become Queen Consort when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne. A new poll by YouGov ahead of Charles and Camilla's 10th wedding anniversary reveals that 49 per cent think Camilla should take the traditional title of the wife of a reigning king, while 35 per cent believe she should be given a lesser title out of respect to Diana, Princess of Wales and 16 per cent were undecided. When the Prince and Camilla became engaged in February 2005, only 7 per cent of people polled by YouGov thought Camilla should one day be Queen. Scroll down for video . Almost half of all Britons believe Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, right, should become Queen when Prince Charles accedes to the throne although 35 per cent believe she should be rewarded with a lesser title . Half of those polled believe that Camilla, right, does a good job of carrying out her official duties . Aides have always insisted the Duchess does not want to be known as Queen and intends to be known as Princess Consort instead. But according to some legal experts, unless there is change in the law, Camilla will technically become Queen no matter what title she actually uses. Most people (42 per cent) said they had neither a positive or negative impression of Camilla, with 31 per cent saying they had a positive one and 23 per cent a negative one. But the survey of 1,830 people also showed that 44 per cent believed Camilla was well prepared to be the wife of the reigning monarch, 13 per cent thought she was badly prepared and the remainder had no opinion or did not know. Of those questioned, 50 per cent thought Camilla had carried out her duties as Duchess of Cornwall well - with 20 per cent saying she did this very well and 30 per cent fairly well. Only 6 per cent thought she had done badly in the role. Some 28 per cent had no opinion and 16 per cent did not know. Nicola Wildash, research executive at YouGov, suggested it was more a case of people becoming used to Camilla, rather than a large surge in popularity. 'The further we get from Diana's death, the less that will resonate in people's minds. As soon as the public see something for years and years, they become more neutralised to the issue,' she said. Prince Charles, left, and Camilla, right, are preparing to celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary . Figures from YouGov in June last year showed 53 per cent thought Camilla should one day become Queen Consort, 32 per cent believed she should have a lesser title and 14 per cent did not know. But Ms Wildash said the slight decrease from 53 per cent to 49 per cent was not significant and part of a general small fluctuation. Almost two fifths (39 per cent) said they believed the Queen was happy with Camilla's performance as the Duchess of Cornwall, with only 9 per cent thinking the monarch was unhappy. Regarding Charles, 29 per cent think he is performing his duties as Prince of Wales better than he did 10 years ago, while 7 per cent think he is performing his duties worse than a decade ago. But 27 per cent think he was already performing his duties well and there has been no difference during the 10 years and 12 per cent believe there is no difference and he is still performing his duties poorly.","Prince Charles and Camilla  will celebrate their anniversary later this week .

"An armed robber who held up a shop with a knife was caught because his own former mother-in-law was working behind the till. Kyle Iveson burst into a convenience store and demanded cash from shop assistant Karen Brown, the mother of his ex-girlfriend and grandmother of his daughter. He attempted to disguise his identity by lowering his voice, but she instantly recognised him and was able to report him to the police straight away. Scroll down for video . Caught: Robber Kyle Iveson, left, was apprehended by his own mother-in-law Karen Brown, right . CCTV images show Iveson, 24, taking a 12in knife into the Thorougoods shop in Clitheroe, Lancashire and threatening Mrs Brown, 54. He escaped with £650, but was quickly arrested and has now pleaded guilty to robbery and being in possession of a bladed article. Speaking after Iveson was jailed for three years at Preston Crown Court, Mrs Brown said: 'He was shouting and swearing and straight away I knew it was him. 'He was one of those people who has a certain type of walk and although he had a scarf around his face and his hood up, I recognised him a mile off. 'I think it was half personal and half to line his pockets - but he's stupid and he thought I wouldn't know it was him.' Terror: Iveson was brandishing a 12in knife when he burst into the convenience store . Threat: The robber demanded money from Mrs Brown while trying to hide his identity . The court heard that Mrs Brown had known Iveson for several years, after he had a year-long relationship with her daughter and the couple had a child together. Prosecutor Neil Basarya said: 'She was in a state of panic and attempted to open the till.The till was opened and a large amount of notes were taken by Iveson. 'At one point he dropped some to the floor and collected them before exiting the shop, still holding the knife up.' In a victim impact statement read out to the court, Mrs Brown described Iveson as extremely aggressive and said the robbery had made her feel vulnerable whenever a customer entered the shop wearing a hood. 'All I want is my life back how it was and then I hope I can return to a normal and happy life,' she said. Defending Iveson, Adam Lodge said he was addicted to heroin and had committed the robbery to fund his habit. Mr Lodge said: 'There is some degree of remorse and he does mention that this incident would have been petrifying for her, but mentions she was not the specific target.' Theft: He pulled out £650 in cash from the till but was arrested by police shortly afterwards . Target: The robbery took place at the Thorougoods convenience store in Clitheroe, Lancashire . Judge Jonathan Gibson told Iveson: 'You had a long kitchen knife and you used that knife to point towards the lady who was serving in the shop. 'Not surprisingly, the offence has had a very significant impact on her.' As well as three years in prison, Iveson is subject to a restraining order which bans him from contacting Mrs Brown in any way. Reliving the moment that Iveson threatened her, Mrs Brown said: 'He just came at it with me, he was holding it in the air. He came round the side of the counter and he had the knife at the side of me. 'He was trying to get the till open and he kept saying ""You'd better get that till open now"", and calling me a b****. 'I was determined not to let him know it was me, I just kept saying, ""Calm down, calm down.""' After the sentencing, the victim said that Iveson's jail term was 'not long enough', adding: 'It was terrifying for me and it has ruined my life. It's no comfort at all knowing he will be out again in no time. 'I wish I could say he will change but I know he won't. He picked the shop because he knew I would be working, he knew my shift patterns. 'He came in 15 minutes after I'd started my shift that night, and it made it worse for me knowing who it was because I didn't think he would stop at anything. 'My daughter's relationship with him was a mistake and we try not to have anything to do with him. I have my granddaughter out of it and I wouldn't change her for the world, but otherwise I wish he didn't exist. 'He used to take great pleasure in grinning and taunting us when he saw us but we tried to ignore him and not let him get to us. I'm not surprised he did something like this.'","Kyle Iveson, 24, burst into convenience store armed with a 12in knife .

"Former president Bill Clinton said he is 'proud' of wife Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential bid for the 2016 election. The comment was said while on a visit to Oklahoma City and is the first he's made about his wife's second presidential campaign, according to CNN. The former secretary of state and first lady kicked off her campaign, which was launched last week, in Iowa and will move on to New Hampshire on Monday. Bill Clinton made the comment in Oklahoma City on Sunday where he was speaking at a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the car bombing that killed 168 people  at the Alfred P Murrah federal building in 1995 . In his first public comments on his wife's 2016 presidential bid, Bill Clinton, pictured here in 2004 with Hillary Clinton, said 'I'm proud of her' while on a visit to Oklahoma City . 'I'm proud of her,' Bill Clinton said of his wife to CNN reporter Ryan Nobles. Bill Clinton was in Oklahoma City to speak at a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the car bombing that killed 168 people including 19 toddlers at the Alfred P Murrah federal building. He addressed hundreds of people gathered at the site of the federal building to commemorate the dead, hailing the city as an example to the world of a strong and compassionate community. The service for survivors, victims' families, and other citizens began at 9.02am with a 168-second moment of silence followed by a reading of the names of those killed. 'I mostly came here to thank you today,' Clinton said. 'For a whole country you burned away all the petty squabbles in which we engaged leaving only our basic humanity. 'I prepared for this day yesterday in New York by taking Hillary to see our daughter and son-in-law and my about to be seven-month-old grandchild. 'Hillary and I bathed her and fed her and put her to bed. I looked at her in that crib so I could remember how you felt, those of you who lost your loved ones.' Visibly emotional, he wiped his eyes as he drew parallels between the 'evil' behind the Oklahoma City bombing and the terrorism of Boko Haram in North Africa, ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and lone wolf militants in cities such as Paris. 'For 20 years you have honored the memories of your loved ones, you have inspired us with the power of your renewal, you have reminded us that we should all live by the Oklahoma Standard,' Clinton said at the service. Hillary Clinton will spend Monday and Tuesday in New Hampshire, returning to the state that handed her a 2008 primary victory early in the bruising nomination struggle won by Obama. Clinton's supporters say her recent comments, particularly on inequality, do not reflect a shift in position. In her 2008 primary campaign, Clinton stressed the need to help families struggling economically and she criticized hedge fund investors, oil company profits, drug company subsidies and trade agreements.

"Kim Richards is speaking out for the first time since her shocking arrest last week following a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel. The former child star turned Real Housewife discusses her demons in an emotional interview with Dr. Phil set to air April 28, her first for a national audience since the arrest. Among the topics the 50-year-old is slated to discuss is her longtime struggle with alcoholism. About her April 16 arrest, Richards reveals, 'I was angry and frightened and I was scared. I knew what I had done. The whole night is my fault. None of this would have happened if I didn’t drink.' Richards - who has been to rehab three times - was charged with with public intoxication, trespassing, resisting arrest and battery on a police officer and arrested at the Beverly Hills Hotel last week. Sat with Dr. Phil: Kim Richards is speaking out for the first time since her shocking arrest last week following a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel . Contradicting reports: Some sources involved in production of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills say that Kim Richard's protestations that she was sober last season were laughable - while others say she was doing better than ever . Currently, Kim is scheduled to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on May 10 following her April 16 incident at the Polo Lounge where she 'caused a disturbance at the hotel restaurant and was taken into custody at the Beverly Hills Police Department.' According to the Richards family friend, Kim's drunk actions were brought on after watching the three-part reunion for the seventh season, which left her 'distraught' and 'very embarrassed.' But that wasn't the only cause. Kim's ex-husband Monty Brinson - who is battling Stage IV cancer - continues to lean on her for support, which fans were able to watch on the recent RHOBH season. 'A big part of all of this is that she is just stressed out,' the pal explained. 'She is under a lot of pressure, especially because of Monty. While Kim Richards staunchly defended herself during the last season of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills - maintaining that she no longer struggles with substance abuse - reports from the cast and crew tell a different story. Several sources involved in production told TMZ that Kim's recent protestations that she was sober were laughable. And while veteran cast members Kyle Richards, Lisa Vanderpump and Yolanda Foster learned to look the other way to avoid drama, Lisa Rinna and Eileen Davidson were the ones to confront the star. Insiders say that the 50-year-old would never drink where people could see her, sometimes drinking in the bathroom and emerging drunk. However, other sources from the show say that Kim was doing a better job than ever of keeping her addiction under control. Interestingly, Brandi Glanville - who was one of Kim's closest friends during season five - sided with both camps, depending on who you talked to. They knew better: Veteran cast members such as Kim's sister Kyle, Yolanda Foster and Lisa Vanderpump all chose to look away during the last season to avoid confrontation . Speaking out: Eileen Davidson (third left) and Lisa Rinna (second from right) were the two who chose to confront Kim about her issues during season five . One crew member revealed that Kim's sobriety was called into question several months ago after the incident where the mother-of-four's dog bit her sister Kyle's daughter Alexia. When a dog trainer was sent to her house to assess the situation Kim was reportedly such a mess he had to help put her to bed. Kim was arrested on Thursday morning after a drunken altercation at The Beverly Hills Hotel where she had to be dragged out of a bathroom after refusing to leave the premises. She was taken to jail and cited with trespass, battery on a police officer, resisting arrest and drunk in public. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the former child star may be booted off the Bravo show as producers feel she has become a liability due to her issues with substance abuse. Playing both sides: Insiders say that Brandi Glanville (centre) - who was one of Kim's closest plas during the last season - sides with both camps . Confirmed: Details of Kim's arrest were revealed in a statement from the Beverly Hills police department . Since she first appeared on the hit reality show in 2010, her sobriety has been her major storyline, with her recent relapse as the driving force between Kim and Kyle's distant relationship. TMZ alleges that Bravo are concerned that due to the nature of the show, they could be held accountable if something was to happen to Kim. There have been no permanent decisions made however, according to the gossip site. The next season of RHOBH has a few months before production picks up again so the final decision has yet to be concrete.

"A selection of thirsty animals were captured drinking water in their own unique way – and the results are hilarious. Elad Hershkowitz, a zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, placed a GoPro camera at the bottom of water troughs to capture the different perspectives. The animals – ranging from a rhino who almost kisses the surface of the water to a lemur who delicately licks it – were recorded for a total of 30 hours. Zookeeper Elad Hershkowitz, of the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, filmed animals drinking on a GoPro camera . He placed the camera in the animals' water troughs and filmed them  for a total of 30 hours . The 26-year-old then cut the final footage down to four minutes. He said: ‘Capturing this footage was really special. It offers a completely unique perspective to anything I’ve ever seen before. ‘I had the idea whilst walking around the enclosures and I saw the zebras drinking. ‘It made me curious to see what was going on below so I decided to check how the rest of the animals drink. Hershkowitz said some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object in their troughs . A commanding rhino appears to almost kiss the surface of the water after it purses its lips and takes a drink . ‘There is a massive difference in how each animal drinks. Carnivores, like lions, drink a lot like domesticated cats and dogs. Herbivores like the rhinos and zebras suck up the water with their lips.’ According to Mr Hershkowitz, some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object placed at the bottom of their trough. He said they attempted to check them out by putting their hooves and paws into the water first before going to take a drink. Eventually however, they got used to the camera’s presence and drank freely. A lemur is featured in the four minute footage and delicately licks the surface of the water with its tongue . A herd of zebra humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping the water from their trough . The zookeeper also anticipated a range of reactions from the animals before the experiment and ensured that the camera was secure before it took place. ‘I was really worried the lions would bite off the GoPro, so I placed a sheet of acrylic glass above the camera,’ he said. In the clip the lion can be seen aggressively breaking the surface of the water with its tongue, and is in complete contrast to a herd of zebra, who humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping.","A zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv recorded the footage .

"A retired British soldier has been arrested by detectives investigating the shooting of a man with learning difficulties in Northern Ireland in 1974. John Pat Cunningham, 27, was shot by the Army in a field in Benburb, County Armagh. A 73-year-old suspect has now been detained in England. He is being taken to Northern Ireland for questioning at the police's Serious Crime Suite in Antrim. John Pat Cunningham (pictured, left, in photo held by his nephew Charlie Agnew, right) was shot by the British Army in a field in 1974. A man has now been arrested over his death . The case was recently re-opened by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and a murder investigation started following a re-examination of the available evidence. Mr Cunningham had a fear of men in uniform and was running away from an Army patrol when he was shot. The Government apologised for his death in 2013. The inquiry is being carried out by the PSNI's Legacy Investigations Branch - a unit which examines historic cases from the Troubles. Relatives of Mr Cunningham, who had a mental age of between six and 10, said the investigation did not have their support. Mr Cunningham was running away from an Army patrol when he was shot. He had a fear of men in uniform . Victims campaign organisation the Pat Finucane Centre (PFC) issued a statement on the family's behalf. 'Whilst family members have cautiously welcomed the arrest, they have asked the PFC to state categorically that they will only have confidence in an investigative process that is completely independent of the PSNI,' said a PFC spokesman. 'Cunningham family members said in October 2013 that they wish to see all investigations into British Army killings, including that of John Pat, being investigated by an independent body.' The investigation into the shooting was re-opened in March this year. Speaking in March, DI Neil McGuinness of the PSNI said: 'I appreciate this happened more than 40 years ago but I believe there are people in the community today who remember this tragic incident, who knew John Pat and who may have information which would be of assistance to the investigation. 'Our objective is to get to the truth of what happened that Saturday morning so that justice can be served.' The Government apologised for his death in 2013.

"An 86-year-old  Kansas City Chiefs superfan had one dying wish - to see her beloved team before taking her last breath. Great-great grandmother Betty Johnson of Missouri, a Chiefs season ticket holder since 1986, had said goodbye to everyone except for her team. But her wish was granted on Thursday after a visit from Chiefs Hall of Famer Nick Lowery, and Johnson passed away shortly after, just as he was leaving, her family said. 'I believe she [was] holding on to say goodbye to her Chiefs,' her daughter, Susan told KCTV5. Scroll down for video . Betty Johnson, 86, was a Kansas City Chiefs ticket holder since 1986. A devoted fan, she was known as 'grandma' by several players and received a kiss from wide receiver Dwayne Bowe every game (above) As a devoted fan, Johnson, who was known as 'grandma' by several current players, would sit front row on the 45-yard line during home games. Her presence at the games did not go unnoticed. Wide receiver Dwayne Bowe would kiss her at every game, and former return specialist and wide receiver Dante Hall took off his coat and gave it to her,  Susan Johnson said. The last game the retired school bus driver saw was on November 30 when the Chiefs played the Denver Broncos. Last season, she attended every home game apart from three. Chiefs Hall of Famer Nick Lowery (above) visited Johnson on Thursday and shortly after the visit, she passed away . 'She is such a die-hard Chiefs fans and loves them so much,' Susan Johnson told KCTV5. 'Her Chiefs were more important to her than her home.' Johnson actually lost her North Kansas City home in order to pay for her Chiefs season tickets, according to KCTV5. The ailing mother-of-five daughters had been in hospice care since April 7, and her health had been deteriorating after breaking her hip in February. In a bid to get Johnson's last request completed, her great granddaughter shared a photo of Bowe kissing her grandmother at a recent game on Twitter. Autumn Barricks wrote to the team on Twitter: 'My gma is the teams gma and she is on hospice :( I believe she is holding on to say goodbye to her chiefs.' After users shared the picture of Bowe and Johnson together, as it went viral, word eventually reached the team which sent Lowery. Barricks wrote on April 17: 'We did it!!! Thank you all for sharing and liking and retweeting!' The Chiefs Ambassadors shared on Twitter that Betty would be missed by Chief Kingdom. The post said: 'HOFer Nick Lowery visited w/ longtime season ticket member Betty Johnson in her last moments. Chiefs Kingdom will miss you Betty.' Following Lowery's visit, the Chiefs shared a post on Twitter saying she would be missed. It said: 'Chiefs Kingdom will miss you Betty' During Lowery's visit, Barricks told KSHB the family said a prayer and as Lowery was going to leave they realized she had passed away. Barricks said: 'We sang a prayer, and he was going to leave, and we noticed that she was no longer breathing. 'We believe that she was just waiting to say goodbye to her Chiefs.'

"The wife of Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor allegedly made an obscene gesture then threw a cup of soda over one of her husband's political rivals. Tonya Stack, whose husband Mike Stack holds the state's second-highest office, reportedly dumped cola on state representative Kevin Boyle in an unseemly row at a fundraiser in honor of a slain Afghanistan veteran. According to Boyle, Stack 'flipped me the bird' as soon as she spotted him at the event in Philadelphia. 'Soda fight': Pennsylvania state representative Kevin Boyle, left, claims that he was covered in soda by Tonya Stack, right, wife of Lieutenant Governor Mike Stack, and a political opponent . When he described the gesture aloud as 'a trashy move', he claims she retaliated by hurling the dark, sticky liquid at him, according to a report by Philly.com. He told the site: 'She aimed the soda at me and it landed directly on me, hitting from my chest to my lap'. He added that at the time he was sitting with the grandmother of Michael Strange, a Navy codebreaker who was killed by RPG fire in 2011 and whom the event was honoring. Boyle said that she came close to getting soaked as well, but that he took the brunt of the blast. He claims that after her shot landed, she was bundled out by a State Trooper who was guarding her. Rivalries: Boyle and Lt Gov Mike Stack (pictured) have been at the center of a political row . Boyle and Mike Stack, both Democrats, are at the center of a political struggle over who will take over the seat in Pennsylvania's state senate which Stack vacated to become Lieutenant Governor in January. Earlier this year, politicsPA.com also reported that the two were also backing different candidates in the race for a Philadelphia district which Boyle's brother had resigned to become a U.S. congressman. Ultimately, Stack's 'handpicked' candidate was chosen to contest the election, but lost to a Republican, Philly.com reported. Commenting on the alleged confrontation, Boyle told the website: 'This was a ridiculous and immature act that shouldn't have happened and hopefully won't be repeated. 'We have to be civil about our differences in politics.' A spokesman for Mike Stack confirmed that the lieutenant governor's wife was at the event. However, he did not comment on the soda-throwing part of the allegations, and insisted that she left 'under normal circumstances'.","Tonya Stack, wife of Mike Stack, allegedly hurled drink at fundraiser .

"A devoted Chinese father is desperately trying to raise money to pay his son's huge medical bills by dressing up a horse and begging people to ride him. Chen Yuntao, 38, wears a horse mask as he kneels on the busy streets of Hefei City, next to a sign asking for 'kind-hearted' people to get on his back for a ride for five yuan – the equivalent of 54p. The unusual fundraising is part of a desperate bid to raise money for his nine-year-old son Chen Minghao, who is suffering from leukaemia. Desperate father Chen Yuntao, 38, has started dressing as a horse and begging people to ride him in exchange for 54p. He is frantically trying to raise money for his son's ever-growing medical bills for his cancer treatment . Mr Chen kneels on the ground as he begs and has a sign, explaining his plight. The family are already in huge debt after son Minghao underwent 20 course of chemotherapy for leukaemia, and now the cancer has returned . The family is 160,000 yuan (£17,500) in debt for treatment he has already received, having already spent 200,000 yuan (£21,800) on medical bills, The People's Daily Online reports. The next course of therapy will cost between 400,000 and 500,000 yuan (£43,600 to £54,600). After Mr Chen first starting begging at the entrance of a subway the city management turned up within minutes to move him along – but when they learnt about his heart-breaking situation, they offered to help find him a better spot. 'I saw others raising funds in the street using a sign so I gave it a try', the 38-year-old said. 'If it wasn't the very last resort I would never have thought I would be begging on the street. 'Yesterday my son just completed the current stage of his chemotherapy and the doctors say that as soon as the boy is physically ready he can proceed to the next stage of treatment which I have no money for.' 'In the village I saw children paying to ride on horses so I thought I could pretend to be a horse and offer rides to raise money for my son. For my son I will gladly do anything.' Little Minghao, nine, has been in and out of hospital for treatment since 2011. His father said begging on the street while dressed as a horse was a 'last resort', but he would 'gladly do anything' for his child . As yet nobody has taken the opportunity to ride Mr Chen, but plenty of kind-hearted strangers have donated money. He came up with the idea of dressing up as a horse after watching children pay to be taken on a ride . Minghao was first diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in December 2011. After 20 courses of chemotherapy he was finally able to leave hospital in 2013 – but during a routine check-up in March the family was told his cancer had returned. As yet no-one has ridden Mr Chen, but many passers-by have donated money to him. Dr Xu, who is looking after Minghao, said in all the years the family had been in hospital he had never seen the father wear new clothes or bring the child in food. 'I know they are very poor but I didn't know that they were in such poverty', he said. Doctors of Minghao, pictured in his hospital bed, said they didn't realise the family was so desperately poor. The next course of his cancer treatment will cost up to 500,000 Yuan, but the family is entitled to some relief . 'To know Mr Chen is begging on the street in order to raise funds for his child is really sad and upsetting.' Nine-year-old Minghao said: 'The needles are not painful anymore. I hope to recover soon so that I can go back to school.' The family will qualify for seriously illness release on the next course of treatment, meaning they will have a 90 per cent reimbursement. However, Mr Chen will still need to find another 50,000 Yuan (£5,500) plus ongoing post-treatment medical expenses if Minghao begins to recover.","Desperate father is begging people to ride him to raise much-needed cash .

"Australia's 'tiny hearts and balls of steel', it's apparently the perfect combination in dealing with asylum seeker boats, and a policy which could be copied by Britain, according to a British commentator. Controversial The Sun columnist Katie Hopkins has heaped praise on Tony Abbott's government for its success in stopping the boats, which was a key election plank.

'They threaten them with violence until they bugger off, throwing cans of Castlemaine in an Aussie version of sharia stoning.' Her tone has won few friends in Europe and her timing, even less so, slammed as it coincided with the drowning of up to 900 men, women and children on a sunken fishing boat, off Italy. Hopkins went on to write: 'Make no mistake, these migrants are like cockroaches.' 'Australians are like British people but with balls of steel, can-do brains, tiny hearts and whacking great gunships.

'Bring on the gunships, force migrants back to their shores and burn the boats.' She stated that areas of the UK had now become 'festering sores, plagued by swarms of migrants and asylum seekers, shelling out benefits like Monopoly money'.

"The U.S Surgeon General has enlisted Elmo to urge American children to get vaccinated in the wake of recent national debate over the right to refuse immunization. A campaign video sees Dr Vivek Murthy and the Sesame Street favourite go through the process of getting vaccinated and explaining to children (and parents) why it is so important. In what appears to be a direct response to anti-vaccination campaigners, Elmo and Dr Murthy questions why everybody does not get a shot. Scroll down for video . Campaign: Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and Elmo explain why getting vaccinated is crucial to keep other children safe and healthy . As Dr Murthy visits Sesame Street, Elmo tells him he is 'worried about getting a shot,' asking the Surgeon General: 'Why does everyone need a vaccination, anyway?' In response Dr Murthy compares getting vaccinated to using an umbrella when it rains and wearing a helmet on a bike. This calms Elmo who gets the shot he needs, and after realising how quick and painless it is to get a shot, he asks Dr Murthy whey everybody doesn't get a vaccination? 'That's a good question, Elmo,' Murthy says, looking at the camera. 'That's a good question.' The video, produced by the Daily Dot, is accompanied by a shorter 30-second video of Elmo and the Surgeon General released by the Department of Health and Human Services. Important message: Dr Murthy explains that the best way Elmo can help him to do his job and keeping Americans healthy, is by getting 'all his Sesame Street friends' vaccinated too . It sees Dr Murthy explains that the best way Elmo can help him to do his job and keeping Americans healthy, is by getting 'all his Sesame Street friends' vaccinated too. The campaign videos have been released in the wake of a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in December, sickened 147 people in the U.S., which has seen the debate over vaccination flare up. Officials at the California Department of Public Health said no new infections have been reported for the past 42 days — or two incubation periods — meaning the outbreak is over in the U.S. Many who fell ill in the Disneyland episode were not immunized against measles. Some cited personal reasons for refusing shots, and others were too young to get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. In California, where 131 of the 147 measles cases could be found, a vaccination bill has generated intense debates pitting personal rights against public health. The campaign videos have been released amidst debate across the United States over whether vaccines should be compulsory in the wake of a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in December . The measure would bar parents from seeking vaccine exemptions for their children because of religious or personal beliefs, joining California with Mississippi and West Virginia in such strict requirements. Medical waivers would only be available for children with health problems, forcing unvaccinated children to be homeschooled. California lawmakers were set to vote on the bill last week, but this was postponed by supporters postponed so authors could work on revisions to address concerns raised in the Senate Education Committee. The proposal's lead author, Sen. Richard Pan, a Democratic pediatrician from Sacramento, said he is confident he can clarify his bill so lawmakers are comfortable in supporting his bill.

"The full horror of 'crime and punishment' under the Islamic State is laid bare in a document which sets out a list of harsh penalties for anyone who falls foul of the terror group's strict interpretation of its own laws. Top of the list is 'death' for anyone who insults God or his messenger or blasphemes against Islam. Adulterers who engage in a sexual relationship are to be stoned to death, while couples who have an affair without sexual contact can expect the more lenient punishment of 100 lashes and 'banishment' from the community. Crucified: The list of ISIS' gruesome punishments dictates that 'spying for disbelievers' is punishable by death - a fate this man suffered by being publicly crucified . Stoned to death: The terror group broadcast this image of a man and women being stoned to death for having sex before marriage, as the barbaric list which surfaced on an ISIS propaganda website proclaims . Barbaric: It allegedly pertains to the IS-held territory in Aleppo but their brutal punishments have taken place in various places, including the death of this man in Raqqa, Syria after he was accused of being gay . Those guilty of 'highway robbery' face crucifixion and offences such as drinking wine or 'calumny', making slanderous comments, each attract the punishment of 80 lashes. Homosexuality is also to be punished by 'death for the penetrator and the receiver' while thieves will have their hands severed from their arms. The growing threat to the Islamic State from spies inside the group's controlled territory has forced the religious leaders to impose a summary death penalty to all those found guilty of 'spying for the interests of the disbelievers'. IS claims the list of 'religious punishments' is a 'warning and deterrent' to the kufr, or disbelievers and infidels. Many of the punishments have already been carried out by IS. Public crucifixions in the IS stronghold of Raqqa in northern Syria have become common-place while pictures of stonings and gay men being thrown from buildings have been widely circulated on social media. The new list of religious punishments pertains to the IS-controlled province of Aleppo and claims to be based on Sharia law. Death: Images which emerged last month a of a large bloodthirsty crowd who gathered to watch a young victim who was accused of being gay hurled off a mutti-storey building by ISIS fighters . Depraved: And only last week, militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq released gruesome footage showing an accused thief's hand being hacked off by an industrial guillotine . It reads: 'Therefore, the Islamic State, believing in God - Almighty and Exalted is He - who has sent down the Book, and regarding as kufr [disbelief] the nations united to wage war on the Lord of the Lords, and regarding as kufr [disbelief] the judgements / rulings put in place by those created from the soil, pledges to God - Almighty and Exalted is He - to rule by His Shari'a in His land among His servants even if the disbelievers hate it. 'Thus we would like to make clear to the people the hudud [religious punishments] of God- Almighty and Exalted is He- as a warning and deterrent.' The document pronounces: 'And indeed we make the people fear their Lord and call them to enter into His mercy by embracing His commands and adhering to His prohibition orders for that is the best outcome in that. 'Sharia law': The new list of religious punishments pertains to the IS-controlled province of Aleppo and claims to be based on Sharia law . 'And there is nothing better in the one judged if he does not submit to the law of the Lord and there is nothing better for the one who judges if he does not judge/rule his servants by the ruling of God. 'And indeed the Islamic State will not compromise on this great attainment for whose sake it has offered hundreds of martyrs from its pious and pure sons, but rather it has established the law of God among its soldiers, and it has brought judgements even of death without exception among them.' The number of fighters leaving home to join al-Qaida and the Islamic State group in Iraq, Syria and other countries has spiked to more than 25,000 from over 100 nations, according to a new U.N. report. The panel of experts monitoring U.N. sanctions against al-Qaida said in the report obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press that its analysis indicates the number of foreign terrorist fighters worldwide increased by 71 percent between mid-2014 and March 2015. It said the scale of the problem has increased over the past three years and the flow of foreign fighters 'is higher than it has ever been historically.' Foreign fighters: The UN estimates the number of fighters leaving home to join ISIS militants - such as the Londoner dubbed Jihadi John (pictured) - has risen to over 25,000 from over 100 nations . The overall number of foreign terrorist fighters has 'risen sharply from a few thousand ... a decade ago to more than 25,000 today,' the panel said in the report to the U.N. Security Council. The report said just two countries have accounted for over 20,000 foreign fighters: Syria and Iraq. They went to fight primarily for the Islamic State group but also the Al-Nusra Front. Looking ahead, the panel said the thousands of foreign fighters who traveled to Syria and Iraq are living and working in 'a veritable `international finishing school' for extremists,' as was the case in Afghanistan in the 1990s.","ISIS claims the horrifying list of punishments is a 'warning' to disbelievers .

"Horrifying images of a baby elephant tied to a pole and forced to perform tricks has sparked a push to have it freed, just weeks after one of the endangered animals was ridden by drunken tourists around a swimming pool. The campaign was kicked off by Jaime Singleton, who saw the baby elephant, Nadia, tied to a pole outside a restaurant at Marina Phuket Resort in December last year. The change.org petition, titled 'Please release Nadia the baby elephant to a sanctuary immediately and let her live the life she deserves!', has received 50,627 signatures since it was launched a month ago. The target is 75,000. Scroll down for video . Baby elephant, Nadia, seen in a picture posted to Marina Phuket Resort's Facebook page, is a 'mascot' for the resort and is forced to do tricks for guests . Ms Singleton said Nadia is also used by another company in Thailand in weddings . Another holiday resort in Thailand has come under fire after it posted a picture online of drunken guests riding an elephant around its swimming pool . 'It's absolutely barbaric,' Ms Singleton told Daily Mail Australia. 'They use bull-hooks and chains on the animals, and handlers sneakily have nails in their hands they hit the elephants with to make they move around the resorts. It's terrifying.' Ms Singleton said she has been told by sanctuaries and animal rights workers in the area that the resorts don't own the elephants themselves, and they instead rely on private contractors who 'rent' the animals out to different places. The elephants are bought at a very young age by these groups, so that they can be 'trained' for the job and are often forced to live in appalling conditions. The elephants are also put through a breaking in process called 'Phajaan' that uses cruel behaviour and negative reinforcement to break its spirit. Jaime Singleton launched the online campaign after she saw Nadia tied up outside a restaurant (pictured) at the resort . Elephants are forced to pose for pictures and be ridden by guests at the resort, and others across Thailand . 'They use bull-hooks and chains on the animals, and handlers sneakily have nails in their hands they hit the elephants with to make they move around the resorts. It's terrifying' Nikki Beach Resort in Phuket published the picture along with a caption that stated it was 'amazing Sunday brunch' Ms Singleton said Nadia is rumoured to be kept in a tiny enclosure, and does not have any interaction with other elephants. She also said a elephant sanctuary has committed to taking Nadia in if she was released, which would allow the elephant to 'live the life she deserves, surrounded by other elephants, and in the care of those who will love and cherish her.' Ms Singleton said she had repeatedly tried to contact the resort since earlier this year, but she it had not replied to any of her calls or emails. Ms Singleton said she has been told by sanctuaries and animal rights workers in the area that the resorts don't own the elephants themselves, and they instead rely on private contractors who 'rent' the animals out . World Animal Protection's Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach said this sort of behaviour is a 'far cry from their natural lives in the wild'. 'When you look behind the scenes, holiday snaps like these support an industry that relies on animal cruelty,' Dr Schmidt-Burbach said. Animal rights activists slammed the way resorts treat animals, and said tourists should not take part in the behaviour . 'This sordid side of tourism is conveniently hidden from public view.' Earlier this year, TripAdvisor posted a blog criticising Beyoncé after the superstar was snapped riding an elephant while on vacation. 'Hi @Beyonce! We don't want to ruin your vacay, but elephant rides are not fun for elephants,' the company tweeted. 'Hi @Beyonce! We don't want to ruin your vacay, but elephant rides are not fun for elephants,' TripAdvisor tweeted . 'People often think that an elephant in captivity is domesticated, and so somehow it's OK to have them under human command,' the company wrote. 'But the reality is that [elephants] never have been domesticated like dogs or horses. Even if born in captivity, they are still a wild animal, and need to be ""broken"" to accept human control. 'There is much evidence that this process is exceptionally cruel.' World Animal Protection's Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach said this sort of behaviour is a 'far cry from their natural lives in the wild' 'When you look behind the scenes, holiday snaps like these support an industry that relies on animal cruelty,' Dr Schmidt-Burbach said . One sanctuary in the area has said it would be willing to take Nadia in, if it's owners freed her . The petition comes after another resort in the island holiday haven was criticised last month for allowing tourists to party with a baby elephant. A holiday resort in Thailand has come under fire after it posted a picture online of drunken guests riding a baby elephant around its swimming pool. The picture, which drew widespread criticism immediately after it was posted, was accompanied by a caption that stated it was 'amazing Sunday brunch'. The resort is located about 30 minutes away from the tourist hot-spot of Patong . Nikki Beach Resort in Phuket was flooded with complaints over the photo, reports The Daily Telegraph. People were enraged such a young elephant had been brought onto the property so that guests could ride it for fun, and that guests were more than willing to take part. The resort quickly deleted the photo, and released a statement to address the controversy. 'We would like to make it clear that we do not, have not and will never own an elephant,' the statement read. 'The elephant in the photo is from a reputable elephant caretaker who has no affiliation with Nikki Beach. 'We would like to make it clear that we do not, have not and will never own an elephant,' a statement from the resort read . 'Elephants are a highly respected and regarded symbol of Thailand. As a global company, Nikki Beach respects every country's culture and traditions and as such, we fall into the normal behaviors in usage of elephants to represent their culture. 'We never intended to be disrespectful.' The statement did little to calm the stampeding herd of online protesters, and the anger spilled onto the resort's TripAdvisor page. However, TripAdvisor deleted negative reviews based on the elephant incident.

"Fired: Stephen Hogger, pictured, was sacked after apparently falling out with senior church figures . As the congregation of St Peter and St Paul Church filed in for the Easter Sunday service, thoughts naturally turned to the meaning of sacrifice. But little did they know it would be put into action by the entire choir moments later. A letter handed out to the stunned churchgoers revealed the 13 choristers were quitting en masse in ‘solidarity’ over the sacking of music director Stephen Hogger. The walkout means it will be the first time in 200 years that the church, which is famed for its timber-framed Tudor buildings, will be without a choir. The 55-year-old, who had been at the 14th century church in Lavenham, Suffolk, for 17 years, was given notice to leave following an apparent falling out with senior figures. A villager, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It seems to be down to a clash of personalities. Some people at the church feel that Mr Hogger can come across as abrasive and even rude on occasion. ‘There have been comments about him being dismissive and offhand to members of the public, like couples who are planning on getting married and are not regular members of the congregation. ‘He has also not turned up to some meetings and has failed to keep arrangements to talk to people.’ ‘It was felt that his behaviour was out of line with how the church wanted to be seen but members of the choir have always had a great respect for him. They admire him because he is very gifted musically.’ Church organist Mr Hogger, who is a Fellow of the Guild of Musicians and Singers and Associate of the London College of Music, said: ‘Obviously it is all a bit difficult. There is nothing more I can tell you. ‘There was nothing about my behaviour mentioned in the letter I received and I was not at the parochial church council meeting so I do not know what was said.’ Solidarity: All 13 of his choristers at St Peter and St Paul Church have now resigned over his sacking . Quiet: The 14th century Suffolk church will now be without a choir for the first time in 200 years . The letter handed to worshippers said: ‘Following the announcement last week of Stephen Hogger’s dismissal, it is with huge sadness and after a great deal of thought and discussion that the current members of the choir have decided to leave. ‘This decision follows a long period of unhappiness and lack of understanding between the choir and the leadership of Lavenham Church. Today (Easter Sunday) will be our last service.’ On holiday: Stephen Earl, the rector of the church, was away and unavailable to comment yesterday . Mr Hogger was given three months’ notice to terminate the contract on his part-time paid post on March 29 by the PCC. Chorister Gillian Smith, 67, who has sung at the church for 30 years, said: ‘All I want to say is that we resigned to show solidarity with Stephen Hogger. That is the reason we came out in support of him.’ Another chorister, who declined to be named, added they were ‘disappointed and upset’. ‘At the end of the day it is not a very Christian attitude that has been shown to Stephen,’ they said. Stephen Earl, 61, the rector of the church, was away on holiday yesterday and unavailable to comment. Church warden Graham Patrick said: ‘The basic facts are that the PCC have given three months’ notice to our director of music. ‘In solidarity with him, the choir has also decided to leave, something which we in the church very much regret.’ John Howard, a spokesman for the diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, added everyone ‘wish him well in the next phase of his career.’","Easter Sunday congregation handed a letter explaining choir had quit .

"George Osborne dodged questions over plans to offer more help to the country's top earners . Labour and Tory politicians have come to blows over the 45p top tax rate following the Chancellor's admission that establishing the threshold was not one of the Government's priorities. George Osborne has avoided calls to rule out further help for the country's top earners, offering vague answers when asked whether those raking in more than £50,000 could see the rate lowered. Instead he says the Conservatives are committed to raising the tax-free personal allowance bracket from £10,000 to £12,500. Raising 40 per cent tax so that it only applies to those earning at least £50,000 was also a priority, he said. At present anyone earning between £31,866 to £150,000 is taxed at the higher rate. Those earning above £150,000 are taxed at the higher rate of 45 per cent. But Labour politicians are calling for the amount to be raised to 50 per cent for those in the highest bracket. Accusing the current Government of prioritising 'helping the very richest', Shadow chief secretary Chris Leslie condemned the Chancellor's refusal to rule out offering reduced tax rates on high income salaries. When pressed in an interview with Sky News the Chancellor refused to rule out making further cuts for Britain's top earners, instead saying the issue was 'not a priority'. 'If that was our priority or our plan we would have made it part of our plan and made it one of our priorities. Scroll down for video . 'That's not our plan. Judge us by what we want to do and what we want to do is increase the tax-free personal allowance to £12,500 so people full-time on the minimum wage don't have to pay income tax and millions are better off,' he said. 'And when it comes to higher rate taxpayers our priority is increasing the threshold at which you pay that higher rate, the 40p rate, to £50,000.' 'Those are our big tax commitments for the coming parliament.' The Chancellor added that any deal between Labour and SNP would harm the country, claiming the latter's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was 'much stronger' than the opposition leader . He also refused to commit to devoting 2 per cent of the budget to defence, the limit agreed by NATO members. David Cameron has faced repeated calls to commit to spending 2 per cent of the budget on defence . 'We made a commitment at Nato. We are spending it today. We have made a clear commitment to the future of the equipment budget, to increase that in real terms ..,. and we have made commitments on the size of the armed forces,' he said. 'I don't think anyone should be in any doubt ... about our commitment to strong national security'. He also said any deal struck between the SNP and Labour would harm the country, lambasting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to broker such a partnership as 'disturbing'. 'The fact that the Labour Party, that was a party that campaigned for the Union in the referendum, is contemplating an arrangement with the SNP, who want to break up the country, is deeply disturbing.' He added the Scottish nationalist leaders were 'much stronger' than the opposition leader who he said would be overrun if they entered a coalition together. 'That would be bad for the entire United Kingdom, bad for the integrity of the Union but also bad for our economy because it would mean higher debts and higher taxes.' He also accused Ed Balls of 'running scared' by not agreeing to a debate with him and Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury. The Chancellor accused Ed Balls of 'running scared' of a debate on the economy with himself and Danny Alexander .","Chancellor faces calls to rule out further tax cuts for the UK's top earners .

"Raffaele Sollecito has been pictured going on a lingerie shopping spree - two weeks after he was cleared of killing British student Meredith Kercher. The Italian, who spent four years in prison after previously being found guilty of the murder of Surrey-born Meredith, 21, in 2007, is said to be looking at compensation. The 31-year-old was spotted out and about with a blonde companion this week looking through the lingerie section of a shop in Rome, Italy - days after he was seen looking at a £105,000 BMW at a car dealership in the city. Scroll down for video . Raffaele Sollecito was seen shopping for lingerie two weeks after he was cleared of killing British student Meredith Kercher . The 31-year-old (left) was out about in the Italian capital Rome with a blonde companion browsing through the underwear section of a shop . Mr Sollecito and his former lover, American Amanda Knox were both acquitted in late March ending a legal process which lasted more than seven years and saw them both serve four years in prison. He later described the ruling as an 'end to the nightmare' telling a press conference that he needed 'time to heal' and 'time to breathe this fresh air'. Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison. Mr Sollecito (pictured) and his former lover, American Amanda Knox were both acquitted in late March ending a legal process which lasted more than seven years . Out and about: Raffaele Sollecito's shopping trip comes a week after he was seen looking at a £100,000 BMW at a dealership in Rome . Both Knox and Sollecito (right) are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison . While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums. Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno revealed her client would wait for Italy's top court to give the reasoning behind the acquittal, expected later this year, before taking a decision. Knox's lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph. Arline Kercher, Meredith's mother, described the acquittal ruling as 'odd'. Raffaele Sollecito (pictured left with a blonde companion) described his acquittal last month as an 'end to the nightmare' The 31-year-old told a press conference last month that he needed 'time to heal' and 'time to breathe this fresh air' Raffaele Sollecito is pictured with a companion leaving a clothes shop in the Italian capital, Rome . She said: '(I am) a bit surprised, and very shocked, but that is about it at the moment. They have been convicted twice so it's a bit odd that it should change now.' Her daughter, who was 21 and from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia, Italy. Seattle-born Miss Knox, 27, who was Ms Kercher's flat-mate, and Mr Sollecito, spent four years in jail for the murder but were acquitted on appeal in 2011. But Italy's highest court last month overturned the 2014 convictions and declined to order another trial. Raffaele Sollecito (right) flanked by his lawyer Giulia Bongiorno, talks to the media during a press conference in Rome.

Mererith Kercher (pictured) from Coulsdon, Surrey, was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her bedroom in 2007 while studying in Perugia, Italy . The decision by the Supreme Court of Cassation is the final ruling in the seven-year case and definitively ends the gruelling legal battle. The pair always maintained their innocence. Both Sollecito and Knox were imprisoned shortly after Kercher's body was discovered with 47 separate wounds on November 1, 2007. They were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in December 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively. After they served four years in prison a court in Perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent. A view of the house where British student Kercher was killed. It is understood Knox will go back to Italy to write a book about the country's legal system . Knox and Sollecito were pictured embracing as police searched the house immediately after Kercher's death . Knox returned to the US before another U-turn in the sensational case in January last year when a court in Florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased Knox's sentence to 28-and-a-half years. Judge Gennaro Marasca read the decision to finally acquit the pair in late March after a judicial body had deliberated for ten hours. Rudy Guede is now the only person to be successfully convicted of the murder. The unemployed basketball player was found guilty in October 2008 and was convicted to 16 years after his footprints were discovered in Kercher's blood. The court will publish its reasons for last month's decision within 90 days.","Raffaele Sollecito pictured shopping for lingerie in a clothes shop in Rome .

"Terrorist group ISIS has released photographs of its militants destroying Christian graves with sledgehammers and carving out crosses in the Iraqi city of Mosul. It's the latest shocking act by the Islamists who are waging a campaign of terror against other religions that has involved mass beheadings and raping. The images were posted on social media, including the Shomoukh Al-Islam jihadi forum, under the title Leveling Graves And Erasing Pagan Symbols. Terrorist group ISIS has released photographs of its militants destroying Christian graves with sledgehammers and carving out crosses in the Iraqi city of Mosul . It's the latest shocking act by the Islamists who are waging a campaign of terror against other religions that has involved mass beheadings and raping . The group released a statement with the images that attempted to justify the mass desecration. It said that graves above the ground suggested that the dead person was closer to Allah than the living, so must be demolished and any images on the graves must be erased. The statement stems from a collection of Islamic teachings known as the hadith, which many Muslims reject. Steven Stalinsky, executive director of The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), told FoxNews.com that by posting the images on social media, the group was sending a message to the West. He said: 'It is important to note that ISIS is documenting its destruction and desecration of Christian sites and its attacks on Christian communities, and on other minorities' sites and communities, and is disseminating these images worldwide via social media. The group released a statement with the images that attempted to justify the mass desecration. It said that graves above the ground suggested that the dead person was closer to Allah than the living, so must be demolished and any images on the graves must be erased . Christians have suffered considerably at the hands of Isis, with many in Iraq and Syria forced by the militants to choose between leaving their homes, facing death or paying a traditional tax on non-Muslims . One expert said that Isis released the video to mock the West, to show that it is powerless to stop the group doing whatever it wants . 'By doing this, ISIS is not only showcasing what it is doing, but is also mocking the West by demonstrating that it is doing so freely, with no one trying to stop it.' Christians have suffered considerably at the hands of Isis, with many in Iraq and Syria forced by the militants to choose between leaving their homes, facing death or paying a traditional tax on non-Muslims. Earlier this year Isis released a video showing militants beheading 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya and Yazidis have told of fighters abducting hundreds of girls and women and subjecting them to rapes and beatings. Isis' attack on Iraq's heritage, meanwhile, recently saw Nimrud, once the jewel of Assyria and home to a treasure considered one of the 20th century's main archaeological finds, destroyed by explosives and men armed with power tools. The UN's cultural agency condemned the act on Monday. 'I condemn this mad, destructive act that accentuates the horror of the situation,' UNESCO head Irina Bokova said in a statement. The Islamic State group on Saturday circulated an undated video showing militants equipped with sledgehammers and power tools breaking artefacts before rigging the site with large barrels of powder. The subsequent footage shows a massive explosion and its aftermath, suggesting the ruins of Nimrud - which lie on the Tigris about 30 kilometres (18 miles) southeast of IS-held Mosul - were largely levelled. Nimrud, founded in the 13th century BC, is one of the most famous archaeological sites in a country often described as the cradle of civilisation. 'With their hammers and explosives they are also obliterating the site itself, clearly determined to wipe out all traces of the history of Iraq's people,' Bokova said.","Isis released images showing graves being destroyed on social media .

DO buy presents for ME! Not for the baby. Emily-Jane says: 'I’m the one with the stitched up lady bits who did all the hard work. My daughter has spent the past ten months sitting on her arse. My need for gifts is greater than hers. 'Besides, all she cares about right now is milky breasts. So unless you can supply some of those then you really needn’t bother. 'And what’s with all the muslins? In no other situation would it be deemed acceptable to buy someone just out of hospital cleaning cloths as a  present. Not to mention the ultimate insult. I can barely bring myself to type the words. NON-alcoholic ‘champagne’. Sparkling bloody grape juice! 'I have just endured ten months of pregnancy and hours of labour. Do you not think I might need a proper drink? Sure, I am breastfeeding, but I can still have one glass (yes, I checked, by god, did I check).' Mothers are often on the brink of exhaustion when looking after a newborn (picture posed by model) 3. DO wash your hands before you touch my baby. Emily-Jane says: 'You may think you have clean hands until you meet the first time mother of a newborn. 'The brand new mum is highly adept in detecting dirt invisible to the naked eye. She is well aware that on every square centimetre of your hand there are 1,500 bacteria. 'And the moment you touch her baby’s face or, god forbid, let the baby suck your finger (why?) – she can see all 50,000 of those germy little tossers wriggling off your hand and into her baby’s brand new little mouth.' 4. DO give support not advice. Emily-Jane says: 'I might tell you I am finding motherhood tough. I may say I feel out of my depth. But do not take this to mean I need you to tell me how to feed/hold/change my baby. 'Thanks to the Internet, parenting books and the NHS, my head is filled with so much advice that I am already struggling to listen to my maternal instincts. 'So offer a shoulder to cry on, or a sympathetic ear, but please, no unsolicited advice.' Mothers often get a stream of visitors in the months after giving birth (picture posed by model) 5. DO NOT tell me that my baby looks just like her father. Emily-Jane says: 'She doesn’t. She currently looks like a wrinkly, blotchy newborn. Seriously, if my husband really did look like a two-day-old baby I don’t think I would have married him.' 6. DO NOT gender stereo-type my child. Emily-Jane says: 'Just because I have a girlbaby it does not mean I want to dress her up like a princess or fill her room with princesses. 7. DO NOT enter my home unless you are armed with coffee and or/chocolate. 8. DO NOT ask me questions about the future. Emily-Jane says: 'Will you be getting her christened? When will she go in her own room? Will you be going to the NCT baby group? Where will she go to school? 'Right now, I can barely work out what I am doing tomorrow, let alone in three years’ time.'","Looking after a newborn is one of the most exhausting periods in life .

"This is the moment a paedophile was caught by police after grooming a girl he believed to be 14 on the internet. Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli, who is of Afghani origin, was snared by a paedophile vigilante group called Letzgo Hunting. Married Adeli, 32, arranged to meet someone he believed to be a young teenage girl after engaging in sexual conversations online and sending an indecent image of himself. Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli who was arrested at a bus station in Leicester after thinking he was going to meet a 14-year-old girl for sex . Adeli had been duped by paedophile vigilante group Letzgo Hunting and police were waiting to arrest him when he turned up at the bus station . The vigilante group filmed the meeting, which showed Adeli putting his head in his hands when he realised he had been tricked . Adeli agreed to pay for 'Amy's' bus fare to make the 13-mile journey from Hinckley, Leicestershire, to Leicester, where they had arranged to meet. When he arrived, he had three condoms in his pocket. But instead of being greeted by a schoolgirl, Adeli was confronted by police who arrested him immediately while the vigilante group filmed his reaction. The video of his arrest on December 10 has been posted on Facebook and viewed more than 10,000 times. In the footage, Adeli is asked to show his identification to police as he looks up at the officer in disbelief. He pauses before telling officers his name. The officer says: 'I am arresting you on arranging and facilitating child sex offences.' Adeli bows his head and puts his hands over his face before he is led away by police. On Wednesday Adeli was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court after he admitted attempting to meet a girl under 16 after grooming her online. 'Amy' was in fact a vigilante named John who was pretending to be a young girl. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, told the court: 'The man, John, acts as a self-appointed paedophile hunter carrying out covert internet investigations, trying to identify and expose those who would prey on children using the internet. 'He and colleagues used to film such confrontations and put them on the internet, but now they've changed their way of handling matters and contact the police when there's been a meeting arranged.' Mr Murphy said the vigilante had set up a bogus online profile in December claiming to belong to a girl called Amy from Hinckley. Within days, Adeli had made contact and the pair started talking online and exchanged texts and images on their mobiles. The court was told that Adeli had thought he had been chatting to a schoolgirl named Amy, when in fact he had been talking to a member of Letzgo Hunting called John . Yesterday he was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court after admitting attempting to meet a girl under 16 for grooming . Although Amy's profile said she was 18, Mr Murphy said that during the conversations the man who was posing as Amy made it clear that she was in fact 14. Adeli claimed to be 28. During the online chats, 'Amy' said: 'Sorry, you're too old for me.' The prosecutor said Adeli replied: 'I know, but we can be friends and talk.' Mr Murphy added: 'The conversation became sexual, with the defendant leading the way. He asked if she would perform sex acts upon him, suggesting it in the most explicit terms. They made arrangements to meet after two days.' Navinder Sekhon, defending, described the meeting as a 'preparatory offence and not a completed one' and said that Adeli felt 'deep-seated remorse'. Mr Sekhon told the court that Adeli cared for his sick wife and 'wishes to be reunited with her'. Adeli, who has lodged an appeal to remain in the UK, was placed on a ten-year sexual offences prevention order. Judge Philip Head, sentencing said: 'It was your intention to have full sexual activity with someone you believed to be 14 and something you know to be a crime in this country. 'You were grooming this person for sexual activity.' The Letzgo Hunting group has caught dozens of paedophiles by posing as young girls online, arranging meetings and then alerting the police. In court Mr Murphy said it had been 'made clear' that the police didn't support the group's actions but once they had been given information about an offence they had to investigate it. Adeli has lodged an appeal to remain in the UK and was also placed on a 10 year sexual offences prevention order .","Jafar Adeli thought he had been chatting to a 14-year-old girl he met online .

"For many women they are a lifestyle essential prone to a fair amount of wear and tear over time. But now well-heeled handbag lovers are paying as much as £200 to give their over-loved bags the equivalent of a spa treatment at a luxury new Handbag Clinic in Chelsea. The unusual boutique has opened on a fashionable west London high street to cater to the needs of well-heeled clientele who want to restore their bags to their former glory. Scroll down for video . Handbag lovers are paying as much as £200 to give their over-loved bags the equivalent of a spa treatment at a luxury new Handbag Clinic in Chelsea. Pictured: an Hermes bag (left) and a Mulberry (right) The Handbag Clinic has opened in Chelsea (pictured) to cater to the needs of well-heeled clientele who want to restore their bags to their former glory . Famous clients who have indulged in the luxury treatment include Imogen Thomas and Made in Chelsea stars Sophie Hermann and Stephanie Pratt. It was set up to rejuvenate high-end accessories in need of a face-lift or a quick repair. And amazingly, a trip to the handbag hospital is becoming more and more fashionable, even though the most treatment costs as much as £200. The company say they are now repairing bags worth £20,000 every day at the clinic on Kings Road in Chelsea London. They include briefcases and bags belonging to male clients. Grubby bags can be spruced-up through one of four available packages which offer everything from a thorough clean, to a fresh coat of colour or a layer of stain-preventing cream. Customers can even take out ‘stain cover’ cover for one handbag for £4.95 or 15 handbags for £19.95 per month. One customer has £100,000 worth of bags on the service. Famous clients who have indulged in the luxury treatment include Imogen Thomas (right( and Made in Chelsea star Stephanie Pratt (left) Customers can visit the new store Chelsea, in London, or simply post their bag to clinic. Prices are bespoke, depending on how stained or damaged a bag is, with costs for minor repairs starting at £24.95 and the average restoration costing £135. The company was set up after Ben Staerck, the director of leather repair company Furniture Clinic, noticed a surge in demand for specialist bag restoration. Mr Staerck said: ‘My father and I launched Furniture Clinic in 2004 to restore and repair heirloom and vintage pieces of leather furniture. ‘We soon found our customers were asking us if we could repair their high-end designer handbags because they couldn’t find a specialist handbag workshop they trusted to restore their high-value accessories. As the volume of bags requiring care continued to increase, we decided to form a company devoted exclusively to handbag repair. ‘Demand has soared for work on all types of bags from the likes of Chanel, Jimmy Choo, Hermes and Mulberry, particularly since the opening of our flagship Kings Road clinic. ‘Clients from across the world bring their bags with them for repair when they are visiting London, particularly from the US and the Middle East.’ The four available packages include a cleansing scrub where bags are fully cleaned inside and out, and a replenishment package to repair remove stains. More expensive services on offer include total rejuvenation, which also includes a complete coat of colour, and an age-defying service which coats bags with a protective cream to prevent future staining. The first clinic in Newcastle, and last month a second high street outlet opened on Chelsea’s fashionable Kings Road, in London. It is believed that women amass a haul of 111 handbags over the course of a lifetime. And the average well-used bag is thought to harbour enough filth to pose a risk to human health. Some startling research even found traces of E.coli, a poisonous bacteria, lurking at the bottom of some handbags. And another study even found that some are contaminated with more bacteria than the average toilet.","Customers are treating over-loved bags at Handbag Clinic in Chelsea .

"A man has accidentally captured a bizarre clash between a kangaroo and a pair of domestic dogs that lasted for over nine hours. Melbourne-based Jon Czerniecki positioned trail cameras to spot deer on his grandparents' farm near Wangaratta, northeast Victoria, over the Easter long weekend. When he checked the nine hours of footage, Mr Czerniecki stumbled upon the upsetting spectacle, which shows the canines ganging up on the injured marsupial as it lies on its back. Mr Czerniecki has since contacted the local council and Parks Victoria in hopes of notifying the owners of the dogs about what they had done, but he claims they're unwilling to help. The disturbing nine hour vision shows the two canines ganging up on the injured marsupial as it lies on its back . Mr Czerniecki told Daily Mail Australia he had never spotted anything like it in eight months of using the trail cameras. 'I've seen plenty of animals but never any dogs. It's clear the kangaroo had a broken leg, and the dogs were just torturing it for such a long span of time.' He said he has contacted Parks Victoria and the local council in hopes of tracking down the owners of the dogs. 'They weren't having a bar of it because it happened on a private property. I figure it can't be that hard to track down the owners in that area,' he said. 'I think they should be told what the dogs were up to, but it's clear the authorities aren't going to help.' Jon Czerniecki serendipitously captured the encounter after setting up trail cameras to spot deer on his grandparents' farm . Wildlife specialist Tim Faulkner said the kangaroo should have been able to escape the dogs and must have been 'suffering immensely' Wild dogs such as dingos are known to only attack kangaroos out of necessity, but the domestic origin of the dogs challenges this stereotype. Wildlife specialist Tim Faulkner from the Australian Reptile Park told 9 News he was disturbed by the video. 'I can't fathom that, he should be able to get away. No one likes to see animals suffer. We rationalise that by saying 'predators need to eat prey',' he said. 'What we're seeing there is immense suffering.'

"They’re the kind of colourful adverts that would have been created by the real-life Don Drapers, Peggy Olsons and other ‘mad men’ of Madison Avenue. These vintage posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience, passengers wore their best clothes and there was plenty of legroom. They’re featured in a new coffee table book, Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975, which revisits a time when the skies were dominated by the likes of Pan Am, British Overseas Airways Corp (BOAC) and Continental. Scroll down for video . Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was a dominant and influential airline which declared bankruptcy and ceased operations in 1991 . Many of the adverts in the book featured beautiful women in an effort to glamorise destinations and encourage people to travel . British Airways promoted its launch of the Concorde in the 1970s (left) while Trans World Airlines (TWA) promoted its New York route . Authored by Matthias C Huhne, the 436-page book contains dozens of glamorous adverts that encouraged those who could afford to fly to visit far-flung destinations such as Haiti, Hawaii, Japan, New York and London. The simple but effective posters showcase each destination with eye-catching cartoons or photos of beautiful women, landmarks such as Times Square and Tower of London, and natural beauty spots including Bermuda’s picturesque coastline and Sydney Harbour. New York was one of the most popular destinations featured in the adverts in Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 . The adverts were created for the biggest airlines of the day, including TWA and Canadian Pacific, which no longer exist . British Overseas Airways Corp led to the creation of British Airways (left) while Continental merged with United Airlines' parent company . It was a time when it cost an incredible amount of money to purchase a ticket for a commercial flight, with many of the ads promoting transatlantic or transpacific travel. The adverts created for the biggest airlines of the day, including many which no longer exist, offer a glimpse at how air travel, advertising and society changed over the 30-year period covered in the book. From a psychedelic image of a surfer in Hawaii to British Airways' introduction of the Concorde, the posters reflect the eras in which they were created by some of the best creative minds of the time, including Ivan Chermayeff, Otl Aicher, Massimo Vignelli and Saul Bass, Academy Award-winning filmmaker. The posters are a throwback to the golden age of air travel, when flying was an exclusive experience and passengers dressed smart . The book hails the designers' creative genius and uses special techniques to replicate their work as accurately as possible . In addition to drawings the adverts include photos of natural beauty spots, including Sydney Harbour (left) and Bermuda's beaches (right) Mr Huhne’s book hails their creative genius and uses 17 colours, five types of varnishes and two methods of foil printing and embossing to replicate their work as accurately as possible. Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 was published by Berlin-based Callisto Publishers, which offered this synopsis of the tome: ‘It provides unique insight into the design and advertising methods of an era when airlines were considered the most glamorous business sector and quality was the main criterion for selecting a flight.’ It retails from approximately £270 online in the UK and from $250 online in the US.","Airline Visual Identity 1945-1975 revisits a time when the skies were dominated by now-defunct airlines .

"It may look like a misshapen disk of metal, but this coin is one of the oldest ever to be found in Britain. The tiny copper coin, which is smaller than a penny, dates from the Iron Age almost 2,300 years ago and suggests there were links between the south west of England and the Mediterranean. It was found in silt after the River Avon burst its banks between Bristol and Bath. The tiny copper coin, which is smaller than a penny, dates from the Iron Age almost 2,300 years ago and suggests there were links between the south west of England and the Mediterranean . On one side there is a horse’s head, while the other bears the image of the goddess Tanit, the chief deity of Carthage. Experts have dated the coin to between 300 BC and 264 BC and say it came from the Western Mediterranean - probably Sardinia or ancient Carthage. The find suggests that the village of Saltford, where it was found, was on a major trade route long before Roman times. On one side of the coin there the image of the Goddess Tanit, the chief deity of Carthage, (pictured left) while on the reverse is a horse’s head, pictured right . The find suggests that the village of Saltford (shown on the map with a red marker), where the coin was found, was on a major trade route long before Roman times . It is believed there was a ford in the area, which made it the only place to cross the river Avon at the time. One side of the coin shows an image of the Carthaginian goddess Tanit,  suggesting links between the south west and the Mediterranean . The coin is thought to be the oldest dateable evidence of human activity found in Saltford and the West of England. It suggests Iron Age links between the Mediterranean and the Bristol Channel, which the River Avon flows into around 15 miles (24km) away. Professor David Mattingly, an archaeologist and Roman historian at the University of Leicester said: ‘It’s really interesting to have a Carthaginian coin in Britain. ‘Suppose that coin was deposited close to its minting - at the time, there were no coins being used in Britain. It would have been quite alien to people. ‘We are very sure that horses were important at the time so that may have invoked a lot of interest back then. It’s a very interesting find.’ Phil Harding of the Saltford Environment Group, said that the coin’s significant because it is one of the oldest coins ever to be found in England. ‘Only eight of these have ever been found, always on ancient trade routes,’ he said. ‘We can’t believe it. We thought we would be writing the history of Saltford from the Roman times to now. ‘But now we have to go back to the Iron Age. It’s absolutely fantastic.’ Last July a hoard of Roman and Late Iron Age coins were found in a cave in Dovedale in the Peak District, where they had lain undisturbed for 2,000 years. It was the first time that coins from the two separated groups have been found buried together. Archaeologists discovered 26 coins, including three Roman coins which pre-date the invasion of Britain in 43 AD, and 20 other gold and silver pieces which are Late Iron Age and thought to belong to the Corieltavi tribe. Last July a hoard of Roman and Late Iron Age coins (pictured) were found in a cave in Dovedale in the Peak District, where they had lain undisturbed for 2,000 years . National Trust archaeologist Rachael Hall said whoever owned the cache was probably a wealthy and influential figure. 'The coins would suggest a serious amount of wealth and power of the individual who owned them. ‘Coins were used more as a symbol of power and status during the Late Iron Age, rather than for buying and selling staple foods and supplies. ‘...The situation of the cave can’t be ignored either. Could it have been a sacred place to the Late Iron Age peoples that was taboo to enter in everyday life, making it a safe place that would ensure that person’s valuables were protected?'","Tiny copper coin is dated to the Iron Age, almost 2,300 years ago .

"Dawn Bainbridge (pictured) led a 'family business' stealing thousands of pounds worth of clothes from high street stores before selling them on . A mother-of-two branded 'Fagin' made almost £50,000 in a lucrative family shoplifting firm with her daughters - and now they have been told to pay back just £1 each. Dawn Bainbridge, 47, of West Rainton, County Durham, led a 'family business' that saw her and her two daughters steal thousands  of pounds worth of clothes from high street stores across the North and sell them online through Facebook. Their company 'Designer Goods North East' took more than £7,000 in online payments in just four months, had detailed sales records and even a debters' book. In a note seized by police, one daughter boasted of making £100 a week and said she dreamed of going it alone. At Newcastle Crown Court last year Judge Sean Morris jailed Bainbridge for 30 months, her daughter Claire Bainbridge, 21, for 20 months and other daughter Caitlyn Bainbridge, 19, to 16 months behind bars. The mother, who is still serving her sentence, and two daughters, who have since been released, were back in court today for a hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Prosecutor Bridie Smurthwaite told the court the mother made £15,017, Claire made £26,180 and Caitlyn made £7,476 from their illegal enterprise. The court heard none of the women have any assets that can be seized or sold so they were ordered to pay back just £1 each. Miss Smurthwaite told the court: 'There are confiscation orders in the sum of £1, that sum to be paid within 28 days.' The mother was allowed 56 days to pay back her £1 as she is the only one still in custody. The women face up to seven days behind bars if they fail to pay the £1 each on time. Claire Bainbridge, 21, (pictured left) and sister Caitlyn Bainbridge, 19, (right) were both ordered to pay £1 each . During sentencing last year the judge slammed Bainbridge's parenting. The judge told the women: 'This was a professional, criminal family firm. 'Thousands and thousands of pounds worth of goods were taken in professional, planned shoplifting expeditions and professionally marketed by you on your own Paypal account and with money being withdrawn to distribute amongst the directors of the firm. 'People seem to think shoplifting doesn't matter. Well it does. 'The outlay shops have to provide: security machines, security guards, cameras; all because people like you can't keep their grubby hands off other people's property. 'The vast majority of this country, many of whom are in far worse situations than you, hold their heads up high and live honest lives. 'You obviously regard yourself as far too clever to be like them.' The judge told Dawn Bainbridge as he jailed her: 'You now have time to think about the effects of your offences on your family. You were the mother and leader of the criminal firm. At Newcastle Crown Court last year Judge Sean Morris jailed Dawn Bainbridge, 47, for 30 months, daughter Claire Bainbridge, 21, for 20 months and Caitlyn Bainbridge, 19, to 16 months behind bars . 'You are the villain of the piece. It's your fault your daughters are in court. Some mother.' Jamie Adams, defending Caitlyn, said at the sentencing hearing: 'The whole scenario is reminiscent of something Dickens would write about. 'Fagin comes to mind in the form of her mother.' The family stole from stores in Leeds, Bradford, Guiseley, York, Knaresborough, Harrogate, Stockton, Bishop Auckland, Durham, Gateshead and Edinburgh. Their operation was uncovered by an investigator for high street chain Next, who bought clothes from the Facebook page and proved they were stolen. When police raided the family home last March, they recovered goods stolen from Next, House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer and elsewhere worth nearly £7,000. But still the thieving continued. Police seized a further £900-worth of stolen goods in June 2014. All three admitted conspiracy to steal at the time.","Dawn Bainbridge, 47, and her daughters made £50,000 from shoplifting .

"A mother-of-three repeatedly knifed in the head by her violent boyfriend has revealed how she begged him to put her to bed so she didn't die on the floor. Joanne Bolton told how she thought she was going to die at the hands of Steven Young during the 'brutal and merciless' seven hour long ordeal. The 35-year-old was stabbed over 14 times before being knocked out with a mental bar after being held captive in her own home. Joanne Bolton, pictured in hospital,  did not believe she was going to survive the horrific attack that saw her knifed more than 14 times . Such was the force of the attack, that the blade of a knife being used to stab her in the head broke. But this did not end the nightmare, instead Young chose a bigger weapon and continued his violent onslaught. 'I didn't think I was going to survive and I asked him to put me to bed because I didn't want to die on the floor,' said Miss Bolton of New Kyo, Stanley, County Durham. 'I felt euphoric, I stopped feeling the cold and had no strength left. I knew I didn't have long left.' Miss Bolton was already fleeing from a violent relationship when she met Young and jumped at the chance to move in with him after staying in a refuge. But soon after he became possessive and violent and started using her a punchbag as he fought his own insecurities. Steven Young, pictured right,  was jailed for 18 years by a judge at Newcastle Crown Court after he admitted attempted murder of Miss Bolton, pictured left, shortly after the seven hour ordeal . Miss Bolton, a former support worker, says he was using drugs and was on prescribed methadone which led to paranoia at times. But in May he exploded after she had posted a photo and message on Facebook saying she was unhappy. 'He would wind himself up to breaking point. He would say I was cheating on him but it was him cheating on me,' she said. 'But on that day I had been outside fixing my car and had been talking to a young lad who collects scrap metal. 'He [Young] was upset because of the Facebook message. I went into the kitchen and opened a tin of tuna and he stuck a six inch knife in my head. 'The blade was sticking in my head and I thought 'oh my God, I'm going to die'. I couldn't pull it out but he did. 'He pulled it so hard it gave me whiplash and the blade snapped on the way out and fell on the floor. He went for another big knife and he stabbed me in the back and it punctured my kidney. 'He then stabbed me twice in the chest - once in the breast and once in the lung. My lung was filling with blood, I knew I was in trouble and I was coughing up blood. The mother-of-three  has been left scarred for life and needed more than 100 stitches to her face, arms and body . 'I didn't feel the stabs, it just felt like punches, I feel more pain in my dreams now. 'He kept telling me I was going to die and was trying to stab me in the eyes and kept lunging and stabbing me in the head and face, over and over and over again. I put my arm up to protect myself. 'He cut through the nerves, tendons, veins and ligaments above my wrist, blood spurted out. 'From my wrist it was hanging off. He then stabbed me in the thumb, I needed over 100 stitches in total.' Young pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was given an 18-year sentence in February at Newcastle Crown Court. Jailing him, Judge Paul Sloan told him: 'During the attack Miss Bolton truly believed she was going to die and she has suffered profound physical and mental suffering. 'This was a particularly brutal, merciless and sustained attack that must have been truly terrifying for the victim. 'There is a significant risk to members of the public, particularly partners and former partners, of serious harm by you.' Mum-of-three Joanne added: 'I was left in my own pool of blood and I was very cold. 'I was there for hours and then I crawled towards the fire to get warm. 'When I was on my hands and knees he took a power bar and played golf with my head. He hit me in the forehead which flung me backwards then hit me on the shoulder which fractured the bones in my shoulder blade.' Thinking of a way out, gasping for breath, Miss Bolton persuaded Young to put her on the bed and said she had £20 for him to uy drugs. Miss Bolton now suffers with mild brain damage and is often scared to leave the house . On his return she begged him to call an ambulance, saying she would blame her injuries on someone else. She was in intensive care on a ventilator and was in surgery for six hours. 'I had been sterilised when I was 22 because I had real problems during my three births but somehow was pregnant during this,' said Joanne. 'I miscarried after my shoulder operation but that plays heavy on my mind now. 'I never expected to be pregnant again, that was not supposed to happen, but I was and it survived those weeks while this was happening' The frenzied attack has left Joanne with mild brain damage, she struggles to detect smell, has short time memory problems and is often too scared to leave the house. But now new boyfriend Brett Ritchie, 40, of South Stanley, is helping her through her nightmare. 'Brett is different, he is patient, caring and would go to the end of the world and back for me. 'I genuinely feel I am with someone for the right reasons.' Dad-of-six Brett said: 'She has got a lot of trust to gain back and that takes time, but I'm willing to wait because I love her.'","Joanne Bolton was stabbed over 14 times before being battered with a bar .

'She’s got that twinkle in her eye,' Topshop creative director Kate Phelan told Elle, while comparing Hailey to supermodel Cara Delevingne. Kate also recalls how, the first time she met Hailey, she was struck by the star's social media influence; when Kate went home to tell her teenage daughter about the meeting, she said she already knew - because Hailey had posted about it online. Next generation: Hailey, the daugher of actor Stephen Baldwin (pictured) is keeping up with her family's famous legacy . Top model: Hailey is the face of Topshop denim, as the brand's creative director says the model has 'a twinkle in her eye' like Cara Delevingne . Indeed, as the magazine points out, it is not just Hailey’s beautiful physical features that have helped to catapult her to the top of the fashion industry ladder, but also her impressively formidable social media presence, which makes her an appealing asset to fashion brands eager to capitalize on her popularity. And she has other hidden talents, too. Before discovering a passion for fashion, the model also trained as a ballerina and spent many summers studying at the American Ballet Theatre school as a child. The gracefulness she learned as a dancer has likely contributed to her skills as a model; in the chic Elle photograph, Hailey effortlessly pulls off a daring Topshop unique ensemble.

"The family of a woman who has been missing for almost a month have shared their heartbreak over her disappearance. Sharon Edwards' car was left parked in her driveway and the clothes she had been wearing on March 14 were thrown in the washing basket in her bedroom. Her son, Eli Edwards, told Daily Mail Australia his family was struggling to come to terms with his mother's disappearance. Sharon Edwards, 55, was last seen between 10pm and 11pm on Saturday March 14 in Grafton, NSW . Pictured from left: Her son Zac, husband John, son Eli, Ms Edwards and her third son Josh . ‘The worst part is not knowing anything, it’s such a mystery,’ he said. ‘My old man’s taking it pretty hard and I guess we are all just going through stages.’ There was no sign of forced entry at her Grafton home on the NSW north coast and it has left her family with many unanswered questions. Ms Edwards, a 55-year-old teacher, was last seen between 10pm and 11pm on March 14 after spending the afternoon with close friends at the nearby Good Intent Hotel. Her wallet and handbag are missing but she has not accessed any of her bank or social media accounts. She is not believed to have had any enemies, but as Ms Edwards has no history of mental illness police are treating the investigation as a homicide. The family made an emotional appeal for information last week as police said it was a homicide investigation . Sharon Edwards, 54, posted a smiling image of herself in front of a sunrise on the morning she disappeared . ‘We can’t think of anyone that would want to do anything to hurt her. We don’t have any theories,’ he said. Police and family say they hold 'grave concerns' for her welfare as it is extremely out of character. After police made it known they were investigating foul play, Mr Edwards said his family started to face the harsh reality that his mother may never be coming home. ‘It could be a real possibility and I guess after all this time it feels like there is really only one outcome left.’ Mr Edwards said regardless of how it happens, he wants his mum brought home. 'I want her to be found, one way or another.' 'We just need an outcome, at least that way we can all have some closure,’ he added. It was first noticed Ms Edwards was missing when she failed to show up for a class she was due to teach . She has no known medical conditions and has not made contact with relatives. Mr Edwards said he and his fiance sometimes worked weekends and his mother was due to come to Brisbane to help care for his young daughter. ‘She wouldn't miss that for the world,’ Mr Edwards explained. The 'dedicated' primary school teacher did not turn up to work at Coutts Crossing Public School on March 16 and her estranged husband reported her missing the next day. On the morning she disappeared, Ms Edwards posted a smiling image of herself posing in front of a sunrise. In the week following her disappearance, police divers searched searched the Clarence River. Police also forensically examined three properties Ms Edwards and her husband own together, one in Grafton and two, including a vacant block, in nearby Lawrence. It is understood Ms Edwards lives in the Grafton home and her husband often stays at the Lawrence property.

"Thousands of women whose breast cancer has become resistant to standard treatment could benefit from a new drug combination, claim researchers. It is hoped the new approach will target cancer stem cells that evade conventional drugs and cause the tumour to re-grow. Cancer that has spread and is incurable, known as secondary breast cancer, kills 1,000 women in Britain every month. Researchers from Manchester University working with drug development company Evgen Pharma, have developed a new combination of drugs which could overcome this problem. Thousands of women whose breast cancer has become resistant to standard treatment could benefit from a new drug combination. It targets cancer cells that evade conventional drugs and cause tumours to re-grow . They are testing the drug Sulforadex in the most common type of breast cancer, affecting 70 per cent of patients. These ‘oestrogen receptor’ (ER) cancers are currently tackled using hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen  to reduce oestrogen levels or block ER function. However, many women go on to develop resistance and the disease comes back, often because cancer stem cells which cause tumours to regrow and spread are unaffected by these treatments. The combination therapy, tested in mice and samples of tissue from secondary breast cancer patients, combines Sulforadex with standard hormonal treatments. Eating dinner or a snack late at night could raise a woman's risk of breast cancer, a study has warned. Researchers found eating meals at set times and eating dinner early reduced the risk. Leaving a longer time between the last meal or snack of the day and breakfast lowers the chance of developing the disease, US researchers found. They discovered women who fasted for longer overnight had significantly better control over their blood sugar levels. Each three hour increase in night-time fasting was associated with a four per cent lower glucose levels when tested after a meal, regardless of how much women ate, they found. Previous research has found women with higher blood sugar levels are more likely to develop cancer, even if they don't have diabetes. In the study, women reported eating five times per day and fasted overnight an average of 12 hours. Those who reported fasting for longer also indicated they consumed fewer calories per day, ate fewer calories after 10 pm and had fewer periods of eating. This targets both the oestrogen-sensitive cells and the remaining cancer stem cells at the same time, says research presented at the American Association of Cancer Research annual conference today. Dr Robert Clarke, from the University’s Institute of Cancer Sciences, said: ‘The hormonal therapies we use today are very good at treating breast cancer tumours driven by oestrogen. ‘However, they don’t completely solve the problem. 'This combination of drugs potentially allows us to target oestrogen-sensitive cells, while also mopping up the cells which cause treatment resistance.’ The next step will be to recruit patients for a trial in the next few months. Dr David Howat, head of research and development at Evgen Pharma said: ‘We are really excited about the data presented at the AACR. 'Dr Rob Clarke and his research team have demonstrated the efficacy of Sulforadex. ‘We now intend to extend this collaboration and advance Sulforadex into a clinical trial with breast cancer patients.’ Katie Goates, at Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘While it’s important to remember that at this stage research has only been carried out in mice, this new combination of drugs shows exciting potential to overcome resistance to hormone treatments, such as tamoxifen. ‘Combining tamoxifen with Sulforadex resulted in fewer breast cancer stem cells surviving treatment compared to tamoxifen alone, lowering the likelihood of breast cancer returning or spreading to other parts of the body. ‘Oestrogen receptor’ cancers are currently tackled using hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen to reduce oestrogen levels or block ER function. The new therapy targets both the oestrogen-sensitive cells and the remaining cancer stem cells (pictured) at the same time . ‘Interestingly, Dr Clarke’s team has also shown that this combination of drugs reduces the number of cancer stem cells in secondary breast cancer samples. ‘This means that the combination also has the potential to extend how long tamoxifen treatment can work for women with secondary breast cancer (cancer that has spread), the incurable form of the disease. ‘Secondary breast cancer still kills 1,000 women in the UK every month so research that helps us to discover improved treatment options for women living with this form of breast cancer, or to help prevent cancer spreading, are vitally important. ‘We hope that planned clinical trials will follow quickly to tell us whether using tamoxifen with Sulforadex is safe and can deliver similar results in humans.’","New approach targets cancer stem cells that evade conventional treatment .

"Nearly half of parents have not taught their children how to dial 999 - and many youngsters think the emergency number is 911, a study found. Many said their children were not mature enough to learn the life-saving skill. And, shockingly, an even greater number said their children would not know the difference between 999 and 911, the emergency number in the US. Scroll down for video . Nearly half of parents have not taught their children how to dial 999 - and many youngsters think the emergency number is 911, a study found . The survey of 757 parents was carried out by Mumsnet, the UK’s largest internet community for parents. It found that 37 per cent of parents had not told their children how to dial 999, with 53 per cent claiming they had never even considered teaching them. But nearly half - 46 per cent - insisted that their children were not mature enough to know about who to call in an emergency. And concerningly, 65 per cent of parents said their children did not know the difference between 999 and America’s 911. Locked smartphones stuck on the ‘enter passcode’ screen were also a source of worry for many parents. 78 per cent of respondents know that you can dial 999 from a locked phone, but only 23 per cent are confident their children know this. The survey raises fears that many youngsters are not being taught vital lessons about what to do in an emergency. Of those parents who said they had not taught them how to dial 999, more than 60 per cent admitted they were not confident their child would know what to do if someone collapsed, wouldn’t wake up or if there was a fire. The survey of 757 parents was carried out by Mumsnet, the UK’s largest internet community for parents . But campaigners say that even toddlers under the age of five should be taught how to call 999. The Mumsnet website www.999forkids.com is now urging parents to build on their children’s interests in the emergency services and characters like Fireman Sam to educate them about making an emergency call. And it says that parents should explain to their children what kinds of medical situations would definitely require a 999 call, such as chest pain, breathing problems, choking or drowning. Joe Mulligan, head of first aid learning at the Red Cross, said: ‘Children as young as five can learn some basic first aid, but we know that even younger children can be introduced to the idea of dialling 999. ‘By using play-acting with your child you can help them feel confident to act in a real emergency scenario, which could potentially save a life.’ Mumsnet have now launched a hard-hitting campaign to alert parents to the dangers of keeping their children ignorant of 999. The website features a poignant video real-life 999 call made by a five-year-old girl after her mother Loretta Addison from Warrington, Cheshire, had an epileptic fit. Elleemae’s bravery saver her mother’s life, and those behind the campaign hope the video will service as a hard-hitting example to other parents who have yet to tell their children about 999. Nils Leonard, chairman and CCO of Grey London - the company which made the film - said: ‘In advertising, we spend our lives making up fiction to get people to care. ‘But there’s nothing more powerful than the truth. When it’s delivered by a child and the UK’s largest network of parents, rather than government, people will take notice. We will save lives.’ Justine Roberts, the CEO of Mumsnet, said: ‘Nobody wants to think about the circumstances in which their child might need to call 999, but as Elleemae’s story shows, it can literally be a lifesaver. ‘We hope this powerful film will encourage parents to take a deep breath and have a chat with their children.’","Study found many children don't know the difference between 999 and 911 .

"Just two cups of coffee a day could halve the risk of breast cancer returning in women recovering from the disease, a study has found. Researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is the main hormonal therapy drug given to women who have not been through the menopause, and is usually taken for five years or longer after treatment for breast cancer. Just two cups of coffee a day can halve the risk of breast cancer returning and boosts the effect of the drug tamoxifen, researchers found . Most breast cancer tumours rely on the hormone oestrogen to grow, and tamoxifen blocks oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells. This means the cancer either grows more slowly or stops growing altogether. As part of the study, Swedish and British researchers looked at data from 1,090 breast cancer patients, in a follow up of a similar study carried out two years ago. They found that more than 500 women who had been treated with tamoxifen, and those that had drunk at least two cups of coffee a day, had only half the risk of their cancer returning than those who drank less coffee, or none at all. Ann Rosendahl, a researcher from Lund University who carried out the study, said: 'The study also shows that those who drank at least two cups of coffee a day had smaller tumours and a lower proportion of hormone-dependent tumours. 'We saw that this was already the case at the time of diagnosis.' Researchers also looked more closely at two substances that usually occur in coffee – caffeine and caffeic acid. They found the breast cancer cells reacted to these substances, especially caffeine. Caffeine caused the cells to divide less frequency, and die more often, especially when it was drunk in combination with tamoxifen. The study found  caffeine caused breast cancer cells to divide less frequently and die more often . Ms Rosendahl said: 'This shows that these substances have an effect on the breast cancer cells and turn off signalling pathways that the cancer cells require to grow.' The team demonstrated both in in breast cancer patients and at cell level that coffee can reinforce the effect of treatment with tamoxifen. However, they emphasise the importance of taking prescribed medication. Ms Rosenhal added: 'They are incredibly important, but if you like coffee and are also taking tamoxifen, there is no reason to stop drinking it. 'Just two cups a day is sufficient to make a difference.' This is not the first study to link coffee consumption with improved cancer prognosis. Drinking coffee may reduce the risk of cancer in heavy drinkers, research has found. A World Cancer Research Fund study shows the hot drink can protect against liver cancer, which is often associated with alcohol abuse. For each cup consumed a day, there is about a 14 per cent decreased risk of liver cancer, found the study by the World Cancer Research Fund. And scientists at Harvard Medical School have found that women who drink three or more cups of coffee a day have a 20 per cent lower risk of developing the most common form of skin cancer compared to those who had less than one cup per month. They also found that men who drank the same amount saw a nine per cent lower risk of the skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma.","Coffee can stop cancer returning in women treated with tamoxifen .

"With luxury plane suites pushing the boundaries of lavish travel, the upstairs-downstairs-style divide between economy and suites is continually growing. And now Airbus is set to introduce an extra seat to each row of its Airbus A380 model, squeezing yet more passengers onto each plane. From 2017 there will be 11 seats incorporated into the same space as the current 10 are placed, and  a fourth class introduced in response to the new dreaded middle seat. Scroll down for video . Tight squeeze! Airbus are set to cram an extra seat into their Airbus 380 in the middle section. The change is due to come into place in 2017 . The configuration was rejected by Emirates but two manufacturers, Zodiac and Geven, have agreed to deliver the seats . The addition of the centre seat will change the current configuration from 3-4-3 to become a 3-5-3 set up. At the moment the company uses First, Business and Economy class, but there will soon be the addition of 'budget economy', cleverly branded as Choice Economy. Some critics have gone as far as calling the new set-up 'economy minus'. Senior Vice President of Marketing for Airbus Christopher Emerson, told trade publication Leeham News and Comment: 'Ninety per cent of world travellers are economy but not all are homogeneous. 'We want to give a choice to the 90 per cent of the economy passengers. They are going to be the driver of the growth, the doubling of growth in the next 15 years.' Miraculously the inclusion of an additional seat will not alter the seat width for economy ticket holders. Currently the width is 18in, which falls in line with the aircraft manufacturer's manifesto 18 months ago to adopt that size as an industry standard. Airbus claims a rearrange of the cabin has enabled it to maintain this width and squeeze in the extra seat. The width of the arm rest, however, will change, with the aircraft adopting a slimmer version. The launch was announced in Hamburg this week, despite customer Emirates Airlines confirming it would not pursue the new arrangement for its aircraft - reportedly over fears the new design could affect its reputation for quality economy seating, according to trade publication Aviation Week. Airbus Vice President-Cabin Innovation and Design Ingo Wuggetzer said at the Aircraft Interiors Expo that more innovation should be going into economy cabins. 'In the past most innovation went into premium products, but that is only for six per cent of the travellers,' he said. The Airbus A380 will be advertised as having 544 seats instead of 525, and Emerson said the additional revenue per aircraft would be $20m per year. 'That's the equivalent of 40 per cent fuel burn reduction,' he explained. How the other half live! Rich fliers can enjoy private three-room suite for a luxurious first-class experience .

"The Good Samaritan who pulled a driver from an SUV hanging dangerously on the edge of a cliff spoke out for the first time on Thursday to describe the rescue that was captured in a heart-stopping photo. Jason Warnock, 29, was driving Wednesday morning in Lewiston, Idaho when he saw debris near the road and looked up to see a vehicle crashed into a chain-link fence on the edge of a cliff. He then parked his car, ran up a pedestrian footbridge and pulled driver Matthew Sitko, 23, out to safety. Warnock chatted with Sitko for a few minutes, but left as soon as police arrived because he had to get back to work. Scroll down for videos . Good Samaritan: Jason Warnock, 29, came forward Thursday and identified himself as the mystery man who rescued a driver in distress Wednesday morning in Lewiston, Idaho . In peril: Warnock was driving Wednesday morning when he noticed debris in the road and looked up to see this car hanging dangerously off the side of a cliff . Quick thinking: He then pulled driver Matthew Sitko, 23, out of the vehicle - saving the young man from a more terrible fate . Mystery: Since he didn't tell police his name, Warnock remained a mystery for 24 hours as the picture of the amazing rescue went viral online . Since he didn't stop to give police his name, Warnock remained a mystery for nearly 24 hours as the photo of the self-less rescue went viral online. Warnock has since come forward to identify himself and speak more about the incident which he wants no credit for. The crash occurred about 8am Wednesday in Lewiston, at a drop called Bryden Canyon, shortly after Sitko had dropped off his younger siblings at school. 'He was listening to a song on the radio, and some lyrics in the song convinced him that it was essentially his time to die. He just closed his eyes, took his hands off the wheel, and pressed the accelerator,'Lewiston interim Police Chief Roger Lanier said. Sitko drove through a yard and over two terraces before getting snared in a chain-link fence. The fence is the only reason the car vehicle did not topple over into the canyon with Sitko still behind the wheel, police told the Lewiston Tribune. It was me: Warnock came forward the next day to identify himself and describe the heart-stopping rescue . Overcome with emotion: Police say Sitko had just dropped off his younger siblings at school when a song came on in the vehicle and it 'convinced him that it was essentially his time to die,' according to police . So close: The chain link fence was the only thing keeping Sitko's SUV from rolling off the side of the cliff . Police previously said the incident was triggered when Sitko had 'some sort of mental or emotional episode' and he only suffered minor injuries. Soon after the crash, Warnock noticed the car and ran to Sitko's aide. 'I knew I had to get him out of the car,' Warnock told NBC, adding that the vehicle was shaking with every movement Sitko made. 'I was going to break the window with one of my tools, but I was worried that the impact might push the car over the ledge,' Warnock said. A disoriented Sitko started talking about his iPod, and that's when Warnock  took action and focused the driver, telling him he was going to pull him out the passenger-side door. 'I was like, ""Give me your hand, you know, because if this thing goes I want to have a hold of you so I can yank you,""' Warnock said. After getting Sitko out of the vehicle safe and sound the two sat down on the nearby grass and talked for a few minutes to calm the driver down. As they were talking, Warnock says Sitko told him that he had started reading the Bible the night before. 'I was like that's awesome, that's great news. I think maybe God put me here at the right time and he held you up here for sure - maybe it's meant to bring you closer to him,' Warnock said. Driver: Mathew Sitko, 23 (pictured) only suffered minor injuries and is recovering . Thankful: He wrote on his Facebook page on Wednesday that he feels 'blessed' for how his ordeal ended . Scene: Sitko crashed while driving along the winding road before crashing through the property and dangling over the edge of the drop. Warnock managed to reach him by climbing the pedestrian bridge, pictured . Warnock says he didn't give his name to police because he didn't need thanks for the act. However, he decided to come forward after the photo went viral. 'I don't want recognition but I know there' no getting away from it until I talk to someone,' Warnock told KHQ. 'We made it. He's alright. And that's all that matters to me,' Warnock added. Not long after the crash Sitko posted to his Facebook page that he felt blessed. 'Good morning everyone! I am truly blessed by God today!! Thank you God & Jesus for taking care of me!! I love you!' he wrote on his Facebook. Sitko lists his job as working for Moscow and Lewiston Landscaping.","Mathew Sitko, 23, crashed his car and ended up hanging over a cliff edge in Lewiston, Idaho in an 'emotional episode' Wednesday morning .

"Nuts are a source of useful nutrients and have other health benefits - just this month, a study found that peanuts can increase the levels of friendly bacteria in the gut and ward off food poisoning. Here, we look at some of other the plus points... Brazils . One of the best dietary sources of the mineral selenium. Two Brazil nuts provide 100 per cent of our daily required dose of 75 micrograms. Selenium is needed for the production of antibodies, important for a healthy immune system, and the hormone thyroxine, needed to regulate metabolism. Researchers have also found it activates an antioxidant that helps reduce the risk of bladder and prostate cancer. Almonds . You need to eat just ten almonds to get your daily requirement of calcium (700mg) You need to eat just ten almonds to get your daily requirement of calcium (700mg), important for healthy bones. They are also rich in vitamin E, which helps improve the condition and appearance of your skin. Almonds are high in fibre, too. Eat them with the skin on as this contains antioxidants that help protect body cells from inflammatory damage. Cashews . A good source of iron. A 30 g serving provides around 2 mg: a woman needs 14.8 mg a day and a man 8.7 mg. However, iron from cashews is not as easily absorbed as iron from meat, says dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker. 'Vitamin C boosts absorption of iron from non-meat sources, so eat cashews with a kiwi fruit, in a salad with peppers and tomatoes or with a small glass of orange juice.' Walnuts . These are rich in plant-based omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants, which have been shown to reduce the risk of the eye condition age-related macular degeneration, and cognitive decline. In a two-year study, researchers at the University of Barcelona are looking at the effects of eating 28 g of walnuts (seven shelled nuts) every day in preventing these conditions. Walnuts have also been shown to help protect against heart disease. Peanuts . Technically, these are legumes, as they grow underground, but a study published last month in JAMA Internal Medicine found they are in the same nutritional league as 'tree' nuts. They are packed with fibre and protein, so keep you feeling satisfied. 'They are nutrient dense and have a low glycaemic index, which means they help stabilise blood sugar levels,' says Dr Schenker. A handful of peanuts contains 180 calories, but Dr Schenker says the calories in nuts are over-estimated. 'They are not that easily absorbed, so you receive only two-thirds of their potential energy.' Vitamin C boosts absorption of iron from non-meat sources, so eat cashews with a kiwi fruit . Mixed nuts . A handful (28g) of mixed nuts a day reduces the risk of heart disease by 29 per cent and cuts the risk of dying from cancer by 11 per cent, according to a 2013 study in the New England Journal of Medicine. A 30-year study of 120,000 people also showed the more often they ate nuts, the lower the risk of premature death, thanks to the various health benefits.

"The Andaz Liverpool Street hotel in London used to be bedlam, but not through cavalier management, rebellious staff or disruptive guests. The Victorian building that houses it is built on the site of England’s first hospital for the mentally ill - the Bethlehem Royal Hospital, which opened in 1247 and was often pronounced as ‘bedlam’. Fast forward a few centuries and in its place is a swanky, celebrity-baiting boutique hotel with 267 rooms  - four of which have been decorated by trendy artists. And instead of mental health patients, it's the likes of Beyonce, Lil Kim and Lady Gaga that stay here these days. Silence is golden: Step into the Andaz Liverpool Street lobby and you're in a world of hushed swankery . Star guests: The likes of Lady Gaga (right) and Beyonce (left) are fans of the Andaz Liverpool Street . Historic: Andaz Liverpool Street is built on the site of England's first hospital for the mentally ill . The striking thing about walking into the lobby is just how serene it is. Despite its proximity to one of the country’s busiest railway stations and the frenetic Bishopsgate road, the foyer is a place of almost temple-like peacefulness, as if hermetically sealed from the outside. ‘Who turned off London?’ I ask my girlfriend as we walk in. The check-in system is very Apple Store. The foyer doesn’t have a reception, it has amiable youngsters swanning around with iPads, which you use to register. Our room on the third floor matches the foyer in the hushed stakes, with the traffic noise quite marvellously suppressed. Even emergency service sirens are little more than distant bleeps. The vibe in this Large King room is minimalist chic, with two distinctive red Eames chairs and a sleek wooden desk with Jacob Jacobsen lamp. But we’ve chosen it for a certain bespoke flourish, for this is one of four rooms in the Andaz which has been decorated by trendy artists. Our room has a gigantic mural created by Patrick Vale and Paul Davis called One Day Walk plastered across one of the walls. The three other ‘art rooms’ contain works by Chris Price and his wife and collaborator Delisia Howard, design studio ILoveDust and Patrick Morgan.

Multi-disciplinary English Artists ILoveDust’s East My Dust street art room will also appeal to those who fancy a quirky twist to their stay . One Day Walk is a celebration of the hotel’s east side locale, documenting a nine-hour walk the artists took that began with breakfast at St John Bread And Wine and wound its way past St Paul’s Cathedral, Hawksmoor Church, Brick Lane and Columbia Road, of flower-market fame. It’s a jumble of sketches, ponderings and quotes from overheard conversations that some might find a bit overwhelming, but we find mesmerising. A work of art that adds a splash of attitude and intrigue to a room with low-key aesthetics. The room’s other major talking point is the bed. It’s simply magnificently huge and comfortable, seemingly spanning multiple postcodes. There’s a lot of floor space, too. I’m tempted to zig-zag my way to the bathroom to extract maximum value from it. Delightful design: The Andaz Liverpool Street features a knowing nod to New York's Guggenheim Museum .

The Andaz should really invest in some Bluetooth-capable sound systems as mobile phones tend to be the portable music system of choice these days. The aforementioned en-suite, meanwhile, is strikingly swish, with floor-to-ceiling tiling, a deep bath and turbo-charged power shower. Room inspection over, it’s time to explore the rest of the hotel. The Andaz has made the business of sauntering around inside all the more pleasant by dispersing a zesty fragrance through diffusers and, I'm told, courtesy of housekeeping staff armed with sprays. It's called 'Darjeeling' and was created specifically for the hotel by a company called T London, which claims it 'relaxes and renews'. This aroma wafts around rather pleasing aesthetics. The hotel opened as The Great Eastern in 1884 and was given a Terence ‘Habitat’ Conran makeover in 2000 after it had fallen into disrepair. The result is most eye-catching, with a postmodern, sleek interior contrasting markedly with the redbrick exterior. A highlight is the soaring six-storey-high atrium and a winning nod to the Guggenheim museum built into the 'spine' of the hotel that joins the old part with a newer section. Guests looking up as they walk to the lifts in the foyer will notice the walkways above have been sculpted to imitate the New York museum’s world-famous spiral design. Very clever. The refurb, meanwhile, revealed something rather intriguing and Dan Brown - a Greek Masonic Temple hidden behind a fake wall. Built using 12 types of Italian marble and mahogany panelling, it was considered one of the grandest Masonic temples of its time. Masons began using it again for meetings when it was uncovered and while it's not open to guests, this ornate room can be hired by the public, with wine tastings and wedding receptions popular bookings. Our appetite for the mysterious sated, it's time to dine. Mysterious: When the hotel was refurbished in 2000 builders found this incredible Masonic temple behind a fake wall. Today it is available for hire . Flaming brilliant: Once a month the Andaz hosts a candle-lit dinner in its 1901 restaurant . Tasty: The standard of cooking at the Andaz is stunning and the setting truly relaxing . Food, glorious food: The presentation of the dishes at 1901 is stunning. Pictured is a crab starter . Casual: Breakfast and brunch is served at the Andaz's Eastway cafe, where the atmosphere is more informal . Brute of a breakfast: The full English option at Eastway will satisfy the hungriest of customers . Dinner at the Andaz, in its 1901 restaurant, is truly an experience to savour. Feeding takes place in a space that’s almost other worldly, a grand high-ceilinged room containing huge Mount Olympus-style pillars, gigantic potted plants that only Hercules could lift and a central block brimming with cocktail-making juices, as one of side of the room functions as a bar. The setting is enhanced because it's 1901’s Candlelight Dinner night which takes place on the last Wednesday of every month. Three hundred and fifty candles are lit and placed around the room for added dreaminess. The food quality is equally impressive. It's so beautifully presented you could call it art, frame it and hang it. I savour a delicious crab starter with cucumber, grapefruit and blackberry jelly (£14) followed by a brilliantly executed beef fillet with potato cake, oxtail spring roll, stilton beignet, carrot and courgette puree (£29). A glass of 2006 Woodlands Margaret River Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot from Australia complements it marvellously. Brunch the next day in the hotel's Eastway diner is far more casual, but memorable all the same. The DIY Bloody Mary bar there is a great idea, but I summon a revitalising oatmeal and banana smoothie and a dreadnought of an English breakfast served in a huge roll from an interesting and fun New York-style menu. It's delicious but I feel anchored to my seat, so it's time to abandon the tranquillity of the Andaz and follow in the footsteps of Vale and Davis through the streets of the East End to walk it off.

"Kate Major Lohan has been arrested for a 'drunken attack' on her husband Michael Lohan, TMZ report. Kate - who was ordered to rehab by Michael last year - is said to have had an alcohol relapse before getting physical with the father of Lindsay Lohan. TMZ report that Michael made a 911 call around 7:02pm on Thursday claiming his wife had struck him after coming home inebriated. Scroll down for video... Busted: Kate Major arrested AGAIN after she 'drunkenly attacked' Michael Lohan after a heated argument on Thursday at their home in . Their argument then turned physical, with Kate began scratching Michael's back. The site also reports that when police arrived Kate was visibly intoxicated, had slurred speech and blood shot eyes. Kate reportedly admitted she had been drinking, claimed Michael grabbed her by the throat and that the argument was caused by him accusing her of cheating. Fiery: Michael (pictured here with Kate in 2010) was not wearing a shirt during the argument, and his wife reportedly began scratching his back . She was then taken to the Palm Beach Country Jail and charged for battery. A recording of his 911 call, obtained by TMZ, captures Michael pleading for police to come and arrest his wife. ‘Please ma'am I need help. My wife, she is drunk and on pills and she just attacked me,' Michael says as the sound of a baby crying in background can be heard. When asked if he was okay, he replied: 'I'm more cut up. She just got out of jail. DWI the works. We are locked outside. I think the baby got hurt… she was hitting me and the baby. I got it all on tape.’ The 911 dispatcher then enquires into what kind of drugs Kate has been using: ‘Yeah she has been smoking marijuana, and taking pills and she went to get food and came back drunk. She is actually on a detox from alcohol [right now].’ Adding: ‘She's on Valium and […]. Yes, prescribed by a doctor, but the marijuana is not.’ The dispatcher then asks if Kate is in need of medical assistance. Family drama: Speaking to TMZ, Michael (pictured with daughter Lindsay and ex wife Dina Lohan in 2003) blamed his ongoing custody battle with Dina for his fiery relationship with his new wife . ‘No, no, I was running away,’ Michael replies. ‘I have video [of it all].’ The recording ends with Michael saying, ‘She is telling our son to say I hit her. Can you believe it? She is crazy. Listen to that drunk.’ Speaking to TMZ, Michael blamed his ongoing custody battle with ex-wife Dina Lohan for his fiery relationship with his new wife. He tells them: 'At the end of the day, this is all because of what Dina is doing in court... It affects Kate too, and like anyone with a drug or alcohol problem, when they can't handle the stress, they resort to drinking.' Last year, Dina filed court documents claiming that Michael refuses to pay for his son Cody's $10,000-a-year school fees. It's not the first time Michael's troubled wife Kate has run into problems with the law. Kate was arrested in March 2013 after Michael called the police following another drunken feud. She was pulled over by police where she tested three times over the drink drive limit.","Kate Major Lohan has been arrested for a 'drunken attack' on her husband Michael Lohan .

"A Canadian woman whose son died fighting for the Islamic State is now working to stop the extremist group from taking advantage of more vulnerable young men and women in North America. Christianne Boudreau thought her son Damien Clairmont was going to Egypt to study Arabic in 2013, but Canadian authorities later told the Calgary mother that her son had instead gone to Turkey where he crossed the border into Syria to join ISIS. While Damien had become more extreme in his Islamic ideology before he left Canada, Ms Boudreau never imagined her shy and peaceful son would actually become a jihadi. 'I thought it was just a phase he was going through,' Ms Boudreau told NBC News. Scroll down for video . A mother's grief: Christianne Boudreau of Calgary, Canada lost her son last year when he was killed fighting for ISIS in Syria . Helping others: The Canadian mother is now working with other families worried about their radicalized children. Boudreau pictured above (left) with her son Damien Clairmont, right . Ms Boudreau is now dealing with the loss of her son by channeling her grief into work - helping families like hers from losing their radicalized children to the extremist group. Ms Boudreau says she raised her son Damien in a Catholic household, but he converted to Islam at the age of 17 while he was having a hard time in high school. Damien was severely bullied, and even considered suicide during this painful period, his mother revealed. So Ms Boudreau was more relieved than worried when he found solace in Islam and started becoming more social again. Helping to deal: Ms Boudreau says her son Damien was bullied in high school and turned to Islam for solace in 17 . Radicalization: However, Ms Boudreau says her son's interested in the religion took a turn in 2011 when he started growing his beard out and distancing himself from the family . 'I saw some positive changes start to happen,' Ms Boudreau told CNN in February. 'He became social again. The old Damian that I knew when he was younger, much younger, was starting to come out.' But Ms Boudreau says her son's interest in Islam took a turn in 2011 when he started distancing himself from the family, growing his beard out and refusing to sit at the dinner table when they were drinking wine. She believes someone in Calgary started radicalizing her son - a process that continued when he searched extremist materials online. Ms Boudreau believes ISIS manipulated her vulnerable son into wanting to join their jihad by appealing to his protective nature. 'I think they got into his head believing that he was saving women and children, and he was very passionate about women and children and felt that they were easy targets,' Ms Boudreau said. Telling his family that he was going to Egypt to study Arabic, Damien left home in November 2012 and traveled to Istanbul where he attended a training camp and eventually crossed the border into war-torn Syria. Ms Boudreau found out about her son's death in January 2014, when a journalist called trying to confirm his death which was published online. He was 22. When Ms Boudreau reached out to the fighter who tweeted a eulogy for her son, he wrote an open letter to her online, saying she should be proud of her son and join ISIS in his memory. When asked what she feels about her son's decision to join ISIS, Ms Boudreau says: 'I'm proud of who he was, I'm proud of what his heart was truly. I'm not proud of the choices he made.' Ms Boudreau says that at the time she lost her son to ISIS, there weren't many organizations she could turn for support about her son. Ms Boudreau is now changing that by working with the families of radicalized young men and women, in an attempt to stop the spread of more homegrown terrorism. 'I can't let Damien die in vain,' Ms Boudreau said. 'Knowing what I went through - that really dark, dark tunnel of loneliness and fear and desperation - I don't want anybody else to go through that.'","Christianne Boudreau's son Damien Clairmont converted to Islam at the age of 17, after being bullied in high school .

"'Heartless': Tykeran Hamilton, 25, has been jailed for 11 years. He killed cyclist Alan Knight in hit-and-run . An unlicensed driver fresh off a vodka and cocaine binge shouted 'watch this' before killing a great-grandfather on his paper round in a hit-and-run. Tykeran Hamilton, 25, who borrowed the rented black BMW 3 Series and drove it around Gloucester after spending a night drinking and taking drugs, has been jailed for 11 years. He spotted a friend waiting for a bus, leaned out of the window and shouted 'watch this' before accelerating up to 70mph on a residential road at 7am. Bristol Crown Court heard Hamilton sped down the road and overtook cars 'recklessly' - narrowly avoiding a central reservation and other traffic. Moments later, he crashed into cyclist Alan Knight, 64, who was crossing the road while on his morning paper round, then drove away at high speed. Former factory worker Mr Knight, a father-of-four and grandfather-of-14, died instantly from his injuries at the scene, on Stroud Road in Gloucester. Hamilton abandoned the car nearby then fled the city and denied any involvement in the tragedy, which happened on September 26 last year. His trial was due to start today but he admitted causing death by dangerous driving, driving without a license, driving without insurance and failing to stop after a road accident. Judge Graham Cottle said Hamilton 'could not have cared less' about the safety of others on the road when he hit Mr Knight. 'In the early hours of the morning of September 26 Mr Knight was doing a paper round on his bicycle,' the judge told Hamilton. 'What had you been doing for the past 12 hours? The evidence paints a picture of you spending a night drinking, taking cocaine. 'You were an uninsured driver, you were unlicensed. You went to a garage and as it happened you saw somebody nearby who you knew. 'You said ""watch this"". The inference that can be drawn from that statement is that you attempted to show off to him what this car could do. 'You took off up the road at around 60-70mph. You were overtaking recklessly and just managed to avoid colliding with a central island.' Great-grandfather Alan Knight, 64, had been out on his morning paper round when Hamilton crashed into him. Mr Knight was killed instantly. His wife said: 'My life just isn't the same since he was taken from us' Hamilton spotted Mr Knight starting to cross the road ahead and immediately began braking but could not stop, the court heard. 'You drove straight into Mr Knight, doubtless killing him instantly,' the judge said. 'You left him in the road and you drove off at equally high speed.' Hamilton drove back to a friend's house before running to see his girlfriend, who he asked to provide him with an alibi, then left Gloucester. The court heard Hamilton told friends 'I've licked him, I've licked him' - street slang for 'I've killed him'. He was arrested on October 21 but insisted he was not involved, telling police he had been with his sister and girlfriend at the time. Prosecuting, Rupert Lowe read a victim impact statement from Mr Knight's wife, Linda. Mr Knight was struck on Stroud Road, Gloucester (pictured) on the morning of September 26 last year . 'My life just isn't the same since he was taken from us by such a show-off person like you, Mr Hamilton,' it said. 'Alan was a great husband, father and grandfather. We didn't want for anything. If we needed the moon he would get us the stars as well.' Mr Knight started doing paper rounds on his bike four years before the accident and did it as a hobby to keep fit. His daughter Victoria told Hamilton in court: 'I will never forgive you for what you did that day and I hate you for it. You are heartless.' The judge sentenced Hamilton for 10 years for causing death by dangerous driving, driving without insurance, driving without a license and failing to stop. He imposed a separate sentence of 12 months, to run after the first sentence, for five drugs charges relating to possession with intent to supply Class B drugs. Hamilton had been on license for the charges at the time he killed Mr Knight. Representing Hamilton, of Moor Street, Gloucester, Joe Maloney, said: 'He is an immature man. He panicked, drove off and did all the wrong things.' Mr Maloney said his client had previously worked as a landscape gardener but applied for disability living allowance after being stabbed in the leg.","Tykeran Hamilton accelerated to 70mph after spotting friend at a bus stop .

"When Eve Addison developed a strange swelling in her collarbone after drinking gin and tonic, she assumed she must have an allergy. But when switching brands failed to help - and she developed night sweats and a rash - she saw her GP. To her horror, tests revealed the 24-year-old was suffering Hodgkin Lymphoma - cancer of the lymphatic system. The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is one or more painless swellings in the neck, armpit or groin. Eve Addison, now 24, developed a strange swelling in her collarbone whenever she drank gin and tonic - and assumed she must have develoepd an allergy . But she became worried when switching brands failed to help - and she developed night sweats and a rash . These swellings are enlarged lymph nodes - oval-shaped glands that help the body recognise and fight germs. About 70 per cent of people diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma have a swollen lymph node in their neck. Usually, the swollen nodes don't hurt, but in some people like Miss Addison, they can be painful - especially after drinking alcohol. Following her diagnosis in January 2014, she has now been given the all clear - and is sharing her story to make others aware of the condition. Miss Addison, a marketing manager from Merseyside, began suffering the symptoms in September 2013. She said: 'I suppose, looking back, alcohol did save my life. 'I had been feeling unwell for a while and every time I went out, I'd come back with swelling and pain. To her horror, tests revealed the 24-year-old was suffering Hodgkin Lymphoma - cancer of the lymphatic system - and she endured six months of chemotherapy . The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is one or more painless swellings in the neck, armpit or groin. Usually, the swollen nodes don't hurt, but in some people like Miss Addison, they can be painful - especially after drinking alcohol . The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is one or more painless swellings in the neck, armpit or groin. These swellings are enlarged lymph nodes. About 70 per cent of people diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma have a swollen lymph node in their neck. Lymph glands commonly swell during an infection but they then usually go back to normal over a short time. With a lymphoma, the lymph nodes often grow slowly and may be there for months or years before they are noticed. But sometimes they grow very quickly. Usually, the swollen nodes don't hurt. But some people say their lumps ache or are painful. And for some they are painful after drinking alcohol. About 25 per cent of patients have other more general symptoms such as: . Heavy sweating – especially at night . High temperatures that come and go with no obvious cause (often overnight) Losing a lot of weight over a short period of time . Itching, which may be worse after drinking alcohol . Cough or breathlessness . Abdominal pain or vomiting after drinking alcohol . Source: Cancer Research UK . 'I just thought nothing of it and when I went to the GP, I was told that there was nothing to worry about. 'When the doctor says ""don't worry, you're going to be just fine"", you believe them, don't you?' But by December, she had developed other symptoms and was given creams and anti-inflammatory drugs to deal with chest pain, night sweats and an all-over body rash. After her devastating diagnosis at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, Miss Addison underwent a six-month course of chemotherapy to rid herself of the disease, which affects around 1,900 people each year. The treatment not only left her drained, but triggered septicemia and a blood clot. 'I lost a lot of muscle and I was so drained all the time,' she recalled. 'I was so tired and in so much pain that I could barely stand up. 'Even though I was only 23, I felt like I had the body of a 90-year-old.' Despite her diagnosis - and starting chemotherapy almost instantly - she began a new job just days later, as planned. She also froze her eggs just in case the treatment rendered her infertile. To her relief, she was given the all-clear last September. And despite her harrowing experience, Miss Addison insists she would face cancer again if given the option. She said: 'It's indescribable how happy I was to get the all-clear - I've never felt happiness like it. 'My mum was the happiest person in the room when I heard the news. All of my family were so proud of me for getting through it.' She also believe she has a better perspective in life after beating cancer. 'The lessons I learnt from it have made me much more appreciative of what I have in life and I feel like I'm oddly lucky.' She is now planning to celebrate by running the Race for Life in her hometown in July.","Eve Addison developed strange swelling in her collarbone after gin .

"Wylie Brys (pictured) and his dad, Dallas zookeper Tim Brys, were digging for fossils near a grocery store when Wylie found the dinosaur bones . A five-year-old boy in Dallas has had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of discovering 100million-year-old dinosaur bones while searching for fossils with his dad. Wylie Brys was digging with his dad, Tim Brys, back in September at a construction site near a Mansfield, Texas, grocery store when he made the ancient discovery. 'He walked up ahead of me and found a piece of bone,' Dallas zookeeper Brys said. 'It was a pretty good size and I knew I had something interesting.' The pair had been finding fish vertebrae, but when Wylie came back with the bone, Brys asked him to take him to where he found it, according to KSAX. And now, scientists from Southern Methodist University have helped a Dallas zookeeper and his 5-year-old son excavate the fossil. Tim Brys and his son Wylie worked at the excavation site Tuesday to dig up what paleontology professor Dale Winkler believes could be a nodosaur, a pony-sized dinosaur that dwelled on land. Though Brys and Wylie discovered the fossil last September, it took over seven months to obtain necessary permits to dig up the bones. Scientists started digging last Friday, according to the Dallas Morning News. At the time, the zookeeper, who often leisurely digs for fossils with his son, was not sure what Wylie, then four years old, had found. Wylie (left) and his dad Tim Brys (right) often go on fossil-searching trips as a way to be outside and spend time together. It's believed that the bones Wylie found belong to a nodosaur, a a pony-sized herbivore with scaly, plated skin . The two kept digging because they knew there was a chance of finding Jurassic period marine life remnants in the area. What they found was the nodosaur - meaning 'knobby lizard' in Greek. The lizards were 15-foot-long, scaly-plated plant eaters that could weigh up to about 2,000 pounds according to the Dallas Zoo. 'My dad told me it was a turtle,' Wylie said Tuesday at the site of his discovery. 'But now he's telling me it's a dinosaur.' University experts said it is rare to find a dinosaur in the Dallas area. Wylie Brys, 5, background, watches as Southern Methodist University's Michael Polcyn (right) supervises the removal of a dinosaur bones encased plaster from Mansfield, Texas on Tuesday. University experts say it's rare to find dinosaur remains in the Dallas area . The fossils were wrapped in burlap and plaster to create a protective shell around the bones, like a cast around a human's broken bones. They will be transported to Southern Methodist University for cleaning and assembly, which will likely take months, Winkler said. He added that excavation will continue at the site for the next week or so before construction crews continue building in the area, but that it is unlikely for another dinosaur to be discovered at that site. Brys isn't expertly trained in searching for fossils, but he learned a few tips from the scientists. He and Wylie collect fossils as something they can 'do together outside,' Brys told KXAS. And Brys told the Washington Post that Wylie is just like any other five-year-old. 'He's a little kid,' Brys said. 'He likes playing in dirt as much as finding the fossils, I think.'","Wylie Brys and his dad, Dallas zookeeper Tim Brys, were digging for fossils near a local grocery store when they made the discovery in September .

"The woman who came up with a neon sign that has welcomed countless visitors to 'fabulous Las Vegas' since 1959 has died. Betty Willis, credited with designing the 'Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas' sign, died in her Overton, Nevada, home on Sunday, according to an obituary on the Virgin Valley & Moapa Valley Mortuaries' website. The 91-year-old artist's often-copied sign sits in a median in the middle of Las Vegas Boulevard south of the Strip. Betty Willis in her Las Vegas home on December 30, 2004, with a replica of the sign she designed in 1959 to lure tourists. She died aged 91 . The 'Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas' neon sign, here outlined in pink lightbulbs in honor of breast cancer awareness month, became a major tourist attraction . 'It's the most recognizable icon in the world,' said Danielle Kelly, executive director of The Neon Museum in Las Vegas, where the signs of Sin City's past are retired and on display. The welcome sign's design, which doesn't have a copyright owner, has become a fixture on travel tchotchkes from Vegas and everywhere else, Kelly said. She has a T-shirt from San Francisco with that city's name swapped in for Las Vegas in front of the sign's recognizable shape, she said. 'The fact that everyone loves that sign and its design after all these years is a testament to Betty's talents,' Clark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak said. 'There is probably no bigger Las Vegas icon than that sign.' In 2009, the sign was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Kelly called Willis' designs dazzling and said her personality was akin to a strong, fast-talking female lead in movies like 'His Girl Friday.' 'A little salty, a little irreverent,' Kelly said with fondness. 'I thought she was a classic broad.' Willis, born in 1923 in the small town of Overton northeast of Las Vegas, worked as a commercial artist in Los Angeles before returning to Las Vegas, where she worked for sign companies and designed the famous diamond-shaped beacon of flashing lights. The sign has become such a popular photo backdrop that a parking lot for cars and tour buses in the middle of the street was expanded in 2012. Willis also designed neon signs for the Moulin Rouge casino and Blue Angel motel in Las Vegas.

"Ed Miliband has explicitly ruled out allowing another Scottish independence referendum, as he bids to ease voters' concerns about the prospect of any future SNP-Labour alliance. The Labour leader said a second independence poll 'ain't going to happen' even if he becomes Prime Minister with the support of SNP MPs next month. Mr Miliband's intervention came as the former prime minister John Major warned that the SNP was 'merely waiting for a good excuse to put separation back on the agenda'. Labour leader Ed Miliband, interviewed on the BBC this morning, explicitly ruled out allowing another Scottish independence referendum . Mr Major said the SNP would break their pledge not to hold another referendum 'for a generation'. He said the SNP were 'determined to prise apart the United Kingdom'. Former foreign secretary William Hague added that SNP could be 'calling the tune' if Ed Miliband became PM on the back of SNP support. He said this would mean: 'The people who want to break up the United Kingdom will be running the United Kingdom.' But Mr Miliband this morning accused the Tories of 'threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom' by talking up the prospects of Scottish nationalists in the May 7 General Election. The Labour leader insisted there would be no coalition with the SNP and flatly ruled out holding another referendum. He told BBC1's Breakfast that he had 'fundamental differences' with the SNP – including on a second independence referendum within five years. He said, adding: 'I'm not having that.' The Labour leader said a second independence poll 'ain't going to happen' even if he becomes Prime Minister with the support of SNP MPs next month . Labour party leader Mr Miliband addresses an audience during a campaign stop in Manchester this morning . Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had been 'talking up' the SNP in the hope that it would take votes and seats from Labour north of the border and allow him to 'crawl back' into 10 Downing Street. 'I think David Cameron is playing fast and loose with the United Kingdom,' said the Labour leader. 'This is somebody who has given up hope of winning a majority. He is trying to boost the SNP. 'I think David Cameron is now threatening the integrity of the UK with the games he is playing. And I think Conservatives are now ashamed of what he is doing.' Mr Miliband cited Conservative former Cabinet minister Lord Forsyth who has warned that the party's tactic of targeting a Labour-SNP link-up was 'short-term and dangerous' and could ultimately damage the Union. In a BBC interview last night, the Labour leader insisted he would not be dictated to by the nationalists, even if he had to govern without an overall majority in the new parliament. But Sir John Major said that, in practice, Mr Miliband would be forced to accede to the SNP's demands or face the collapse of his government. 'If Labour were to accept an offer of support from the SNP, it could put the country on course to a government held to ransom on a vote-by-vote basis,' he said. Mr Miliband's intervention came as the former prime minister John Major warned that the SNP was 'merely waiting for a good excuse to put separation back on the agenda' Sir John added: 'Labour would be in hock to a party that - slowly but surely - will push them ever further to the left. And who would pay the price for this? We all would. We would all pay for the SNP's ransom in our daily lives - through higher taxes, fewer jobs, and more and more debt. 'This is a recipe for mayhem. At the very moment our country needs a strong and stable government, we risk a weak and unstable one - pushed to the left by its allies, and open to a daily dose of political blackmail.' The former premier pointed to the way that Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy has already suggested that funds raised from the party's planned 'mansion tax' in England could go to Scotland. 'If a Labour leader asks for that, how much more will the SNP demand?' Sir John is expected to say. 'And if this is the way Labour intends to behave towards England, how can they say no to the SNP? And if Labour did say no, the SNP could withdraw support and bring down the government at any time.' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon addressed the Scottish Trade Union Congress during a campaign visit to in Ayr this morning . MsSturgeon poses for a selfie with supporters during a campaign visit to in Ayr today, after launching the party's manifesto yesterday . With the opinion polls pointing to a hung parliament with the SNP holding the balance of power as the third largest party, the threat of a nationalist link-up with Labour has emerged as the main Conservative line of attack in the election campaign. The tactic has caused misgivings among some Tories. Lord Forsyth - who served as Scottish secretary in Sir John's government - warned that building up the SNP to undermine support for Labour in England could ultimately damage the Union. 'We've had the dilemma for Conservatives, which is they want to be the largest party at Westminster and therefore some see the fact that the nationalists are going to take seats in Scotland will be helpful,' he told the Guardian. 'But that is a short-term and dangerous view which threatens the integrity of our country.' He said Mr Cameron's call for 'English votes for English laws' in the aftermath of last year's Scottish independence referendum vote had 'shattered the unionist alliance against the break-up of the United Kingdom'. Labour MP David Lammy this morning admitted that the party would strike a deal with the SNP after the election . Meanwhile, former Labour minister and London mayoral contender David Lammy suggested that the party could 'do business' with the SNP after the election. 'I think we can win this election. But clearly, after the General Election, you would forge common alliance with parties that you can actually do business with and the SNP must be part of that story,' he told ITV News. 'I still think Labour can form the next government and that's what I am fighting for. But, yes, there is common ground with other parties and the SNP would be included in that and we may need to enter into discussion after the General Election.'","The Labour leader said he would not grant the SNP a second referendum .

"When Catherine Gerhardt got her business of the ground, she chose to reach out to her competitors and ask them if they were interested in collaborating. While most ignored her offer, she did receive one response so nasty, that the thought of it still fires her up. 'I felt as though I had been punched in the gut,' Ms Gerhardt told Daily Mail Australia. After reaching out to competitors only to receive a nasty response, Catherine Gerhardt now uses her experiences to educate other adults and children on how to deal with online 'flamers' She teaches the children to follow ICE: Ignore, Communicate and Exit in order to deter bullies . 'He basically responded saying that I could never know as much as he knows, it was a total power play.' Ms Gerhardt chose to employ the same initiatives she teaches to young children through her Melbourne company, Kidproof Safety, and completely ignore the bully. 'When dealing with a 'flamer' or troll, all you want to do is respond to justify yourself,' she said. 'But I tell the children to instead follow 'ICE' and Ignore, Communicate and Exit.' Much like a Troller, a 'flamer' sends messages with the intention to hurt the recipient and get a reaction. An internet troll often trawls through social media, hunting for victims, while a 'flamer' (like in Ms Gerhardt's case) waits for the victim to contact them and unleashes a hateful response. Ms Gerhardt tells her students that by ignoring, the bully is being frozen in their tracks with nowhere to go. Then by communicating the incident to an adult and then exiting the situation, the behaviour is not escalated. She advises those experiencing this behaviour to try and not take it personally.

An internet troll often trawls through social media, hunting for victims, while a 'flamer' waits for the victim to contact them and unleashes a hateful response . Along with the ICE motto, Ms Gerhardt, in her early 40's, also advises adults and children who witness others being 'flamed,' to employ 'ACT.' 'Assess' the situation, 'Calm' yourself down before getting involved and 'Tell' someone about the bullying behaviour,' she said. 'Bullying-related suicides often happen because ICE and ACT haven't worked that well and the victim has had a difficult time exiting the situation.' If, for business purposes, the victim must respond to the 'flamer,' Ms Gerhardt has advised that via email is not ideal. 'With email, it's all about the tone,' she said. 'I would personally step up and attempt a person to person conversation rather than over email.' Ms Gerhardt believes that internet bullies are seeking a reaction from as many people as possible. 'They just want to stir the pot,' she said. 'I live by the mantra, if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.'","Catherine Gerhardt reached out to competitors when she started business .

"For most workers, being told they're getting a raise at work is a cause for celebration, but not for these builders in China. That's because they're constructing a mountain road thousands of feet above the ground in Pingjiang County, Hunan province. With no ropes or safety harnesses, and only hard hats to protect them if they fall, these men spend their days hauling heavy planks and wheelbarrows full of cement over a rickety wooden walkway. On the edge: Workers in China have been pictured building a walkway for tourists while perched thousands of feet up a mountain side in Pingjiang County, Hunan province . Precarious: The men spend their days carrying heavy planks of wood and wheelbarrows full of concrete across a flimsy-looking wooden walkway with so safety harnesses or ropes . Tipping point: Here, the builders are left standing on nothing more than rusty-looking scaffolding poles as they hammer them into the rock to extend the road further round the cliff . Attraction: Pingjiang is dominated by the Mufu mountain range and officials have tried to attract visitors to the small county by construction precarious walkways such as this one for tourists to walk along . In other images the builders can be seen perched on nothing more than rusty metal scaffolding poles as they hammer them into the mountainside to extend the walkway. Chinese officials hope that the road will draw thousands more tourists to the area, as they flock to walk along the scenic route. Pingjiang County is well-known for its mountains, with the Mufu Mountain range sweeping through most of the province, and the national park there already attracts thousands of sightseers. Local authorities have tried to capitalise on this popularity by building a winding series of mountain roads and glass walkways along some of the sheerest cliff faces. Under construction: The workers first assemble the scaffolding poles along the cliff before constructing a walkway of wooden planks along the top, and then use this as a base to construct a more stable concrete path . Don't look down: Without ropes or safety harnesses, and with only hard hats to protect them if they fall, these men assemble scaffolding along the cliff, which is the first stage of extending the walkway . Nerve-wracking: With little or no safety equipment, these are the brave men charged with helping to build this tourist attraction in Pingjiang County, south eastern China, which officials hope will bring tourists to the area . Danger: These men pour heavy concrete into moulds set into the mountain walls, with the whole structure balanced on top of wooden planks and rusty scaffolding poles . It is not known exactly where this walkway is being constructed, but it is very similar in appearance to another mountain path being built along the side of Shifou Mountain, in nearby Jiangxi province. That road has been under construction since at least 2011, and also saw workers balancing on a flimsy 3ft-wide wooden walkway thousands of feet up a mountain. Once completed, that road would have stretched for nearly two miles around the cliff top, making it China's longest mountain sightseeing road. Engineer Yu Ji, 48, who has been building these roads for a decade, said: 'I don’t feel it’s so different from any other job. It’s not as dangerous as people think. You just wear ropes then everything is OK.' Heavy load: Workers are pictured filling in the bridge with concrete, with all the weight balanced on top of rickety wooden planks . Hard labour: The men are expected to spend their days hauling heavy wooden planks and wheelbarrows full of concrete back and forth across the walkway, despite being suspended thousands of feet in the air with no safety equipment . Toughing it out: These workers manage to look like they're enjoying themselves, despite being just one step away from death on this mountainside in south eastern China . Another glass-bottomed walkway opened in Pingjiang in 2014, suspended 600ft above the ground, it is actually a suspension bridge that stretches between two mountaintops. Because it is only held up by steel cables which anchor it to the surrounding rocks, the bridge actually sways when the wind blows, making it especially terrifying for tourists to cross. So many visitors get stuck on the bridge, their legs paralysed by fear, that the tourist board employs specially trained staff who are on hand to help them to the other side.","Workers carry heavy planks and wheelbarrows full of concrete across wooden walkway thousands of feet in the air .

"A coroner has questioned the lack of swimming in the national curriculum after Rony John, 15, drowned on the first day of his summer holidays . A coroner has raised concerns over the lack of swimming lessons included in the national curriculum after a 15-year-old drowned in a river on the first day of his summer holidays. Rony John, 15, died after jumping into the River Great Ouse in Hartford, Cambridgeshire, despite being unable to swim. At an inquest into his death, the coroner said she would now write to Government chiefs to ask why swimming is not included in secondary school education. The hearing heard that swimming is compulsory during primary school but is not enforced for those aged 11 or over. Assistant Cambridgeshire Coroner Belinda Cheney said: 'Swimming is not a difficult skill to learn yet it is a critical life skill.' The hearing heard how Rony was with friends on the bank of the river in July last year when he dived into the water. When it was clear he was in difficulty, Rony's friends desperately tried to rescue the teenager. A group of adults also attempted to bring the young boy to safety, while firefighters arrived at the scene within ten minutes. But an inquest heard how Rony was swept away by the current and would have died within four minutes of jumping into the water. His body was not found until the following day. The hearing, which took place in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, heard how Rony came to Britain from India in 2012 and did not know how to swim. According to his headteacher, Mr Bennet said he had been eligible for six 30-minute lessons a year at St. Peter's School in Huntingdon. But Christopher Bennet said that he had also been excused from some of the sessions after taking notes to school, written by his family, requesting he not take part. Just weeks after Rony's death, the school also cancelled swimming lessons for all older pupils. After the hearing, Mr Bennet said: 'Rony came to school at the beginning of year eight. As his family said in the inquest he needed help to stay afloat. The teenager was swimming with friends in the Great River Ouse at Hatford, Cambridgeshire in July last year . Firefighters were on the scene within ten minutes and his friends also tried to bring Rony to safety, but the young man could not be saved . 'Pupils of his age were entitled to six half-an-hour lessons a year and we know that for all of the lessons that took place he was in school. 'We know that he attended some of those lessons but he also came in with notes which could have come from the family stating that he couldn't take part.' He added: 'Swimming is in the national curriculum for primary school pupils but not for those in secondary education. 'We had to cancel lessons for secondary school pupils because of the cost and it would be beneficial to have extra provisions for those students. 'It is a life skill and at the end of the day we live on an island so we are never very far away from water.' Tributes were left at the scene, on the bank of the river, following Rony's death. His headteacher Christopher Bennet said he was a 'hugely popular young man' He added that Rony was a 'hugely popular young man' and there were plans for a memorial cricket match on the first anniversary of his death. Rony's father John Thomas, from Huntingdon, told the inquest: 'He was extremely well-behaved. He was always a good boy.' Yesterday, Moses Yitzchok Greenfeld, 19, from Stamford Hill, London, drowned in Hampstead Heath pond after going for a swim with four friends in the 25C heat. His body was eventually discovered five foot below the surface and 20ft from the water's edge just before 11pm on Wednesday - nearly six hours after he was reported in trouble at 5.30pm. It is thought Mr Greenfield may have had a cardiac arrest because of the shock of jumping into the cold water. It has since been claimed that police officers 'watched' as the desperately tried to save their friend. An eyewitness has said at least seven police officers stood on a bank and watched as the boys dived in and out looking for their friend.","Rony John drowned in the River Great Ouse in Hartford, Cambs, in July .

"A nanny is behind bars after she was caught on camera allegedly beating a young girl in her care. Lidia Quilligana was arrested in Danbury, Connecticut last month after police viewed a video that allegedly showed her choking and beating a 3-year-old girl, and then burning her legs, arms and hands on a hot stove as she screamed out in pain. This after the girl's family set up a nanny cam thinking that something was happening to the girl. Scroll down for video . Lidia Quilligana (above in court Wednesday) was arrested in Danbury, Connecticut last month after police viewed a video that allegedly showed her choking and beating a 3-year-old girl . She was also caught allegedly burning the legs, arms and handsof the girl on a hot stove as she screamed out in pain . 'You can hear the child yelling screaming,' said the prosecutor in court on Wednesday according to News 8. 'Multiple times she takes the child’s hands and puts the child’s hands on the burner.' She then called it the 'worst video' she has ever seen in her career. Quilligana has worked for the family, who are not being named for their daughter's safety, for about a year. In December 2014, the parents began to suspect something might be going on, so they purchased the camera. The defense lawyer working for Quilligana says the charges are completely false, and that her client even knew she was being filmed by the family. Furthermore, four other families wrote letters showing their support for the nanny in court. 'She’s never had any problems in the past,' said Tunnard. 'She’s watched other people’s kids over the past three years, those are the letters I showed to the court. That she’s always been very trustworthy and they never had any issues with her.' Quilligana is charged with first degree assault of a child under 10 years old and criminal mischief and will appear again in court on April 22. Her bail has been set at $1million.","Lidia Quilligana was arrested in Danbury, Connecticut after police viewed a video that allegedly showed her choking and beating a 3-year-old girl .

"Kezzia French, 46, will hold a second funeral for her baby daughter killed at the hands of her father . A grieving mother will hold a second funeral for her baby daughter tomorrow 16 years after she was killed by her lottery addict father. Kezzia French, 46, thought she had laid six-month-old Andrea to rest in 1999, but only found out more than a decade later that police had in fact removed virtually all her vital organs. The little girl died after being flung at a wall by her father, Meyrick Fowler, then 24, who flew into a rage when his lottery number's didn't come up at their home in Ipswich, Suffolk. He was convicted of her manslaughter and jailed for four years after throwing her so violently she suffered brain damage and four skull fractures when her crying disturbed his number checking ritual. Andrea's body was returned to Ms French fully-clothed and a funeral was held shortly after the tragic death in April 1999. But police failed to tell Ms French she was burying her daughter with much of her body parts missing. It was only two years after a national police audit in 2010 that she received a letter informing her that Andrea's vital organs were held in a fridge at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Her liver, spine, bowel, lungs, kidneys, heart, spleen, thymus, stomach, pancreas, trachea and skull fragments had all been retained without Ms French's consent. She received a further blow this month when police admitted that her brain had been cremated in 2009, after it had been sent to a hospital in Sheffield for examination, without their knowledge. The organs were stored as police investigated Andrea's death and kept in case Fowler appealed his sentence. Ms French said: 'After the funeral I felt I could try and move on. But now I feel lied to by everybody. I feel conned by the authorities, they have kept this secret from me for all these years. 'The idea that I buried my girl without her heart and brain has completely broken me. Those are the parts that make a person. What they let me bury wasn't my daughter. Kezzia French, pictured holding baby Andrea in 1998, thought she had laid her to rest in April 1999 after she was tragically killed by her ex-boyfriend Meyrick Fowler . 'There were two detectives at the funeral - and they didn't mention a thing. This revelation has brought all the heartache back again. My world was torn apart.' Ms French, who went on to have two more children, will hold Andrea's second funeral at Ipswich Chapel in Suffolk where her remains will be placed on top of her original coffin. She said: 'This whole thing has been like living in a real-life horror movie. I never dreamt that I would have to go through burying my daughter again. 'I feel really upset and angry at the thought of having to go ahead with another funeral. I have had to sign a form to open up her grave which is just awful. 'Once the funeral is over I feel at last I can put everything behind me and try to move on. 'I will feel happier when I know she is with her heart and everything else. I know she'll finally be a peace.' She now plans to make a formal complaint to Sheffield Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Royal Hallamshire Hospital where Andrea's brain was destroyed. Ms French (pictured left, during her pregnancy) only found out she had buried her daughter with some of her vital organs missing when she received a letter from police in 2012 to inform they were holding her body parts . The most recent letter she received last month informed her that Andrea's brain had been cremated in 2009 . The Trust's deputy medical director, Nick Massey, said: 'In 1999, a member of our pathology staff agreed to provide an opinion on one particular organ at the request of the police. 'We kept the specimens prepared for microscopic examination but we were obliged by new guidelines to dispose of the remainder of the tissue. 'This was ten years after the opinion had been given. It was carried out in a respectful manner and in line with the best practise guidelines of the Human Tissue Authority. 'Subsequently we were contacted by the police in 2012 to whom we then returned the examination specimens that had been retained.' Ms French has also complained to Addenbrooke's Hospital, but bosses have said they acted as requested by the police. Andrea's liver, spine, bowel, lungs, kidneys, heart, spleen, thymus, stomach, pancreas, trachea and skull fragments had all been retained at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, without Ms French's consent . A Cambridge University Hospitals spokesman said: 'We followed the procedures for storing organs in line with the protocols for police investigations at that time.' Suffolk Police said: 'In 2010, all police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were tasked with conducting an audit of any human tissue samples which had been retained as part of criminal investigations that had since been concluded. 'We sought to undertake the notifying of families sensitively, prioritising the wishes of the families affected.' ACPO guidance now tells police to keep samples for be up to five years or until criminals are released from prison.","Kezzia French, 46, thought she'd laid baby daughter Andrea to rest in 1999 .

"It is the sort of advert to strike fear into any woman. Wanted: Female body double for Sienna Miller. Must have the same body measurements as the Hollywood actress – give or take a centimetre. But that hasn’t stopped a hopeful production company putting out a very detailed request that includes, and reveals, every one of Miss Miller’s impressive vital statistics. Specifics: Applicants must meet a strict criteria including measuring 5ft 6in, have a 25½in waist, a high hip of 35, low hip of 36½ and be prepared to cut their hair into a messy bob, so they look like Sienna Miller . Would-be Siennas hoping to appear in an advert for bottled water should be 5ft 6in in height and have a 25½in waist, the advert states. Their ‘low hip’ measurement should be 36½in while their ‘high hip’ should come in at 35in. Those afflicted with bingo wings will wince at Miss Miller’s ‘top arm’ circumference – a sparrow-like 10in. The casting request even gives details of the 33-year-old’s head and wrist circumferences. The hopeful extra must not have tattoos or body piercings and must be prepared to cut her hair into a messy bob, just like Miss Miller’s. And, if measuring up to these remarkable standards is not enough, the successful stand-in must also be an expert in yoga. According to the casting call, the advert, for Austrian water brand Vöslauer, will star Miss Miller and feature a group of girls ‘having a laugh while they perform very hard yoga moves in a private class’. The commercial ‘uses the effortless and feminine elegance of the girls to personify the true spirit of Vöslauer’. Flexible:  On top of having the right measurements, applicants must be be able to do a host of yoga moves like the bridge (pictured) Sought-after position: Sienna Miller wannabees should be good at yoga stances including the scorpion . Moves: As well as having the right measurements and being prepared to chop their hair into a messy bob, applicants must also be able to do yoga moves including the side crow (left) and lotus (right) Candidates are required to demonstrate their yoga skills in the audition, with filming due to start in London shortly. Required yoga poses include the ‘side crow’, where the stand-in must balance on his or her forearms. The clones are also required to demonstrate the ‘bridge’, ‘lotus’, ‘warrior’, ‘wild thing’ and the ‘scorpion’, which sees the legs curl over the head in a potentially hospitalising move. The fee for the body double is set at just £500. Curiously, however, a separate casting call for the same advert, this time for a male yogi required to do the same moves but without looking like Miss Miller, sets the fee at £1,500. Vöslauer Water, Austria’s answer to Evian, bills itself as coming from the country’s ‘oldest fountain of youth’. The spring is said be more than 20,000 years old and to have its source 2,000ft underground. Previous adverts for the brand have featured fellow Hollywood actress Keira Knightley and models Claudia Schiffer, Cindy Crawford and Agyness Deyn.","Applicants must measure 5ft 6in and have a 25½in waist .

"These are the pictures taken by an unforgiving regime of the men, women and children caught trying to escape its suffocating clutches and then forced to re-enact their ordeal for the cameras of the secret police. 'Reenactment MfS' - the Ministry for State Security better known as the 'Stasi' during the 40 year existence of the East German state - is a new book containing these photos of desperation which the socialist rulers used as evidence in the show trials against those they caught. They were also thought to have been used for training purposes for border guards and trainee agents intended to inculcate in them awareness of the lengths people would go to in order to try to escape the workers' paradise that was the German Democratic Republic. Scroll down for video . Foiled: The Stasi - East Germany's secret police - forced people to pose for their pictures, showing exactly how they had planned to escape from the German Democratic Republic . Humiliation: The families were forced to line up and pose for the pictures, which were used as 'evidence' Lessons: The photographs were also used to train up border guards, so they knew what people might try to do to escape the confines of East Germany . Hidden: These pictures were found in the archives of East Germany's Stasi secret police, presumably the clothing of someone who had tried to flee the Communist regime . But photographer Arwed Messmer, who discovered the pictures, sees another reason for the pictures of families desperate to escape the grasp of East Germany. 'Of course when I saw these photos of families for the first time I was reminded of Abu Ghraib,' he said, referring to the prison in Iraq where American gaolers humiliated their prisoners for amusement and captured the images of their degradation on camera. Messmer found the remarkable photos in a box at the Stasi Archive in Berlin, where mile upon mile of yellowing paperwork - the files of the secret policemen which they managed to neither burn or shred in the East German state's dying hours - now reside. Together, they constitute a fascinating if grim epitaph to a nation which erected the Berlin Wall to hermetically seal in its citizens. One of the photos shows a man sitting in a homemade raft made out of polystyrene slabs, nylon rope, and wooden boards. He was transporting it to the Baltic Sea near the East German resort of Boltenhagen on July 9, 1981, when he was apprehended, tried and flung into prison. Simple: A picture of a ladder, which some desperate person had used to try to escape to the West . Creativity: The ingenuity of people trying to escape was remarkable: one picture shows a girl hiding in a gearbox compartment, while others simply show the vehicle in which they tried to make their escape . Evidence: Other pictures, like these blood stained tops, look more like a picture which might be taken by police for use in a court case today . Another is of a primitive float constructed out of a car tyre inner tube, a fan motor and car battery. The craft was assembled by a man who worked in a factory which made Trabant cars. He intended also to sail from Boltenhagen to get to the west on June 26, 1989. But he was apprehended before he hit the shoreline and also ended up in jail. Collection: All the pictures have now been brought together in a book by the photographer Arwed Messmer . One of the more poignant photos shows a young boy standing outside a car with its boot open, his sister forced to lie inside, just as she was found when their car was stopped at Checkpoint Bravo in Berlin as it headed west on September 12 1983. It is believed the children were sent to a Stasi orphanage, their mother arrested. Also caught in the cold glare of the Stasi photographic lens was an East German family and their West Berlin escape helpers, Oliver Mierendorf and Karlheinz Hetschold, who tried to smuggle them west in an Opel car on September 21, 1973. The ingenuity of the people smugglers knew no bounds. One of the photos shows a young girl lying in the gearbox compartment at the front of a Peugeot 403 on September 9, 1965, as two U.S. soldiers attempted to get her through the border to the west. Tunnels, people caught in vans, others caught in car boots as well as models of the Stasi HQ speak from the pages of the book: silent witnesses to an unforgicing system which killed hundreds and imprisoned thousands more before it imploded in 1989. Messmer said: 'Many of these pictures were surely made within the kind of standard crime investigation routine you can find all over the world. 'In these reenactments I suspect that the East German authorities wanted to at least keep up the semblance of the rule of law, by giving state prosecutors visual evidence, even if a later trial verdict was already pretty certain at the time of arrest. 'I would say that the humiliation caused by this form of documentation was more like collateral damage, and that it was accepted as simply part of the process.'","Discovered in the Stasi Archive in Berlin by photographer Arwed Messmer .

"Thousands of motorists have been fined or had their cars towed away after falling foul of new rules following the switch to digital tax discs. Many are buying used cars unaware that the old paper documents are now automatically cancelled when a vehicle changes hands. Ignorant that they must fork out for a new digital one – even if the existing paper disc is months from expiry – rising numbers of drivers are falling prey to clampers. Scroll down for video . Thousands of law-abiding motorists have had their cars clamped because they were unaware of major vehicle tax rule changes. File photo . Critics allege that the DVLA has been operating a 'money-making scam' after figures yesterday showed clamping soared after the paperless system was introduced in October last year. Many say the authority was too quick to penalise motorists without first warning that their car was not taxed. Drivers have faced bills of up to £800 to get their impounded vehicles back. The Government abolished the paper tax disc (pictured) last autumn . The DVLA was accused of 'heavy-handed and Draconian' behaviour yesterday after figures showed its use of clamping rocketed by 60 per cent from about 5,000 vehicles a month before the changes to 8,630 last month. With no right to appeal against the fines to an independent body, drivers have little choice but to pay up. The DVLA is estimated to be making millions of pounds a year because it receives double road tax payment – from both the seller and the buyer. Christopher and Marianna Webb, from Bridport, Dorset, were hit with an £822 bill to get their Ford Focus back after returning from holiday to find it had been impounded for non-payment of vehicle excise duty. The couple decided to swap their cars with each other and informed the DVLA of the change in ownership, without realising it meant the tax for both vehicles would be cancelled. Mr Webb, 56, told The Guardian: 'I feel they are very heavy-handed. Why did they not send a reminder letter?' Pete Hallam, whose car was also clamped, said: 'This is shady practice and reminiscent of the car parking wheel clampers a few years ago. It is a money-making scam.' Paul Watters of the AA said there had been only limited publicity from the DVLA about the changes to the vehicle tax system. 'There are a lot of people who are not aware of this – some may think they are covered because they see there is a tax disc on the windscreen,' he said. 'Clamping is quite heavy-handed and Draconian. Before they clamp they should try to get in touch with these people if they can.' A DVLA spokesman said: 'The changes have been widely publicised and we write to every vehicle keeper to remind them of the new rules before the vehicle tax expires. 'We also write to every new vehicle keeper when they buy a used vehicle to inform them that they must tax the vehicle before they use it. 'In addition, if a driver does not tax their car we will send a warning letter to remind them to tax as they are at risk of enforcement action.'","Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency abolished paper tax disc last autumn .

"History of depression: Former Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich openly contemplated committing suicide for years before he shot himself on February 26, according to new police reports on the Republican gubernatorial candidate's death released Tuesday . Former Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich had talked for years of taking his life - and had become increasingly agitated over politics - but left no suicide note when he fatally shot himself, investigators said Tuesday. Police in the St. Louis suburb of Clayton said they have found nothing to suggest the death of Schweich, who was running as a Republican candidate for governor in 2016, was anything other than a suicide. Newly released police reports show Schweich felt so abandoned by GOP supporters that he told an aide on February 26, the day of his death, that he would have to either 'run as an independent or he needed to kill himself.' Schweich's death and the apparent suicide a month later of his spokesman Spence Jackson have sent shockwaves through Missouri politics. The latest police information came as Governor Jay Nixon on Tuesday announced plans to appoint fellow Democrat and county treasurer Nicole Galloway as Schweich's replacement. Schweich had told an Associated Press reporter by phone minutes before his death he was ready to go public with allegations that the Missouri Republican Party chairman had told donors that Schweich was Jewish. Schweich was Christian but had Jewish ancestry. He perceived the remarks as anti-Semitism. Police investigative reports released Tuesday to The Associated Press in response to an open-records request show that friends and political advisers had discouraged Schweich from publicizing his concerns. Some of them told investigators that Schweich appeared to feel betrayed and alone because they didn't agree with him. Overwhelmed: Schweich shot himself in the head at his home in St Louis (above) just moments after calling an Associated Press reporter to set up an interview to discuss anti-Semitism in his own party . Anti-Semitc? Missouri GOP chairman John Hancock (pictured) had allegedly told donors at a party that Schweich was Jewish. Schweich is a practicing Christian, but has ethnically Jewish roots . Clayton Police Detective Lt. Don Bass said while that was 'part of the puzzle,' Schweich's motive to kill himself still is unclear to investigators. Police found no evidence that Schweich was involved in a scandal or extramarital affairs. And while Schweich had been prescribed two-dozen different drugs for such things as pain relief and Crohn's disease, which causes bowel inflammation, toxicology tests found no illegal drugs in his system. His wife, Kathleen, told investigators that Schweich had never been seen by a psychiatrist. Kathleen Schweich told investigators that her husband had talked about killing himself previously while holding guns, but she didn't think he would actually do so. She told police she thought he acted spontaneously. 'It is her belief that the stress of the disease along with the stress of the campaign caused him to take his life,' Clayton Police Detective Tom Bossch wrote in an investigative report. On the morning of his death, Schweich had talked by phone with his chief of staff, Trish Vincent, and 'was extremely upset over what he considered a lack of support from anyone' about his plans to publicize allegations about the GOP chairman, the report said. Schweich told Vincent he would have to 'run as an independent or he needed to kill himself,' the report said. Vincent got in touch with a family friend, who later was on the phone with Schweich when he made another statement about killing himself, threw down the phone and then shot himself, according to the police reports.

At left is his wife, Kathy, and to his right are son, Thomas Jr., and daughter Emilie . Double the tragedy: Just a month after Schweich's death, his former spokesman Spence Jackson (pictured) took his own life . State law requires the governor to find a replacement immediately when vacancies occur in the auditor's office. Nixon originally named his longtime aide, John Watson, to serve as auditor while he searched for a permanent replacement. For Galloway, now the Boone County treasurer, to take over, Watson will have to resign. Nixon said Galloway's swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for the week of April 27. Galloway, 32, made her political debut in 2011, when Nixon appointed her to serve as Boone County treasurer following the death of Treasurer Jan Fugit. Galloway was elected to a four-year term the following year. Galloway will serve the remainder of Schweich's term, which runs until January 2019. She said Tuesday that she plans to run for re-election at that time. Schweich had been sworn in for a second, four-year term in January after facing no Democratic opposition in the November election. Missouri Republican Party Executive Director Jonathan Prouty sent out a scathing statement while Nixon still was touting Galloway's appointment to reporters, saying the pick goes against the will of voters and that she will be 'entirely beholden' to the governor. Galloway denied that. Galloway's appointment will mean Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder will be the only Republican of six statewide elected officials. The Democratic-led executive branch contrasts with an overwhelmingly Republican Legislature. • For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here . • For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","Former Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich committed suicide on February 26, as he was running for governor as a Republican .

"The overbearing and interfering mother-in-law is often jokingly portrayed as most people’s least favourite family member. And now a new poll on modern families reveals this is a reality for almost a quarter of Britons – who said their pet dog was more important to them than their in-laws. Of the 2,071 people surveyed, 22 per cent cited their pets as a close family member, above in-laws (21 per cent) but below grandparents at 26 per cent. Scroll down for video . A new poll on modern families reveals almost a quarter of Brits prefer their pets to their in-laws . The research commissioned by Matalan for its Made for Modern Families campaign also found that the ‘Brady Bunch’ or ‘blended’ household where children had multi-parental figures was also on the rise. More than one in 10 British families now live in ‘blended’ families as more people with children divorce, remarry other parents and their households merge. As a result a fifth of all children – more than the entire population of Birmingham and London combined - have participated in their own parents’ wedding, the poll found. Spending quality time together as a family is still important with 65 per cent saying eating together at a table was one of their favourite family activities and 30 per cent claiming to enjoy playing board games and doing arts and crafts together. Over a third (35 per cent) said that their family’s happiness was their top priority, compared to just 6 per cent who cited money as most important. Mark Earls, a leading behavioural expert and fellow of the Marketing Society, said: ‘Contrary to those who have bemoaned the decline of the family as a key pillar of our society, family is alive and well – it just comes in many more different shapes and sizes than it used to including the “blended’ or “Brady Bunch” family, which consists of one or more adults with their own children and those from previous relationships. The interfering mother-in-law is often jokingly portrayed as most people’s least favourite family member, as in 2004 film Monster-in-Law starring Jane Fonda and Jennifer Lopez . ‘More than one in ten British families have this kind of arrangement. Such a scenario can create a situation in which the age gap between the youngest and eldest child/step-child can be more than a decade, as our survey found. ‘Ultimately, what we want for our families is what we’ve always wanted for those we love - health and happiness. However much the shape and the structures and the participants shift, it seems these same old truths abide. The family is here to stay.’ While the Beckhams were seen by 20 per cent of people questioned as the best representation of the modern family, 16 per cent thought it was Jamie Oliver’s brood, followed by the Jolie-Pitts at 7 per cent. Next in line from the list were Will Smith’s family (4 per cent) and Elton John and David Furnish (3 per cent). The research saw data compiled by YouGov reviewed by Mr Earls for Matalan as part of its commitment to understanding today’s modern families. Jason Hargreaves, Managing Director of Matalan, said: ‘Family life has changed dramatically since we first opened our doors 30 years ago. The demands on parents and families are greater than ever as time is precious, life is faster and pockets are pinched. ‘Family is at the heart of our business and we are committed to being there to help families, whatever their makeup or wherever they’re from, in everything we do.’","Mother-in-law is often jokingly portrayed as least favourite family member .

"These incredible images show French paratroopers dropping into hostile territory near terrorist havens on the Libya-Niger border. The pictures, including one radar grab, showing soldiers of the French second Foreign Parachute Regiment, were released by French Defence Audio-visual Communication and Production Unit. Taken during an airborne operation at the 'Salvador Pass' at the border between Libya and Niger, the shots show part of the anti-jihadist operation in the Sahel – the desert region which stretches across North Africa.

France began setting up a command base in northern Niger at the end of last year in efforts to combat the patchwork of international jihadist groups operating across the sparsely populated region from Southern Libya to Mauritania. The porous border between Libya and Niger in particular has been increasingly unstable following the toppling of former Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi by a NATO coalition including France in 2011. With Islamic State increasing its presence in the beleaguered North African State, the region, a gateway to Europe, has been of even greater concern to France and its allies in recent months. Roughly 300 fighters linked to al Qaeda's North African arm AQIM, including a splinter group formed by veteran Islamist commander Mokhtar Belmokhtar, were believed to have operating in southern Libya, a key point on smuggling and trafficking routes across the region. The French operation, dubbed Barkhane after the name of a kind of sand dune formed by desert winds, has set up its headquarters in the Chadian capital N'Djamena, but also placed an outpost in northern Chad about 200 km from the Libyan border. France has a reputation as the policeman of Africa. About 3,000 French troops are now operating out of Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad -- countries straddling the vast arid Sahel band -- with the aim of stamping out Islamist fighters across the region.

"With a 'megadrought' forecast to hit the US in the coming decades, parched states are turning to increasingly radical solutions to fill their reservoirs. Arizona is leading the way with plans to create artificial rain clouds by flying planes over the Rockies and seeding the sky with silver iodide. They hope the technology will allow them to mitigate some of the worst impacts of climate change – but not everyone is convinced. With a 'megadrought' forecast to hit the US in the coming decades, parched states are turning to increasingly radical solutions to fill their reservoirs. Arizona is leading the way with plans to create artificial rain clouds by flying planes over the Rockies, and seeding the sky with silver iodide . The process of cloud seeding was first proposed in the 1940s at the General Electric labs in Schenectady, New York. Two decades later, the Central Arizona Project and the Salt River Project invested in research to make it a reality. 'It hasn't been taken off the table as a potential tool as we work our way through drought now and in the future,' Nancy Selover, Arizona's state climatologist told Becky Brisley at Cronkite News. Since 2007, CAP has put about $1 million toward research happening in other states to increase the supply of water in the Colorado River system. Water in the air, even in dry areas, can be transformed into ice crystals by using planes to seed the atmosphere with chemicals such as silver iodide or dry ice . If it seems like it never stops raining, blame the Russians. Or even the North Koreans. CIA chiefs fear hostile nations are trying to manipulate the world's weather, a conference heard in February. A leading academic told how he got a mysterious phone call asking whether foreign countries could be triggering droughts or flooding. Professor Alan Robock, from Rutgers University in New Jersey, said: 'Consultants working for the CIA rang and said we'd like to know if someone is controlling the world's climate would we know about it? 'Of course they were also asking - if we control someone else's climate would they then know about it.' The professor is one of many scientists from around the world are actively looking at manipulating the weather as a way of combating climate change. Professor Robock told the callers that any attempts to meddle with the weather on a large scale would be detectable. The system works on the premise that rainfall takes place when supercooled droplets of water form ice crystals. As a result they become too heavy to remain suspended in the air, and fall, often melting on their way down to form rain. Water in the air, even in dry areas, can be transformed into ice crystals by seeding the atmosphere with chemicals such as silver iodide or dry ice. They create rain by inducing nucleation – a process in which water is in the air condenses around the particles and crystallises to form ice. But some scientists are concerned about silver building up in river basins, as well as legal uncertainties over who should get the additional water. Compared to other alternatives, such as desalinating seawater, cloud seeding is the cheapest option, though it isn't going to be a drought-buster on its own. In a recent Wyoming Weather Modification pilot project, the technology resulted in an increase of seasonal snow water accumulations of 5 to 15 per cent. But Selover, the state climatologist, told Cronkite News that the trickiest part of cloud seeding is measuring whether an area got more rainfall. 'So the effectiveness of it is in doubt,' she said. 'It's not that it's completely ineffective – they're pretty sure it has some impact – but it's pretty hard to measure.' Some scientists are concerned about silver building up in river basins, as well as legal uncertainties over who should get the additional water.

"They were the heartbreaking scenes of a family being torn apart: four young sisters being dragged kicking and screaming from their mother's home in the middle of the night. The story was that the girls had been taken from their abusive father back in Italy to hide out in Australia and now they were being sent back to the 'monster' against their will. The scenes of the girl's forced return caused widespread outcry, particularly as the girls' mother portrayed the cruelty of the Dad, and the girls -  then aged nine to 14 years old - frightened and distraught. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Flashback to 2012: These were the heartbreaking scenes of a family being torn apart when four young sisters were dragged kicking and screaming from their mother's Sunshine Coast home in the middle of the night and forced onto a plan back to their father in Italy . The four Vincenti sisters, including the two older girls Emil and Claire, had a 'monster' of a father who abused them and their mother,or so the story went after the girls were removed from their home in dramatic circumstances and return to Italy . What had led up to the removal of the four sistersin Australia and their return to Italy was the fact that their mother had taken them from their home in Italy on a 'vacation' and never returned, claiming the girls' father Tomaso was an abuser . Laura Garrett (pictured) has consistently maintained that she was removing her daughters from Italy back to Australia for their own safety . That was in 2012 and it seemed unbelievable to many Australians who watched the scenes play out that the girls were legally being returned to their Italian father as approved under Italian law. What had been lost in the drama was the fact that the four sisters had earlier been taken by their mother from Italy without the knowledge or permission of that father, Tomaso Vincenti, and that the girls had been born in Italy and spent the greater part of their young lives there. Now 60 Minutes has returned to the village near Florence where the girls have been living with their Italian Dad and interview the two elder girls, Emily and Claire Vincenti and talked to them about their lives and the dramatic circumstances in which they were apparently wrenched from their mother, Laura Garrett. This scene of one of the Tomaso girls in apparent distress outside her father's villa in Florence after the four sisters were taken back from Australia to Italy . Emily and Claire Vincenti (pictured) are now aged 16 and 17 and are living in Italy with their father . Emily and Claire talked about their parents and were filmed going out with their Italian boyfriends in Florence . The four Vinceni girls miss Australia and their mother, but appear happy and calm in contrast to the dramatic and hysterical scenes in which they were removed from Australian in late 2012 . The girls are living positive and fruitful lives, attending school six days a week, talking about what they will study at university and going out with their Italian boyfriends in Florence, according to the programme. Despite claims by the girls' mother than they were not happy in Italy, the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with father Tomaso . The dramatic turn in the lives of the Vincenti girls began in 2010, when they left Italy ostensibly just for  month's holiday back in Australia, with their mother's family on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. Laura Garrett and Tomaso Vincenti had met when she was a schoolgirl and had gone to Italy as an exchange student. Her host family was Tomaso's parents and Laura and Tomaso fell in love. Laura became pregnant and the pair married. Ms Garrett gave birth to four healthy girls, but in 2007 when the youngest was only around  four years old she split from Tomaso. Under Italian law, both parents were granted equal custody. In 2010, Laura told Tomaso she wanted to take the girls back to Australia for a vacation. Ms Garrett told the Australian embassy in Italian entirely different story, that she was fleeing an abusive husband and father and she needed their assistance. Once back in Australia, Ms Garrett and her daughters settled down to life in Queensland for two years, until the dramatic scenes which saw them returned to Italy. Now aged twelve to 17, the young women behave in complete contrast to the screaming, hysterical girls captured on camera in 2012. Just a day after being taken to their father's villa on the outskirts of Florence, the two older girls were filmed running to the front gates when they saw media camped outside and pleaded for reporters to help them return to Australia. The eldest girl was taken back inside by her father, while her sister clung to the gate as her grandmother urged her to return inside. She held onto the gate for an hour, during which local police and social workers arrived. The girls had not seen their mother since they left Australia, but after 60 Minutes went to Italy to film the story, Laura Garrett  has subsequently turned up for a three-day visit. Ms Garrett has previously said in the years since her daughter's return to Italy that the girls were unhappy. 'They don't seem to be settling,' she said in 2013. 'I keep getting constant requests from them to come home.'

"The first gender-neutral bathroom has opened in the White House after President Barack Obama’s executive order banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity came into effect. The all-gender restroom has opened in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The facility is the first of its kind at the White House and according to spokesman Jeff Tiller it’s something that fits in with the administration’s stance on LGBT issues. An all-gender restroom has opened in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in the White House (pictured is a sign marking the entrance to a restroom at the University of Vermont) The facility is the first of its kind at the White House and according to spokesman Jeff Tiller it’s something that fits in with the administration’s stance on LGBT issues . According to The Advocate, he said: ‘The White House allows staff and guests to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity, which is in keeping with the administration’s existing legal guidance on this issue and consistent with what is required by the executive order that took effect today for federal contractors.’ His comment came after the restroom had been alluded to by senior adviser to the President Valerie Jarrett in an op-ed for the publication about protecting LGBT workers. She said: ‘We have closely examined our internal policies on everything from benefits, to restroom access, to how we invite people to events, to ensure that everyone who enters this building feels safe and fully respected.’ On Wednesday President Obama’s Executive Order on LGBT Workplace Discrimination went into effect. It protects the rights of the LGBT community while in the employment of federal contractors and subcontractors. The all-gender restroom opened as Obama's executive order on LGBT workplace discrimination came into effect . Announcing the policy last year, Obama said: ‘Our government will become just a little bit fairer. ‘I will sign an executive order that does two things. First, the federal government already prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Once I sign this order, the same will be explicitly true for gender identity. ‘And second, we’re going to prohibit all companies that receive a contract from the federal government from discriminating against their LGBT employees. America’s federal contracts should not subsidize discrimination against the American people.’ On Thursday Obama called for an end to psychiatric therapy treatments aimed at changing the sexual orientation or gender identity of gay, lesbian and transgender youth. The move comes in response to an online petition posted on the White House website following the death of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn. The transgender teen committed suicide in December and left behind a note saying her parents had forced her to attend so-called conversion therapy.","The all-gender restroom opened in Eisenhower Executive Office Building .

"Have you ever wondered exactly what happens to the unused toiletries in hotel room bathrooms? Or how a hotel handles it if a guest dies during their stay? Hotel industry insider turned author Jacob Tomsky shares his tales from working in two top hotels in New Orleans and New York City and provides lots of little-known tips to ensure guests make the most of every hotel stay. MailOnline Travel chatted with Tomsky to get the answers to some of our most burning hotel questions... Scroll down for video . Hotel industry insider turned author, Jacob Tomsky, reveals the most common items people take from hotels . What are some of the most common items that people take from hotels? Without a doubt, toiletries and towels are definitely the most popular items for guests to pocket, according to Jacob Tomsky, author of Heads in Beds: A Reckless Memoir of Hotels, Hustles, and So-Called Hospitality. But some individuals staying at the hotel take things a bit too far. 'They take everything,' he tells MailOnline Travel. 'Duvet covers, little silver trashcans, universal remotes - anything that's not nailed down.' Despite common misconceptions, it is possible to pocket a plush robe - without incurring any charges . What can you usually get away with taking? Despite common misconceptions, you actually can get away with stealing that coveted hotel room robe. 'If you were to, say, check into a room, take a fresh robe and pack it away in your suitcase, then call down and say your room didn't have a robe in it when you checked in, is the hotel staff going to search your belongings? Highly unlikely,' Tomsky reveals. And when it comes to pocketing toiletries, you can occasionally even ask for more. 'There are other items, as well - complimentary amenities that you may not be aware are available,' he explains. 'Good hotels keep extra items, such as slippers, razors and shaving cream, travel lint rollers, and mini-deodorants, in stock but not displayed in the room.' As it turns out, the minibar is the most fallible system in the hotel, full of items 'sold at an absurd mark-up' If you lie about using the minibar, will the hotel really charge you? 'The minibar is the most fallible system in the hotel,' Tomsky tells MailOnline Travel. 'Human error, over-stocking, failure to re-stock, errant charges from weighted items being shifted but not consumed, all of these lead the front desk to spend hours a day slicing off incorrect charges.' He also notes that the 'items are purchased in bulk and sold at an absurd mark-up.' 'Hotels are much more concerned with your overall experience and securing further room nights - the main revenue stream - than whether or not you ate a candy bar.' Mike Holovacs, a front office supervisor at a major hotel chain and an adjunct hospitality instructor, adds: 'If an item has not sold, it's just like any other retail setting - the item is pulled when it reaches its expiration date.' Because certain rooms have varying levels of cleaning difficulty, they are usually awarded 'points' How long does it take to clean a hotel room? Is there anything that typically does not get cleaned? The length of cleaning time generally depends on the room. Because rooms have varying levels of difficulty, they are usually awarded 'points' and housekeepers must clean a certain total of points in one day. This may translate to a few larger suites or simply multiple standard rooms. 'I'd guess the average time is between 30 minutes to an hour to flip the room,' Tomsky estimates. 'A great deal of that time discrepancy depends on how the guest has left the room.' Once a year, large sections of rooms, or even entire floors are pulled out of service for maintenance and deep cleaning. 'This is includes sending the draperies out for cleaning and shampooing the carpets,' Holovacs explains. However, minibar glasses are often cleaned less thoroughly, usually soaked in shampoo or furniture polish . When it comes to the items that are cleaned less frequently or less thoroughly? Minibar glasses and the remote control. 'Housekeepers are usually responsible for cleaning the glasses, yet are not provided with dish soap,' he explains. 'So they either soak them in the sink with shampoo or, in a pinch, use furniture polish, as it leaves a 'clean-looking' shine.' And have you ever tried to clean your own remote? 'The rubbery buttons make it near impossible and dousing it with a cleaning agent could damage the circuitry,' Tomsky adds. How much money hotels spend on toiletries generally depends on the scale of the property and its occupancy . How much do hotels generally spend on toiletries per year? This one has everything to do with the scale of the property and its occupancy. According to a recent Forbes article, the Marriott hotel chain will spend approximately $20 million annually on their Thann products, a natural skincare line that's stocked in their Americas and Asia Pacific hotels. 'Usually the ordering is done by a housekeeping manager who takes into account the current supply and the average monthly uses from years past,' Tomsky reveals. 'People use more toiletries in the winter, have longer showers, and go through more toilet paper. 'It's a rather intriguing ordering process based on a large amount of collected data. 'And, ultimately, you don't want to be the one who fails to order enough toilet paper for the entire hotel.' Though there's a belief that hotel staffer furnish their home with amenities, Tomsky says it's not often the case . And do staff ever get to take them home? 'There's a long history of hotel staffers semi-furnishing their own home with hotel amenities,' Tomsky admits. 'Every party I threw from 2001 to 2004 was catered with hotel pillow chocolates. 'For the most part, items are either so pre-used that to take them would be distasteful, or so expensive that to steal them wouldn't be worth the loss of one's job. 'But I do have shoe polish that I've never paid for and hotel-branded slippers to keep me comfy in the wintertime.' One charity has come up with a novel way to deal with leftover hotel soaps - churning them together to provide soap to those in developing countries. Clean The World, receives partially-used and discarded soap from hotels, recycles it into millions of new bars, and then works with partner Global Soap to strategically distribute the new soap to people who lack access to it around the world. People dying in their hotel room is not quite as rare of an occurrence as guests may think, Tomsky admits . What happens if someone dies in a hotel room? While a bit morbid to talk about, Tomsky admits that such an occurrence is not quite as rare as guests may think. 'It's not something a hotel wishes to publicise, naturally,' he explains. 'So, they are removed as discreetly as possible. 'This may involve flashing lights and paramedics, depending on the severity of the situation, but can also happen via employee elevators and back exits.' Afterwards, the room is sanitised, cleaned, 'flipped' and sold - and that can happen a lot faster than you'd think. And, of course, all hotel staffers are forbidden from revealing any details - including cause of death and room numbers - to anyone. 'Death is a part of hotel life,' Tomsky adds. 'In fact, suicides often prefer hotels, relieving loved ones of the cleaning duties or seeing the deceased in a disturbing way.' Guests should take comfort in knowing that their in-room safes are actually very secure . Do staff actually have access to the in-room safes? No, they do not. The safes truly are, you know, safe. 'I always recommend using the safe to every traveller,' Tomsky says. 'The only person who can open the safe, should you forget your password, is a manager from the security department, using a tool that only they are trained and authorised to use.' What really happens to that half-used roll of loo paper in hotel room bathrooms? Well, it depends... And finally, what happens to the half-used loo roll in hotel room bathrooms? There's a bit of dispute over this one, and again, a lot of times it depends on the hotel itself. In the spirit of being environmentally-minded, most chains will simply refold the paper and leave the half-used roll in the bathroom, with another full roll behind it, should the guest run out. If there's not enough left to warrant leaving it, a Quora thread user, who works for the Beechmont Hotels Corporation, believes that the nearly-used up roll most likely winds up on housekeeping carts for when a room attendant needs a tissue for other cleaning tasks or in employee bathrooms.","Yes, it is possible to steal a robe from your hotel without being charged .

"A former lager lout who ballooned to 24 stone has lost nearly half his body weight by giving up his favourite drink. Rugby prop Dale Forrest, 26, of Bolton, would sink up to 12 pints a night, but decided to shed the pounds after seeing a photo of himself while out with his fitness fanatic friends. In December 2013, the bank teller decided to ditch the booze, give up his favourite fatty readymeals and greasy takeaways and hit the gym. Dale Forrest would drink up to 12 pints a night - and ballooned to 24 stone - before giving up beer to lose weight . Dale, pictured at his slimmest, was worried he would look like a 'beached whale' next to his friends on holiday . Since then, Mr Forrest, who had a holiday planned with his mates and didn’t want to look like a ‘beached whale’ next to them, has lost 10.5 stone. He said: ‘I can now go on nights out and feel confident - even without the Dutch courage. ‘I no longer feel like people are laughing at me and all it took was a bit of willpower.’ Mr Forrest struggled with his weight from a young age and in adulthood fell into unhealthy habits. Before shedding the pounds Mr Forrest ate a cheese and sausage bap for breakfast, a Big Daddy Box Meal from KFC for lunch and a meat feast pizza for dinner. Dale, pictured sitting down, said he would consume beer, alcopops and shots regularly on nights out . Dale, pictured before his weight loss (right) and after losing 10 stone, gave up greasy takeaways for healthy foods and started going to the gym regularly, and saw the pounds fall off . Despite being a rugby player, Dale weighed 24 stone due to his unhealthy lifestyle . He said: ‘I was inactive and ate and drank what I wanted. ‘All my friends were in really great shape. They got a lot of attention from girls and I got none, which was a bit depressing. ‘They were all quite careful about what they ate, but I thought nothing of having dinner at McDonald's regularly.’ Despite being a keen rugby player, Mr Forrest rarely exercised and lived on an unhealthy diet – and would regularly drink 12 pints of beer followed by shots and sugary alcopops on a night out with friends. He said: ‘I would drink in the pub with my friends every Friday and Saturday. ‘I would start off by having a few pints, then as I got a bit bloated I would switch to other drinks. By the end of the night I was downing Jaegerbombs and drinking alcopops.’ After a night out in December 2013, Mr Forrest logged on to Facebook to look at the pictures taken the night before. Dale is now taking part in a charity boxing match since losing weight . Dale, pictured before (left) during a rugby game, and (right) after losing more than 10 stone . He was horrified to see that he was nearly double the size of all his friends. He said: ‘I was shocked when I saw how big I was compared to my mates. ‘Me and the lads had just booked a holiday for the summer and I did not want to be the beached whale at the side of the pool. ‘I decided I had to change.’ Desperate to change, Mr Forrest set his alarm for 6am the next day so he could go to the gym. He said: ‘I had to drag myself out of bed - during the walk to the gym I felt like death and I struggled to find any motivation. ‘When I got to the gym things changed. I started with some weights and then did 15 minutes on the crosstrainer. ‘After I finished I felt I had achieved something, although it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. ‘I got a taste for it and started going all the time.’ Dale said he would start the night drinking beer and then move on to shots and alcopops . Dale (left before losing weight) turned his life around and lost more than 10 stone thanks to healthy eating . The committed slimmer also overhauled his diet, swapping fatty takeaways for lean meat and fresh vegetables. Before his dramatic weight loss Mr Forrest would snack on chocolate bars and gorge on a fat-rich diet. Now he eats porridge with blueberries for breakfast, grilled turkey with boiled potatoes and vegetables for lunch and grilled fish with green vegetables for dinner. Throughout the day he snacks on nuts, fruit, celery and protein shakes. He also started going to the gym twice a day, weightlifting before work and doing cardio in the evening. By February 2014 Mr Forrest had lost an impressive 3st 7lb. He said: ‘The biggest change was kicking the booze. I still go out now but I've changed my drinking habits. ‘I drink lime and soda throughout the week and I'll switch to gin and tonic on a Saturday night. ‘Within four months people started to notice I had lost weight. My work clothes started getting really baggy as the weight fell off. ‘It was a good feeling every time I needed to go down a size, but it cost me a fortune to keep refreshing my wardrobe.’ Since losing more than ten stone, Mr Forrest has dropped from a 48-inch trouser waist to a 34-inch waist. He now weighs in at an even 14 stone. He is planning on taking part in a charity boxing match on April 18 for Cancer Research UK. He said: ‘I've changed my lifestyle completely. It was a lot of hard work - but it is the best thing I have ever done for myself.’","Dale Forrest would go out drinking regularly and would eat fatty food .

"A businessman in suburban Detroit is under fire from unhappy neighbours after hanging a Confederate flag and nooses at his two properties in the area. Robert Tomanovich, who owns Robert's Discount Tree Service in Livonia, Michigan, first hung a noose from a tree and a Confederate flag, printed with the slogan 'I ain't coming down,' on a fence at his home. When neighbours complained, a second noose appeared on a tree outside his tree-cutting business which operates at a second property on the same street. Robert Tomanovich is under fire from unhappy neighbours in Livonia, a suburb of Detroit, after he hung a Confederate flag and nooses at his two properties in the area . Tomanovich first hung a noose from a tree and a Confederate flag, printed with the slogan 'I ain't coming down,' on a fence at his Michigan home . Tomanovich, 55, has denied his actions are racist, although an employee has admitted that the second noose was a deliberate move to antagonise locals. 'One hundred fifty years after Abraham Lincoln's death, we are still going through these kind of atrocities. A hangman's noose and a Confederate flag?' neighbor Mary Greer toldWXYZ. Another local complained that at least one of the nooses was hung from a tree small enough for a young child to climb. When the local TV network attempted to speak to Tomanovich on Friday he refused, although his wife Lindy tried to explain the noose as a tribute to a dead friend. 'Robert has a friend that died in that way (hanging himself), and that's in memory of his friend,' she told WXYZ. 'There's no crime in hanging a noose.' An unnamed employee was qick to take credit for the noose at Tomanovich's business. 'Screw 'em... We're gonna put more up,' he said. Tomanovich, 55, has denied his actions are racist and said he simply liked the colors of the Confederate flag, but has since taken it down . Wife Lindy told local media that the noose was a tribute to a friend of her husband who had hung himself . On Monday, Tomanovich spoke to the Daily News and said accusations of racism were 'stupid.' 'I know black guys, I have black friends. We're all laughing at this stupidity. Do you know how many white guys were hung back in the day? This isn't racist. But all of a sudden it's out of control.' He said he had put up the Confederate flag because 'I like the colors'. Tomanovich also said he has since taken down the nooses and flags, but refused to apologize. 'I don't need to defend this to nobody. My business is doing very well,' he said. 'I only want this story to get bigger. I want people to know I'm not a racist.' A second noose was hung on a tree outside Robert's Discount Tree Service in Livonia, Michigan, after neighbours complained about the first one .

"It is the age-old trick of students the world over - pulling all-nighters to cram for an exam. But a team of experts at Brandeis University in Massachusetts have a few words of wisdom, urging students to put down the coffee and sleep. They believe the memory neurons that are responsible for converting short-term memories into long-term ones, work most effectively when a person is asleep. Scientists have long known that sleep, memory and learning are deeply connected. Most animals, from flies to humans, have trouble remembering when they are sleep-deprived. And studies have shown that sleep is critical in converting short-term memories, into long-term memory, a process known as memory consolidation. A team of scientists at Brandeis University in Massachusetts believe all-nighters to cram before an exam won't work because the process converting short-term memory to long-term memory is best carried out when a person is asleep . But just how that process works has remained a mystery. One body of thinking questions whether the mechanism that promotes sleep is also responsible for consolidating memory. While another asks if the two distinct process work together. In other words, is memory consolidated during sleep because the brain is quiet, allowing memory neurons to go to work, or are memory neurons actually putting us to sleep? Graduate students, Paula Haynes and Bethany Christmann, at the university's Griffith Lab, believe the answer is the latter. They focused their research on dorsal paired medial neurons, well-known memory consolidators in fruit flies. The pair noted, for the first time, that when the neurons are activated, the flies slept more, but when they were deactivated, the flies kept buzzing. These memory consolidators cause the flies to fall asleep, as they begin to convert short-term memory to long-term memory. Ms Haynes and Ms Christmann said this all takes place in a section of the fly's brain called the mushroom body - similar to the hippocampus in humans, which is where our memories are stored. The parts of the fly's mushroom body, which is responsible for memory and learning is the same part that keeps it awake. The hippocampus in the brain, highlighted in red, is where our memories are stored, and where, the scientists believe the process takes place . Ms Christmann, said: 'It's almost as if that section of the mushroom body were saying, ""hey, stay awake and learn this"". 'Then, after a while, the DPM neurons start signaling to suppress that section, as if to say, ""you're going to need sleep if you want to remember this later"".' Understanding how sleep and memory are connected in a simple system, like fruit flies, can help scientists unravel the secrets of the human brain. 'Knowing that sleep and memory overlap in the fly brain can allow researchers to narrow their search in humans,' Ms Christmann said. 'Eventually, it could help us figure out how sleep or memory is affected when things go wrong, as in the case of insomnia or memory disorders.' This research was funded by the National Institute of Health.","Memory neurons that covert short-term memory to long-term work most effectively when a person is asleep, scientists believe .

"All but one of 10 former Atlanta public school educators convicted in a widespread conspiracy to inflate student scores on standardized tests were sentenced to jail time on Tuesday, as the judge called the cheating scandal 'the sickest thing that's ever happened in this town.' Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter had delayed sentencing by a day and encouraged all to negotiate deals with prosecutors. But only two agreed to deals. In both those cases, Baxter followed the state's recommendations: He gave a former teacher a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew at home for one year and a former testing coordinator six months of weekends spent in jail. They'll also serve five years on probation. Scroll down for video . Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter describes how the three former SRT directors were at the top of the chain during sentencing on Tuesday in Atlanta. He called the cheating scandal 'the sickest thing that's ever happened in this town' Defense attorney Angela Johnson holds her hand on her client, former Atlanta public school teacher Pamela Cleveland. She was the only one of the accused to avoid jail after she took a plea deal and was sentenced to 5 years, with 1 year of home confinement and curfew . Despite their lawyers' pleas for probation and community service, the remaining eight received harsher sentences, ranging from one to seven years in jail. They are expected to appeal and will be free on bond while the appeals are pending. A state investigation found that as far back as 2005, educators from the 50,000-student Atlanta school system fed answers to students or erased and changed answers on tests after they were turned in. Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools with nearly 180 educators involved, and teachers who tried to report it were threatened with retaliation. In 2013, 35 educators were indicted on charges including racketeering, making false statements and theft. Many pleaded guilty before the trial, and some testified at the months-long trial. The jury acquitted one of the 12 former educators who went to trial and convicted the other 11 of racketeering. 'This was very, very remarkable, to have the judge sort of give the defendants a second chance,' said University of Georgia law professor emeritus Ron Carlson. 'The thing that maybe was a little surprising was the reticence of the defendants to step forward and do that.' Former testing coordinator Donald Bullock was one of only two accused to took a plea deal. He was sentenced to 5 years probation, 6 months of weekends in jail, a $5000 fine and 1500 hours of community service . Former Atlanta public school teacher Angela Williamson was sentenced to two years in prison, three years probation, 1,500 hours of community service and a $5,000 fine . Bob Rubin, who represented former elementary school principal Dana Evans, said the decision to turn down the deal wasn't hard for his client. 'She couldn't say something that wasn't true,' he said, referring to the insistence by the prosecution and the judge that the negotiated deals include an acceptance of responsibility. Those who took the deals — former teacher Pamela Cleveland and former testing coordinator Donald Bullock — waived their right to appeal. They also agreed to accept responsibility, reading aloud a statement apologizing to students, parents and the court. Hurl Taylor, Bullock's lawyer, said his client is relieved and wants to move on with his life. 'He's a man of God and he knows that sometimes to be a man of God you have to humble yourself,' Taylor said. Baxter eventually agreed to let all the defendants qualify for first-offender status, after initially denying it for some. That means their records can be wiped clean once they've completed their sentences. Former Atlanta public school SRT Directors Sharon Davis Williams, left, and Tamara Cotman, right, were both sentenced to seven years in prison, 13 years probation, 2,000 hours of community service and a $25,000 fine . Atlanta Public school educator Tabeeka Jordan, left,  was sentenced to two years in prison, three years probation, 1,500 hours of community service and a $5,000 fine . Misconduct by educators rarely ends up in criminal court, and the fact that so many of them received jail time sends a strong message, Carlson said. 'These sentences will send shockwaves through the world of education,' he said, adding that he believes it will be nearly impossible going forward for an administrator to pressure a teacher to cheat. When sentencing those who didn't take a deal, Baxter reserved the harshest punishment for three regional directors who oversaw multiple schools and were 'at the very top of this scandal.' For them, Baxter went above prosecutors' recommendations of three years imprisonment. He ordered them to serve seven years in prison with the remainder of a 20-year sentence on probation, 2,000 hours of community service and a $25,000 fine. During sentencing, Baxter called the cheating 'pervasive.' 'It's like the sickest thing that's ever happened in this town,' he said. Former Atlanta public school SRT Director Michael Pitts was sentenced to seven years on Tuesday, while Diane Buckner-Webb received a one year jail term . Former Superintendent Beverly Hall was among those indicted, but she did not stand trial because her lawyers argued successfully that she was too sick. She died last month from complications of breast cancer. The 11th convicted former educator had a baby over the weekend and will be sentenced later. District Attorney Paul Howard told reporters after sentencing that his goal all along was to get the community to pay attention to what happened in Atlanta schools and to make sure the affected children get some relief. 'We believe the loss that we suffered was a community loss,' Howard said. He said his office is in talks to create the Atlanta Redemption Academy, which he said will seek to identify and assess the students who were hurt by the cheating scandal and to provide solutions for them, including help getting a job or GED training or assistance getting into college. Bernice King, daughter of slain civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., and Rev. Gerald Durley, a former administrator at Clark Atlanta University and the Morehouse School of Medicine, have been tapped to head the board of the planned academy, Howard said. Tamara Cotman .

"The Disney driving instructor who was killed in a Lamborghini crash Sunday tried to grab the wheel in a desperate attempt to prevent a collision, as investigators say the car may have been speeding in the wrong direction around the track. Tavon Watson, 24, was doing 100mph at the Exotic Driving Experience at Walt Disney World in Orlando when he slammed the $220,000 Lamborghini on the passenger side into a guardrail, killing 35-year-old race track employee Gary Terry. Florida Highway Patrol Sgt Kim Montes revealed Tuesday that the guardrail damaged the Italian car on the east side of the passenger door. Desperate effort: Investigators say Disney driving instructor Gary Terry (left) grabbed for the wheel of an out-of-control Lamborghini operated by Trevor Watson (right) and counter-steer before the car crashed into a guardrail . 'Guess who's driving a Ferrari 458 Italia LSTRF today?': Watson uploaded this picture to Facebook in celebration of his birthday with this message: 'But really. I thankyou Lord for keeping in your presence long enough to endure another day that just so happens to be my birthday' The FHP is now investigating whether cars at the private track are set up to travel in the opposite, clockwise direction of the guardrails, according to WESH-TV. Montes also said that evidence suggests Terry tried to grab the wheel and 'counter steer' the out-of-control vehicle in the moments before the deadly wreck. Video from inside the red Lamborghini reportedly showed that the car spun three times before careening into the guardrail at 100mph, causing the vulnerable passenger door to cave in into Terry. 'We're talking his whole body received the low,' Montes noted to New York Daily News. Both Watson and Terry were wearing helmets and lap and shoulder belts. Father-of-one Terry died at the scene while Watson was rushed to Celebration Hospital near Lake Buene Vista for treatment where he was later declared stable. He has since been discharged. The day out at the track was a present from Watson's wife and he posted a picture of himself next to a red Ferrari on the tarmac just hours before the fatal collision. Drive: According to his LinkedIn Terry was the operations manager at the Richard Petty Driving Experience at Walt Disney World . Outdoors: Terry, 36, originally hails from Michigan and brought his love of adventure to his new home in Kissimmee, Florida . 'Guess who's driving a Ferrari 458 Italia LSTRF today?' wrote Watson. 'That's right that's right. I ma drive all the cars they have in one day. Because I'm a gangsta like that. Lol.' Later that afternoon, Watson crashed the Lamborghini Gallardo he was driving, killing Terry, a former race car driver who was the operations manager at the Richard Petty Driving Experience at Walt Disney World. Watson doesn't face any traffic charges since the accident took place on a closed track, and there are no indications he was doing anything criminal, authorities said. 'It's not the kid's fault. It's a freak thing that happened,' said Timothy Horvath, a Terry family friend. As for Terry, 'if he thought he was in any danger, he wouldn't have done it.' Horvath said working at the Disney attraction was Terry's 'dream job.' Terry grew up in a racing family in Michigan. His brother, Adam, was also a race car driver. Terry was married with a toddler-age daughter, said Horvath, who grew up with the Terry family and runs a graphics business in Michigan that specializes in motor sports. 'Gary was one of the best,' Horvath said. 'He was a natural-born talent behind the wheel.' Watson, a hotel bellhop, described himself on his LinkedIn page as self-motivated, professionally mannered, humble and 'a very quick learner.' He told authorities he had been at the Exotic Driving Experience before. Father: Gary Terry is pictured here with his wife, Kathy and their daughter who appears to have celebrated her first birthday in May of last year . Tragic: Gary Terry, 36, died and his driver was hospitalized after their Lamborghini crashed at Disney world . Investigators from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration are looking into what happened. OSHA spokesman Lindsay Williams said the agency hadn't previously investigated Petty Holdings, the company that operates the track. Driving days at the track start at $99 and can cost as much as $2,500 for a full race experience with in-car video. The track is operated by Petty Holdings which also has Exotic Driving Experience franchises at speedways in Atlanta, Dayton Beach, Charlotte, New Jersey and Texas. Named after the NASCAR legend, Richard Petty, the experience lets fans drive European supercars or NASCAR vehicles at close to their top speeds of 200mph around an oval. 'It's kind of scary to think accidents do happen even though they are rides and there are precautions,' said visitor Autumn Stevenson to WFTV. The Exotic Driving Experience attraction lets racing fans be drivers or passengers in luxurious cars such as Lamborghinis, Porsches or Ferraris . Package: Thrill seekers can pay up to $2,500 to experience a day driving an Italian supercar such as a Lamborghnin Gallardo (pictured above) As part of the package, visitors are accompanied by a professional driver who sits in the passenger seat providing racing advice. It is believed that was what Terry was doing when he was killed in the Lamborghini. The racing track is just south of the iconic Magic Kingdom. 'We offer our deepest sympathies to those involved in today's tragic accident,' said Andrea Finger, spokesperson for Walt Disney World Resort. According tot he Orlando Sentinel, Petty Holdings LLC also offered its best wishes to the victims and their families. 'On behalf of everyone in the organization, it is with a very heavy heart that we extend our deepest sympathies to those involved in today's tragic accident in Orlando.' The Exotic Driving Experience, along with its sibling track, the Richard Petty Driving Experience, was slated to close this summer at Disney World for unrelated reasons.","The Exotic Driving Experience park lets racing fans drive top-end cars .

"A babysitter broke down during her murder trial this week as she demonstrated the moment she claims a 14-month-old toddler died after his neck snapped. Michelle Heale of Tom's River, New Jersey claims she was trying to burp Mason Hess when he began choking on his applesauce, but when she pulled him off her shoulder his neck snapped backwards, killing the boy. The mother of twins, who were in the next room when the incident happened and then just three years old, was charged with murder and endangering the welfare of a child after a medical examiner determined the boy died as a result of homicide caused by blunt cerebral trauma. The prosecution has argued that Heale shook the child to death. Scroll down for video . Michelle Heale (above) breaks down during her trial for murder in the death of 14-month-old Mason Hess on Tuesday as she reenacts the moments before his neck allegedly snapped . She claims she was burping Mason Hess (above) when he began choking on his applesauce and that his neck snapped when she took him of her shoulder . Heale was babysitting Mason as she was a friend of the family (Mason's mother Kellie above) and her husband Michael and Mason's father Adam worked together as detectives . NJ.com reports that on Tuesday Heale, 46, reenacted the moment the baby boy died with a doll. She claims the young boy started coughing soon after she fed him some applesauce on August 28, 2012, and when his passageway did not seem to be getting clear, she immediately grabbed him to see if she could make him burp. 'I hit him hard on the back. I may have hit him harder than I should have,' Heale said through tears after demonstrating on the doll. 'I hit him about four or five times, and then I felt the applesauce come out. I felt it on my shoulder and I felt it on my shirt.' Thinking the crisis had been averted, she took Mason of her shoulder. 'As I brought him down, his head snapped back ... he was completely limp,' she said. 'His eyes were open, but he wasn't doing anything. ... Everything was flopping.' Mason would die on September 1 after being airlifted to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Courtesy of Asbury Park Press/APP.com . Heale (seen above crying on the stand Wednesday) is out on bail during the trial and still has custody of her twins, who were 3-years-old when the incident occurred . Medical examiners determined that Mason (above with his parents Kellie and Adam) died as a result of homicide caused by blunt cerebral trauma . Heale took the stand again on Wednesday, as she detailed her relationship with the Hess family, with her husband Michael and Mason's father Adam both employed as detectives at the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office. For this reason the trial was moved to another county. The Heale and Hess families, including Mason's mother Kellie, had been friends for years. Heale spent most of her day expressing her disbelief over the situation, first being told she had to leave Mason at the hospital as she was suspected of hurting him and then being charged with murder. 'I thought they were going to take my kids from me because I was told that I had hurt Mason,' Heale said. 'I thought that once they were made aware that I had my own kids that they were going to take them from me.' Heale, who is currently out on bail during the trial, was able to keep custody of her children. She told the jury at the end of the day; 'I would never hurt Mason or anybody.' Heale's murder charge carries a maximum sentence of lifetime in prison, and a minimum of 30 years in jail with a 30-year period of parole ineligibility.","Michelle Heale of Tom's River, New Jersey is on trial for murder in the death of 14-month-old Mason Hess .

"Q: I have been suffering from mouth ulcers for the past five months and feel I'm living on Bonjela and mouthwash. I get them all around my mouth and on my tongue. I've been referred to hospital but the appointment isn't for three months. Although I'm otherwise in good health, I'm quite worried. A: Mouth ulcers may seem like a minor ailment but can actually be incredibly distressing. The pain can severely impact on quality of life, as eating and drinking are significantly affected. As many as 20 per cent of people suffer with the occasional single mouth ulcer and these are of no consequence. They are usually shallow and occur on the tongue or inside the lip or cheek. These small painful ulcers usually last no more than ten days and require no treatment. Mouth ulcers may seem like a minor ailment but can actually be incredibly distressing. The pain can severely impact on quality of life, as eating and drinking are significantly affected . We have a rule in medicine that any single mouth ulcer lasting longer than three weeks should be investigated in order to rule out a cancer of the mouth, but this would usually be an isolated ulcer that does not heal, rather than multiple lesions. Multiple ongoing mouth ulcers are quite a different issue and certainly warrant further investigation. Initially it is worth taking blood tests to establish deficiencies of iron, B12 or folic acid that could be a root cause of significant tongue and mouth problems. It is equally important to consider multiple chronic mouth ulcers as a symptom of bowel disease, as both coeliac disease and Crohn's disease can first present as mouth ulcers. Coeliac can be identified on specific blood tests and Crohn's on a thorough history, examination and specialist opinion. A sudden-onset chronic issue in a previously healthy person does need proper assessment, and referral to a specialist certainly seems appropriate. While waiting to see a specialist, always make another GP appointment if something has changed or you feel that perhaps an important symptom has been missed. Q: Three years ago I had an operation to remove my prostate because of cancer. This seems to have been a success so far because my prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are zero. However, I now have a urine infection which has resisted five courses of antibiotics. At a recent hospital visit a registrar suggested that I drink at least three litres of water daily. I am not sure I'll manage this. What can I do? Surgery to remove the prostate for cancer can lead to urinary problems in about one in five cases, as well as erectile dysfunction for almost two-thirds of men. The former may manifest as incontinence or leakage of urine rather than recurrent infections. These are more likely when the bladder cannot empty properly, as urine is able to stagnate and bacteria can multiply. This typically occurs in men with an enlarged prostate, which puts pressure on the bladder, but would not seem likely if a prostate has been removed. A urologist's opinion would be warranted to assess whether a complication such as scar tissue could be preventing the bladder from emptying properly. After cancer, it is easy to assume all subsequent conditions are related. In fact, recurrent urine infections may be secondary to another urinary-system problem such as kidney stones or bladder disease, which need to be ruled out. It is unlikely that three litres of water a day will help. Brave Claudia deserves her Bafta nod . I was thrilled to see Claudia Winkleman nominated for a Bafta – she has breathed new life into Strictly. And what a lovely boost for her given the horrendous six months she's had after her eight-year-old daughter Matilda was hospitalised with burns following a freak Halloween accident. Whoever wins the British Academy gong, Claudia Winkleman's an absolute champ in my book . The scars from such injuries are physically and psychologically traumatic, and Claudia has remained fiercely private about her daughter's recovery. Good for her. Yet she has thrown her considerable celebrity status behind a St John Ambulance scheme for free lifesaving lessons for 50,000 children, echoing The Mail on Sunday's campaign to add first aid to the school curriculum. Whoever wins the British Academy gong, Claudia's an absolute champ in my book. Pop star Avril Lavigne set tongues wagging when she disappeared from the public eye for months. It has now been revealed that the 30-year-old singer had Lyme disease, a bacterial infection passed to humans from a tiny tick bite. Avril, who likened her illness to 'having the life sucked out of you', is thankfully on the road to recovery. The 'Complicated' singer had Lyme disease, a bacterial infection passed to humans from a tiny tick bite . Up to 3,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported in England and Wales every year. It sounds harmless enough but, if left untreated, it can cause joint pain and inflammation, facial nerve palsies and even inflammation of the heart. It is treatable with antibiotics, but diagnosis can be difficult as many don't realise they have been bitten. There is a story doing the rounds on science blogs at the moment warning those who buy breast milk via the internet that it's highly likely to be contaminated with either harmful bugs or cow's milk. Or both. I am not sure what is stranger: that people choose to buy breast milk or that the sellers are artificially topping it up. If women who can't produce enough of their own opt to source donor milk, it is only safe to do it from bona fide regulated milk banks or within hospitals that are verified safe sources. The worry for vulnerable babies is that donor milk obtained via sharing websites is infected or non-hygienic. I would have thought a random website is the last place a concerned mother should be buying her baby milk. It's good news on meningitis, despite a scare for my son . One evening last week my eight-year-old son started complaining that he had a headache. He told me the lights seemed too bright, and when I checked him, he was running quite a temperature. He said his legs were cold, too. I instantly recognised these to be red-flag symptoms of meningitis and rushed with him to our local A&E, where it was confirmed he had the viral form of the disease, which is thankfully less severe – but no less serious – than the bacterial kind. Once the dust had settled (he's absolutely fine now) I couldn't help thinking it was quite a coincidence: I wrote on these very pages just a few weeks ago about the worrying rise of a rarer form of the disease, Meningitis W. And all of this happened in the week that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt finally announced he will make the Meningitis B vaccine part of the routine UK vaccination schedule. Shame it wasn't sooner. But it's been good news all round, in the end. Do you have a question for Dr Ellie? Email DrEllie@mailonsunday.co.uk or write to Health, The Mail on Sunday, 2 Derry Street, London, W8 5TT.

"It has long been a complaint that all politicians are the same. Now the Green party has set it to music, with a new election advert featuring David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage forming a bizarre pro-austerity boyband. The video, complete with dry ice, glittering podiums and the obligatory key change, is designed to show that despite their claims to the contrary, the Tories, Lib Dems, Labour and Ukip are all singing the same tune on cuts, public services and immigration. The video begins with 'David Cameron' playing a white grand piano, with 'Ed Miliband' looking on . It sees Mr Cameron entering a polling booth and telling voters how 'a vote for me's the same as a vote for any of us guys' The advert is designed to show that despite their claims to the contrary, the Tories, Lib Dems, Labour and Ukip are all singing the same tune on cuts, public services and immigration . The song, Change The Tune, features comedians playing the four party leaders forming a boyband called Coalition. According to the Green party, the quartet 'sing in harmony about their shared love of austerity and fondness for fracking'. It sees Mr Cameron tell voters how 'a vote for me's the same as a vote for any of us guys'. The chorus includes the lyrics: 'It's sweeter when we all agree, a party political harmony. Lose your voting inhibitions. Join the one true coalition.' It also takes a swipe at the background of leading politicians, with the verse: 'The choice between us couldn't be clearer, Oxford! Cambridge! Diversity for ya, Whether it's Trident or High Speed Two, The lesser of four evils is up to you.' Notably the video, which last 3minutes, 40 seconds, does not feature Green leader Natalie Bennett at all. With the party leaders forming a boyband called Coalition, the video is complete with dry ice, glittering podiums and the obligatory key change . Dancing around a large pound sign, the four leaders are shown singing: 'Austerity! Austerity! Austerity!' Green party leader Natatlie Bennett said she wanted to show how the Establishment parties 'have been singing from the same hymn sheet' The chorus includes the lyrics: 'It's sweeter when we all agree, a party political harmony. Lose your voting inhibitions. Join the one true coalition' She has suffered a series of difficult media appearances in recent weeks, including claiming people who join ISIS should not be criminalised, struggling to make her housing sums add up and admitting it could take decades to implement her 'citizen's income'. Despite the gaffes, the Green party has enjoyed a sharp rise in popularity in the last year and now boasts more members than both the Lib Dems and Ukip. Unveiling the new advert, Ms Bennett said: 'For many years the Establishment parties have been singing from the same hymn sheet. 'The Westminster consensus – which sees all other parties sign up to austerity economics, privatisation of our public services and inaction on climate change – is coming to an end. The Green Party is offering a real alternative to business-as-usual politics. 'We want an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means bringing in a Living Wage of £10 an hour by 2020 and fair taxes on rich individuals and Britain's biggest corporations. 'Voting Green on May 7th is a chance for people to play their part in breaking open the political harmony of the Establishment parties.'","Advert sees party leaders form an unlikely boyband named Coalition .

"Nigel Farage suffered a fresh blow today after a poll of key marginal seats revealed voters were deserting Ukip in droves and returning to Labour and the Tories. In 10 battleground constituencies polled by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft, Ukip's vote has fallen in nine. Support for Mr Farage's party has more than halved in two seats and by more than a third in most of the others. Scroll down for video . In 10 battleground constituencies polled by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft, Ukip's vote has fallen in nine of them . Support for Mr Farage's party has more than halved in two seats and by more than a third in most of the others . The revelation comes after a leaked poll revealed Mr Farage is on course to lose his own Parliamentary election battle in Ukip's heartland in Kent. The Ukip leader has seen his support in Thanet South collapse from a 12 point lead over the Tories. He is now sitting in second place in the Kent constituency, 1 per cent below his Conservative rival Craig Mackinlay and only just ahead of Labour. Today's polling also mirrors nationwide polls which show that Ukip's support has fallen by 25 per cent in the last six months alone. In November last year 18 per cent of voters said they were planning to vote for Ukip – but this has since fallen to less than 12.5 per cent, with polling experts now predicting that it could drop below 10 per cent by next month. Ukip's dramatic collapse in support has not, however, led to a surge in support for the Tories. According to Lord Ashcroft's poll of 10 marginal constituencies today, the Tories are set to lose four seats to Labour but cling on in five. A tenth seat is too close to call between the two main Westminster parties. The four seats Labour are set to gain according to Lord Ashcroft are Harrow East, Hove, Morecambe & Linsdale and Stockton South. According to Lord Ashcroft's poll of 10 marginal constituencies today, the Tories are set to lose four seats to Labour but cling on to at least five . The results suggest Labour has strengthened its position since Lord Ashcroft polled the same constituencies last year, when the party was only picking up three seats from the Tories. The one seat which switched since last time is Harrow East in West London where a small Tory lead has turned a four-point advantage for Labour. But if the General Election was held tomorrow, the Tories would hold on to five of the 10 marginal seats it won in 2010 – Pendle, Blackpool North & Cleveleys, Loughborough, Kingswood and Gloucester. Comic Al Murray, also known as the Pub Landlord, arrived at Thanet District Council offices in Margate, Kent, today to hand in his nomination papers as he stands in the South Thanet seat against Ukip leader Nigel Farage . With the race in Thanet South going down to the wire, any votes the comic takes from  the main candidates could prove costly . Lord Ashcroft has one constituency – Pudsey – where Labour and the Tories are tied. But the real shift in the seats, according to the Tory peer's polling, is the huge squeeze on Ukip's vote. Lord Ashcroft said: 'The most notable movement across the board in this round of polling was a move towards the two main parties at the expense of UKIP. 'In this group of ten seats, the UKIP share had fallen significantly – by up to ten points – in nine of the ten seats polled. 'In only one seat did I find the lead had switched between parties – Harrow East, where a three-point Conservative lead in December had become a four-point lead for Labour.' The star of Ukip's latest election poster has admitted he is not sure he is even going to vote for the party. Tony Rutherford, 59, features on Nigel Farage's party's new poster highlighting the impact of EU laws on coastal communities. The poster, which was launched by the Ukip leader in Grimsby, reads: 'Gutted. Tony's business has been ripped apart by the EU.' Nigel Farage unveiled Ukip's latest campaign poster in support of the fishing industry during campaigning in Grimsby today . The party has vowed to 'reclaim our territorial fishing waters, restore our fishing fleet and introduce sustainable fishing practices', as well as withdrawing from the Common Fisheries Policy. Mr Rutherford, who started working full-time in the industry aged 15, is managing director of Bideford Fisheries in Bideford, north Devon. His business has been badly hit and the quota, which has been blamed for bringing the industry in north Devon to the brink of collapse when skate and ray fishing was halted in October. He praised the work of both Conservative and Ukip politicians locally in north Devon but said he had not decided who he would support on May 7 - wishing he had two votes. Mr Rutherford, a third generation fisherman, said: 'What has been done to UK waters is totally disgusting with the amount of fish that is taken by Europe.' Mr Rutherford insisted he was supportive of any politician who campaigned to 'get our waters back' - blaming the EU for the decline of his industry in the UK. He said: 'It's not political. I'd support any MP who agrees that we should have our UK waters back under our own control.' Mr Rutherford said he had not met Mr Farage but praised him as a 'normal working man', who likes a drink and a smoke. But he praised the work of Conservative candidate Geoffrey Cox, who is standing for re-election in Torridge and West Devon. He said: 'The local people for Ukip and the Conservatives have done so much for the fishing industry. It's a pity I don't have two votes. It will be a very tough choice.'","Ukip's support has fallen in nine out of 10 marginal seats, poll shows .

"Iran has forbidden its citizens from travelling to Saudia Arabia's holy sites over claims two teenaged boys were abused by Saudi airport officials while returning from a pilgrimage. Iranian officials made the decision following claims two of its citizens were abused while returning from an off-season pilgrimage at Jeddah airport in March. The announcement comes amid escalating tensions between the two regional powers, particularly over Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen. Iranian protesters demonstrate against Saudi-led strikes in Yemen outside the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Tehran . Muslims undertaking the umrah in Mecca - the pilgrimage which is not obligatory in Islam can be taken at any time during the year . Sunni Saudi Arabia has led the bombing campaign against Yemeni Shiite rebels, the Houthis, much to the anger of Iran. Iran, a Shiite nation, is backing the rebel group. Iran's Foreign Ministry has said the two boys, aged 14 and 15, were abused by airport security after they were separated from other passengers for body searches, Russia Today reported. Iraninan Culture Ministry spokesman Hossein Nooshabadi told the state TV that the pilgrimage would be suspended until the Saudi government 'applies a strong attitude' to the case. He also said 'capital punishment' should apply to the case, without offering further details. The alleged abuse, the details of which have not been publicly disclosed, sparked unauthorized protests at the Saudi Embassy in Tehran on Saturday. Public anger has grown over the incident, with President Hassan Rouhani ordering an investigation and Iran's Foreign Ministry summoning a Saudi diplomat for an explanation. However there has been confusion over what exactly happened. Yesterday, a representative of Iran's top leader on pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia downplayed the case, saying the pilgrims weren't abused. 'In the incident, no abuse has happened and the two policemen who attempted abuse were identified and detained by Saudi police,' Ali Ghaziasgar was quoted as saying. Iranians burn Israeli and US flags: The shiite nation opposes Saudi Arabia's alliance with the United States . The alleged abuse to the two teenagers comes amid increasing tensions between the two regional powers . Some 500,000 Iranians visit Saudi Arabia each year for the off-season umrah pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, Islam's holiest sites. The umrah differs from the annual Muslim hajj pilgrimage as it can be undertaken at any time of the year. Saudi officials haven't commented publicly on the dispute. Earlier this month, aviation authorities in the kingdom turned away an Iranian plane carrying pilgrims, saying it did not have permission to use the country's airspace, Saudi state media reported. On Monday hundreds of students staged a demonstration against the Saudi government outside its embassy in Tehran . On Monday, hundreds of students staged another demonstration in front of the Saudi embassy in Tehran, protesting the air strike campaign in Yemen. Relations between Shiite Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia are hostile at the best of times. Iran has insisted in the past that its pilgrims be allowed to hold 'disavowal of infidels' ceremonies — rallies denouncing Israel and Saudi ally the United States - when on pilgrimages. Saudi Arabia bans such demonstrations at hajj and in 1987, one such rally led to clashes with Saudi security forces in which more than 400 pilgrims, mostly Iranians, were killed. Iran prevented pilgrims from attending hajj for three years after the killings.

"The New Zealand family of fourteen who last month walked out of a remote Christian commune that shuns the outside world are adjusting well to life in the wider community, a relative said, with the father accepting a farm job and the family moving into a home with modern appliances. James and Hope Ben Canaan last month declared they were living in a 'false system' and left the Gloriavale Christian Community, located at Lake Haupiri on New Zealand's West Coast, with their twelve children and few worldly possessions. Founded by the Australian-born evangelical preacher Neville Cooper - now known by the name Hopeful Christian - Gloriavale is home to around 500 residents, sometimes known as Cooperites, who wear a plain, blue uniform and reject birth control. Scroll down for video . Free: The Ben Canaan family (picture supplied) have left behind Gloriavale for the outside world. Many family are pictured here in traditional Gloriavale uniforms, although they are now allowed to wear 'modest' clothing . Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament and reject the outside world . The Ben Canaans fled some 300km south to the town of Timaru, where supporters from the Marchwiel Reformed Baptist Church community have helped them adapt to a world where Christmas and birthdays are celebrated and money is used to purchase goods and services. '(They're doing) really, really good,' said Mr Ben Canaan's aunt, Miracle, who herself fled the picturesque commune with her husband and ten children around six years ago. 'They are adapting very well. They've got a job and everything. They've had a lot of support.' The family left Gloriavale, which is located at Lake Haupiri on the west coast of the South Island, for Timaru, around 320km away . Gloriavale residents do not hold celebrations for birthday parties or Christmas . Miracle, the daughter of Neville Cooper (pictured speaking in a previous interview with New Zealand television) said the Ben Canaan family are adapting very well . The Ben Canaans' close supporters have closed ranks around the family, who last month thanked the community for their support and requested privacy in order to 'settle into our new lives' in Timaru. Sources familiar with Gloriavale, such as Miracle - one of Neville Cooper's ten children - discussed the challenges of adjusting to life outside the commune in general terms to Daily Mail Australia. 'There's just a complete struggle in the outside world,' she said, adding that she had 'nothing' when she left but 'managed to get away' from the community 'without too much drama'. 'It's totally different to what you've lived before. 'You know nothing of just normal, everyday stuff - like renting a home, insurance, any of those types of things. 'Often people don't have their birth certificates or bank accounts. They don't even know how to spend money, how to buy things. 'There's birthday parties, Christmas - none of that was practised in the community... It's huge, adapting (to all of that).' The Ben Canaans will now be able to readily access personal technology, like mobile phones and have a television which they can watch without restrictions. Neville Cooper - now known by the name Hopeful Christian - is the Australian evangelist who founded the Gloriavale commune after clashing with church leaders in New Zealand and Australia. In 1995, he spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges . Former Gloriavale residents tend to find it difficult to adapt from the outside world, a former resident told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's totally different to what you've lived before' The Ben Canaans no longer have to wear their Gloriavale 'uniform'. Instead, Miracle said they will now wear 'modest clothes'. The women in the family will also have to adjust to a world where make-up is worn regularly. Author Fleur Beale, who wrote the book Sins of The Father about the 1989 escape of Neville Cooper's son, Phil, and his family from the commune, said the biggest challenge the Ben Canaans would have would be financial, particularly given their 12 children. 'You can imagine what it's like trying to find a place to live with a family like that,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Gloriavale residents are often dubbed 'Cooperites'. Pictured is a Gloriavale wedding . The happy couple kiss as they are led from their wedding ceremony . 'You haven't been used to handling money or buying in a shop. And what do you wear?' The details of the Ben Canaans' departure from Gloriavale remain unclear. Miracle said the community was not surrounded with large walls, but: 'There are different types of walls... 'Psychological walls as well as physical barriers, but no access to telephones and long driveways to be able to leave.' A spokesman for the commune, Fervant Steadfast, told the New Zealand Herald last month the family had been permitted to depart. 'If they want to go and live in Timaru, well, that's their choice and that's what they need to do. 'No one is here against their will. We only want people who want to be here.' Nestled on the banks of the picturesque Lake Haipuri on New Zealand's rugged West Coast, Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament. The community, which isolates itself from the outside world, was founded by Neville Cooper, a Australian evangelist. Cooper moved across the Tasman in 1969 with his wife, Gloria, and their ten children to found a Christian community. As its membership swelled, in 1991 they purchased land by the scenic lake to live off. Mr Cooper - a controversial figure who spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges in 1995 - would later change his name to 'Hopeful Christian'. Fleur Beale, the author of the Gloriavale book Sins of the Father, said the most striking thing about Gloriavale was the 'control those in power' - a group of elders - 'had over the ordinary people.' 'The women, particularly - it would be miserable to be a woman in Gloriavale,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Birth control is non-existent. 'God wants you to get married and have as many children as you can. That's why they have big families.' Residents are required to wear a uniform. Women generally frock up in long, blue dresses - 'every single day', a former resident named Miracle told Daily Mail Australia. Meanwhile, men wear neckties, dark blue pants and a light blue sleeved shirt. And while the personal use of technologies such as television and mobile phones is rare among 'ordinary people', Ms Beale said the community was 'very innovative', with extensive commercial operations. Residents do not take any wages, but work hard for the community's dairy and deer farms. The community consists of more than 80 families, according to Gloriavale's official website, and they live together in large, communal hostels.","A New Zealand family of fourteen walked out of remote Christian sect .

"A German pensioner who is expecting quadruplets said she went in search of sperm and egg donors when her youngest of 13 children told her: 'I want to have a little brother or sister.' Annegret Raunigk, 65, was plunged into a vortex of travel and trials thanks to the wish of daughter Leila, who turns ten this year, but says she is not bothered about what people say about her decision to have more children so late in life. Their scheduled births for the schoolteacher from Spandau, Berlin, is just weeks away - but there are major fears that the health risks for her unborn quads will spike massively if they are induced early. Babies on the way: Annegret Raunigk, 65, and her nine-year-old daughter Leila are seen during a recent ultrasound filmed for an upcoming documentary about how the teacher is preparing to welcome the quads . Annegret, meanwhile, is weathering the debate centred on the rights or wrongs of her decision to both become pregnant and raise the children with cool detachment. 'There will obviously be cliches bandied about,' she said, 'and I find that quite strenuous. But I have always been a person who says live and let live and it is not for the opinion of others but for me. 'I have enough experience of childbirth not to be afraid. I am not scared actually, I am just hoping to stay healthy and fit. If others are mega-prim about this I believe they have no interesting lives themselves and therefore it no longer bothers me. I think this is the right choice.' 'She is a very strong, very fit woman,' Her doctor, Kai Hertwig tells MailOnline. 'I hope she can come to full term, I think she can. She is very well placed to be a fit mother for these babies. The schoolteacher from Spandau, Berlin, is set to become the world's oldest woman to give birth to quads . Ms Raunigk and her large brood are seen during an appearance on German television in 2005 . 'The pregnancy so far makes no distinction between the body of a younger or older person but quadruplet pregnancies are always a high burden. 'We of course are keeping a close watch on the cardiovascular system. We all have little or no experience with such a pregnant woman in this age group, but I can say that this is certainly going very well.' Thrombosis, her heart, her circulatory system - these are the areas causing concern for the unborns in the run-up to delivery day. 'But she is highly motivated and this positive psychological mood is optimally important, the rest is not in our hands,' added her gynaecologist. Both were speaking in a clip released by the RTL TV network which is airing her story on Monday night. One woman who had a child at 42 tells the programme: 'I met her and found her to be a very sympathetic and intelligent woman. 'As a 56-year-old woman who raised a just-pubescent son, it is hard to imagine why she would want to have quads. I also wonder how she can meet the needs of her growing children, especially as the children will have no father.' It was mentioned in the publicity clip released by RTL that her fertility treatment - including both donated eggs and donated sperm - would never have been greenlighted in Germany. Two countries where treatment for women of such an advanced age is allowed were stated as Ukraine and America. All her 13 children, ranging from Leila to a daughter of 44, were sired by five different fathers.","German primary school teacher is in 21st week of pregnancy and 'feels fit'

"Secretary of State John Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they didn't and get away with it, says the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain. 'I think John Kerry tried to come back and sell a bill of goods, hoping maybe that the Iranians wouldn’t say much about it,' the Republican lawmaker told radio host Hugh Hewitt during his Thursday program. McCain, responding to the supreme leader of Iran's proclamation yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is 'instant,' said he had 'sympathy' for Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because Kerry 'must have known' what the perimeters were for a long-term accord 'and yet chose to interpret it in another way.' Launching a rare attack from his official White House Twitter account, President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest in turn said it was 'naïve and reckless' for McCain 'to believe every word of the Supreme Leader's political speech.' 'He shouldn't,' Earnest added. And the president's deputy national security adviser told reporters traveling with the administration abroad that it's 'very clear and understood that sanctions relief will be phased.' Secretary of State John Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they didn't and get away with it, says the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain . Kerry, is flanked here by President Barack Obama and National Security Adviser Susan Rice at the bilateral meeting between President Obama and Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela today in Panama City, Panama. The Obama administration is in Panama to attend the VII Summit of the Americas . 'The fact of the matter is, we have framework,' Rhodes said, according to the Associate Press. 'The president has said if the details don't bear out, we won't have a deal.' Obama, Kerry, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and other members of the president's kitchen cabinet are in Panama for the Summit of the Americas. Backed into a corner by reporters, the White House on Monday indicated that negotiators left Switzerland last week without coming to an agreement about the pace at which sanctions would be removed. The administration had stated in a fact sheet that nuclear-related sanctions would be 'suspended' if Iran complied with the terms of the deal. The president said in a live statement they would be 'phased' out over time. The framework, however, he said would remain in place so sanctions could be snapped back into place if need be. Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, immediately cast a cloud over the United State's assertions, pointing out that the statement released by the United States' negotiating partners made no reference to either the gradual lifting of sanctions. Zarif indicated that his country was under the interpretation was that sanctions would be 'terminated.' Asked the next day about Zarif's claims, the lead spokeswoman for the State Department shrugged them off and said she wasn't too concerned with how Iranian leaders sold the deal in their own country. Barraged with questions at his Monday briefing about who was lying - the U.S. or Iran - White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest suggested that the timing of sanctions relief remained a topic of discussion - a major revelation given the dispute's potential for derailing a written agreement. Khamenei reaffirmed on Thursday his country's vow not to sign an agreement unless negotiators kowtow to Iran's demands and promise the 'instant annulment of all sanction,' according to a translation. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani similarly said, 'We will not sign any agreement, unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal.' Khamenei further stated Iran would not allow an 'unconventional inspection or monitoring.' 'Foreign monitoring on #Iran's security isn’t allowed,' he said on Twitter. Speaking to reporters in Panama today, Rhodes also dismissed Iranian officials' rhetoric about the agreement as spin. 'They have their own hardliners who are skeptical of this deal,' he said. 'The test of whether or not that framework can be memorialized is not a comment on any given day by an Iranian leader, the test will be if by the end of June we have a document.' Responding to the supreme leader of Iran's announcement yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is 'instant,' McCain, above, said he had 'sympathy' for Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because Kerry 'must have known' what the perimeters were for a long-term accord 'and yet chose to interpret it in another way' McCain ripped into former colleague Kerry on Hewitt's radio show for mischaracterizing preliminary talks with Iran. 'It’s probably in black and white that the Ayatollah is probably right,' McCain said. 'John Kerry is delusional.' Continuing, the Arizona senator said, 'I think you’re going to find out that they had never agreed to the things that John Kerry claimed that they had.' 'So in a way, I can’t blame the Ayatollah, because I don’t think they ever agreed to it.' Republican Senator Mark Kirk on Thursday said, 'It’s increasingly clear that Iran, in fact, failed to reach agreement with the United States and its partners on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement. 'At best, Iran agreed to disagree with the United States on key nuclear weapons-related issues and to continue talks,' the Illinois lawmaker said. McCain told Hewitt Kerry's behavior 'reveals that a number of things' about his 'negotiating capabilities and also his candor with the American people.' He also said he believes Senate Republicans are 'extremely close' to winning enough Democrats' support to push through a veto-proof bill giving Congress the power to review the formal deal with Iran that is scheduled to materialize by June 30. Khamenei further stated that Iran would not allow an 'unconventional inspection or monitoring' Even with out that legislation, McCain claimed that the Senate has the Constitutional authority to reject an accord because it is technically treaty. Obama should 'read the Constitution of the United States,' McCain said. This is clearly a treaty.' And even if the president 'disregards the Constitution' McCain said - 'which he certainly did with executive orders concerning immigration' - Congress should have a say in an issue of this scale. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the Armed Services Committee who is exploring a presidential run, said in a statement Friday afternoon that 'the Ayatollah and President Obama appear to be talking about two separate agreements. 'Unfortunately, I can’t say I’m surprised,' he added. 'President Obama wants a deal way too badly, and his Administration has been trying to sell a deal which may not actually exist.' Graham said the Obama administration should tell Iran 'in no uncertain terms – that should we come to an actual agreement between both parties, sanctions relief will not be immediate.' 'Any realistic agreement must preclude sanctions relief from being granted until Iran proves it has ended its military nuclear program.' Drawing on Khamenei's comment about supervision, Graham said he would 'never' lend his support to a deal that doesn't allow for inspections 'anytime and anywhere.' With 'Iran’s history of cheating,' he said, 'it would be incredibly dangerous not to require Iran to abide by an ‘anytime-anywhere’ inspections regime.'","Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions when they didn't and get away with it, he said .

"Rajul Patel (pictured) has been jailed for stealing £30,000 worth of jewellery and valuables from members of gyms across London . A serial thief who stole £30,000 worth of irreplaceable Rolex watches, jewellery and iPhones from wealthy gym members has today been jailed for 32 months. Rajul Patel, 35, targeted wealthy victims as they worked out at Virgin Active health clubs across London after obtaining memberships using the stolen driving licence of a gym-going doctor. In one spree, Patel stole a man's platinum wedding ring, first-year anniversary ring, and a 40th birthday bracelet, Isleworth Crown Court was told. He was finally stopped when another gym member spotted him returning to the changing room lockers just five minutes after beginning his workout. When challenged about the items he was removing, he replied: 'Do you not trust me?' Patel tried to escape arrest by running from the gym into a nearby shop but was discovered hiding behind a clothes rack. Prosecutor Paul Casey said a conservative estimate of the goods stolen during the two-month spree, not taking into account the items unreturned, was 'between £25,000-£30,000.' Mr Casey told the court: 'The facts of these burglaries begin with the identity documents of a Doctor Ritesh Sharma being stolen from his gym that he attended on the 12th of September 2014. 'There followed a number of thefts with Dr Sharma's identity being used by this defendant. 'It seems they bore a physical resemblance and he was able to use that photo identity before he was eventually apprehended on the 8th of November. 'On that date he attended the Kensington Active gym using Dr Sharma's identity. 'It was shown to staff and he was told he would need to pay an additional £25, as this particular branch was a premiere gym.' Mr Casey told the court that Dr Sharma almost came under police suspicion in relation to the thefts - such was the use of his identity cards. Patel took a Samsung Galaxy mobile phone worth £200 and a pair of Bose headphones, also worth £200, belonging to Peter Culak, at Virgin Active in Wimbledon on September 13. At the Clapham branch Patel grabbed a brand-new iPhone six worth £600, a £1,500 ring, a Rolex Oyster watch worth £2,500, a £150 designer purse, three credit cards and £910 in cash belonging to Oliver Budworth. Indian-born Patel stole Horace Treviss's Cartier watch worth £6,000, his £1,200 Cartier ring and a second ring by Bvlgari worth £1,300, as well as £50 cash when he was working out at the chain's Wandsworth gym on October 24. Patel targeted the Virgin Active in Notting Hill on November 4, taking Nicholas Little's £500 iPhone as well as £50 cash. Hours later he went to the Mayfair branch, taking Robby Surya's £2,000 bag containing a £500 iPhone, and £8,000 Rolex watch, a £100 jacket, a driving licence and three credit cards. Patel struck again, shortly before he was arrested on November 8 when he raided the changing rooms at the Virgin Active Gym, in Old Court Place, Kensington. He took a £10,000 Rolex, a £500 Samsung mobile phone, an iPhone worth £600 and a Dunhill wallet worth £200 belonging to Ivan Pavlov. Mr Pavlov also lost two credit cards, a £600 necklace as well as £50 cash. One of Patel's victims, Simon Parkinson, sat in court during sentence, explaining that he had suffered from depression and was forced to take time off of work after the 'sentimental' and 'irreplaceable' items were stolen. These included a phone, which stored pictures of the first year of his daughter's life. Patel also took his platinum wedding ring which he had saved for several years, a wedding anniversary ring, and a 40th birthday silver bracelet. Sentencing Patel, Judge Molyneux said: 'Between September and November 2014 you stole a gym membership card and a driving licence belonging to Dr Ritesh Sharma, and you carried out eight burglaries. In one instance, Patel stole a man's platinum wedding ring, first-year anniversary ring, and a 40th birthday bracelet, Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) heard . 'Whatever were the precise circumstances you have pleaded guilty to the theft of the cards. 'You resembled him and decided to use his card to enter gyms across London where you stole from lockers. 'The goods that were stolen were of a high value, in monetary terms between £25,000 and £30,000. 'But far more importantly they were of a high sentimental and emotional value to those who they belonged. 'It must have been clear to you that this was the case - one of those items was a wedding ring which was invaluable to the owner.' Judge Molyneux said the thefts had had 'lasting consequences' on Mr Parkinson. 'These offences were planned and organised, and took place over a period of months,' she continued. 'Whether this began opportunistically is to some extent irrelevant.' The court heard depression, gambling addiction, and the collapse of his business lay at the root of Patel's offending. Patel, a married father-of-one whose parents came to the UK from Tanzania, had spiraling debts to finance companies, credit card companies, and his relatives. He has a degree in computing and is a middle child, with siblings enjoying successful careers in medicine. The court was told Patel had brought 'shame' upon his family, and since his arrest had been working as a Dominos pizza delivery man. Patel, of Kingston-Upon-Thames, admitted eight counts of burglary and one of theft. Three others counts of burglary were left to lie on file.","Rajul Patel stole £30,000 worth of valuables from London gym members .

"When a young mum posted images of her post-pregnancy body on Instagram to inspire others, she might have anticipated a raft of supportive comments for her bravery. Hannah Moore, 20, from Broxburn in West Lothian, didn't get that far though; her images of the stretchmarks on her tummy were vetoed by the world's biggest photo-sharing website within minutes of her posting them. The mum-of-twins claims her account was deleted because the images were deemed to contain inappropriate 'nudity and violence' which breach the site's decency guidelines. Scroll down for video . Confidence shattered: Hannah Moore, who had shots of her stretchmarked stomach removed 'within two minutes' of posting them on photo-sharing site Instagram, said the rebuttal had taken her confidence away . Body pride: Hannah Moore, 20, of Broxburn in West Lothian, shared photos of her post-childbirth body. She gave birth to twin girls Lily and Grace (pictured above with fiance David Johnstone, 22) in June last year . Hannah suffered from stretch marks after giving birth to twin girls Lily and Grace with fiance David Johnstone, 22, in June last year. Moore said: 'Nobody could get on my Instagram and nobody could search for it so someone had obviously reported the picture for nudity - all it was was a picture of my belly and it has just took my confidence away.' It's yet another example of Instagram coming under fire for refusing to publish certain images, particularly photos that are dedicated to showing the female form in its most honest state. Shots of menstrual blood, stretchmarks following childbirth, pubic hair and naked breasts have all felt the wrath of the site's censors. Critics have also highlighted that plenty of images that many might find offensive such as users bragging about extreme wealth while poking fun at the poor or pro-guns graffiti often get the green light for publication. Just last week, Instagram, which boasts 300 million monthly users, announced that it has toughened up its rules on the types of pictures users can post in a bid to cut down on pornography and harassment. Samm Newman received an apology from Instagram for removing these images of her in her underwear. The 19-year-old had posted the shot to celebrate her curves...but later found they had been removed . Megan Tonje saw a picture of her bottom - covered by sizeable black pants - banned for contravening Instagram's rules, even though she posted it in a spirit of body confidence with the hashtags #honormycurves and #effyourbeautystandards . The overhaul of Instagram's community guidelines is the biggest since Facebook bought the app three years ago for $1 billion. Although it has banned 'close-ups of fully nude buttocks', it remains perfectly fine to post a shot of a woman's rear if she is wearing underwear. A spokesman for the site said: 'We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. One rule for one: Images such as the shot above, taken from the picture stream of American social media star Dan Bilzerian, appear liberally on the site . Star support: Willow Smith joined the campaign to use images of bare breasts by tweeting this picture on her @officialWillow Twitter page last year . The #freethenipple campaign saw a host of web users staging their protests against what they perceived as sexism by Instagram . 'This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. 'It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. 'Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.' However, the boundaries laid out above seem to contradict the image posted by many. When singer-songwriter Meghan Tonje published an image of her bottom in underwear in May 2014, she was dismayed to find it promptly removed for being deemed as 'mature' content. Tonje says you don't need to wander very far on Instagram to find images of photos of other women in a similar pose, which have all been published by the site, leading to accusations that she was discriminated against because she was bigger than some of the bikini models who feature. Elsewhere, earlier this year, an Australian media agency Sticks and Stones claimed the site had removed one of its images which showed two women wearing bikinis and showing some pubic hair. Sticks and Stones said the photo-sharing site had 'censored' their image and argued that it was a sexist move and it would not have happened had the shot been a picture of two men. Ainsley Hutchence, the agency's director, said at the time: 'Unfortunately Instagram has ruled out natural hair that appears on all bodies of women that don't trim their bikini lines. 'This hair occasionally does spill out of the sides of swimwear as it does on men in their underwear. But Instagram seem to be ok with man pubes.' He added: 'Clearly this is absolutely sexist. Instagram believes that women should wax or get off their platform.' This shot, published by Australian media agency Sticks and Stones, was banned by Instagram for showing public hair. The agency said it though the image would have been published if it had shown two men . When photographer Rupi Kaur published a photo of a woman lying fully clothed on a bed with menstrual blood between her legs, the site removed it twice, saying that Kaur wasn't following 'community guidelines'.Instagram eventually apologised. Other high profile bans include a protest by Scout Willis (daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore) who saw a photo of a jumper with two bare-breasted women on it removed from the site. Willis said at the time: 'Women are regularly kicked off Instagram for posting photos with any portion of the areola exposed. 'While photos sans nipple – degrading as they might be – remain unchallenged.' Such 'unchallenged' images might include the profile of US poker player Dan Bilzerian, who regularly posts near pornographic images of women alongside misogynistic language. His posts include a woman dressed in provocative school uniform-type dress but with her shirt tied beneath her breasts and  only pink tape covering her nipples. In other shots, scantily clad women cavort together or thrust their cleavage into the camera. After pressure from critics, the world's most popular photo-sharing website has been forced to clarify how it treats certain images. Last week, Instagram said it was making clearer what exactly is allowed. 'We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. Fans were not happy when Michael Buble shared this Instagram photo from his Miami holiday accompanying it with hashtags that included the words '#myhumps #babygotback #hungryshorts' Despite stipulating that close-ups of 'fully nude buttocks' are banned on the service, Kendall Jenner posted a side-on view of her posterior without complaints . 'This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. 'It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. 'Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.' Its censoring filter may have received attention but as our images  show, there are plenty of photos that might cause offense that have made it through: . When global music star Michael Bublé posed in front of a female in Miami last week to deliberately highlight her bottom, the image was promptly published to his million-strong following on Instagram. The photo, which the singer tagged with the words '#myhumps #babygotback #hungryshorts #onlyinmiami', shows a close shot of Bublé in the foreground  while the rear of a female shopper was clearly in view. In spite of a public apology and wide criticism, the image remains on Bublé's site. Such 'unchallenged' images might include the photostream of US poker player Dan Bilzerian, who regularly posts images of scantily clad women. Many Instagram users will be baffled as to why an  image depicting a woman who is practically topless, as her shirt is tied beneath her bust, has been allowed to stay on the site. Bar two bits of tape on her nipples, the woman's breasts are entirely bare, yet it falls within the rules, essentially on a technicality thanks to the strategically placed tape. Kendall Jenner, meanwhile, posted a provocative that depicts the side of her entirely naked bottom, with a car balanced on the top of one cheek, yet despite the stipulation regarding 'close ups of fully-nude buttocks', the shot has been deemed acceptable. Hypocritical? Instagram says it doesn't allow nudity on the site, yet enables shots such as the above to appear on the page of US poker player Dan Bilzerian . Only words, say Instagram...this image promoting the use of guns was published by user andygotphotos . Beyond the pale? A young user came under fire for describing her father as her 'man crush Monday' every day. This inappropriate post was then compounded by her hashtags that reveal she's at her great grandmother's funeral. Despite ongoing bloodshed in Syria, positive messages and pictures of the country's president, Bashar al-Assad, are regularly uploaded to the site, with no objections from Instagram .","Young mum Hannah Moore, 20, had shots of her stretchmarks taken down .

"This a carer partying with friends and kissing her boyfriend in the hours after taking cash from two frail pensioners she stole £5,000 from. Rebecca Calder, 24, who was jailed for a year today, went out drinking on the same night she used her victims' bank card to withdraw large amounts of money. At her peak she was draining up to £300 a day from her disabled victims' accounts, spending it on nights out and items such as shoes. Sentenced: Rebecca Calder, 24, who was jailed for a year today, went out drinking on the same night she used her victims' bank cards to withdraw large amounts of cash, pictured left and right . Calder posted regular partying pictures of Facebook not knowing the family of the victims, a couple in their late 80s who have now died, had installed a spy camera and filmed her taking cash. Officers discovered Calder had stolen more than £5,000 from the savings of the elderly couple who suffered from mental and physical disabilities. Today Calder, of Greater Manchester, was jailed for 12 months after she pleaded guilty to nine counts of theft. Liverpool Crown Court was told she had previously been employed by a company called Makerfield Care - who are no longer in business - as a carer although she was not part of the team who looked after the couple at their home in Warrington. Caught: The victims' family saw money coming from their accounts so set up a camera and filmed her taking money . Police said the victims both suffered from a number of physical and mental impairments due to their ages, with very poor memories and were largely confined to their home. Calder lost her job with the care firm but carried on visiting the house regularly on an unofficial basis having befriended the couple. The thefts came to light when the couple's two daughters became concerned when she noticed on her parent's bank statements that large amounts of cash, in £100, £200 and £300 amounts, were being withdrawn from cashpoints almost every other day. One of those withdrawals was made from an ATM in Ashton-in-Makerfield at about 2am on April 13 2014, which could clearly not have been either of the victims. The couple's daughters also found huge amounts had been withdrawn from their father's savings account. The daughters installed a covert CCTV camera at the house and caught Calder red-handed as she stole cash from the elderly man's wallet. The daughters continued their investigation and managed to identify Calder through her Facebook profile, which also showed her wearing the same clothes as when she stole the money. The police were then called. After her sentencing today PC Ryan Mackenzie said: 'Calder's actions were utterly reprehensible. Whatever motivated her, there can be no excuse or justification for stealing more than £5,000 from an elderly and frail couple whom she was supposed to care for and look after. Evidence: The family watched her Facebook account and matched clothing she wore in pictures to clothing she wore while withdrawing cash . 'It is a heinous and appalling crime, made all the more galling by the audacity to post something on Facebook of her enjoying a night out using cash stolen just hours earlier from an unsuspecting and trusting couple. The fact that when the money was stolen she was not even employed as a carer but pretended to be a caring friend just compounds her despicable actions. 'And one of the saddest parts of this case is that both the man and his wife passed away before they could see justice being done. 'I would like to pay tribute to the tenacity and determination shown by the couple's daughters. Once they suspected something was amiss, they carried out their own investigation and caught Calder red-handed on secret cameras. 'The evidence against Calder was therefore overwhelming and no doubt helped to expose her criminality, so I would like to praise the couple's daughters for doing what this so-called carer should have done and that is protecting a frail, vulnerable couple. 'I hope this case serves as a stark warning to anyone who is put in a position of trust, like Calder was, to look after elderly and vulnerable people. 'Temptation will clearly be there but do you really want to be known as someone who stole from elderly people? Not only will you have that stigma for the rest of your life, but you could also be facing a long prison sentence.'","Rebecca Calder posted pictures on Facebook of nights out funded by theft .

"The Pentagon said Tuesday it would exhume and try to identify the remains of nearly 400 sailors and Marines killed when the USS Oklahoma sank in the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The ship capsized after being hit by nine torpedoes during the December 7, 1941 surprise attack from Japanese forces. Altogether, 429 sailors and Marines onboard were killed. Only 35 were identified in the years immediately after. Hundreds were buried as unknowns at cemeteries in Hawaii. In 1950, they were reburied as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific - also known as the Punchbowl - inside a volcanic crater in Honolulu. Scroll down for video . Casualties: The Pentagon announced Tuesday plans to exhume the bodies of some 400 sailors and Marines who were killed on the USS Oklahoma on December 7, 1941, in the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor. Above, the ship seen capsized after the attack . Resting place: The sailors and Marines who died on board the USS Oklahoma are currently buried as unknowns in Honolulu's National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific . Nameless: Above, a gravestone at Honolulu's National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, marking the resting place of seven unknown Americans who died on board the USS Oklahoma . The military is acting now, nearly 75 years after the men died, because advances in forensic science and technology as well as genealogical help from family members have made it possible to identify more remains, said Lt. Col. Melinda Morgan, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency spokeswoman. The move is apparently a part of a new Pentagon policy on disinterring the remains of unknown troops. According to the new policy, bodies may be exhumed from Punchbowl or any other permanent American military cemeteries - but they can not be removed from any U.S. Navy vessel that is being used as a national memorial, like the USS Arizona which remains sunk and on display in Honolulu. The bodies of Marines and sailors lost at sea do not apply to this new effort. In order to disinter these large groups, researchers must also prove that they can identify at least 60 per cent of the group with supplied family DNA samples, medical and dental records. 'The secretary of defense and I will work tirelessly to ensure your loved one's remains will be recovered, identified, and returned to you as expeditiously as possible, and we will do so with dignity, respect and care,' Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work said in a statement. 'While not all families will receive an individual identification, we will strive to provide resolution to as many families as possible.' Officials plan to begin the work in three to six weeks, Morgan said. They aim to identify the remains of up to 388 servicemen within five years. In 2003, the military disinterred one casket at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific based on information provided by Ray Emory, a Pearl Harbor survivor who has spent years doggedly scouring documents. Loss of life: The USS Oklahoma was hit with nine torpedoes in the assault, which caused the boat to tip over and capsize - trapping many inside . Revenge: The Oklahoma pictured above before the attack. Overall, more than 2,000 Americans died in the surprise attack on December 7, 1941 which sparked the entrance of the U.S. into World War II . Watery grave: The capsized deck of the Oklahoma is seen on May 24, 1943  - two and a half years after the attack . Rescue: After the ship capsized, survivors worked hard in an attempt to rescue some of those trapped inside . Many remains were comingled when buried, and the military was able to identify five servicemen from that casket. But the coffin also contained the remains of up to 100 others who haven't been identified. 'It's something I looked forward to for a long time,' Emory told CNN about Tuesday's news. The Pentagon started notifying families on Tuesday about the plans to disinter and identify the bodies. If a body is identified, the family will be notified and the sailor or Marine's remains returned to them for a full military burial. Bob valley of Escanaba, Michigan was one of the first to hear about the plans. Escanaba told the Honolulu Star Advertiser that he received a call from the Navy Casualty Office, about his brother Lowell who died at the age of 19 on board the Oklahoma. Lowell worked in the boiler room on the port side of the ship, which was hit by Japanese torpedos. The onslaught caused the ship to roll over and capsize - trapping much of the crew inside. 'I can hardly talk,' Valley, 82, said of receiving the call. 'Families want some kind of closure.' Valley says his parents received a telegram right before Christmas 1941, saying Lowell was missing, and then another two months later saying he had died. 'And that's all they ever got. They never got any information about Punchbowl cemetery. They never heard of a Punchbowl cemetery,' Valley said. Valley said his parents tried hard to get information on where their son was buried, even seeking the help of a local congressmen. If identified, Valley says he already has a burial plot ready for his brother.","The Pentagon announced Tuesday plans to identify the remains of hundreds of sailors and soldiers killed on board the USS Oklahoma .

"A birthday gift for 24-year-old man at a Florida speedway ended in tragedy when he plowed the $220,000 Lamborghini he was driving into a guardrail, killing his 36-year-old passenger. Tavon Watson was taking racing advice from instructor Gary Terry on Sunday when he lost control of the Italian supercar at the Exotic Driving Experience at Walt Disney World in Florida. Father-of-one Terry died at the scene while Watson was rushed to Celebration Hospital near Lake Buene Vista for treatment where he was later declared stable. 'Guess who's driving a Ferrari 458 Italia LSTRF today?': Watson uploaded this picture to Facebook yesterday in celebration of his birthday with this message: 'But really.

The track is operated by Petty Holdings which also has Exotic Driving Experience franchises at speedways in Atlanta, Dayton Beach, Charlotte, New Jersey and Texas. Named after the NASCAR legend, Richard Petty, the experience lets fans drive European supercars or NASCAR vehicles at close to their top speeds of 200mph around an oval. 'It's kind of scary to think accidents do happen even though they are rides and there are precautions,' said visitor Autumn Stevenson to WFTV. The Exotic Driving Experience attraction lets racing fans be drivers or passengers in luxurious cars such as Lamborghinis, Porsches or Ferraris . Package: Thrill seekers can pay up to $2,500 to experience a day driving an Italian supercar such as a Lamborghnin Gallardo (pictured above) As part of the package, visitors are accompanied by a professional driver who sits in the passenger seat providing racing advice. It is believed that was what Terry was doing when he was killed in the Lamborghini. The racing track is just south of the iconic Magic Kingdom. 'We offer our deepest sympathies to those involved in today's tragic accident,' said Andrea Finger, spokesperson for Walt Disney World Resort. According tot he Orlando Sentinel, Petty Holdings LLC also offered its best wishes to the victims and their families. 'On behalf of everyone in the organization, it is with a very heavy heart that we extend our deepest sympathies to those involved in today's tragic accident in Orlando.'

"PC Ronnie Lungu has won a race discrimination case against Wiltshire Police .

It found the 40-year-old was passed over for promotion in favour of white colleagues after his internal assessments were secretly downgraded to make him appear unworthy. It also heard evidence that derogatory comments were made about Mr Lungu based on his colour violating his dignity. When the PC raised concerns with his superiors they were not taken seriously and his complaints were brushed off as trivial. The force - which has only 16 ethnic minority officers out of a total of just over 1,000 - had denied the claims. But the tribunal ruled that the Zimbabwe-born officer was unlawfully discriminated against on grounds of race. Mr Lungu said: 'When I realised I was being singled out and treated badly because of the colour of my skin I felt so angry and upset. 'I had worked all my career to serve the community and be the best police officer I could but I was being penalised because I was black. 'It was totally unacceptable. But what made matters worse was that when I did raise the issue internally it wasn't taken seriously.' The tribunal in Bristol was told that the father-of-three joined the force as a police constable in 2003 after moving to England and 10 years later was temporarily promoted to the role of sergeant. After passing his sergeant's exam he applied for the role permanently, but he was turned down. Employment judges were told he was the only black candidate out of 20 officers to go for the position. The panel found that his internal assessments were specifically downgraded in order to make him appear unworthy of promotion. It also was told that a senior member of staff were invited to make negative comments about PC Lungu during an appraisal. The tribunal concluded that Wiltshire Police had singled out Mr Lungu as a 'marked man' on grounds of his race . The judgment read: 'The reduction in the scoring has the very significant effect in terms of making it appear reasonable that the one black applicant for promotion was scoring lower than the 19 white applicants and should therefore not be promoted.' It went on: 'This behaviour is so extreme that the Tribunal cannot think of any apparent motive other than one that is directly related to [the] Claimant's race.' Despite his treatment, Mr. Lungu is still serving as a PC with the force. 'I joined the force to uphold the law and I still would like to remain with the force,' he said. 'I need reassurance from Wiltshire Police that they will take issues of discrimination seriously in future and I want to see new procedures put in place to tackle discrimination and better education among senior members of staff in how to deal with complaints.' Mr Lungu said he was left 'upset' and 'angry' after being penalised because he was black . His lawyer, Juliette Franklin, of Slater and Gordon, said: 'It's extremely disappointing that people are facing this sort of prejudice and discrimination. 'Wiltshire Police needs to take this tribunal ruling very seriously and take swift steps to address any failings which have been identified. 'The force needs to ensure that officers feel confident that if they experience racism or discrimination that any complaint will be taken seriously.' Wiltshire Chief Constable Patrick Geenty said the force was 'concerned' by the findings and would 'learn lessons' from the case. Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Patrick Geenty, pictured, said he was 'concerned' by the findings . He said: 'Wiltshire Police take this matter very seriously and I am concerned by the Tribunal's findings. Clearly, the issues this raises do need to be carefully considered. 'We continue to work hard to embed our values and behaviours and the Code of Ethics within the organisation. 'Wiltshire Police will learn lessons from this process and continue to move forward.' He added: 'As an organisation we have a very small number of Black and Ethnic Minority (BME) staff (16 officers, 15 police staff and 3 Police Special Constables) and this judgment raises some serious concerns about how an officer felt he was treated. 'I have no doubt that this judgment will affect members of the Black and Ethnic Minority community who might be considering joining Wiltshire Police. 'I want to reassure the public that Wiltshire Police are committed to increasing diversity in the Force so that we can reflect the communities we serve. 'This case was complex and there were a number of points covered. With our legal advisors, we are undertaking an assessment of the Tribunal's findings in order to decide whether to appeal any aspects of the judgment. 'Following this assessment, decisions will be made on what action we may need to take and how we can ensure that lessons are learnt from this case. 'We will continue to engage with the officer and his representatives to ensure that he can continue to be a valued member of Wiltshire Police. 'All necessary training and support will continue to be provided to him.'","Ronnie Lungu successfully sued Wiltshire Police for race discrimination .

"A Conservative party candidate has defended photographs which show him trying to lick a female friend's breasts saying they were taken on a night out with friends and show him being a normal, sociable person. Liam Marshall-Ascough is standing to be an MP in Stoke-on-Trent central, which had a 5,500 Labour majority in 2010, and is a traditional Labour stronghold. The candidate, who is gay, is pictured on the open profile of his Facebook page appearing to lick a female friend's breasts. Underneath the picture a friend commented 'drunko'. But Mr Marshall-Ascough has insisted the photos, taken seven years ago, just show him out having fun with close friends 'like a normal person' and do not undermine his ability to do the job. He also said they show he is able to interact with people - important to the role of a politician. Liam Marshall-Ascough, pictured seven years ago on a night out with a close friend, insists the pictures show him enjoying himself like any normal person in their twenties and do not undermine his ability to do the job . 'You are still allowed to go out with your friends,' he told MailOnline. 'I think it's really important that you have a balance. You are not just about politics, but you actually interact with people. 'You can balance your social life and your professional life' Other photographs show him out drinking and posing with several female friends under the title 'more random nights out', and with and colleagues at Virgin Atlantic where he works as a steward. Mr Marshall-Ascough is also seen posing with David Cameron and outside the front door of Number 10, in pictures on the site. 'I'm a normal person,' he added in response to claims that some people felt the pictures showed a lack of judgement and responsibility. 'I grew up in a council house and I have a job that's cabin crew. It's a very sociable job and I'm a very sociable person. 'I think that's important. 'One of the things that I love about being cabin crew is you get to interact with people from every walk of life, and I think that's really important to the job of a politician. 'People want politicians these days who are normal people.' Mr Marshall-Ascough is a Conservative candidate for Stoke-on-Trent central, a traditional Labour stronghold . Several photographs show Mr Marshall-Ascough enjoyong nights out with his friends . Mr Marshall-Ascough, now 35, said the pictures had been taken seven years ago when he was out with close friends and was enjoying himself like most people in their twenties. He also added that he is not drinking to excess in any of the pictures, or doing anything wrong. 'I don't hide the fact I'm a normal person, and people want politicians who are normal,' he added. 'I'm definitely not going out at the moment. I'm too busy. 'You have to remember these pictures were taken in my twenties, when I was out like other people. Now I am in my thirties. 'Sometimes you make misjudgements when you are younger and you learn from these and grow up, using these experiences.' Mr Marshall-Ascough said he is able to balance his personal and professional life to interact with people . The Crawley borough councillor hasn't used any privacy settings on his social media profile, so the images are viewable by the public. The 35-year-old has also recently been seen on the campaign trail, supporting other Conservative party candidates. He faces a challenge to get elected in his constituency, which has been a Labour stronghold since the 1950s. His female friend, who appears in one of the photos but did not want to be named, said: 'It was taken seven years ago and it was harmless fun. It just happens to be a picture taken out of context. There was nothing untoward. It was all very innocent and Liam is a really professional person.' Mr Marshall-Ascough courted controversy last year when he told his local newspaper that he did not believe there was a cost of living crisis. He said he felt an extra food bank was not needed in the borough because he believed there was no food poverty, as shown by the fact it was 'difficult' to book a table in Crawley on a Friday or Saturday evening. Mr Marshall-Ascough, who studied Archaeology and History at the University of Southampton, made a start in politics in 2012 when he was elected to the council. He was picked as the Conservative party candidate for Stoke-on Trent in October last year and insisted he will not be standing down as a councillor for Southgate, where he has a seat until 2016. He also insisted that residents of Southgate - located almost 200 miles from Stoke-on-Trent, will not suffer if he is elected as an MP. He described being chosen to stand as an MP as 'an honour and a privilege'.","Liam Marshall-Ascough is a Tory candidate for Stoke-on-Trent Central .

"Margaret Gretton has been banned from classrooms for labelling an Asian job applicant 'Taliban' and calling special needs pupils 'roadkill' A primary school headteacher has been banned from classrooms for labelling an Asian job applicant 'Taliban' after referring to special needs pupils as 'roadkill'. Margaret Gretton, 46, has been barred indefinitely from the profession after she referred to the applicant as a member of the terror group and talked of 'bombs and blowing up the school' in an Asian accent. A disciplinary panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership in Coventry ruled Ms Gretton 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability'. The panel said she showed no remorse for 'deliberate' and 'repeated' actions while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham. They heard that she had mocked special needs students by referring to them as 'cuckoo' and said she didn't want to encourage children 'like that' to come to the school. She even displayed a Golly magnet in her office and made 'monkey noises' on one occasion when talking about black people. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school from September 2007 until November 2013. The panel concluded Ms Gretton 'displayed racist attitudes and behaviour in that - on one or more occasions you inappropriately commented in relation to a photograph of a male Asian job applicant.' It said her comments included 'would you hire me…I'm in the Taliban', or words to that effect, referring to the man as 'Mohammed', or words to that effect, and referring to 'bombs and blowing up the school', or words to that effect, in an Asian accent. A teacher at the school, named only as Staff Member E, told the panel that Ms Gretton said to her, unprompted: 'Do you like black men?' The teacher said she was 'taken aback' by the question, but added that it did not bother her, and her mother's partner was black and from Jamaica. She told the panel that Ms Gretton then 'burst out laughing and said words to the effect of 'does he have big lips?...does he look like a monkey?' and then went on to make monkey noises.' The headteacher denied making the comments, but the panel said it was 'satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the comments, or words similar to them, were made by Ms Gretton. ' The panel also found that she 'expressed inappropriate and discriminatory attitudes towards SEN [Special Educational Needs] pupils in the presence of school staff.' The panel said 'exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability' while head of Burton Joyce Primary School in Nottingham (pictured) They said she had used the word 'cuckoo' or words to that affect and said 'we don't want to encourage children like that to come here.' She was also found to have 'deliberately tried to upset' a special needs pupil, 'frightened him', and 'tried to make him cry.' Witness G gave evidence to the panel that on one occasion in 2010 a pupil would not come out from underneath a table and was disrupting the lesson so, as a teaching assistant, she asked Ms Gretton for assistance. She told the panel that 'Ms Gretton said 'It's like something from One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' and said 'cuckoo, cuckoo' whilst twirling her finger at the side of her head.' A Special Education Needs co-ordinator, who also gave evidence to the panel, said that during a discussion in 2010 about creating a disabled parking space at the school car park she mentioned that Ms Gretton's parking space was the obvious place to put it. However she said that Ms Gretton said: 'We don't want to encourage people like that here.' Ms Gretton was also found to have bullied members of staff which the panel described as 'wholly unacceptable.' It concluded: 'The panel considered that Ms Gretton was not acting under duress, she lacked any insight into her behaviour and demonstrated no remorse. Her shocking behaviour continued over a 'sustained period of time' while she was headteacher of the school (pictured)  from September 2007 until November 2013 . 'Her actions towards staff and pupils were deliberate, repeated and over a sustained period of time. Ms Gretton seriously abused her position of power and trust within the school. ' After the panel made its recommendations Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, decided to prohibit Ms Gretton from teaching indefinitely. He said: 'This is a case where the teacher has exhibited clear intolerance on the grounds of race, as well as disability.' He added: 'There has been no effort made by Ms Gretton to remedy the attitudinal deficiencies which have led her to behave in the way in which she did.' Describing his decision to prohibit the woman from teaching he said: ' This means that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. 'Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against her, I have decided that Ms Margaret Leandra Gretton shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of her eligibility to teach.' Ms Gretton has right of appeal to the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, until 28 days after she was given notice of the order.","Margaret Gretton, 46, has been barred indefinitely from the profession .

"Aaron Hernandez saw his PCP-taking friends kill Odin Lloyd but did not commit the murder himself, his defense claimed in the closing arguments of his trial on Tuesday. 'Did he make all the right decisions? No,' defense attorney James Sultan said. 'He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed... a shocking killing committed by somebody he knew. He really didn't know what to do. So he just put one foot in front of the other.' After closing arguments from the defense and the prosecution, the jury began their deliberations on Tuesday afternoon. If convicted, Hernandez faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. The former New England Patriots football player, 25, has pleaded not guilty to murder and firearms charges in the death of Lloyd, a semiprofessional football player who was dating his fiancée's sister.

His defense argued that he witnessed the killing of a friend but did not commit it himself . Defiant: Defense attorney James Sultan holds a photo of the murder scene during closing arguments . Prosecutor William McCauley points to Hernandez on Tuesday as he told jurors to simply look at the evidence . Prosecutors say the former tight end and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home before dawn on June 17, 2013, and drove him to an industrial park near Hernandez's house in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, where they shot him to death. Surveillance video at Hernandez's home minutes after the shooting showed him holding a black item that appeared to be a gun. A joint found near Lloyd's body had Hernandez's and Lloyd's DNA on it. Murdered: Semi-pro football player, Odin Lloyd, was shot dead near Hernandez's home in June 2013 . Cellphone records shared in court also showed the men communicating with Lloyd that night. Surveillance video along the way showed Hernandez driving the Nissan shortly before Lloyd's sister saw him get into a silver car, a moment captured on a neighbor's security camera. Soon after, a toll booth camera caught the Nissan leaving Boston, while Lloyd's phone pinged several cell towers before stopping in North Attleborough for good. His body was found in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home later that day. Lloyd had been shot six times. In his closing arguments, Assistant District Attorney William McCauley told jurors  to go through all the evidence. 'If you do that, you'll get to where you need to go, which is to find the defendant guilty for the murder of Odin Lloyd,' McCauley said. But the defense said the prosecution's case failed to prove Hernandez pulled the trigger. Prosecutors have never presented a motive to jurors and Sultan added on Monday that Hernandez and Lloyd were friends who shared 'a passion for marijuana'. 'Obviously they were friends,' Sultan told the jury. 'They were future brothers-in-law.' Wallace and Ortiz have also pleaded not guilty to murder charges and will be tried separately. Both men used the drug PCP, according to attorneys and court documents, and the defense team has sought to link use of the drug with violent, unpredictable behavior in an apparent attempt to shift blame for the murder on the pair. Blame game: Attorneys from the defense team said Carlos Ortiz, left, and Ernest Wallace, right, were responsible for the murder - not Hernandez. DNA and surveillance footage ties all three to the scene . Support: Shayanna Jenkins (left), Hernandez's girlfriend, and his mother Terri listen to the judge on Tuesday . Emotional: An uncle of Odin Lloyd is comforted as he hears details about his nephew's death on Tuesday . Investigators say Lloyd was shot multiple times with a Glock .45-caliber handgun that has not been found. Sultan said that after nine weeks of testimony, prosecutors 'still haven't proved to you who killed Odin Lloyd.' During the trial, which started in late January, the prosecution called 131 witnesses while the defense called three. Sultan also attacked the investigation, saying a shell casing removed from a rental car returned by Hernandez had been contaminated with his client's DNA from a piece of chewing gum stuck to it. 'The investigation done in this case was incomplete, biased and inept. That was not fair to Odin Lloyd, that was not fair to Aaron Hernandez, and it was not fair to you,' he said. 'All that effort and this is all they could come up with. What does that tell you?' Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury. Hernandez had a $41 million contract with the Patriots. He was cut after being charged with Lloyd's killing in June 2013.

"Tory Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith came under fire today after suggesting that zero-hours contracts should be re-named 'flexible hours'. Labour said the 'Marie Antoinette' moment by the Work and Pensions Secretary showed 'just how out of touch the Tories are' about the lives of working people. The future of zero-hours deals has become of the key issues of the election battle over jobs, with Labour pledging to ban exploitative deals. Tory Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith came under fire today after suggesting that zero-hours contracts should be re-named 'flexible hours' In a TV interview today Mr Duncan Smith said that zero-hours contracts were 'wrongly named'. He told the BBC: 'It should be flexible hours contracts, but only 2 per cent of the total workforce have those and they are mostly people like carers, who can't give direct time, and young people like students, so for them there is a reason for those.' Aides to the minister stressed that job satisfaction and work-life balance for those on zero-hours contracts were similar to other workers. Some 60 per cent of people on zero-hours contracts do not want more hours, they said. Labour and trade union leaders criticised the comments, saying it showed the minister was 'out of touch'. Shadow business Secretary Chuka Umunna told MailOnline: 'Iain Duncan Smith's 'Marie Antoinette' moment today has revealed just how out of touch the Tories are about the lives of working people. 'Instead of acknowledging the worrying growth of zero-hours contracts in our economy, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions today chose to defend them – arguing this morning that we should simply rename them as flexible hours contracts. 'Instead of pledging to tackle exploitation in the labour market he refused to even acknowledge there was a problem.' Labour leader Ed Miliband today launched his party's manifesto for young people in Lincoln . Labour has pledged to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, while unions have been pressing for them to be scrapped altogether. Under the controversial contracts, workers are often told at the end of the week how many hours they can work the following week. Launching Labour's manifesto for young people in Lincoln, party leader Ed Miliband said: 'Young people are three times more likely to be on zero-hours contracts than the rest of the population. 'Iain Duncan Smith has tried today to rename zero-hours contracts as 'flexible contracts'. We don't need to rename zero-hours contracts, we need to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, and that's what the next Labour government will do.' Len McCluskey, leader of the Unite union, said zero-hours contracts meant 'misery' or workers and their families, leaving them on a 'hand to mouth' existence. 'This insecurity has exploded on David Cameron's watch, where we have an economy built on shaky jobs and chronic low pay.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Whatever you call a zero-hours contract, it is still a recipe for insecurity and exploitation, where the boss holds all the power. 'Nothing sums up what is wrong with this Government's approach to work and how out of touch they are with the way most people live their lives than this celebration of the zero-hours contract. 'If you put lipstick on a pig, it is still a pig. But as 'zero-hours contracts' is a bit of a mouthful, perhaps we could call them 'IDS jobs' in the future.' Shadow business Secretary Chuka Umunna accused the Tories of being out of touch . Iain Duncan Smith's 'Marie Antoinette' moment today has revealed just how out of touch the Tories are about the lives of working people. Instead of acknowledging the worrying growth of zero-hours contracts in our economy, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions today chose to defend them – arguing this morning that we should simply rename them as flexible hours contracts. Instead of pledging to tackle exploitation in the labour market he refused to even acknowledge there was a problem. The Tories have a history of Let Them Eat Cake moments. Today's comment comes from the minister who renamed the Bedroom Tax the 'removal of the spare room subsidy' and the party which insisted on calling the poll tax the 'community charge'. And three weeks ago David Cameron said that more people are using food banks because of better advertising – next he'll be rebadging them as Big Society supermarkets. This reveals an important truth about the Tories – they simply won't stand up for working people. Just a few weeks ago David Cameron admitted he couldn't live on a zero-hours contract. But the Tories seem happy for working people to be stuck in low-paid zero-hour contract jobs. It's becoming increasingly clear throughout this campaign that they will only stand up for a privileged few. The reality – that the Tories refused to acknowledge – is that for too many people zero-hours contracts leave them without a regular income and not knowing from one day to the next how much work they will get. The number of people with zero-hour contracts has increased by almost 20 per cent in the last year and surveys show that over half of young people on these contracts are on them because they could not find a job with regular hours. Companies such as Sports Direct are hiring the vast majority of their workers on zero-hours contracts, even though they have predictable and manageable fluctuations in demand and many of these employees reportedly work regular hours in practice. This is insecurity dressed up as flexibility. It's not acceptable, it's not fair and Labour will act to stop it. Labour will ban exploitative zero-hours contracts. With Labour, if you work regular hours for 12 weeks or more you will get a right to a regular contract. We will also give workers on zero-hours contracts new rights to be protected from employers forcing them to be available at all hours or cancelling shifts at short notice without compensation. Labour is clear: we don't need to rename exploitative zero-hours contracts. We need to ban them.​ .","Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary likened to Mary Antoinette .

"Fox News anchor Chris Wallace has issued an apology after 'fat shaming' Kelly Clarkson in a radio interview, saying that he should have spoken of the singer's 'remarkable talent', not her weight. During the interview with conservative talk show host, Mike Gallagher, the 67-year-old was asked: 'Have you seen Kelly Clarkson? You know the singer, Kelly Clarkson? Holy cow, did she blow up.' In reply, he said the 'American Idol' winner has 'a lovely voice', but added that she 'could stay off the deep dish pizza for a while'. Within minutes, Wallace's response had sparked outrage online. Now, the veteran news man has apologized for his 'offensive' remarks - which he made on the nationally-syndicated Mike Gallagher Show on Friday - in a statement obtained by DailyMail.com. SCROLL DOWN FOR 'FAT SHAMING' INTERVIEW . Firestorm: Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace (right), 67, faced wide-spread criticism after fat shaming Kelly Clarkson (left) on Friday, saying the singer and new mom could 'stay off the deep dish pizza for a while' Dealing with it: The same day, Kelly Clarkson told chat show host Ellen DeGeneres that she's had to deal with criticism about her weight since she first hit the spotlighton the first season of American Idol in 2002 . In the statement, Wallace said: 'I sincerely apologize to Kelly Clarkson for my offensive comment. I admire her remarkable talent and that should have been the focus of any discussion about her.' Clarkson, who coincidentally spoke of criticism about her weight on The Ellen DeGeneres Show the same day, is married to talent manager Brandon Blackstock. They have a nine-month-old girl, River. Following Friday's interview, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor, 60-year-old Greta Van Susteren, almost immediately took to her blog to chastise her colleague over his comments to Gallagher. 'This ""guy snickering"" about her weight is obnoxious. He should apologize,' Van Susteren wrote. Meanwhile, Twitter users condemned Wallace for his 'disgusting' remarks. One wrote: 'Chris Wallace you're disgusting how dare you fat shame a woman who gave birth less than a year ago.' During her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Clarkson revealed that since she appeared on 'American Idol' in 2002, she has had to  deal with people being mean about her body shape. On Kelly's side: Following Friday's interview, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor, Greta Van Susteren (above), 60, almost immediately took to her blog to chastise her colleague over his comments to Mike Gallagher . Tweet: 'This ""guy snickering"" about her weight is obnoxious. He should apologize,' Van Susteren wrote . Mom-and-baby bag: Ellen surprised Kelly, whose daughter River was born in June 2014, with a baby bag that dispenses 'mommy juice' after the singer said she sometimes prefers wine to workouts on Friday's show . 'I was the biggest girl in the show, too. And I wasn’t big, but people would call me big. Because I was the biggest one on Idol and I’ve kind of always gotten that,' she told the  host. Referring to British TV personality, Katie Hopkins, who has tweeted a string of rude comments about her, she added: 'People are like, I’m so sorry that lady in London was so mean to you. 'I’m like, are you serious? Like get in line.' In an interview with Access Hollywood in early March, Hopkins, 40, defended her position on the Heartbeat Song artist, declaring that 'ultimately, Kelly Clarkson is a chunky monkey.' Proud mom: The singer brought along her adorable nine-month-old daughter River and introduced her to the comedienne backstage at The Ellen DeGeneres Show . Happy and successful: Kelly's new album Piece By Piece debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 Chart, making it her third number one album . But Clarkson told Ellen she feels bad not for herself but for other woman. 'I think what hurts my feelings... is that I’ll have a meet and greet after the show and a girl who is, like, bigger than me will be in the meet and greet and be like, 'wow, if they think you’re big, I must be so fat to them"", she said. The new mother, who gave birth to her daughter in June 2014, revealed on the popular TV chat show that she takes a philosophical approach to comments about what she looks like. 'We are who we are. Whatever size,' the 32-year-old said. She added: 'I’m such a creative person that I yoyo. So sometimes I’m more fit and I get into kickboxing hardcore. And then sometimes I don’t and I’m like.. I’d rather have wine.'","Fox News Sunday host appeared on The Mike Gallagher Show on Friday .

"A passionate truck driver has posted a five-minute plea online in a bid to encourage Australians to attend an Anzac Day memorial service. Geelong man Trevor Vale took to his social media account on Tuesday while on a long-haul trip from Darwin to Melbourne to appeal to his fellow countrymen, after becoming frustrated at the lack of interest from Australians in paying respect to the Anzacs. In the video, which has been viewed over 800,000 times, Mr Vale calls on Australians to make it their business to attend an Anzac Day service and show the Anzacs the respect they deserve. Scroll down for video . Passionate truck driver Trevor Vale (pictured) has pleaded with Australians to attend an Anzac Day service . Mr Vale, whose wife fought as a soldier in Timor and Afghanistan, posted the video online from behind the wheel of his truck. While listening to the radio, he heard a podcast questioning Australians on their plans for the public holiday. While a small number of people admitted that last year they made their way to a dawn service, many Australians made up excuses for not attending a memorial, claiming it was too wet or it was too early to get out of bed. Mr Vale was furious at their responses and made the video in an attempt to persuade them to honour their ancestors who fought so bravely for them. 'Men and women went overseas to fight for our country so we could live the way we live,' Mr Vale said in the video. 'Then we get people making piss-poor excuses about why they can’t go to the dawn service, one hour of your friggin day.' The issue is close to the truck driver's heart as his wife fought as a soldier in Timor and Afghanistan . Mr Vale revealed in the video that his wife 'was not making tea' while she was in Timor and Afghanistan, but she actually was 'walking around with a rifle' and put her life on the line for her country. 'I’m lucky my wife came home and I thank every day for that,' Mr Vale said. 'A lot of people didn't come home, a hell of a lot of people didn't come home and a lot of people that did come home maimed and injured mentally scarred for life – what about their families?' Speaking to the Today show,  Mr Vale said he is inspired by his wife's service overseas and is proud of her efforts to protect her country. Mr Vale is on a mission to never let Australians forget their heritage . The truckie was driving from Darwin to Melbourne when he made the video . His ramblings were shared by friends and soon became viral . 'To have someone who's willing to put their time and all their effort into serving our country with the dedication that she did - it's an inspiration,' he said. 'You don't have to agree with why they go over there, but when someone so close goes over there you've got to be inspired by it.' Mr Vale said it was tough when his wife was overseas as their children were very young but pleaded with Australians to go to at least one service.

"The Vatican are training up ordinary doctors, teachers and psychologists to cope with a rising tide of demonic possessions. More than 40 years after The Exorcist left cinema audiences green, the Vatican has gathered a team of experts including practising exorcists to give ordinary Catholics the tools needed to recognise a case of demonic possession when they see one – and teach them what to do about it. The tenth edition of the annual course, ‘Exorcism and Prayer of Liberation,’ sponsored by the Vatican Congregation for the Clergy, the department responsible for overseeing matters regarding priests, began this morning at Rome’s Regina Apostolorum University. More than 40 years after The Exorcist (pictured) left cinema audiences green, The Vatican are training up ordinary doctors, teachers and psychologists to cope with a rising tide of demonic possessions . One of the main purposes of the course is help would-be exorcists distinguish demonic possession from psychological or medical conditions, organisers said. In 2013 Francis appeared to perform an exorcism on a young man in a wheelchair who shook violently when the pope laid his hands on him and said a blessing. He has frequently expressed the belief that the devil really exists and is not merely ‘a myth, a figure, an idea, the idea of evil.’ Experts say demonic activity is on the rise due to an in creased interest in the occult among the young including ouija boards and seances. Last year the International Association of Exorcists claimed it was ‘a pastoral emergency.” In 2013, Pope Francis (pictured( appeared to perform an exorcism on a young man in a wheelchair . The Vatican tried to introduce Holyween, where children would dress up as saints and attend prayer vigils instead of Halloween. Father Pedro Barrajon, director of the Sacerdos Institute, which is organising the course said ‘Living in an increasingly secularised society than in the past there is more tendency to open the door to the occult. Demonic activity is increased by the practice of magic and visiting fortune tellers which can increase the likelihood of a possession’.","Doctors, teachers and psychologists being trained to cope with rising tide .

"The families of two slain New York City police officers threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the Mets' home opener at Citi Field, while the widow of American Sniper Chris Kyle pitched in for the San Diego Padres. New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady also threw a first pitch, at Fenway Park in Boston - but didn't do himself proud, chucking the ball straight at the ground.

Taya Kyle gets a hug from San Diego Padres starting pitcher Andrew Cashner after throwing out the first ceremonial pitch . De Blasio's relations with the police unions and some rank-and-file officers were fractured in the aftermath of the December shooting that claimed the lives of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. They were murdered on patrol in Brooklyn on December 20 by a crazed gunman who then committed suicide. Since that crisis, which threatened to overwhelm the mayor's agenda, de Blasio has taken pains to repair relations with the nation's largest police force, brokering a new union contract, investing in new technology and training, and doubling down on his public praise of the department. On Monday, he joined the tens of thousands of fans in cheering as the officers' images were displayed on the park's giant video screens and again when Ramos' two sons and Liu's widow threw out the pitches to Mets players David Wright, Matt Harvey and Curtis Granderson. De Blasio, however, was largely booed when he was introduced to the crowd. A year ago, de Blasio was also booed as he threw out the first pitch (a strike). Both years, he sported a Mets cap and jersey, which was emblazoned with his last name and the number 6, a tribute to Rico Petrocelli, a longtime shortstop on de Blasio's favorite team, the Boston Red Sox. Petrocelli, like de Blasio, was also of Italian descent and lived in Brooklyn. The tribute to the NYPD comes as de Blasio is weighing a City Council proposal to hire 1,000 more police officers. The idea has been endorsed by union leaders who said it would reduce pressure on existing officers to keep crime low. But de Blasio rejected an identical council proposal a year ago, pointing to the city's record low crime and suggesting that the money would be better spent elsewhere.

Members of the Liu and Ramos families, including Yenjian Liu's widow, Pei Xia Chen, second from left, throw out the ceremonial first pitch . Police Commissioner William Bratton has, at times, signaled support for the effort to hire more officers for the department, which now has a headcount of about 34,500, about 6,000 fewer than at its peak in 2001. De Blasio has not committed to hiring more officers but has been more receptive to the proposal in his public remarks than he was a year ago. The council's budget office projected that hiring two new classes of officers, to total 1,000, would cost nearly $69m in the upcoming fiscal year. But the council believes that the cost will be offset by the corresponding reduction in overtime.

"The very first black James Bond villain, Yaphet Kotto, has said the legendary secret agent role should only ever be portrayed by a white actor and 'political correctness be damned'. Kotto, who starred as Dr Kananga in the 1973 Bond installment Live And Let Die, said the role was created by Ian Fleming for a white actor and should be portrayed on the big screen as such. His comments come in response to months of speculation that black British actor Idris Elba is in the running to be named as Daniel Craig's successor. Scroll down for video . Yaphet Kotto (pictured opposite Roger Moore in Live And Let Die) said James Bond cannot be portrayed by a black man . In an interview with Big Issue, Kotto said: 'Political correctness be damned, we have to stay with what is literally correct.' He said: 'He was established as a white character, played by white actors. I don't think it's right for black actors or writers to do roles that whites have made historically white roles.' Kotto argued that a black man could play 003 or 006, but could not be 007, and suggested new characters should be written for black heroes. Last month veteran Bond actor Roger Moore was widely condemned for his claim that Elba, 42, could not be the next James Bond because he was not 'English English' enough. Following the publication of the interview, Sir Roger faced strong criticism on Twitter over the statement. He made the 'English-English' comments, even though former Bonds Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan were Scottish, Welsh and Irish. After being accused of 'racism', he claimed his comments were lost in translation during the interview with a French magazine. Elba is seen as the leading contender to play Bond once Daniel Craig holsters his Walther PPK for the last time. Hackney-born Idris Elba (pictured) has been tipped to replace Daniel Craig as the next James Bond actor . Current James Bond Daniel Craig (pictured) has said Elba is the only possible choice to replace him . He was born in Hackney, raised in East Ham, schooled in Canning Town, started work in Dagenham and he supports Arsenal. However, with speculation rampant he is being lined up to replace Craig, Elba himself has said he has ruled out taking the role. Today The Sun reported him as saying: 'It's a rumour that's really started to eat itself. If there was a chance of me getting Bond, it's gone.' He also responded to claims he was not 'English' enough for the role, stating he was 'born and raised' in England. Following Live and Let Die, Kotto went on to take central roles in several successful Hollywood films, including Alien and Midnight Run.

"A keen fisherman got more than he bargained for at the weekend when he reeled in a massive shark after spending hours battling the beast. Max Muggeridge, 19, from Coomera in QLD was camping at Tweed Heads just across the NSW border with his girlfriend when the pair decided to go for an early morning fish. An avid angler, Mr Muggeridge couldn't believe his luck when a huge four metre tiger shark took a bite of his line, and he spent the next three hours trying to bring it to shore. Scroll down for video . Max Muggeridge, 19, from the Gold Coast caught this four metre tiger shark at the weekend . He reeled in the monster on the Tweed coast just inside the NSW border, after a three hour battle . The massive creature is one of the largest tiger sharks ever caught off a beach, according to Max . 'Three hours on the rod and reel, it was both physically and mentally exhausting,' Mr Muggeridge told Daily Mail Australia. 'It definitely challenged my mindset and whether I had the perseverance to push through,' he added. 'We were just about to reel our rods in.. I started my car up and then my rod started ticking over.' The teenager, who is in his own words 'a shark conservationist first and foremost', also said the massive three hour battle left him with some serious battle wounds. 'I was absolutely shattered, I had blood blisters all over my hands, I've got some nice callouses coming up now,' Mr Muggeridge revealed. From the time he hooked the shark just after 7am, to the time he pulled it in around 10.30am the fisherman said it was a constant battle. In a post on Facebook, he described the ordeal in great detail, admitting that at times he wasn't sure if he had the strength to reel the monster in. 'The first hour this shark absolutely made a mockery out of me,' Mr Muggeridge wrote. The huge struggle with the shark left his antique fishing rod bent slightly out of shape . The 19-year-old said the catch was a once in a lifetime opportunity . Mr Muggeridge believes it could have been world record size but he wasn't able to accurately measure the beast . He was with his girlfriend Alexia (right) on the beach, who was snapping photos of him reeling in the shark . 'I was hurting bad, really bad. I've never been in so much pain. Sun burning in my face, shocking burns and blisters all over my hands, sweat and sunscreen dripping into my eyes, and my whole body aching from holding the intense pressure for such an extended time. 'Thoughts crossed my head like I can't do this, It's too big, I'm not prepared enough, I'm on my own...' the post continued. Mr Muggeridge said he didn't even get a proper glimpse of the shark until the second hour, 'when it jumped out of the water!!! What a sight, I have never seen that before!' The teenager also spoke to Nine's Today show on Thursday morning, telling the program he knew what he was up for about '20 seconds in... it definitely shocked me and my girlfriend (who) I was fishing with'. 'It absolutely blew everything I've ever caught out of the water so it was once in a lifetime catch,' he added. Mr Muggeridge said he thinks the catch could have been close to the world record, and he wished he could have measured it accurately. 'The current catch and release world record tiger shark held by Joey Polk is 10 foot eight inches (3.25m) in fork length and 12 foot 9 inches (3.88m) overall length,' he told The Gold Coast Bulletin. After getting a quick measurement of the huge creature, Mr Muggeridge sent it back out to sea . He is pictured here watching the huge creature swim back out into the ocean . Mr Muggeridge (left) and Alexia (right) were camping on the Tweed coast when they were fishing . Mr Muggeridge said he decided to release the shark rather than getting the measurements necessary to prove the record because the animal was in distressed after being landed. Photos show the young man in the shallows with the creature, dwarfed by the huge tiger shark. Snapped by his girlfriend Alexia, Mr Muggeridge said she was taking photos of him while he worked to get the marine animal back in the water and out to safety. He described the catch as a life-long goal, and said that by the end of the struggle he was completely wiped out. 'I collapsed on the beach and tried taking it all in. I had just achieved everything I had ever set out to. It was surreal. The time was 10.30am, meaning I was on the rod and reel for over 3 hours,' Mr Muggeridge posted. Aside from the exhaustion, and battle wounds the teenager also bent his antique rod during the fight, but said he wouldn't change it for anything. Asked about the danger of being in such close proximity to a potentially deadly creature, Mr Muggeridge said he wasn't too concerned. 'You take your chances, I've been around enough sharks to have a basic understanding of how they work,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'But at the end of the day you are dealing with a wild animal.'

"The mother of a two-year-old boy who fell 10 feet into a cheetah enclosure could face child endangerment charges after witnesses claim she was dangling him over the edge. Visitors at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo in Ohio heard a scream as the toddler tumbled into the pit at 3pm on Saturday. His parents jumped in and pulled him to safety before paramedics arrived to treat the boy for a leg injury. Though the felines appeared to avoid the child, Dr Christopher Kuhar, executive director at the zoo, said there is a strong chance charges will be pressed on Monday. Scroll down for video . A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital . He told CNN: 'Unfortunately, we have a number of eyewitness accounts that point to the strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the rail.' According to witnesses the mother was holding him and another child when he fell. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' The exhibit was closed following the child's fall. Zoo visitor Michael Lurie was at the cheetah exhibit when he heard the child scream.

"Between the tears, eulogies and final farewells, funerals are typically a sombre affair. So mourners at a Taiwanese man's memorial were shocked after they were treated to a sexy performance by two scantily-clad strippers - hired by the deceased's own wife, The People's Daily Online reported. Dressed in little more than  underwear and thigh-high boots, the exotic dancers showed off their moves in a scene more fitting to a strip club than a funeral home. Scroll down for video . Two hot dancers wearing just bras and miniskirts danced around the casket showing off their sexy moves to open mouthed mourners . Bringing a whole new meaning to the phrase Drop Dead Gorgeous the women gyrated around the coffin to Maroon 5's Moves Like Jagger in front of the open-mouthed mourners. At one stage they even draped themselves over the casket as part of their routine. Incredibly it was the deceased's wife who booked the dancers as a final gift to her husband. Mrs Jian said she knew her spouse always had an eye for the ladies and wanted to ensure that his final journey was one that he would appreciate. The exotic dancers had been hired by Mrs Jian, from Taiwan, who said she booked them to perform at her husband’s funeral as her last gift to him . Taichung Funeral Home in Taipei, Taiwan was turned into a makeshift gentleman's club when the dance music began pumping and neon lights started flashing as the girls went through their moves on the morning of April 12. Some mourners appeared to be more interested in filming the sexy dancers rather than remembering their departed friend as they vied for the best position to take photos and videos on their smart phones. Family and friends of the deceased expressed their shock during the performance but it didn't stop the dancers who went through three different fast paced songs. They then disappeared before the drums played and the coffin was taken to the awaiting car and the start of the solemn funeral ceremony. Friends said the extremely understanding Mrs Jian was a devoted wife and after Mr Jian had suffered a stroke before his death, she would spend every minute at his bedside, attending to his every need. Draped across the coffin, the women are happy to pose for pictures in between dancing to Maroon 5's Moves Like Jagger . Mourners appeared to be more concerned about filming the sexy dancers rather than remembering their departed friend Mr Jian . The Taiwanese phenomenon of having exotic dancers or strippers perform at funerals began in the 1980s and is thought to be connected to the local mafia who were said to have seized control of the mortuary industry and offered strippers from their clubs at a cut price. For a modest fee the scantily-clad women arrive on the neon-lit back of a diesel truck, dubbed an Electric Flower Car, to gyrate erotically in front of the departed and his mourners. The cars also offer an easy getaway if police arrive to the scene. Some have labelled the practice as scandalous, but others claim it as an important part of the grieving process - and the perfect way of sending off their loved ones with a smile. In Taiwanese culture, the more people who attend the funeral then the more honour was given to the deceased. So the strippers were used to 'bribe' more mourners into turning up. Other theories suggest the entertainment was because the ghosts of the deceased enjoyed watching strippers while they were alive. The funerals also provide one of the few forms of live entertainment for many of the rural poor communities in Taiwan.","The scantily-clad strippers danced around the casket at Mr Jian's funeral .

"American model Kendra Spears, who has been known as Princess Salwa since her marriage to the Aga Khan's son Prince Rahim, has given birth to her first child. The baby, a  boy named Prince Irfan, was born in the Swiss city of Geneva last Saturday and both mother and child are doing well. News of the birth, which was announced yesterday, has been greeted with joy by the followers of the Aga Khan, who, in a statement, spoke of his family's 'great happiness'. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Princess Salwa Aga Khan, pictured during a photo shoot last year, has given birth to a son . Ms Spears, a Seattle-born supermodel who has starred in campaigns for Diane von Furstenburg and Chanel among others, married Prince Rahim Aga Khan in 2013 following a four month engagement. The model, 26, had been considered 'the next Cindy Crawford' by her agency Ford Models, but has put her career on the back-burner since becoming wife to the 44-year-old royal. She follows in the footsteps of a string of American royal wives, among them actress Rita Hayworth who was married to Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan. Prince Rahim's younger brother Hussein, 41, also married an American, although his marriage to New Yorker Kristin White, 38, ended shortly after his brother's wedding in 2013. The Jordanian royals have also made a habit of wedding Americans, most famously Lisa Najeeb Halaby who became known as Queen Noor following her marriage. Happy couple: The royal is said to be doing well, according to her husband, Prince Rahim Aga Khan . Striking: Princess Salwa pictured left on her wedding day and right during her catwalk modelling career . Britons have also married into the Jordanian royal dynasty, most notably Antoinette Avril Gardiner, the mother of current ruler Abdullah, . Unlike the Jordanians, the Aga Khan dynasty do not have a country and instead lead the Imami Ismā'īlī Tariqah, a Shi'a Muslim sect . Like the King Abdullah of Jordan, the Aga Khan, a title bestowed upon the family by Persian (now Iran) ruler Fath-Ali Shah Qajar in 1818, claims to be a direct descendant of the Prophet Mohammed. Prince Rahim's father Prince Shah Karim Al Hussaini is the current Aga Khan and took the title aged 20 following the death of his grandfather, Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah, Aga Khan III. A British business magnate and a racehorse enthusiast, he is responsible for adding to the family fortune, which is thought to amount to more than $800m. Not all of the money was acquired through commerce, however. Part of it comes from a tithe paid by Ismaili Muslims called a 'dasond' - the equivalent of 12.5 percent of each person's gross annual income.

"A 28-year-old teacher has been charged after she allegedly exchanged multiple nude pictures and videos with a 14-year-old student she began texting when he was just 12. Whitney Fetters, from Putnam City, Oklahoma, turned herself into cops in February after other students told teachers about the pictures but she was released after posting $10,000 bail. On Wednesday, Oklahoma County prosecutors charged her with one count of soliciting sex with a minor and one count of possession of marijuana. The Spanish teacher, who has since lost her job at Hefner Middle School, allegedly planned to invite the boy to spend the night with her as she was house-sitting 'so they could get high and have sex'. Scroll down for video . Charged: Whitney Fetters has been charged with soliciting sex with a minor and  possession of marijuana . Accused: She allegedly exchanged naked photos and sexual videos with the boy, and sent him sexually suggestive text messages. She also invited him over to get high and have sex . She had met the victim at the middle school when he was 12 and the two began sending each other harmless text messages, but last year, the messages became sexual. Court documents cited by News9 earlier this year indicated the victim sent the first sexually explicit message, telling Fetters he thought she was 'hot' with a partially nude photo of the boy. They allegedly went on to exchange 20 naked and partially nude images, as well as videos of themselves performing sex acts and explicit Snapchat messages. One text allegedly sent by Fetters to the boy read, 'Touching myself is fun', WSET reported. Another featured a photo of the woman wearing only her underwear with a text: 'That's all you get.' The teacher allegedly planned to invite the boy over to stay the night so they could have sex on February 13, but authorities learned of the relationship before that was able to happen. The plan emerged after other students told school staff that the boy had inappropriate photos of a woman,The Oklahoman reported. Caught: Fetters first started messaging the boy when he was 12 and the texts turned sexual last year . Fired: The 28-year-old Spanish teacher was fired after students told staff that the boy had photos of her . Officials learned of the allegations against the middle school teacher on January 30. When two school principals approached him during a school sporting event, he allegedly deleted the explicit photos and videos, but police were able to recover them. During a search of Fetters' family home, police seized her cell phone, computers, marijuana, and lingerie matching the photos found on the student's iPad. She was removed from her job and no longer works for the school district. Fetters graduated from the University of Central Oklahoma with a BA in Spanish. According to public records, she is not married.","Whitney Fetters turned herself into cops in February after it emerged she 'had exchanged X-rated photos and videos with the student'

"Have you ever panicked about whether you locked the front door, been woken by a Facebook notification or desperately needed a phone charger? To deal with these sorts of everyday emergencies, one company has designed a range of prototype products. You can vote on which one is your favourite - and the winner will be made into an actual product, funded through a Kickstarter campaign. Scroll down for video . Leeds-based Direct Line is running a competition called #EverydayFix. They asked groups to design products to deal with common problems. These include forgetting to lock the door, which one company hopes to solve with their Forget Me Lock prototype, shown . The products were designed as part of the Direct Line Everyday Fix design makeathon. They asked people to pick their top ten ‘everyday emergencies’ - things that caused them an undue amount of stress in their daily lives. Groups from London-based design company Makerversity were then asked to design products that could alleviate certain emergencies - and three were picked for a shortlist. 1. Not being able to sleep (46 per cent*) 2. Losing your keys (37 per cent) 3. Being stuck in traffic when already late (35 per cent) 4. Losing an important paper or document (33 per cent) 5. Nowhere to park (32 per cent) 6. Printer not working when you need to print something (31 per cent) 7. Running out of battery on your phone whilst out (31 per cent) 8. Discovering you are out of toilet roll whilst on the loo (30 per cent) 9. Dealing with machine operated customer service (26 per cent) 10. Forgetting your bank card when paying for an item (25 per cent) *How many people thought this was a problem . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called ‘Snooze’, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep. To deal with not remembering if you had locked your door, ONN Studio created the Forget Me Lock - a device to reassure you that you have locked the front door. It fastens on the key and swivels green to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. This means that even when out or about, you can find out if your door is locked or not. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost. Direct Line is running a competition on Twitter where you can vote for your favourite of these three products by retweeting tweets about Snooze, Forget Me Lock or Nipper. The Forget Me Lock is coloured green and red and fastens on a key. When the key is turned in a lock it swivels green  to show the door is open, and red to signify it’s locked. Another group designed Nipper - the world’s smallest mobile phone charger according to its creators, Impulse. Any household battery can be used as its energy source, with two terminals attaching either side and then connecting to your phone to provide a boost . The Nipper device (shown) is designed to help people who run out of battery while they are out and about . In the survey of 2,000 people, the top emergency was not being able to sleep. So a group called Instruments designed a product called Snooze, shown, an alarm clock which connects with your phone and silences any notifications to ensure a good night’s sleep . Whichever tweet has the most retweets, with the #EverydayFix hashtag, by 23 April will go into a Kickstarter fundraising campaign and ultimately into development. ‘We’ve seen the great British designers of tomorrow create smart and simple solutions to real life everyday emergencies,’ said Paul Smyth, co-founder of Makerversity. ‘Through the Direct Line Everyday Fix event, we’ve been able to extend our role as ""fixers"" and work with some unique creative talent to produce a fantastic shortlist of exciting prototypes that start to solve the nation’s everyday emergencies,’ added John Shaw, head of R&D and Innovation at Direct Line. Of the products that didn’t make the cut, one was a helmet with ‘bone conduction headphones’ that gave you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you. Another was a parking pin that you could leave in a space, which would then alert you when the space was free, if you couldn’t find somewhere to park. And as another solution to your phone running out of battery, one team designed an app that lets you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies. Products that didn't make the final shortlist included the Parking Pin, shown. You could leave this in a parking space, and it will alert you when the space is free, so you can park your car . The Relay app, shown, would let you nominate people to receive your messages when your phone dies . And the 'Hat Nav' was a smart helmet that used ‘bone conduction headphones’ to give you directions while cycling without impairing your ability to hear the environment around you .","Leeds-based Direct Line is running a competition called #EverydayFix .

"Model Karlie Kloss is spreading her passion for computer coding and empowering young women by teaming up with the Flatiron School in New York to offer teen girls around the country scholarships to the academy's software engineering program this summer. The 22-year-old's Kode With Karlie scholarships will provide 20 girls between the ages of 13 and 18 free tuition to the same two-week coding course she took last year at the Flatiron Pre-College Academy. 'Code is only going to continue to play a major role in defining our future,' she says in a video promoting Kode With Karlie. 'I think it's crucial that young women learn to code as early as possible to ensure that we [...] have a voice and a stake in what the world looks like.' Scroll down for video . Role model: Karlie Kloss can be seen flexing her muscles in a promotional video for her Kode With Karlie scholarship program, which will provide 20 young girls free tuition for a computer coding course this summer . Team player: The 22-year-old model was filmed working with other students at the Flatiron School in New York, where her scholarship recipients will be taking a two week software engineering program . Karlie is donating $20,000 of her own money for the classes, which cost $2,000 per student, while the Flatiron school has offered to match her contribution. The blonde beauty, who describes herself as a 'model, ballerina and cookie expert' in the clip, explains that she learned how 'creative coding truly is' when she studied it last summer. 'Similar to dance and fashion, coding is a form of self-expression,' she says. 'It's a way to turn a cool, innovative idea into a product, website, app, tool or experience.' Karlie says it was this revelation that inspired her to share her passion with other girls across the country. Major revelation: Karlie attended the coding course, which costs $2,000 per student, last year . Deep in thought: The former Victoria's Secret Angel can be seen working on a computer programming project with other students . Completed project: Karlie and other students watched their hard work pay off as their creation took flight . After the course, her 20 scholarship recipients will understand the 'building blocks of coding' and have already built and deployed their own app to the web. In order to apply for the scholarship, female students are asked to film a 60 second video explaining how they plan to use their 'coding super powers' after they complete the course. Karlie took to social media yesterday to promote the opportunity, tweeting: 'Who runs the world? CODERS! Apply for the #KodeWithKarlie Scholarship @FlatironSchool for your chance to learn code! [sic]' And it's clear that Karlie, who also co-founded Karlie’s Kookies with chef and owner of Milk Bar Christina Tosi, takes her entrepreneurial roles and studies seriously. Stellar student: Karlie can be seen working with other students at the software engineering class last summer . Combined interests: The blonde beauty can be seen speaking on a panel about how technology revolutionized fashion week at SXSW in Austin, Texas . In February, it was announced that she was hanging up her Angel wings and leaving Victoria's Secret to focus on other business opportunities, as well as her classes at New York University. The model will be starting college at NYU's Gallatin School of Individualized Study in the fall, where she will study computer coding. Karlie, who covered the summer issue of Porter, told the magazine that she 'definitely could not get a job as a coder yet'. American girl: Karlie, who covers the summer issue of Porter, told the magazine she is 'fascinated' by computer coding . Catwalk queen: Karlie can be seen strutting down the runway at the Tom Ford show (L) and the Atelier Versace haute couture show (R) earlier this year . 'But it is something I am fascinated by, even if it is not the profession I choose,' she added. Karlie continued: 'Simply having the comprehension of the way that it works, having the ability to speak that language and to be able to not only comprehend it, but write and build something – the world is built on code.' And Karlie has no problem blending her two worlds together. Last month, she spoke on a panel about how technology revolutionized fashion week at SXSW in Austin, Texas.","The 22-year-old teamed up with the Flatiron School in New York to offer 20 girls free tuition to a two-week software engineering program .

"Sheriff's deputies undressed the body of a 20-year-old car crash victim  then took inappropriate nude photos of her  at the side of the road, her mother has claimed. Christina Mejia first outlined her accusations in a lawsuit filed against the Cook County Sheriff's Office in Illinois in 2010 and the trial is scheduled to begin next week. Her daughter, Jessica Mejia, was killed in the early hours of December 31, 2009 when her ex-boyfriend, Nicholas Sord, lost control of the car they were traveling in and smashed into a pole. When deputies arrived on the scene, they improperly removed clothing from Mejia's dead body and took photographs of her, according to the lawsuit. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Christina Mejia is pictured talking about her daughter Jessica, who was killed in a car crash in 2009. She is suing the responding deputies for stripping her daughter nearly naked and taking photos . Loss: Jessica Mejia, 20, was killed when her drunk ex-boyfriend smashed their car into a pole in 2009 . The young woman had been wearing a white t-shirt, jeans and high-heeled shoes but was photographed wearing just her lower undergarment, according to the Chicago Tribune. By doing so, the deputies intentionally caused emotional distress to the victim's family, they say. 'This was a young lady that just died and was treated with less dignity than a deer carcass you find on the side of the road,' family attorney Don Perry told the Tribune. Mrs Mejia added that the photos had left her feeling 'violated' and she accused the deputies' actions of perpetuating  false rumors that the car had crashed because her daughter was on top of Sord. '(People) think my daughter died from having sex, not from somebody being drunk and killing her,' the heartbroken mother told the Tribune. 'By the time everybody else got to the scene... she was partially naked because they made her naked. So the rumors, and the allegations... they made it believable.' But the sheriff's office insisted that it took the photographs at the scene in order to gather evidence that ultimately helped to convict Sord. They called the images 'standard operating procedure'. Locked up: Nicholas Sord, left, was sentenced to 56 months in prison for the deadly crash. Mejia's family filed a lawsuit against the sheriff's office for taking the photos and the trial will begin next week . 'The family suffered an unimaginable loss, and the crime scene photos were taken as our officers investigated this crime and were instrumental in securing a conviction against the person responsible for this tragic death,' spokeswoman Cara Smith said. 'In no way were these photos intended to cause harm to the family.' Sord, whose blood alcohol level was .236 per cent when he smashed his Mercedes SUV into a pole, pleaded guilty to drunken driving last fall and was sentenced to 56 months in prison. Sord was a business partner with former Chicago Blackhawks player Denis Savard and is the son of Bryan Sord, a prominent developer and restaurateur. He and Mejia had dated but had broken up months before the crash. Mejia was studying psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago when she died.","Jessica Mejia, 20, died when her drunk ex-boyfriend smashed their car into a pole in Cook County, Illinois in December 2009 .

"More than 140 children have been removed from their classes at schools in Washington because they could not prove they have had the required vaccinations. Health experts in the US have warned the country is in danger of being gripped by a measles pandemic because a growing number of people are not getting vaccinated against the virus and are being exposed to the rest of the population. The virus has swept several states in America and California and officials have warned there could be a danger of reversing the eradication of measles 15 years ago. They are also keen to prevent a return to the outbreak of 1989 when more than 100 people died. Scroll down for video . More than 100 pupils have been kicked out of their classes because they did not have completed vaccination forms, as health officials have warned about the danger of the spread of the measles virus (pictured) This week 143 pupils were removed from their classes in Spokane because they could not prove they had legally required vaccinations, which includes measles. And officials predict the number of children being kicked out of school in the state for not getting their jabs is likely to rise, as around 700 students in the district lack complete documents. Earlier this year, Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said he was concerned about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in America. He said there was concern over the growing number of people choosing not to have their injections to prevent the highly infectious disease and has called for more people to be vaccinated . In February around 100 people were diagnosed with the virus across 15 states. Last month officials in California confirmed 119 people had been diagnosed with measles after visiting Disneyland in Anaheim. The outbreak is believed to have started when an overseas tourist with measles visited the theme park. American officials are calling for children to be vaccinated against measles in order to prevent a pandemic . Spokane school district officials are believed to be the first to remove children from schools in a bid to prevent the spread of measles. District spokesman Kevin Morrison said: 'We're the front-runners . 'Given the increased awareness that the world has of the possibility of pandemic, I think heightened awareness is certainly not a bad thing.' Mr Morrison said complete documentation is important to protecting students so that if there was an outbreak at school staff would know which students to send home. Measles is a highly infectious disease that is characterised by a rash, runny nose and fever. In extreme cases it can be fatal. Children are routinely protected against the virus through the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine but some parents choose not to allow their children to have the jab because they personally disagree with it or due to problems with their offspring's immune system. Dr Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control said the spread of measles could increase because of a growing number of people who have not been vaccinated being exposed to the population . Pupils in Spokane were removed from school on Monday and will be allowed to return once their parents either get the required vaccinations, or sign waivers saying they were opposed to one or more vaccinations, Mr Morrison confirmed. The Spokane district has about 30,000 students, and only about 729 students lack the required documentation. Mr Morrison did not speculate on whether other school districts in the region or the state would follow. After the measles outbreak, Spokane district officials discovered about six percent of their students lacked proper vaccination documentation. In February they launched a program to inform parents that their children needed vaccinations or waivers. The school district and the Spokane Regional Health District also held a series of vaccination clinics. This helped reduce the lack of compliance to around three per cent. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in an infected person's nose and throat mucus and spreads through coughing and sneezing. The CDCP warned: Measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. 'If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected.' Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and a red rash that usually first appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The infection can lead to blindness and even death. Children aged one to four are most vulnerable. The CDPH warned medics to ask patients if they have either travelled to areas with a measles problem or locations domestically with a large number of foreign tourists from infected areas. The process of ensuring students are vaccinated is complicated because 60 different languages are spoken by students in the Spokane district, and about 30 percent of the students leave their school each year. Tracking vaccinations is especially difficult for students who come from out-of-state or other countries. At least 92 percent of the population of America is vaccinated. However, the number of children who are not vaccinated, is higher in some states, particularly in California where a number of cases are believed to have originated. The virus from Disneyland has so far infected 94 people in eight states, and 67 can be clearly linked to the theme park, health officials reported. It is believed to be linked to a similar outbreak in the Philippines. In California an estimated eight per cent of kindergartners fail to get the required immunizations against measles, mumps and rubella. Some people choose not to get their children vaccinated for personal reasons, or it may be because their immune system is compromised. Children under one year old are not vaccinated because their bodies cannot cope with the vaccine. The issue of vaccination against measles is a historically controversial one. In a 1998 UK study the triple MMR vaccine was linked to autism, causing parents to panic and refuse to get their children vaccinated - leading to a rise in cases and resulting deaths and permanent injuries. However this paper by Andrew Wakefield was partially withdrawn from the Lancet in 2010 and fully retracted in 2014 after it was proven to be fraudulent. Wakefield was found guilty of serious  professional misconduct and was struck off the register. His claims have been disproved by a number of scientific studies. Last week Robert Kennedy Jr waded into a debate about proposals to remove the rights of parents to refuse to get their children vaccinated by comparing it to the holocaust. He claimed there was a link between autism and thimeresol, an ingredient in vaccines, and said: 'This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.' Multiple studies have rejected this link and this week Kennedy apologised for his comments.","Pupils in Spokane, Washington, were removed from classes on Monday .

"A cyclist who was killed in an accident with a lorry in London has been named as a former design chief of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Moira Gemmill, 55, was cycling to work at St James's Palace where she had begun a new role at the Royal Collection Trust, when she collided with a lorry near Lambeth Bridge in Westminster. The leading art and design figure, who had recently been chosen to oversee a programme of renovations at Windsor Castle, was the fifth cyclist killed on London's road this year. Moira Gemmill, 55, was killed by a tipper lorry while cycling to work near Lambeth Bridge yesterday morning . She had recently left her position as director of design at the V&A, where she led the planning and implementation of FuturePlan, an on-going restoration and redesign programme of its galleries. Ms Gemmill, a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, spent more than 10 years at the museum before taking up her new position as director of capital programmes at the Royal Collection Trust. Her devastated brother Andrew, 59, speaking from the family home in Scotland, today told the Evening Standard: 'She was a wonderful, inspirational woman. 'She was absolutely extraordinary but in a very modest way. She lived a modest life. She was very excited about her new post, we all were.' The accident happened at the junction of Millbank and Horseferry Road shortly after 9.30am on Thursday . Her brother Andrew Gemmill described his sister as an 'extraordinary' woman who lived a 'modest life' Martin Roth, current director of the V&A, paid tribute to his former colleague, stating she had made a 'remarkable contribution' in her 13-years at the museum. He said: 'We are devastated to hear of the tragic death of our much-loved and respected colleague of many years, Moira Gemmill. 'During her 13-year career at the V&A she made an extraordinary impact in transforming the museum’s galleries and facilities with the FuturePlan programme of restoration, refurbishment and redesign. 'Major projects included the Medieval & Renaissance Galleries and most recently the Weston Cast Court. 'I cannot overstate Moira’s remarkable contribution in making the V&A the global leader in museum design that it is today. She will be greatly missed and our thoughts are with her family at this very sad time.' Ms Gemmill, who lived in Kennington, south London, had been a judge for the Architectural Review's (AR) Women in Architecture Awards since their launch in 2011 and an avid supporter of the campaign. AR editor Christine Murray said: 'She believed in the importance of creating a more equal profession. The profession has lost one of its great patrons and champions.' Having grown up in a farming family in Kintyre in Scotland, Ms Gemmill studied graphic design and photography at the Glasgow School of Art. Later, she worked for Aberdeen Art Gallery and in 2011 was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. She had recently left her position as director of design at the V&A (pictured), where she led the planning and implementation of FuturePlan, an on-going restoration and redesign programme of its galleries . The V&A today posted on Twitter: 'Devastated to hear of the tragic death of Moira Gemmill who transformed the V&A during 13yrs as Director of Design. She'll be greatly missed.' Clare Hughes, a creative producer and filmmaker, replied: 'Huge sympathies - Moira was an inspirational to us all and her legacy will be treasured the world over.' Police were called to the junction of Millbank and Horseferry Road shortly after 9.30am yesterday morning and Ms Gemmill was pronounced dead half an hour later. The 40-year-old driver of the tipper lorry stopped at the scene but was not arrested. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course, police said.","Moira Gemmill, 55, was cycling to work when she collided with tipper lorry .

"Nick Clegg was heckled over his broken tuition fees pledge today as he ramped up his attack on George Osborne – with a stark warning that the Tory Chancellor is 'a very dangerous man'. The Deputy Prime Minister was met by protesters in Surbiton, south-west London, who chanted: 'Nick Clegg lied to me, he said uni would be free'. Mr Clegg ignored the protesters as he stuck to his message that only the Lib Dems can be trusted to balance the budget without hitting the poor. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg was heckled by tuition fees protesters while out campaigning in Surbiton, South West London, today - while Lib Dem supporters tried to intervene . Nick Clegg was in Kingston and Surbiton to campaign with fellow Cabinet member, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Ed Davey today . The Lib Dem leader's campaign stop came after he launched a furious attack on the 'ideological' cuts planned by the Tories. Speaking to Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell in May's edition of GQ magazine, Mr Clegg said the chancellor's plans would do 'so much damage'. He added: 'I don't know of a developed economy that wants to do something as rigidly ideological as he wants to do, to balance the books through public spending reductions alone, not tax, with one section, the working poor, taking the biggest hit. 'I find it socially and morally unacceptable, but also economically a disaster.' The 'dramatic lurch to the right' involves a 'harder approach than anything the arch-Thatcherites would do' and would 'destroy public services', he said. Mr Clegg added: 'George Osborne is a very dangerous man with a very dangerous plan, and I will do everything in my power to stop it.' In contrast, Mr Clegg said the Prime Minister was 'a classic traditional shire Tory', adding: 'I can live with that.' He said Mr Cameron was 'very much a Tory, and in that tradition he is not too much about grand vision'. The Deputy Prime Minister launched a furious attack on the 'ideological' cuts planned by the Tories . Mr Clegg met seven-month-old Elise Popperwell and her mother Melissa Popperwell in South West London this morning . The Deputy Prime Minister said David Cameron was 'a classic traditional shire Tory', adding: 'I can live with that.' Asked about Ed Miliband, Mr Clegg said he was a 'perfectly nice guy, personable, as is David Cameron'. The Lib Dem leader said he wanted his party back in government 'because Osborne's ideological assault on public services has to be stopped' and 'Ed Miliband and Ed Balls' head-in-the-sand approach to public spending has to be challenged, because it would be really bad for the economy'. Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander meanwhile claimed that a top Tory told him 'you take care of the workers and we'll take care of the bosses', in a private Whitehall meeting to discuss the Coalition Government's priorities. Mr Alexander said it showed that David Cameron and George Osborne were guilty of 'breathtaking hypocrisy' for trying to claim responsibility for raising the threshold at which people pay tax - while privately arguing for tax cuts for the better-off. He said: 'In March 2012, when the economy was still in the very early stages of recovery, we wanted to do a very big increase in the personal allowance to put a lot of money back into folks' pockets. The Tories' priority at the time was the top rate of tax. 'I remember one meeting with a group of senior Conservatives and one of them said, 'listen, you take care of the workers and we'll take care of the bosses'.","Deputy PM was met by protesters in Surbiton, south-west London .

"Disbelief. That’s what you feel when you meet a rhino in the wild. You just can’t come to terms with the fact that you and he are sharing the same air, the same continent, the same century. I’ve had close-up experience with three of the world’s five surviving species of rhino: the white rhino looks like the main battle tank of an extra-terrestrial army, while the black is more like a hot-rod armoured car. The greater one-horned rhino, meanwhile, sometimes called the Indian rhino, looks as if it’s been riveted together from pieces of boiler-plate. Surely they can’t be real. You feel as if you’ve slipped back into the Jurassic era and were looking at some great horned dinosaur, for they couldn’t possibly be part of the 21st century. It’s as if the creatures of the past had suddenly invaded the present, as if the Lost World of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had been found again. Scroll down for video . Guarded: A four man team of armed guards now protects Sudan the Northern White Rhino who is the last male of his species . But then you think: hang on a minute. These rhinos are nothing to do with dinosaurs or with any vanished world. They’re mammals, just like you and me, and they’re as admirably adapted for the current century as we are. They’re as modern as a child born yesterday: part of our present, not part of our past. Yes, give them a fair crack of the whip and they’d be as successful as any of the big creatures we have left on our planet, for in many countries the wild places they depend on are still in fine shape and perfectly capable of supporting any number of rhinos. So why are we running out of them? Why does the last surviving male of the northern sub-species of the white rhino now live under a 24-hour guard? Why has he been stripped of his horn? Why is it that we seem to be on the brink of losing an entire race of rhinos? Threatened: Sudan is the target of poachers looking to sell rhino horn which can make up to £47,000 a kilo . This is the lonely rhino, known as Sudan, guarded day and night by rangers who risk their own lives as they try to keep him from poachers. Even without his horn, his keepers in the Kenyan reserve of Ol Pejeta fear for his safety. It seems like madness —because it is madness. A rhino’s horn is made from keratin, the same stuff as fingernails. You could collect your nail clippings and try to sell them, claiming that they were magic and capable of curing all kinds of things. You could try selling your keratin at £47,000 a kilo. You probably wouldn’t find many takers, but it’s no more absurd than selling rhino horn for the same purposes and price. People will pay an absurd amount for an absurd product because of an absurd belief: that rhino horn is the most wonderful kind of medicine. Today, the wildlife business — including the sale of rhino horn — represents the third-largest illegal trade in the world, after arms and drugs. It offers a considerable opportunity for criminals, because the authorities don’t enforce the laws against it with anything like the same seriousness as they do with weapons and narcotics. And there is huge — and growing — demand. In 2007, 13 rhinos were poached and killed in South Africa. The horns were removed and they were sold on the Asian medicine market. Dangerous: The rangers are aware they are risking their lives to protect the enormous animal . Failure: But attempts at breeding have been unsuccessful - and Sudan is now getting old . Last year in South Africa 1,215 rhinos were poached and killed. That’s one every eight hours. We’re running out of rhinos. The massacre is taking place across Africa and into Asia. It’s driven by money, and the more horn costs the more desirable the stuff becomes. Prestige, status, vanity and belief in magic drive the trade in rhino horn. The fact that it’s useless for anyone but a rhino has no bearing on demand. Rhino horn has for centuries been part of traditional Chinese medicine, and it’s used to treat disorders of the blood. It’s never been used as an aphrodisiac: that’s a fantasy from bewildered Westerners. Increasing prosperity in China has led to higher demand. But as the South African poaching figures show, the market has jumped from steady but borderline sustainable to completely crazy, which has put rhinos on the fast-track to extinction. That’s largely because of the entry of a new player: Vietnam. The country’s new wealth has kick-started a craze for rhino horn. They take a much more free and easy attitude to its powers there: it’s regarded as a cure for cancer, and it’s also used a pick-me-up after a big night. The effects of a powerful hangover can, people believe, be controlled — all it takes is one very rich man and one very dead rhino. Can the trade possibly be stopped? There are two ways of doing so: policing the poaching, smuggling and sale with more commitment, and reducing the demand in the places where people buy the stuff. In 2012, the South African and Vietnamese governments signed a memorandum of understanding, agreeing to work with closer co-operation to stop the trade. You can see how well that’s worked. In Vietnam a non-governmental organisation called Education for Nature in Vietnam (ENV) is trying to make rhino horn uncool. It has a public service announcement with Vietnam’s great singing diva, Hong Nhung, standing by a poached and dehorned corpse telling the Vietnamese not to use rhino horn. And in another sequence, a comedian plays a rich man trying to impress the girls with his hideously expensive chunk of horn. The most beautiful girl says: ‘It impresses no one, especially not me.’ ENV runs a hotline for information about rhino horn use and a database. It also has good contacts in government and works on policy. The organisation has plenty of young volunteers and a good deal of their work is making rhino horn unthinkable for the next generation. It gets some of its funding from the excellent London-based organisation Save The Rhino — of which I’m a patron. Extreme measures: Rangers have even cut off the rhino's horn - but they fear it won't be enough . Hungry: Feeding time in Sudan's enclosure - he spent most of his life in a Czech zoo . There are also many good projects for rhino conservation in Africa and across the world. The Luangwa Valley in Zambia once held 4,000 black rhinos: they were poached out over 20 years and declared extinct in Zambia in 1998. Five years later, a project to release captive-bred black rhinos began: there are now 34 roaming free in the valley. Most problems with conservation come from the rising human population, and with it, the destruction of habitat. In so many parts of the world, we are running out of room. But there’s plenty of room left for rhinos in Africa. Conserving rhinos should be easy, yet they’re going extinct not because of overcrowding but from human folly. Rhinos are being killed because of belief in a discredited form of magic and the simple love of showing off. And yet you can go out into the wild areas of the world, especially in Africa, and still get close to these vast beasts. I once spent a day in Zimbabwe tracking a big male black rhino on foot and when at last we found him it seemed this might have been a mistake. There he was, 20 yards away, looking at me looking at him. One of those moments of eternity. But after a while he relaxed and got on with his life, snacking on bushes. Big solid, fast and armed with that wonderful great bodger on his bonce, he’s a modern creature fully equipped for the modern world, if only we’d let him get on with it. But we’re killing him off with money, greed, political inertia, incompetent policing, superstition and deadly vanity. So, a suggestion if you happen to be suffering from a hangover and wish to cure it. Try biting your nails. It’s every bit as effective as a dead rhino.","Sudan is guarded day and night by rangers to keep him from poachers .

"While Easter in the UK is celebrated with chocolate eggs and a roast lamb, in Greece they mark the day slightly differently - and a week later. As Orthodox Easter Sunday was held, thousands of homemade rockets were aimed at church towers in the Aegean island of Chios by rival parishioners in their traditional ‘mock war’. Dozens of brave souls even attend the late-night services inside the churches of Aghios Markos and Panaghia Erithiani while the annual battle is held – even when the structures and surrounding homes are ringed in defensive veils of chicken wire.

Although small firework displays are held at churches around the country at midnight services on Easter Saturday - despite official disapproval from Church officials - Vrontados is in a league of its own, drawing spectators from all over Greece and abroad. The custom dates back to the 19th century, when the island was under Turkish occupation, but may have older roots. Preparations last all year, while on the Saturday morning participants parade their hardware through the village in lorries, honking their horns.

"Police investigating the theft of 12 prize-winning guinea pigs from a top breeder have not ruled out - a rival competitor. Heartbroken owner Tony Tancock believes only an expert could have targetted the dozen show-quality guinea pigs stolen leaving more ordinary rodents behind. Tony, 56, has won accolades for his specially-bred cavies and has shown them off at events around the country. But he was devastated after a thief snuck into an outbuilding at his home in Crediton, Devon, to steal his prized pets leaving eight behind. Robbed: Police investigating the theft of 12 prize-winning guinea pigs from top breeder Tony Tancock (pictured) have not ruled out - a rival competitor . Sabotage: Heartbroken owner Tancock (pictured) believes only an expert could have targetted the dozen show-quality guinea pigs . He said: 'They knew exactly what they were looking for. They took two tortoiseshells, two black and two brown, all short-haired guinea pigs that besides being show-quality, were also beloved family pets. 'They left six which were not show quality, plus two other show ones.' Tony yesterday issued a desperate plea to the thief to return the treasured pets to him. He said: 'Please bring them back. I miss them dearly and am really worried about them. I would like to know they didn't just get bumped off. They were priceless to me.' Guinea pig fancying took off in the 1890s but a fascination for the furry animals began when they were introduced to Britain from South America in the 1500s. They are still bred for their meat in several countries on the South American continent and are a particular delicacy in the Andes. The biggest event in a guinea pig fanciers calendar - the Bradford Championship Show - draws hundreds of participating critters, competing in categories separated according to breeds. But Tony said that unless his guinea pigs are returned he will not be able to appear at any shows this year. A cavy expert has warned the thefts could be a hate crime from someone with a score to settle. But Bryan Mayoh, chairman of the British Cavy Council, expressed shock at the suggestion a fellow competitor could have deliberately targeted Tony. Heart-broken: Mr Tancock was devastated after a thief snuck into an outbuilding at his home in Crediton, Devon, to steal his prized pets leaving eight behind . He said: 'I would suggest that a personal dispute is a far more likely explanation than that some person was envious of his cavies. 'Real fanciers know how important cavies are to other fanciers and would not dream of trying to steal animals from them. 'In addition, it is very likely that someone attempting to remove cavies at a show would be noticed by other fanciers. 'In 25 years of showing I never had a cavy stolen, nor have any of my fancier friends.' 'But my advice would be to be vigilant of anyone behaving suspiciously at a show and ensure that garden sheds in which cavies are kept at home are padlocked when the owner is absent.' Police say they are investigating the thefts and asked anyone with information to contact them on 101.","Heart-broken Tony Tancock, 56, has won prizes for specially-bred guinea pigs .

"Michael Scott Shemansky is on the run after authorities named him as a suspect in the murder of his mother . A Florida man wanted as a suspect in the murder of his own mother has been on the run from police since Saturday. Police say Michael Scott Shemansky came to their attention after he failed to appear for a supervised visit with his son on the same day mother Sandra Shemansky, 57, was found dead at the home they shared in Winter Garden. The body was discovered at the West Colonial Drive home when an out-of-state family member called in a well-being check. WKMG reports that an initial investigation determined there was foul play. 'My biggest concern is that he might come back,' said neighbor Natalie Randall, a resident of the Winter Garden RV Resort. An attorney for his estranged wife confirmed Shemansky's failure to appear for the scheduled visit. He is already on parole for battery on law enforcement, has a history of bipolar mental illness, and was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward for an attempted suicide. His mother was there to help him as he went through a divorce. His wife filed a domestic violence injunction against him two years ago, according to her attorney, Diana Knowles Dunlop. Neighbors said his mother may have been the one preventing him from making the meeting with his son. Neighbors at the Winter Garden RV Resort believe divorce proceedings may have pushed Shemansky over the edge . 'His mom wouldn't allow him to go,' Nathan Tanner told reporters. 'She said because she didn't want him to have no more trouble through the courts.' Tanner added the stress of the divorce proceedings may have pushed him over the edge. 'And he got some paperwork Friday that was, I guess, bad news and I guess that triggered him,' Tanner told WFTV. Authorities have the murder weapon, still not publicly identified, but will not yet confirm how Sandra Shemansky was killed, according to information given to local press by Police Lt. Scott Allen. He allegedly was seen going into the trailer park's office and asking for a glass of water shortly after the murder. Shemansky was last seen fleeing on foot without any sort of provisions and no medication. His estranged wife is reportedly preparing to protect himself on the chance he arrives at her home. Anyone with information as to his whereabouts is urged to contact authorities at 407-656-3636.","Police say Michael Scott Shemansky came to their attention after he failed to appear for a supervised visit with his son Saturday .

"Book of the week . NATURALISTS IN PARADISE: WALLACE , BATES AND SPRUCE IN THE AMAZON . By John Hemming . (Thames & Hudson £19.95) Back in 1961 three young Oxford graduates set off to explore the Iriri river in a remote part of the Amazon. One of them, Richard Mason, became the last Englishman to be killed by an uncontacted tribe, when he was murdered with bows and arrows. The second, Kit Lambert, went on to manage The Who. But for the third, John Hemming, the trip was the beginning of a lifelong fascination with the region, and a distinguished career writing about it. Bird of paradise: A musician wren . More than 50 years on, that same fascination still shines out of every page of Naturalists In Paradise, the compelling story of an earlier trio of young British explorers. At first sight - and several subsequent ones - 'paradise' mightn't seem the obvious word to describe the Amazon basin in the mid 19th century. A huge anti-government uprising had destroyed much of whatever infrastructure there had been. River transport, the only kind available, still relied on getting the local Indians to do the paddling - or, when faced with waterfalls and rapids, the heavy lifting. Flooding could cause chunks of land, some of several acres, to come hurtling down the river, smashing everything in their way. And of course, there was a spectacular array of biting and stinging insects - including mosquitoes, which nobody had yet linked to malaria. Nonetheless, for naturalists as driven as Alfred Russel Wallace, Henry Bates and Richard Spruce, a paradise is exactly what the Amazon was. Even after being attacked by a particularly nasty species of wasp, Spruce wrote of his admiration for 'their beauty, ingenuity and heroic ferocity'. These days, the image of 19th-century British travellers is perhaps of public-school types airily bossing the natives about, possibly from a sedan chair. Well, not in this case - because Wallace, Bates and Spruce were all classic examples of Victorian self-improvement. None was from a rich family and none went to school beyond 14. All, however, soon set about the urgent task of educating themselves. At 15, Bates was working 13 hours a day, six days a week, as a hosiery apprentice. Fortunately, that didn't prevent him from learning Greek, Latin, French, Drawing and Composition at the local Mechanics' Institute in Leicester, or from developing a passion for natural history. Naturalist Richard Spruce . The young Wallace loved nothing better than to curl up with the poetry of Milton or Dante - until he discovered the joys of plant classification. Aged 17, Spruce carefully listed 403 species of plants near his Yorkshire home, before surrendering to the seemingly irresistible appeal of mosses and liverworts. When Wallace and Bates met in Leicester in 1844, apparently at the public library, they immediately realised they were kindred spirits. Four years later, still in their early 20s and having found a London agent to sell any specimens they sent back, they sailed to Brazil, which was already recognised as an ecological treasure-trove. In fact, after a few months together, the pair amicably separated. (Bates preferred to stay in one place for months at a time, while Wallace liked to go wherever his more impulsive nose led him.) A year later, Spruce arrived to begin his own Amazon adventures, bumping into the others only occasionally. What followed was a story - or three stories - of quietly stirring heroism. Sad to say, in the port of Bélem where they landed, the biggest difference from England that Wallace and Bates noticed was the comparative lack of drunkenness. Once they headed inland, though, they were in another world entirely. They were also among people either puzzled or amused that they had come so far just to collect some plants and animals. In general, the Indians proved remarkably hospitable, as well as astonishingly skilful boatmen. Not all tribal traditions were to English tastes - including the one where the dead were buried in the village's huts, dug up a month later, cooked, pounded into a powder, mixed with alcohol and drunk by the assembled company. The non-Indian locals, meanwhile, were a distinctly mixed bunch. In one village, Bates was amazed to come across a man whose mud-hut contained a library of well-thumbed Latin classics. In another, Wallace was both shocked and delighted by a cheerfully dissolute priest. As an Amazon explorer himself, Hemming describes the endless hardships almost matter-of-factly, which only makes it clearer how hair-raising they were. Even so, when it comes to understatement, he's still no match for the three Victorians. After Wallace shot part of his own hand off, he confessed to feeling 'rather miserable'. Later, he described the ants eating him alive as 'not the most agreeable companions'. Above all, though, these men collected: gathering specimens of every conceivable type, no matter what condition they were in. 'With bleeding feet and an empty stomach, I found the journey sufficiently toilsome,' wrote Spruce of one trip. 'But this did not prevent me gathering plants' - although, on a wimpier note, when he was 'near dying of hunger' he did collect only in the afternoons. Then there was the equally tricky business of preserving the specimens in wet jungle conditions until they could be packaged up for the journey to London. As Hemming emphasises, it's almost miraculous that so much of what the three collected made it back in such good condition. Bates alone managed to send 14,712 species, with the number of specimens naturally far higher. The biggest loss, in fact, came when the boat on which Wallace was travelling home in 1852 caught fire, destroying his notebooks and the live animals he'd brought with him. Happily, he was rescued after only a week in an open boat 700 miles from land. A lesser man might well have been discouraged by the experience. Yet within two years, Wallace was off again, this time for eight years of collecting in Asia. There, he also developed a theory of natural selection that Charles Darwin realised was virtually the same as the one he himself had been sitting on for two decades - and so quickly set about writing The Origin Of Species. 'I could never have approached the completeness of his book,' Wallace generously declared when it was published. Meanwhile, back in Amazonia, Bates and Spruce were still collecting away... Hemming tells the story of this extraordinary trio without hype, wisely content to let the facts and their own reflections speak largely for themselves. He does, however, add the occasional telling update: we learn that some of the tribes that helped the three men are sadly now extinct. But perhaps the most striking moment of all comes with a short footnote on page 106 that reminds us how much the world has changed. Having sailed through a series of thunderstorms, Spruce gets separated from his companions on a jungle trek and fears he's going to die. But then, deep in the lonely forest, he hears something he's long dreamed of hearing: a musician wren, which sings like a music box. 'Modern readers,' the footnote reads, 'can hear this bird by visiting www.xeno-canto.org and searching for “musician wren”.' Try it. I guarantee that it will brighten your day.","Naturalists In Paradise tells the tale of an early trio of British explorers .

"She helped to transform U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama's public image into that of an all-American 'everywoman' who shops at retail outlets, does 'mom dancing' and even has a Twitter account. Now, former White House aide Kristina Schake, who left the East Wing in June 2013, is reportedly behind the drive to get another first lady - ex-secretary of state, Hillary Clinton - elected president. Ms Schake, 45, who has worked as chief communications officer at L'Oreal USA for the past two years, has been brought on to Mrs Clinton's 2016 communications team to help recast her image. She will attempt to turn the 67-year-old politician - who is expected to  announce her run for White House this month - from a strong and knowledgeable figure into a softer, more accessible one, according to the New York Times. Scroll down for video . Image makeover: Former White House aide Kristina Schake (left), who left the East Wing in June 2013, is reportedly behind the drive to get  ex=secretary of state, Hillary Clinton (right), elected president next year . Accessible personality: Ms Schake helped to transform U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama's public image into that of an all-American 'everywoman' who even performed 'mom dancing' with Jimmy Fallon in 2013 (above) The former persona, experts have said, could have hampered Mrs Clinton's 2008 presidential contest against President Barack Obama, who came across as cool and amiable with voters. The latter persona, meanwhile, has worked wonders for Mrs Obama, who has become a national emblem of healthier eating with her legislative push for more fruit and vegetables in school meals. As Obama noted in 2008, Mrs Clinton must show voters that she is more than just 'likeable enough' - by displaying a warm and funny side that, according to her friends, reflects her true character. But, Ms Schake's efforts to help Mrs Clinton do this could prove tricky - particularly in the wake of the scandal over her new boss's exclusive use of a personal email address while secretary of state. A U.S. House committee is currently seeking a private interview with Mrs Clinton over her use of the private address, as well as a personal computer server, during her time at the State Department. Ms Schake's attempts could also be hindered by some voters' views that the politician and her husband Bill - parents to daughter Chelsea - are detached from the issues of 'normal' Americans. Scandal: Ms Schake's efforts to help Mrs Clinton do this could prove tricky - particularly in the wake of the scandal over her new boss's exclusive use of a personal email address during her time as secretary of state . 'True self': As Obama noted in 2008, Mrs Clinton (seen listening to an instructor reading a story to children at a Firststep NYC session in Brooklyn on Wednesday) must show she is more than just 'likeable enough' The couple have reportedly amassed more than $100million since leaving the White House in 2000, and continue to command speaking fees of a whopping $200,000 or more, according to the Times. They also have multiple homes, including one in Washington DC and one in Chappaqua, New York . To counter Mrs Clinton's apparent inaccessibility, Ms Schake, whose work with Mrs Obama helped to turn her into an online video star and magazine cover model, could draw on the politician's hobbies. She could get Mrs Clinton to speak about her passion for swimming, as reported by ABC, or appear at a charity swimming gala. She could also fix up celebrity partnerships like she did with Mrs Obama. The multitude of new ways to reach voters means 'it’s not the same formula in politics that it was even just four years ago or eight years ago,'  Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist, told The Times. Undercover: During her time as an aide for Mrs Obama, Ms Schake encouraged the current First Lady to shop undercover at a Target (pictured) in Alexandria, Virginia, dressed in a floral blouse and a baseball cap . Presenter: Ms Schake's work also led to Mrs Obama presenting the best picture award alongside Hollywood legend Jack Nicholson at the Academy Awards in February 2013. The trophy was given to the film, Argo . The deputy campaign manager for the Obama reelection campaign added: 'It’s about understanding people who are just living their lives and figuring out ways to fit a candidate into that', not vice versa. During her time as an aide for Mrs Obama, Ms Schake encouraged the current First Lady to shop undercover at a Target in Alexandria, Virginia, dressed in a floral blouse and a baseball cap. The widely-reported trip was intended to her portray the 51-year-old - who has two daughters, Sasha and Malia, with her husband - as an ordinary mom, keen to make savings for her family. Successful: Ms Schake (pictured), who previously co-owned a LA-based PR firm that handled media relations for Maria Shriver, is the daughter of a stay-at-home mother and a commercial airline pilot . Ms Schake's work also led to Mrs Obama presenting the best picture award alongside Hollywood legend Jack Nicholson at the Academy Awards in February 2013, according to the Washington Post. And she encouraged the First Lady to invite children to the White House to help harvest the summer crop from the House's kitchen garden in 2013 - an event that was photographed by the world's press. The adviser, from California, 'did a really great job of keeping Mrs Obama at the forefront of the conversation but in a way that continued her ability to be accessible and relatable,' Ms Schake's predecessor Camille Johnston told the newspaper, adding: 'No small feat during a presidential election cycle.' Indeed, Ms Schake's 'feat' saw Mrs Obama feature on the front covers of both Vogue  (twice) and Better Homes & Gardens magazine. Ultimately, it turned her into an 'accessible everywoman', the Times reported. And Ms Schake's impact is still apparent today - this week, an energetic Mrs Obama performed a second installment of 'Evolution of the Mom Dance' on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Her performance came  two years after she took part in her original 'Mom Dancing' skit with Fallon, which was encouraged by Ms Schake and gained more than 22million views on YouTube. It marked the five-year anniversary of her Let's Move! initiative to fight childhood obesity in America. Ms Schake, who previously co-owned a Los Angeles-based PR firm that handled media relations for Maria Shriver, is the daughter of a stay-at-home mother and an airline pilot, it is reported. She was the co-founder and board member of the American Foundation for Equal Rights - the nonprofit group that filed the successful federal lawsuit against California's ban on gay marriage, . She currently lives with her boyfriend, an Albanian journalist. After Ms Schake left the White House in 2013, Maria Cristina 'MC' Gonzalez Noguera, 39, was hired as the Obamas' communications director. Fitness initaitive: Mrs Obama participates in a yoga class during a visit to the Gwen Cherry Park NFL/YET Center as she celebrates the fourth Anniversary of Let's Move on February 25, 2014 in Miami, Florida . Mrs Obama tweeted The Chew this week, encouraging the show to participate in her #GimmeFive challenge . On Friday, it was revealed that Mrs Clinton has signed a lease in a Brooklyn, New York, building for what is expected to house her campaign headquarters, according to a person familiar with the plans. Mrs Clinton has reportedly signed the lease for two floors in an office in New York's Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. The anonymous person was not authorized to speak publicly about internal planning. The decision to sign the lease - which was first reported by Politico - likely sets off a 15-day period in which presidential candidates are required to make their intentions officially known. The building, One Pierrepont Plaza, also houses the U.S. attorney's office of Loretta Lynch, who has been nominated to be President Barack Obama's next attorney general.

"Matthew Kenney smoked Flakka and then ran naked . A Florida man who was high on a designer drug called Flakka stripped and ran naked through traffic in Fort Lauderdale to escape from imaginary killers who he believed stole his clothes and wanted to murder him. Matthew Kenney, 34, told police he smoked Flakka before he streaked though traffic early on Saturday evening while only wearing a pair of sneakers. Flakka, which can be injected, snorted, smoked, swallowed or taken with other substances, has been nicknamed '$5 insanity' for its mind-bending effects and cheap cost. After he was arrested, Kenney told police he would 'rather die than be caught by these unknown people', the Sun Sentinel reported. He added that 'if I got hit by a car they would stop chasing me' according to a Fort Lauderdale Police reported. Kenney has previous arrests for disorderly conduct, making a riot and possession of a controlled substance. He was hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation. Flakka is usually made from the chemical alpha-PVP, a synthetic version of the stimulant cathinone. That is the same type of chemical that is used to make bath salts. Scroll down for video .

"The devastated parents of a 31-year-old Australian nurse who died six days after giving birth to her second child have revealed how doctors once told them their daughter wouldn't even live to see her sixth birthday, let alone have her own children. Anne-Louise van den Nieuwenhof was diagnosed with a rare bone and soft tissue cancer, called Ewing’s sarcoma, aged just five, and her parents were informed she only had three months to live. Incredibly Anne-Louise went on to defy all the odds against her, eventually moving to Canada where she worked as a nurse and began raising her own family. However, she tragically died  during a routine hospital check-up for her baby girl Elizabeth Kelly, near her home in Rossland, British Columbia in Canada, six days after giving birth on March 10. A fundraising page set up by her friends has raised an incredible $40,000 in her memory. Anne-Louise van den Nieuwenhof (right) died suddenly just six days after giving birth to her baby daughter (centre) ‘After such immense joy, there is now such sadness and pain over this tragic loss,’ the page says. Anne-Louise, who grew up in Sydney, collapsed in the waiting area of the Canadian hospital and is believed to have died suddenly from a burst cyst in her pancreas. Her husband Ryan Kelly wrote on Facebook after her death: ‘Instantly all the hospital’s emergency staff were there and did everything in their power and worked longer than ever before but couldn't bring my love, partner, mother to my children, best friend back from the angels.’ In a touching tribute he said: ‘It's not fair, nothing could be more sad or devastating. But we have been swallowed by love and support and energy of a community spread all over the world, we all will carry on and be strong for Lou and follow her courageous example of living.' Ryan is now tasked with raising their two-year-old son Emerson and newborn Elizabeth as a single parent. Anne-Louise's two children, Emerson (left) and Elizabeth (right), are being for by her husband and their father Ryan . Anne-Louise (right) was with her husband Ryan (left) when she collapsed in the waiting area of a Canadian hospital . He said the children are ‘both doing great’ and noted ‘we all are feeling the love you all are sending. It is giving us strength to get through this terrible time. We couldn't do it without you.’ Anne-Louise’s father Ray van den Nieuwenhof told the Sydney Morning Herald how his daughter had courageously battled cancer at the age of five after being given a triple dose of chemotherapy. She developed the cancer again while in Year 11 at school and underwent extensive surgery but went on to become a high achiever, who flourished in sport, politics and her medical career. Anne-Louise van den Nieuwenhof's Facebook photo shows her with her siblings Mary-Ellen, Timothy and Michael . A Gofundme page set up to help the family reads: ‘Lou was an amazing young woman. She was a fantastic mom to two year old Emerson and little Beth, devoted spouse, best friend and soulmate to Ryan, and loved dearly by all of her family and friends. ‘She touched the lives of everyone she knew through her contagious smile, support and compassion for others and love for life and adventure. She will be forever missed.’ In a tragic twist, one of Anne-Louise's colleagues at the hospital where she worked was killed on the way home from her funeral on Thursday. Amanda Koppin's car was hit by a tree which fell from a cliff while she was driving with her husband and two-year-old son.","Anne-Louise van den Nieuwenhof was diagnosed with cancer at age five .

"A debate between two Oklahoma roommates about whether an iPhone is better than an Android ended in a violent brawl with a stabbing and assault using beer bottles. Jiaro Mendez and Elias Acevedo were both found to be 'highly intoxicated' by Tulsa police following the fight that broke out in the parking lot of their shared apartment on April 14 around 1am.

"A row has erupted over controversial plans to demolish an historic Grade I listed crescent designed by the architect of Buckingham Palace and replace it with a £500milion block of luxury flats. After angering locals with an initial proposal, the developer has now submitted fresh plans to demolish the John Nash-designed Park Crescent West and rebuild it as apartments. The crescent's facade will look near-on identical to its current design, but residents who live behind the site are furious at the proposals, claiming years of noise and disruption will ruin their lives. Fresh start: Park Crescent West, next to Regents Park in London,  could be demolished and re-built again under controversial plans which have angered nearby residents worried about noise and disruption . How it could look: Controversial plans for houses behind Park Crescent West (pictured) have been unveiled by property developer PCW Property Holdings. The development would be made up of 73 homes in total . PCW Property Holdings paid £105million for the crescent in 2013. The new development will be made up of 73 homes, ranging from studios and mews houses to five-bed flats worth £15million. With around 183,000 sq/ft of accommodation, any completed development is set to be worth in excess of £500million. Carlo Seidel, who is representing residents, yesterday said 'an overwhelming number' of people were against it. He said: 'There are a lot of elderly people living here and a number who aren't healthy. They do not want the development to go ahead. Opposition: Modern flats next to the planned development (pictured) where residents are objecting to the proposal to demolish a Grade I listed crescent designed by the architect of Buckingham Palace . The vision: After angering locals with an initial proposal, the developer has now submitted fresh plans (pictured) to demolish the John Nash-designed crescent and rebuild it as ultra-posh apartments . A big deal: With around 183,000 sq/ft of accommodation, any completed development in place of Park Crescent West, near Regents Park in London, is set to be worth in excess of £500million . A glimpse into the past: How Park Crescent West looked in the early 1900s. It was designed by Buckingham Palace architect John Nash . 'This is a complicated project and there will be massive disruption. People are upset. 'It is at the expense of longstanding London residents who are expected to put up with years of misery and mess without any compensation, for the sake of the developer's profit.' Mr Seidel added: 'Residents are conscious that developments have to happen from time to time but they feel that they ought to be appropriately compensated for being caught up in one. 'It is probably going to take around five years and some of the elderly people are saying they won't be alive for another five years. 'If this is going to happen they are going to need decent compensation so they can move while any work takes place.' The crescent was originally designed by John Nash in the early 19th century to be grand houses for the friends and family of the Prince Regent. In the pipeline: The revamp will be made up of 73 homes, ranging from studios and mews houses to five-bed flats worth £15million. Residents fear the work could take around five years to complete . Bombed: What the crescent looked like in the early 1950s after being partially destroyed in the Second World War. The Grade I listed terrace was restored in 1960 and replaced with offices and residential accommodation . Nash, who designed Buckingham Palace, wanted a full circus, but only a semi-circle was ever built and a large amount was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. The crescent was restored in 1960 and replaced with offices and residential accommodation. Developers want to replace the facade of the Grade I listed crescent, which is a 'flawed modern copy' of the original work by Nash. The proposals are to remove it and build a more historically correct and accurate replacement. There were plans to build 80 homes, but the developers had to revise their proposals after discovering an 18th century ice house beneath the road and parking bays. Fresh plans, consisting of almost 150 documents, were submitted to Westminster Council last week. John Nash, remembered for his work on Buckingham Palace, Regent's Park and Regent Street in London, is one of the most famous architects of the 18th and early 19th centuries. He was born in January 1752 and after an early education received training from the architect Sir Robert Taylor. After early education, Nash was trained by the architect Sir Robert Taylor and worked as a surveyor and builder in the city of London. In 1777 Nash established his own business and later inherited £1,000 from an uncle which he decided to risk on the building of houses in Great Russell Street and Bloomsbury Square. The buildings failed to rent out and Nash was declared bankrupt in 1783. Returning to London in 1797, Nash then designed a number of Gothic castles around the country, in places such as Luscombe Castle in Devon and Caerahays Castle in Cornwall. Nash  soon came under the patronage of the Prince Regent, later King George IV. In 1806 he was appointed Surveyor General of Woods, Forests and Parks and from 1810 onwards worked solely for the prince. By 1813 he had been appointed official architect to the Office of Works, which meant advising parliamentary commissions on things such as new church buildings. This was when he designed Regent's Park, Buckingham Palace and two theatres in Haymarket. When George IV died in 1830, Nash lost his royal protector amid a backlash about the extravagance of the King's reign. Buckingham Palace had cost thousands, millions in today's terms, and Nash ultimately retired. He died a few years later in May 1835. Architect: John Nash (pictured left), who designed Buckingham Palace, wanted a full circus but only a semi-circle crescent was ever built, where scientist and inventor Sir Charles Wheatstone (right) once lived . Landscaping: What the gardens could look like under the landscaping scheme for Park Crescent West. A raise pool with seating is included . But despite the anger from residents, there is support from people working in the property industry while Westminster Council would receive around £5million from the developers for affordable housing. Becky Fatemi, managing director of luxury estate agent Rokstone, believes it is an 'exciting new plan' which will help boost the area. She said: 'Over the last five years the regeneration of Marylebone and new super-prime resi projects in Regents Park such as the new mansions at Cornwall Terrace have totally transformed the perception of the park and its surrounding properties. Builders at the Park Crescent West site. Despite anger from residents, there is support from people working in the property industry while Westminster Council would receive around £5million  for affordable housing .

There were plans to build 80 homes, but the developers had to revise their proposals after discovering an 18th century ice house beneath the road and parking bays . Around 200 people living in flats (pictured) that back onto Park Crescent West, many of whom are elderly, are opposed to fresh plans, consisting of almost 150 documents, submitted to Westminster Council last week . Unhappy: Carlo Seidel (right), who is representing angry residents, said 'an overwhelming number' of locals were opposed to the plans for Park Crescent (left). He claimed the project would cause 'massive disruption' 'Oil royals, wealthy Russians and Ukrainian commodity billionaires plus celebrities such as Tom Ford have all moved into homes around Regents Park and the location has become totally transformed into a highly sought after luxury village. 'The buyers will be people looking for homes in and around Marylebone and Regents Park who want lateral space and like the Regency aesthetic.' Ms Fatemi added: 'Modern schemes nearby such as The Chilterns and Chiltern Place are superb, but not everyone likes ultra modern developments. 'Period facade projects like Park Crescent and Cornwall Terrace appeal to another market who like opulent period architecture homes with luxury new specification features. 'This market is very popular with Middle East, Russian and Eastern European buyers, and it also attracts City brokers wanting a luxury London home.'","Developer's plans to build 73 luxury flats has angered residents who live nearby Park Crescent West in London .

"Books about Islam are flying off the shelves and selling out in France after the deadly Charlie Hebdo terror attacks in Paris raised questions about the religion. Sales of books about the religion were three times higher in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same time last year, according to the French National Union of Bookshops. It comes as a special magazine supplement from Philosphie which focused in the Koran also saw a spike in sales following the attacks on the French satirical magazine and a Jewish supermarket, which left 17 dead. Some of the books on sale at the 'Librairie de l'Orient' bookstore on Islam and interpretations of the Koran, which are popular in France . Mansour Mansour, who runs the Al Bouraq publishing house specialising on Islam and the Middle East, said his sales have shot up by 30 per cent since the attacks. He said: 'The same happened after the September 11 attacks in 2001. 'Now the spike is likely to last longer because Islam will continue to pose a geo-political problem.' Experts believe people are buying the books and magazines, because they want a better understanding of the religion some terror groups claim to represent, so that they can make up their own minds. Yvon Gilabert, who runs a bookshop in Nantes, western France, explained: 'A very Catholic lady came to buy a copy of the Koran, because she wanted to understand for herself whether or not (Islam) is violent religion.' Sales of books about Islam were three times higher in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same time last year, according to the French National Union of Bookshops . Meanwhile, Patrice Besnard, a regular at a Paris bookshop specialising in religions dded: 'I think we have to know how to see past the fundamentalism, in order to see what religions have to offer.' But Mr Mansour warned about people diving into reading the Koran 'unaccompanied' and jumping to conclusions on its highly poetic text. He also added that his company has withdrawn several books that offered 'too literal' an interpretation of Islam from his catalogue. Publishers such as Mr Mansour were already selling more books on Islam even before the Paris terror attacks since the brutality of ISIS created shock waves since its emergence in 2013. A luxury edition of the Koran is displayed at a Paris bookstore. According to publisher Hebdo Livres, twice as many books published in France last year were dedicated to Islam compared to Christianity .

The policy will raise the wages for 70 of the company's workers - more than half the staff. The Times was present at Price's announcement. Even if the $70,000 minimum wage is a publicity stunt, it's one that will cost him big time. Price is slashing his own salary by 93percent - more depending on what portion of the company's profits he was planning to take home. Price founded Gravity Payments in 2004 when he was 19 and working out of his dorm room at Seattle Pacific University. The company processes credit card payments for small businesses. Price said told the Times he was motivated to make the radical change after reading a study about how much pay raises increase happiness for people making less than $70,000 a year. He also was distressed hearing the struggles of his friends and family who make far less money than he does. Happy workers: Price said the move will eat up 93percent of his current salary and 80percent of his annual profits . 'They were walking me through the math of making $40,000 a year. '...I hear that every single week. That just eats at me inside.' The move comes at a time when CEO pay is 300 times the average employee pay at large companies - among the highest level of inequality in history. Price claims he's a man of few vices. He takes snowboarding trips and likes to pick up the tab at dinner and when he's out with friends. Otherwise, he says, he drives a 12-year-old Audi.","Dan Price, founder of Gravity Payments, will slash his salary to $70,000 and raise the minimum wage for his 120 employees to $70,000 .
The move, in the next three years, will also require Price to plow up to 80percent of his firm's $2.2million profits back into salaries .
He says he was inspired to make the bold step after reading that happiness increases dramatically for people earning over $70,000 ."
"Hillary Clinton is deadly serious about attracting young and tech-savvy voters in 2016, hiring a new digital guru who hails from the world's most powerful online brand. Stephanie Hannon, who was the tech giant's director of productmanagement for civic innovation and social impact, will serve as her presidential campaign's chief technology officer. In that role she will supervise a sprawling effort to develop websites, mobile apps and other vehicles for pushing the former secretary of state's brand through the 2016 elections. Hannon previously worked on Gmail and Google Maps. She also spent some time at Facebook, and also worked for the event-organizing website Eventbrite, according to her LinkedIn profile. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . DEADLY SERIOUS: Clinton, 67, is priming the pump for a digital outreach campaign tailored to the expectations of younger, more tech-savvy voters . SECOND TIME AROUND: Clinton ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008, but the online landscape has evolved since then . That profile describes her Google projects as including 'changing how the world prepares and responds to natural disasters, using big data and experiments to enable cities to make evidenced based decisions and sharing transparent election ballot, candidate and results globally.' Stephanie Hannon, director of product management, civic innovation and social impact at Google, has come aboard the Hillary Express as Mrs. Clinton's technology guru . Seasoned digital talent is in high demand as nearly 20 potential White House hopefuls plan for a 2016 campaign season that will rely heavily on clicks, likes, shares and other indications of a broad reach. Every major party candidate will have to navigate the brave new world of online fundraising, too, which President Barack Obama's team mastered in 2008 en route to his victory – including a stunning Democratic primary upset of Clinton. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who announced his candidacy on Tuesday in Louisville, poached his tech leader from rival candidate Ted Cruz late last year. Vincent Harris, who also helped manicure Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell's online image during a bruising re-election fight in 2014, runs his own Texas consulting firm with a staff of 20. His team was responsible for McConnell's breakthrough video 'What rhymes with Alison Lundergan Grimes,' a brief online ad that launched a year-long slap-fest directed at McConnell's unsuccessful challenger. IN YOUR FACE: The 'Ready for Hillary' super PAC has adopted an iconic, mock-worthy photo of Clinton on her Blackberry as its poster image, laughing off claims that Clinton's infamous private email server will get in the way of her presidential ambitions . POACHED: Vincent Harris (left), the Rand Paul presidential campaign's digital chief, worked for Ted Cruz unti lthe Kentuckian lured him away . The Washington Post was first to report Clinton's latest hire. The onetime first lady and former U.S. senator hasn't yet launched an official campaign, but an announcement is expected in the next 10 days. Her campaign-in-waiting has already signed a lease for two floors of a Brooklyn, New York, office building, starting a 15-day countdown for a formal declaration of her candidacy set by the Federal Election Commission. Clinton's staff also includes several key members who came over from the White House. Kristina Schake was first lady Michelle Obama's aide responsible for recasting her as a fun-loving 'everywoman' through TV appearances on pop-culture shows. She will help transform Clinton into a softer, more accessible public figure. White House Communications Director Jen Palmieri stepped down this month to helm Clinton's campaign communications team. Palmieri has been replaced by Jen Psaki, the former State Department chief spokeswoman. EMAIL-GATE: South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy hasn't let go of demands for Clinton's home-brew email server, which contained her correspondence from the State Department until she erased it . It's unclear whether Hannon will be able to help Clinton shed her image as a ham-fisted and digitally aloof schemer, a reputation that has followed her since a scandal broke over emails she deleted froma private server she maintained during her years in the Obama administration. Questions remain about whether Clinton acted improperly when she conducted all her State Department email communications on a home-brew system completely separate from government computers and the archiving required by federal law. South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, at the helm of a special congressional committee tasked with investigating the deadly 2012 terror attacks at a State Department facility in Benghazi, Libya, did not respond to a request for comment about the status of the probe into Clinton's emails.","Stephanie Hannon, Google top dog on product management for 'civic engagement,' will help Hillary navigate the digital waters in 2016 .

"Awash with a sea of colour, sounds and smells, a stunning water carnival has exploded into life in China. The annual Water Temple Fair in Jiangnan, China, sees thousands gather on boats to pray for good fortune for the upcoming year. Locals dress up in traditional costumes, while boat races, drumming and dragon dances bring a carnival atmosphere to the town of Jia Xing. Riot of colour: The Water Temple Fair in Jiangnan, China, sees thousands gather on boats to pray for good fortune for the upcoming year . Superstition: People travel from nearby towns to join the Net Boat Fair. Other Water Temple Fairs are held around Chinese New Year. Fishermen from the area take their boats out for show, hoping for good fortune and blessing . Extravagance: An aerial view of the 2015 China Jiangnan Net Boat Fair which commemorates an ancient hero . Starting on different dates in the western calendar, the fair happens annually according to the Chinese Lunar calendar. This year, it began yesterday and the celebrations are expected to last three to seven days, with festivities sometimes being extended to a month long. One of the highlights of the carnival is the Net Boat Fair which showcases the unique culture of Jiangnan water people. One of the most anticipated performances is the 'tie the perfume to your skin' which sees performers attach metal hooks to their forearms. On the other side of the hook hangs a censer containing incense or sometimes even heavy anchors with flowers in them to mask the natural smell of the fishing town. Locals dress up in traditional costumes, while boat races, drumming and dragon dances bring a carnival atmosphere to the town of Jia Xing . The traditional local folklore carnival pays homage to Liu Chengzhong, a figure who led people in annihilating locusts in the Yuan Dynasty . Tradition: Fishermen and their families dress up in traditional clothes. About 50 different folklore groups and nearly two thousand people will be joining the celebrations. It will be the biggest Net Boat Fair in 60 years . The Fair commemorates General Lui Chengzhong, a hero in the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368), who successfully eliminated pests during a massive drought. When the Yuan Dynasty came to an end, General Lui killed himself by jumping in the river as an act of loyalty to the Yuan emperor. The locals built the Lui King temple for him and celebrated his heroic acts. Mr Li, one of the participants, told Jia Xing Ping Dao: 'I am the sixth generation to come to this temple fair. 'My great-grandfather once said the celebrations were even more extravagant than what we have now. 'We want to pray for safety and for the Gods to give us proper weather next year.' Music and beats: Little drums are used to scare away angry spirits. This event was listed as one of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in China in 2011, along with Chinese abacus, an ancient calculator . Cultural heritage: Fishermen prepare shrine offerings, including food, wine, pork, fruit and snacks. An elaborate ritual will be performed on the boats to give thanks to the Gods and the ancestors . The Net Boat Fair has already been included in the list of Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage. One of the most important agenda this year is giving out the 'folklore religion activity' certificate to the Liu King temple. Jiangnan Mayor Liang Bokai sauid: 'This marks the first certificate of its kind. It is a massive step for the preservation, promotion and legacy of this folklore religion in the Liu King temple. 'We will further promote our local customs and culture and combine it with tourism in order to put out a new image.' Jiangnan folklore: 'Stepping on whites boats' is a custom for fishermen. Their boats are known to be very unstable because of the exceptionally long frame. Fishermen remodel the boats with a wooden see-saw in the middle. Two people stands on the edge of both sides and jump to make the boat go forward . Tourism: It is a very popular tourist attraction as well. Vendors and shopkeepers appeal their products to passers-by, participants gather for pictures and others pray for blessings .","Water Temple Fair held annually in Jiangnan, China, where fishermen gather to pay homage to ancient hero .

"A Japanese artist charged with obscenity for distributing plans of how to build a kayak shaped like her vagina denied the charges when she appeared in court on Wednesday. In a case that has sparked accusations of heavy-handed censorship, artist Megumi Igarashi said she had done nothing wrong in handing out the code for a 3D printer. 'I am innocent because neither the data for female genitals nor my art works shaped like female genitals are obscene,' she told judges at Tokyo District Court. Japanese artist  Megumi Igarashi could face up to two years in jail if convicted of obscenity . In a case that has sparked accusations of heavy-handed censorship, artist Megumi Igarashi said she had done nothing wrong in handing out the code for a 3D printer. She's pictured here with the frame of a kayak she created modelled on her own vagina . Igarashi was first arrested in July, but was freed several days later following a legal appeal and after thousands of people signed a petition demanding her release. But Tokyo police arrested her again in December, on three counts of distributing 'obscene' data -- namely CD-ROMs containing computer code for a 3D printer that would allow users to make copies of the vagina-shaped kayak. She was held in custody for around a month before being granted bail. 'I have been arguing that it is strange to single out one part of a human body that every woman has' and treat it as obscene, she told journalists and supporters after the hearing. 'Some people say my works are cheap and not even art, but that should not justify police moves to arrest me,' she said. Igarashi creates a range of products that look like her vagina, including picture frames (left) and phone cases (right) Japanese artist Megumi Igarashi shows a small mascot shaped like a vagina at a news conference in Tokyo . One of her lawyers, Takashi Yamaguchi, said the defence team believes 'it is extremely outrageous that anybody can be arrested and forced to stand before judges because of making artworks or working as an artist.' If convicted of distributing or possessing obscene materials for the purpose of selling, Igarashi could face up to two years in jail and/or a fine of as much as 2.5 million yen ($21,000). Japan has an enthusiastic and prolific pornography industry that caters to all imaginable tastes. But rigid obscenity laws ban the depiction of actual genitalia, which normally appear pixellated or behind black spots.","Megumi Igarashi makes pieces of art that are modelled on her vagina .

"Fast bowler Jimmy Anderson made cricket history in the Caribbean on Friday by beating the great Sir Ian Botham's all-time England wicket-taking record with his 384th victim in his hundredth Test. Anderson's marquee moment in his landmark Test arrived in his 21st over when, crucially for his team, he had West Indies captain Dennis Ramdin caught by captain Alastair Cook after a partnership of 105 with Jason Holder had frustrated England. Botham's record had been equalled much earlier in the day when Anderson had Marlon Samuel caught in the gully by James Treadwell.

Anderson has with him parents Michael and Catherine, wife Daniella and daughters Lola and Ruby as well as agent and former county cricketer Luke Sutton and his wife and family, Sutton's Activate management assistant Gaia Bursell, and Anderson's friend Greg James, a BBC Radio 1 DJ.

Speaking to Sky Sports after the match, Anderson admitted: 'I'm hugely proud. It is great to have my family here as well and taking over from an English legend is a hugely proud moment for me. 'My immediate emotion was that we were back in the game. We opened up an end and were hoping to get the win. 'I know my game now. When I started I didn't have a clue. I ran up, shut my eyes and just bowled as fast as I could. I've developed skills over the years that stood me in good stead. 'It's not been a target, I love taking wickets and playing for England and that's all I'm worried about. You pick up milestones along the way. It's a huge moment for me as well playing in my 100th Test this week. It's a dream come true to play for England, let alone playing 100 Tests.' There had been great expectancy since Anderson started bowling shortly before lunch on the second day of the four wickets needed to own outright one of English cricket's most prestigious records. Not only from the family party but also Sky pundit Botham, watching from the TV commentary position. He has an expensive case of wine waiting for Anderson back home. Botham said: 'It has been a privilege to watch him close up all these years and commentate on a career that I believe still has a few more miles in the tank.

Only two Anderson wickets came in the West Indies' first innings when the leading bowler was surprisingly sparingly used. And he failed to add to that tally in the seven overs he bowled on Thursday.

"'Gunman': Claudio Giardiello was described as 'very unusual' and 'over the top' by his former lawyer . A gunman has killed four people - including a judge and a witness - after going on a rampage at a Milan court where he was due to appear today accused of fraudulent bankruptcy. The defendant, Claudio Giardiello, 46, is said to have first killed his lawyer Lorenzo Alberto Claris Appiani, 37, and his co-defendant before shooting dead judge Fernando Ciampi  in an act of revenge 'against those that ruined me'. Prosecutors said the attack was carried out with 'cold premeditation'. A fourth victim, understood to have been a witness, had no visible injuries and is thought to have died of a heart attack. Several other people suffered serious injuries in the attack, including Giardiello's former colleagues and accountant. After his killing spree, the gunman managed to evade police and fled the courthouse on his motorbike, reaching the town of Vimercate 15 miles from Milan before being arrested. Giardiello likely used a false ID pass to enter the court through a side door reserved for judges and lawyers, who are not obliged to have their belongings scanned by a metal detector, Milan public prosecutor Edmondo Bruto Liberati said. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said the attack 'a moment of great pain, of sadness' adding that it was 'unthinkable someone should be able to enter a court with a weapon.' He promised 'the government will shed the utmost light on the event' and described the police who had chased down and arrested the man as heroic. The gunman's attack began when he fired four or five rounds from multiple weapons at 11am. Witnesses reported barricading themselves inside their offices and taking cover under their desks as police hunted for the gunman. After texting loved ones that they were OK, employees and lawyers were eventually allowed to trickle out of the tribunal, women first, followed by the men who had their court ID cards checked. Gunman: Claudio Giardiello (centre) - the man who killed four people after opening fire on a Milan courthouse - is escorted by Italian police officers in Vimercate barracks near the city . Casualty: Rescuers and police help a seriously injured man out of the Justice Palace in Milan this morning . Several others suffered serious injuries in the attack, including Giardiello's ex-colleagues and accountant . Hundreds of people were eventually evacuated from the building as police hunted the gunman. 'There was a lot of panic at the beginning when people came running towards us saying there was a person with a pistol who had been shooting,' said lawyer Mirko Ricetti, who said he locked himself in a first-floor courtroom after hearing a shot. Police said Giardiello fired 13 rounds in total, beginning his rampage by mortally wounding his co-accused, Giorgio Erba, and killing his lawyer Mr Appiani. Another of his co-accused, Davide Limongelli, was injured in the gunfire. The armed assailant then allegedly sought out judge Ciampi, shooting and wounding another man on the stairs on the way to the floor below. He allegedly entered the judge's private office, letting off two shots that killed him instantly. Mr Bruti Liberati said it was not clear whether there was any relationship between the gunman and the judge. After his killing spree, the gunman managed to evade police and fled the courthouse on his motorbike, reaching the town of Vimercate 15 miles from Milan before being arrested . Giardiello was caught on video surveillance cameras fleeing the court and police traced him via his numberplate. Interior Minister Angelino Alfano later issued an update saying the suspect was arrested in a village 15 miles from central Milan away after fleeing the scene on a motorcycle. He subsequently tweeted: 'Caught in Vimercate the alleged murderess of Milan'. He told a press conference it appeared the man 'was ready to kill others in Vimercate,' following reports Giardiello had been heading towards another co-defendant, who was not present in court. Giardello, who reportedly had a string of failed businesses, allegedly told police: 'I wanted to take revenge on those that ruined me', according to Italian news agency ANSA. He owned 55 per cent of a real estate company which went under in 2008, media reports said. An ambulance with escort was seen leaving the Vimercate police station, but it was not immediately clear if the gunman was inside. Valerio Maraniello, who once acted as a lawyer for the shooter, told AFP his ex-client was 'an aggressive person, a little paranoid.' 'He was always convinced people were trying to cheat him. He never listened to advice,' he said, adding that he was 'not completely surprised' by the deadly attack. Hundreds of people were evacuated from the Palace of Justice building as police searched for the gunman . A plain clothes police officer helps to evacuate people from the tribunal building in Milan this morning . Leaders across the political sphere expressed shock that a gunman had managed to get into the court building. 'The fact that we're not talking about an organisation which surveyed the place first makes it even more perturbing,' said the head of the Lombardy region, Roberto Maroni. Alfano - in Milan for a meeting on public order and safety ahead of the 2015 Milan expo which opens in May - promised to investigate what he described as 'serious errors' in security. 'If this is the level of security in Expo Milan imagine what potential terrorists can think of doing,' said Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-immigration Northern League party. Judge Gherardo Colombo told journalists outside the court that he had known the murdered judge well. 'It's absurd that one can die like that, while you're doing your job,' he said, suggesting 'an anti-judiciary climate' may be to blame. The shooting immediately raised questions about how the man gained entrance to the Fascist-era courthouse with a weapon, given that visitors must pass through metal detectors. Heavily armed: Police snipers arrive at Milan's Palace of Justice this morning following the shooting . Security: Police cars surround Milan's Palace of Justice building this morning after a man named locally as Claudio Giardiello opened fire. Four people are thought to have died . The courthouse has metal detectors at the four main entrances, but lawyers and courthouse employees with official IDs are regularly waved through without the additional security screen and accredited employees can drive into the internal garage. Lawyers Mirko and Davide Pupo noted that the metal detector from the lawyers' entrance had been removed several months ago. Employees who emerged after the shooting suggested that the gunman could easily have gained entrance without passing through the metal detector by entering with his lawyer, though other lawyers said their clients are routinely told to go in via the public entrance. Deputy interior minister Filippo Bubbico said an investigation would determine who was to blame for any security lapse, given also that the gunman was not stopped as he moved from one floor to the next to continue the spree, and then was able to flee unimpeded. The Palace of Justice is in the historic centre of Milan, only a few streets away from the city's cathedral and shopping district.","Suspect Claudio Giardiello wanted revenge 'against those that ruined me'

"The night that Ryan Poston was shot dead by his on-again, off-again girlfriend he was supposed to meet a former Miss Ohio 2012 beauty queen for a date, an Ohio court heard on Thursday. Audrey Bolte, who also finished runner-up in Miss USA, told prosecutors she was looking forward to seeing Poston, 29, at a bar to play pool and drink on October 12, 2012, but he failed to arrive. That was because Shayna Hubers had shot him six times at home - during which she allegedly 'cackled' with glee claimed a cellmate of the accused, who claims the 24-year-old confessed to her while behind bars. Scroll down for video . Testimonny: Audrey Bolte told the Ohio court she was expecting to see Mr. Poston but he failed to arrive for their date . Date: Audrey Bolte (pictured left at the Miss USA pageant in 2012 and right as winner of Miss Ohio 2012) in  was supposed to meet Ryan Poston on the night he was shot by his girlfriend . 'I found him very entertaining, and that led me to accept an invite to go on a date with him,' Bolte testified. Prosecutors allege that Hubers shot Poston because she was furious he was trying to break up with her. Hubers, who was 21 at the time, denies murdering her lawyer boyfriend and claims she shot him in self-defense. Her trial began on Monday and during that time, Hubers has been held at the Campbell County jail in Newport. Her romer cellmate testified to the court that Hubers joked about the shooting and said she was going to get off all charges. 'Did she ever laugh?' Commonwealth's Attorney Michelle Snodgrass asked Cecily Miller according to Cincinnati.com. 'Oh, yes.' 'About what?' 'About shooting him in the face and giving him the nose job he always wanted,' said Miller. 'That's what bothered me – she cackled.' Trial: Shayna Hubers attends her murder trail in Campbell, Ohio. Hubers is charged with murder in the shooting death of her boyfriend, Ryan Poston . Gallows humor: Jurors were shown a videotaped police interview with Hubers, in which the woman, then 21, said Poston was 'vain' and she gave him the 'nose job he wanted' by shooting him in the face . Miller said that Hubers realized she was too intelligent to plead insanity, 'So she was going to plead battered wife syndrome.' Lisa and Peter Carter, who raised Poston said that their son was concerned about ending things with Hubers. He said to me, 'My biggest issue is … Shayna is always around,'' said Peter Carter, according to Cincinnati.com. 'He said, 'I don't know what to do to get her to leave.'' 'I told him to make sure that he was kind to Shayna and to be honest with her about what was going on,' he said. 'I told him to be direct, but to be kind.' However, Carter said he never got to find out the answer because Poston died the next night. Also on the stand was Vernon West, who lived in the condo below Poston with his wife Doris. They testified they returned home at around 8.30pm and heard a woman crying on a balcony above. Troubled: Poston's family described his relationship with Hubers, left, as tumultuous and said that the 29-year-old was trying to end it . West said that she returned inside the home at around 8.50pm and then he heard two pops that at first he thought were fireworks and then four more and then a thud. 'The first two shots, I thought might have been fireworks,' Vernon West testified according to Cincinnati.com. 'But a few seconds later, I heard four shots, and I knew that wasn't fireworks.' Vernon West also said that they did not hear a physical fight or arguing before the shots. Hubers, who was 21 at the time, claimed she was acting in self-defense because the young attorney was shoving and hitting her, but during an interview with police she was quoted as telling a detective she gave Posten 'the nose job he wanted.' On the first day of testimony Tuesday, jurors were shown a video of the defendant's interview with police following the slaying. 'He was screaming at me at the top of his lungs after he had thrown me around the room,' the woman told a detective sitting across from her, reported Cincinnati.com. 'I shot him enough times to kill him,' she said, 'so that he wouldn't suffer... He was laying there, twitching and making noises, and I shot him in the head. 'I was watching him die. it was painful to watch him die and to know that I had done that,' reported WCPO. Hubers then described her late boyfriend of one year as 'vain' about his looks. 'I shot him right here,' she said in the video as she pointed to her nose. 'I gave him his nose job he wanted.' Gun-toting girlfriend: Shayna Hubers (left), 24, is on trial in the 2012 shooting death of her lawyer boyfriend, 29-year-old Ryan Poston . Prosecutors argued that the woman intentionally shot the attorney six times across a table, including once in the face, after Poston tried to end their relationship. Hubers' attorneys have maintained that their client shot Poston to protect herself. During questioning, Hubers explained to detectives that she went to Poston's home 'with the best intentions' not to kill him, but to convince him to work out their differences and mend their relationship. But when she arrived, Poston allegedly 'resorted to violence.' The woman said the lawyer made fun of her speaking voice, insulted her family, and physically assaulted her by pushing and dragging her around. She detailed how the 29-year-old victim allegedly pushed her down against the arm of the couch and threw her against furniture in the moments before the first shot rang out. 'He said, 'You're just a hillbilly from Kentucky.' And I am. I guess the hillbilly came out in me, and I took up for myself,' she told police in the recording played in court. Hubers' trial is expected to last two weeks. She is being held in jail on $1.5million bond. Ryan Poston graduated from Salmon P. Chase College of Law, Northern Kentucky University in 2008, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and uncle. In May 2012, he started his own law practice specializing in personal injury cases in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. His family and friends have described him as a bright and hard-working young lawyer who had a promising future ahead of him. He is survived by his parents and three sisters. Hubers graduated from Lexington's Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in 2009. In the fall of 2010, she made the Dean's List at the University of Kentucky as a sophomore psychology major. Zevely said she is close with her parents, and her mother spent the day with her in Northern Kentucky prior to the shooting.","Ohio court hears that Ryan Poston was supposed to meet Audrey Bolte the night he was shot dead .

"'Toxic': Celebrity Big Brother contestant Katie Hopkins said migrant vessels 'need pushing back' Katie Hopkins was today branded 'toxic' after saying boats in North Africa should be 'burned' to cut immigration - just hours after up to 900 migrants drowned in the Mediterranean Sea. The 40-year-old former Celebrity Big Brother contestant said the vessels ‘need pushing back’ and asked listeners to a radio show: ‘Why do we take on everyone else's problem?’ Miss Hopkins said on LBC yesterday: 'I, for one, believe we should turn back the boats. Personally I would use gunships, I would tow them back to where they came from, and I would make a huge bonfire of all the boats they have - in order that we put a stop to this ridiculous situation that we find ourselves in.' Her comments were labelled 'dangerous', while she was described as a 'manifestation of the culture of toxic hate that is prevalent in the UK'. More than 900 people are feared dead after the fishing boat overturned in the Mediterranean at midnight yesterday in one of the worst maritime disasters since the Second World War ended. And the former Apprentice contestant insisted a 'huge bonfire' should be made from boats in North Africa so they cannot be used again. She added: ‘If you allow these boats to come that number will grow year on year. When we see these migrants arriving in Italy, they aren't just staying in Italy. ‘The Italians are more or less okay with these numbers coming, because as soon as they are in Italy they disperse through Europe and then we see them arriving in vast swathes in Calais. The mother-of-three, who was hosting her first radio talk show on the station at 10am, continued: ‘I do believe these boats need pushing back. We pay an enormous amount towards foreign aid as it is, and I don't think we need to be helping with a rescue programme in the Med as well.’ Today, an Italian coast guard ship brought the bodies of 24 victims to Malta for burial before heading to Sicily with just 28 survivors plucked from the sea after the disaster off Libya. Help: This image from Guardia di Finanza shows an infra-red camera screen shot during an operation to rescue migrants after their shipwreck in Strait of Sicily yesterday. Hundreds were feared drowned today . Coming to the rescue: German shipping company Opielok Offshore Carriers released this picture today showing a boat with refugees close to its cargo ship in the Mediterranean Sea on April 12 . Following the tragedy, politicians and charities attacked EU states for supporting Italy's decision to stop search and rescue missions last year which they blame for such a high number of deaths. But Miss Hopkins - speaking about 90 minutes after news of the disaster first emerged yesterday - said: ‘Why do we take on everyone else's problem? 'I think at the moment we don't really address immigration as a country. Our politicians are frightened to go near the issue. ‘I'm actually not that frightened at all, nor am I inclined to tow the PC line. I actually really believe that we can't afford to take on the problems of the world.’ However, Miss Hopkins received a furious backlash from listeners, and had a stormy exchange with one called ‘Ronkey’ from Greenwich, south-east London - who branded her comments ‘dangerous’. Meanwhile on Twitter - where Miss Hopkins has more than 500,000 followers - a user named 'Anne Cupcake' wrote to LBC: ‘You are using a tragedy to fuel publicity for a vile racist. Shame on you.’ Anger: Miss Hopkins received a backlash from listeners and people on Twitter - being labelled a 'vile racist' Criticism: Another Twitter user said Miss Hopkins should be 'very happy' after news of the huge death toll . And Neil Hainsworth told Miss Hopkins in a tweet: 'You should be very happy today with news of hundreds of migrants drowning. Corpses and coffins just for you.' Meanwhile Tariq Yusuf said: 'People like Jeremy Clarkson and Katie Hopkins are manifestations of the culture of toxic hate that is prevalent in the UK. It's hate.' And biomedical scientist Dilwyn Havard added: 'I'm going to report The Apprentice to the Environment Agency. I'm pretty sure Katie Hopkins could be classed as a toxic byproduct.' Last Friday Miss Hopkins wrote  of Australia's 'tiny hearts and balls of steel' being the perfect way to deal dealing with asylum seeker boats - and a policy that could be copied by Britain. She praised Prime Minister Tony Abbott's government for its success in stopping the boats, and claimed Australia's strategy of 'threatening them with violence' was the way forward. Miss Hopkins also stated in The Sun that areas of the UK had now become 'festering sores, plagued by swarms of migrants and asylum seekers, shelling out benefits like Monopoly money'. Mother of three: Miss Hopkins is pictured with her three children Poppy (left), Max (centre) and India (right) Route: How a journey for hundreds of migrants began in Egypt and ended at the bottom of the Mediterranean . Miss Hopkins is known for her outspoken remarks in print, TV and radio, which recently included the claim that dementia patients are 'bed blockers'. One survivor from the weekend’s shocking incident who has already been brought to the Sicilian city of Catania has told prosecutors that there were 950 people on board the ship when it sank. The EU president is calling on the EU's executive arm to urgently propose new measures to beef up Europe's border agency to respond to the migrant emergency in the Mediterranean. Rescuers are still combing the waters of the Mediterranean where the migrants are thought to have drowned. EU foreign and interior ministers are to hold emergency talks in Luxembourg later today. The tragedy came just days after another shipwreck in the area claimed 400 lives. Save The Children said more than 1,000 people have died in the  Mediterranean Sea in recent weeks.","Celebrity Big Brother contestant, 40, says vessels 'need pushing back'

"Shoppers have been taking advantage of cheaper milk, vegetables and clothes as a result of the supermarket price wars and the falling price of oil. Prices have fallen by the largest amount in almost a decade as supermarkets continue to slash the cost of milk, vegetables and meat as they compete with each other and with emerging budget chains for customers. And on the high street clothes and footwear have become even more affordable - with prices dropping by around 7.8 per cent in the last 12 months - as the low cost of oil makes transporting and selling goods even cheaper. Consumers are taking to the shops as they cash in on the falling prices of supermarket staples and clothes . Milk, bread, eggs, cheese and roasting chickens have seen the biggest fall in price at the supermarket checkout as the large chains have been forced to reduce their prices to compete with the rise of budget stores Aldi and Lidl. According to the British Retail Consortium-Nielsen price index, goods in shops cost 2.1 per cent lower this March than the same time last year, the Guardian reported. This is the biggest fall in prices in a single year since records began nine years ago, in 2006. It is also a larger drop than the 1.7 per cent recorded the month before. Fresh food prices have dropped by around 0.9 per cent in a year, while the figure for electrical items was even greater, falling 5.7 per cent in the last 12 months. And the falling costs for consumers, which have been taking place for the last 23 months, show no sign of stopping. Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at data firm Nielsen told the Financial Times: 'Prices continue to fall across the retail industry and deflation is likely to be with us for the near future, which means shoppers are going to be able to stretch their budgets further when shopping in store or online.' Cheese and milk have seen some of the biggest fall in prices - of around 0.9 per cent in the last 12 months . The price of fresh foods such as eggs and lettuce fell by more in March, than the 0.4 per cent in February . The cost of electricals, such as toasters and kettles, have dropped by 5.7 per cent in the last 12 months . Cheaper prices and inflation reaching zero in February have led to a boost on the high street as people have more cash to spend, and are finding their money goes even further. Analysts predict inflation could have fallen to a negative in March. Falling prices of oil have also led to cheaper fuel for consumers in the petrol price wars. Fuel was reduced to 99p per litre  in January this year - the first time prices had reached such a low in five years. Milk, eggs, cheese, vegetables and meat have fallen by 0.9 per cent. Electrical goods have dropped 5.7 per cent. Falls of 7.8 per cent have been seen in the cost of shoes and clothes . Petrol prices reached 99p a litre earlier this year. After a Midlands petrol station reduced prices to below £1, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury's followed suit and experts predict that the lower cost of petrol could be come the norm. The cost of a barrel of oil fell from $110 a barrel to around $58 this month - reducing the cost of petrol and diesel for customers and giving them even more money to spend in the supermarkets and high streets. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, estimated earlier this year that UK drivers are collectively £30million better off every single month. However, while the price wars have benefited customers they have been having an impact on independent shops and dairy farmers. Earlier this year, as supermarkets went to war with Iceland, Aldi and Lidl, the cost of a pint of milk was slashed to 22p - making it cheaper than bottles of mineral water. Farmers raised concerns that the ongoing wars are devaluing their product and could end up putting many out of business. The recent abolition of the EU milk quota is expected to further cause the cost of dairy products to plummet, as consumers are set to take advantage of plunging prices.","Shoppers are taking advantage of cheaper eggs, milk, cheese and meat .

"Politicians' living quarters are under close inspection in order to establish just how human and how like (or unlike) us they really are. It is the current Prime Minister's kitchen that has got everyone talking more than any of the other political leaders' – perhaps because he is a known 'toff', and Britain, despite protests from the left and now the right, really still are obsessed with class. Do you have as much cachet as Cameron? Perhaps you're more Onslow and Daisy than Hyacinth? Scroll down for video . Samantha and David Cameron's home has been put into the spotlight recently but do his belongings live up to etiquette expert William Hanson's expectations? Use my short household audit to see how many of the below items you own and discover how posh your pile really is. Score one point for each - the more points you get, the more upmarket your house must be. THE KITCHEN . A CAFETIERE . Those pesky middle-middle classes have fallen hook, line and capsule for these sleekly designed, all style and no substance coffee machines, but those of true upmarket stock know that you can't beat freshly ground coffee in a cafetiere. You will probably own a few of these, in different sizes, to cater for varying numbers of drinkers. A COOKERY BOOK SHELF OF LITTLE-KNOWN AUTHORS . If your kitchen shelves are teaming with works by Messers Oliver, Ramsay and Martin then you're in trouble. Those of better stock will stick to tired, faded old works – think Constance Spry, Mrs Beeton and Julia Child (the latter only if you have American blood the family). William says that there are several items that you are required to own for your home to be 'posh' Mary Berry's books are all right so long as they are the pre-Bake Off ones and you are able to talk at length about her terribly helpful cooking instructions for Agas alongside each recipe. AN AGA . A little hackneyed now but still a good sign that you're in a house of good standing. The older and rustier the Aga the better and preferably oil or gas. A bonus point for each dog found lolling in front of this classy cooker. A CLING FILM DISPENSER . Too many kitchen gadgets and you're on thin ice but one of these terribly clever dispensers for cling-film is a 'Godsend!' (shout this) and saves so much time as you're covering the leftovers of the pickled pears. Very few people know about them or have them and they always impress when friends use it. SMART BIN BAGS . Very few people will see these – but that doesn't matter as you're upper-middle class or above and so don't care whether people see it or not – but a good, solid bin bag is heavenly and you can't imagine going back to the cheap ones now. Deduct a point if you call them some lower-middle euphemistic name like 'refuse sack'. PROPER TEA AND COFFEE CUPS . No politician has been seen with anything but a mug when snapped in their own home since 1997, but tea or coffee from the proper vessel (i.e. one that requires a saucer) is a must for better houses. An extra point if you know the difference between a coffee cup and a demitasse cup. CLOTH NAPKINS FOR KITCHEN SUPPERS . Most people will know to get out the nice napkins (never 'serviettes') for guests but those of better breeding will ensure cloth napkins are set for even the most simple of suppers for one. Knock off a mark if you have ever given a guest a piece of kitchen roll in lieu of a proper napkin. Old fashioned it may be but William says that an Aga is still a good status symbol . William says that a posh household should opt for a cup and saucer (right) over a mug (left) for a hot drink . BATHROOM . A REED DIFFUSER . There's no better smell than fresh air, but for city-dwelling upmarket folk this may not be to hand (or a bathroom may have no windows). A reed diffuser is now just about passable as bathroom décor, but from certain brands only, naturally (The White Company: yes, Next Home: no). A citrus smell, always, for the upstairs bathroom. Never, under pain of death, an Airwick. When it comes to seating William says that fabric sofas are the only way to go . William says that a leather sofa is seen as 'a tad suspect' among the middle classes . PLAIN LOO PAPER . The upper classes would sooner use sandpaper than quilted lavatory roll. Your loo paper must be plain white and un-textured. Three-ply, mind. We're not barbarians. TWO TAPS . Bathrooms in smart old houses will have two taps rather than a 'mono' alternative. These new funky taps are fine for a pied-à-terre but if your house is older than 1980 then two taps it must be. SOAP . Bar soap. Not liquid. This is non-negotiable. There are even rules when it comes to toilet roll, according to William it should always be white and under no circumstances whatsoever should it be quilted . SITTING ROOM (NEVER 'THE LIVING ROOM') BOOKS TO DVD RATIO . You may award yourself a point if the number of books you own and that are on display outweighs the number of DVDs. Buy 1p copies of the classics online if your shelves are bulging with far too many films (which normally means to have far too much free time, too). A FABRIC SOFA . Leather sofas are always seen as a tad suspect amongst the upper-middles and uppers. Fabric is the only way to go, frankly. SILVER PHOTO FRAMES . There should be lots of these, ideally ones that have been handed down or given to you or family members for landmark birthdays and anniversaries. An extra point if the picture of you meeting The Queen is in one of the smaller ones an tucked away somewhere so discreet you may as well not have it on display. TELEVISION . The rules have shifted for 'the telly' (fine to call it that in an ironic way). Naff TV cabinets to hide the thing are definitely lower-middle and now no-one makes them to fit modern flat screens anyway. Loud and proud, that's what we now want. Yes that's a big old TV and you're not afraid to show it… although anything over 42 inches is ostentatious. Just up your prescription if you can't see the screen. Deduct a mark, if not four, if you have a cinema room. HOW DID YOU SCORE? 18 - 14: Upper class In the words of Cole Porter, you’re the top! Give your self a good hearty pat on the back and relax with satisfaction (although don’t undo your hard work and go about boasting about this!) 13 – 9: Upper middle Close, but not quite. You can still hold your head up high when inviting pretty much most of the population into your house, but best offer to meet your upper friends in a restaurant or café somewhere until you sort a few things out. 8 – 5: Middle-middle Nothing to feel ashamed about, although of course you will inside feel deeply anguished at your insecurity within the class food chain. Go and have a soothing cup of tea (from a mug) to calm yourself down. 4 – 1: Lower-middle Let’s say no more about this.

"An investigation is underway after two passengers were allegedly seen making frequent visits to the cockpit during a Ryanair flight from Dublin to Berlin Schönefeld. Two women, who were believed to be off-duty Ryanair members of staff wearing their staff lanyards, were passengers on the plane and were not wearing their uniform. The Irish Aviation Authority has decided to probe the incident, which took place on Good Friday, after fellow passengers on board expressed their concerns about the behaviour. The Irish Aviation Authority are investigating after two female passengers were allowed in the cockpit of a Ryanair flight mid-flight . Speaking to Independent.ie a passenger named Bridget who was travelling on the flight spoke of how once the plane had taken off, two women were spotted coming out of the cockpit. Ryanair has since confirmed there were a total of three off-duty workers on board the flight. The passenger also claimed she had seen the two women 'drinking in the airport' before the flight out. She said: 'Later, when the captain said 'we're getting ready to descend', the two girls went back up. They were laughing and giggling and taking photos of each other. The actions of the two women in visiting the cockpit, who have since been revealed as off-duty Ryanair staff, left fellow passengers on board concerned (file photo, not actual cockpit) 'With things being so strict since the (Germanwings) Alps crash, I don't think this should be allowed.' A Ryanair spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'We have investigated this matter. These were three Ryanair employees travelling off duty. 'All three were wearing their Ryanair ID and were known to the flight crew. 'Following the investigation the matter is now closed.' A spokesperson for the Irish Aviation Authority told MailOnline Travel: 'The IAA is currently investigating the incident in question.

"A Lithuanian talk show has accused Norway of stealing their children in an attempt to tackle 'the highest rate of inbreeding in the  world'. The episode of An Hour with Ruta, which aired on independent TV channel LNK last week, claimed that foreign children were being seized and fostered with Norwegian parents to strengthen the Nordic country's 'genetic material.' An introduction to the chat show argued that Norway's Child Protection Service (Barnevernet) argued that it was deliberately targeting Lithuanian children which were seen as a 'sought-after commodity'. Lithuanian talk show An Hour with Ruta (pictured) has accused Norway of stealing their children in an attempt to tackle 'the highest rate of inbreeding in the world' It stated that 'In Norway, Lithuanian children are taken away from their parents.' An 'expert' on the controversial service told show host Rūta Mikelkevičiūte that the country needed fresh blood to combat its rates of inbreeding which she said had led to high rates of babies being born with birth defects. Neringa Ozolina, a Lithuanian based in Ålesund, said: 'The birth rate is the lowest in Norway,' according to a report by The Local. Earlier this year, Lithuania's Gražina Leščinskiene (pictured) hit local headlines after her son Gabrieliaus was taken into care by Norway's Child Protection Service . 'Inbreeding in Norway is the greatest in the world, and the same is true of the percentage of children born with Down syndrome and other birth defects.' Earlier this year, Lithuania's Gražina Leščinskiene hit local headlines after her son Gabrieliaus was taken into care by Norway's Child Protection Service. She claimed he had been taken from her after displaying what was deemed to be 'sexualised behaviour', which included frequent visits to the toilet and sniffing his hands. Dag Malmer Halvorsen, Norwegian Ambassador to Lithuania was forced to hire a Lithuanian public relations form to try and counteract the 'misconceptions' about Norway's child protection regime . She is still fighting to have her son returned to her. Norway's Ambassador to Lithuania Dag Halvorsen admitted the issue of children being taken into care from foreign parents living in the Nordic country was a major concern in Lithuania. The problem is so widespread that Mr Halvorsen was forced to hire a Lithuanian public relations firm to try and counteract the 'misconceptions' about Norway's child protection regime. 'It is said that there is a history of inbreeding in Norway and that there is a high incidence of Down syndrome among Norwegian children,' he told Norway's NRK channel. 'They argue therefore that it is important for Norwegian authorities to obtain fresh, foreign children, such as Lithuanian ones, to strengthen the genetic material.' Earlier this year Czech President Miloš Zeman accused the services of acting 'like the Nazis' by not allowing a Czech mother of the two seized boys to talk to them in Czech. Russian authorities have also attacked Norway over its seizure of children from their Russian-speaking families.","A Lithuanian talk show has accused Norway of seizing foreign children .

"A popular Twin Cities radio host has revealed her year of terror after she was stalked by a stranger who bombarded her with emails, calls and presents, including bottles of wine and sausages. Maria Lucia detailed her year-long battle in a letter to fans on The Current's website on Wednesday as she explained she would be taking some time off from the station following the ordeal. The alleged stalker, Patrick Henry Kelly, from Eden Prairie, has been charged in the case and is set to go on trial next week. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. 'This has been a tough year for me,' Lucia, 44, wrote in the online letter. Terrified: Patrick Henry Kelly, left, allegedly repeatedly violated a restraining order radio host Mary Lucia, right, had taken out against him after he sent her letters, emails and gifts to her home and workplace . 'My life over the last year has involved a series of restraining orders, seemingly endless calls to 911, the installation of security cameras at home, and police photo ID line-ups. 'I've been constantly looking over my shoulder, dead-bolting doors, and jumping when someone rings my doorbell or my motion lights go off.' It began when Kelly, 56, wrote Lucia a letter about his dead dog and she responded sympathetically in March 2014, the Star-Tribune reported. He then started sending her 'delusional' e-mails and calling her on her personal numbers. He also sent her gifts, including flowers, sausages, candy and a picture of a man in a mask, to both her home and her workplace, according to court records. In July, she filed for a restraining order against him. 'He believes we are in a relationship,' she told the court. 'He got ahold of my cellphone # somehow and left me a message about getting together this weekend. He's unstable and delusional.' Fears: Lucia posted this letter detailing her terrifying ordeal to The Current's website on Wednesday as she explained to fans why she would be taking some time off work for a while . She was granted the restraining order, which prevented him from being within two city blocks of her Minneapolis home, but he allegedly went on to violate it on multiple occasions. 'I wake up thinking of you and repeat before bed,' he allegedly wrote in one handwritten note he sent Lucia. 'This feeling is so real to me! Just can't ignore it anymore.' He left candles, a bottle of wine, a frog calculator and flowers at her home - allegedly violating the restraining order five times between August and October 2014. 'Do you know what it's like to feel unsafe watching a band at First Avenue?' Lucia wrote online on Wednesday. 'To worry any time a stranger approaches you? To not be able to sleep or eat properly? That's what my past year has been like. 'I've made a 21-year career on the radio in this town being honest and authentic, and now I'm deathly afraid to reveal too much of myself on the air.' Scary: Lucia, pictured, said she was always looking over her shoulder or fearful when a stranger approached her because of how Kelly allegedly bombarded her with letters and emails saying they should be together . After the incessant contact, station officials alerted the St. Paul police department, which launched an investigation before turning it over to Minneapolis authorities. Kelly was charged last October with a single count of stalking for violating the court order. He could go to prison for up to 10 years as well as a $20,000 fine if he is found guilty at his trial, which starts on Tuesday. Lucia did not say how much time she will be taking off but said she plans to return 'soon'. Minnesota Public Radio issued a statement on Thursday saying it supports Lucia 'completely in her decision to take a leave of absence'.","Twin Cities radio host Mary Lucia wrote a letter to her fans on Wednesday saying she would be taking some time off work following her ordeal .

Andrea Lindsay, 43, from Prescot, Merseyside, transformed her appearance leaving her almost unrecognisable to friends and family. The mother-of-one shed more than three stone using an hypnosis app and dropped from a size 18 to a size ten to 12 in half a year. Andrea Lindsay, 43, from Prescot, Merseyside, shed more than three stone using an hypnosis app . Andrea hit her target weight in December 2014, shrinking from 14st to around 10st 5lb, before dying her bright blonde locks dark brown. And the bank worker received a curious compliment when her husband's colleagues thought Robbie had traded his wife in for a younger, slimmer model at a Christmas party when they failed to recognise her. Andrea said: 'I hit my target weight in December and we went to my husband's work party. A couple we knew walked in so I waved and said hello to them but they seemed really off with me. 'I thought they must have had an argument or something but we found out later that they didn't recognise me - they thought Rob had traded me in for a newer model. 'After losing the weight and dying my hair, they just didn't recognise me and thought that Rob had brought another woman with him! 'They had no idea who I was and had asked their friends where Andrea from last year was and why I wasn't with Rob.' Andrea, pictured here with her husband Robbie, says she'd tried every fad diet . After her transformation her husband's colleagues thought Robbie had traded his wife in for a younger, slimmer model at a Christmas party . 'Andrea says: 'People I have known for years have walked past me in the street as well and just ignored me. I didn't even think I looked that different.' The brunette says she has struggled with her weight all her life and says she'd tried every fad diet with little success ever since she reached a size 16/18 in her early teens. Andrea's new diet plan . Breakfast: Porridge . Lunch: Soup and a sandwich . Tea: Chilli with rice, cheese, and bread . Mid-morning: (as soon as I feel hungry) bowl of soup or a salad . Evening (as soon as I feel hungry) - a small bowl of chilli with cheese, bread or salad . But after she discovered Easy Loss' Virtual Gastric Band - Lose Weight Fast app, she has never looked back and said she still listens to the hypnosis sessions twice a day. The £4.99 app is designed to teach people to use their common sense when it comes to eating, rather than sticking to rules and restrictions, and just eating when they are hungry. Andrea said: 'As far back as I can remember, I have been overweight. Andrea says she'd had little success with weight loss ever since she reached a size 16/18 in her teens . But seeing as she never had any health issues she didn't really do anything about her weight . She says she always said she never wanted to be fat and 40, but got to 43 and was 'still fat' 'I tried absolutely everything - fad diets, cutting out food - but nothing ever worked. I would stick at it for a few weeks then just lose interest. There were too many rules and restrictions. 'I think because I never had any health issues I didn't really do anything about it. I always said I never wanted to be fat and 40, but I got to 43 and was still fat. 'It wasn't until I started doing hot yoga that I realised I was dissatisfied with myself, so I started looking for something to help me relax and that is when I found Easy Loss - it was just a complete fluke.' Andrea says: 'The ethos of my new lifestyle is that I don't stick to traditional meal times! I eat whenever I'm hungry, as soon as I'm hungry and stop eating as soon as I'm no longer hungry. 'If we went out for breakfast before I would have a fry up, now I have something lighter like Eggs Benedict.' Andrea is now preparing for a luxury two week getaway with husband Robbie, 45, to Mexico, and can't wait to show off her new bikini body on the beach. She said: 'I go away on Saturday and this is the first time I have actually felt body confident. I've spent £700 on a new holiday wardrobe, and I can't wait to wear everything. 'I got my old holiday clothes out and everything was just falling off me - I just can't believe now that I was ever that big. The difference is massive. After she started doing hot yoga she realised she was dissatisfied and that is when she found Easy Loss . 'I have three younger sisters and I have always been the fat one. They always shared each other's clothes and I could never do that, until now. They are amazed at the difference too. 'Since Easy Loss I eat a better balance and variety of food, a lot healthier. But we still have takeaways on a Friday, I don't feel deprived at all. 'It has changed my mind-set completely, it isn't a weight loss programme more a common sense set of guidelines to follow. My husband has started listening to it now as well.' Sue Peckham, co-creator of Virtual Gastric Band - Lose Weight Fast app said: 'Andrea has done so well with our app and we're all thrilled for her. She is a real inspiration and a Gold Member of our Easyloss Facebook Group. 'Her support and advice is a great help and really appreciated by other group members. We're really grateful for all she does to help other app users to achieve their weight loss goals.' The £4.99 app is designed to teach people to use their common sense when it comes to eating .

"A firm which declared that the South of England harboured as much oil as the North Sea has been forced to backtrack on its ‘wild claims’. Last week, UK Oil & Gas Investments (UKOG) boasted it had discovered a ‘world class potential resource’ beneath the Home Counties. The oil exploration company claimed analysis of a well near Gatwick Airport suggested 100 billion barrels of oil lay beneath the Weald Basin, covering Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire and Kent. UK Oil & Gas Investments has backtracked on its claims the UK could be sitting on an oil reserve larger than what has been extracted from the North Sea and Kuwait. Above, the company's test oil well at Horse Hill . Sceptics immediately queried the bold claims – as the Daily Mail reported – but UKOG’s millionaire chairman David Lenigas insisted at the time that the oil would create thousands of jobs, saying: ‘If you own a farm or land in the Weald, there’s a pretty good chance there’s a bucket-load of oil under there.’ Now the firm has been forced into an embarrassing U-turn, admitting that it cannot be sure how much crude lies beneath the region – if, indeed, there is much at all. UKOG and a consortium of other oil firms hold a licence for just 55 square miles in Surrey and Sussex, a tiny fraction of the Weald Basin. But after finding oil in the area, it scaled up its findings across the whole 1,100-square mile Weald area. The company has now admitted that its estimates were based on findings made in a 55-square-mile stretch of the basin, less than two per cent of the total surface area . A map showing the location of the oil and gas deposits within the Weald Basin, which are thought to lie at between 2,500ft and 3,000ft below the ground . It claimed the entire region was rich with the fossil fuel, sparking hopes it had uncovered ‘Britain’s Dallas’. Yesterday, after being instructed to give more details by the London Stock Exchange, it issued a ‘clarification’, admitting the oil should not yet be considered as ‘prospective resources or reserves’. It said further drilling and well testing was needed before it could say how much oil existed on its own site – let alone surrounding areas – and what could be recovered from the ground. David Lenigas has been criticised on the past for exaggerating his companies' successes to drive up share prices . Even then, it seems unlikely it could estimate how much lies beneath the whole region, adding: ‘The company has not undertaken work outside its licence areas sufficient to comment on the possible OIP (oil in place) in either the approximate 1,100 square miles or the whole of the Weald Basin.’ Brenda Pollack, of Friends of the Earth, said: ‘UKOG has backtracked on the wild claims it made last week and admitted that it has no idea how much oil is under the Sussex Weald. ‘This is yet another example of the potential for shale oil and gas being overhyped by an industry desperate to start pumping profits with little concern for residents or the climate.’ Following the announcement of a ‘significant’ discovery on April 8, UKOG’s share price soared from about 1p to over 4p the next day. But since then, the price has fallen to almost half this, suggesting scepticism in the industry about the claims. UKOG had claimed the supply could meet up to a third of Britain’s oil demand within 15 years. It ignited hopes the vast resource would reduce reliance on oil from the Middle East and Russia, and boost British industry as the North Sea supply dwindles. But the claims were at odds with other research on the Weald Basin. A study by Imperial College London suggested a maximum of 40billion barrels in the region, while the British Geological Survey estimated the basin held just 4.4billion barrels of shale oil. Professor Alastair Fraser, of Imperial College, said last week that UKOG’s claims were ‘overly-optimistic’, while Malcolm Graham-Wood, of oil consultancy firm HydroCarbon Capital, said it would be difficult to drill the green belt area to extract the fossil fuel. UKOG boss Mr Lenigas, an Australian who lives in Monaco, is a director of seven British companies and has been criticised in the past for exaggerating the success of his enterprises to jack up share prices.","UK Oil & Gas Investments described discovery as 'world class' last week .

"A headteacher who allegedly used his school email to set up a threesome with a prostitute who he wanted to spank while she was dressed as a schoolgirl, has resigned from his post. David Nicholson, 48, sent the woman explicit messages saying he was 'keen' on her dressing up like a pupil and was 'looking forward to putting you over my knee', it is claimed. The married father-of-four has not returned to The Costello School in Basingstoke, Hampshire, since the correspondence came to light last month, and has now left the school. MArried father-of-four David Nicholson is accused of sending messages to a prostitute about spanking her when she is dressed up in school uniform using his official school email . Mr Nicholson, from Great Bedwyn, Wiltshire, is still under investigation by Ofstead after claims he used his official school email address to contact an £150-an-hour escort through an adult website and arrange a meeting with her and another woman. The Sun newspaper published the messages between Mr Nicholson and the escort, which showed her telling him she liked dressing up as a schoolgirl and being spanked. The Cambridge graduate then allegedly responded: 'I love this and would be keen,' adding that he he was 'looking forward to putting u over my knee'(sic). Mr Nicholson, is said to have organised a liaison in a hotel room on a night when he was due to be working away from home, which was then cancelled, according to the paper. In a statement today, Mr Nicholson said: 'As I am sure you will understand, the recent press coverage has been highly distressing. Resigned: Mr Nicholson started as headteacher at The Costello School in Basingstoke in September last year . 'Although I have been very grateful for the many messages of support and understanding, I have to put both the interests of my family and the school community first. 'It is therefore, with huge regret and disappointment that I have taken the very difficult decision to resign as headteacher of The Costello School. Accused: Mr Nicholson allegedly used his school email to send messages to prostitutes . 'I have been very privileged to have served as headteacher of the school and proud of the opportunities I have set up. I wish all at the school every good fortune in the future.' Having previously worked as a head teacher at a school in Chippenham, Wiltshire, Mr Nicholson, moved to the Costello School, which counts Liz Hurley among its alumni, last September, . Mr Nicholson, who lives with his wife of 15 years Karina, 43, a local councillor, and describe himself as a ''husband and father' on his Twitter account is also training to be an Ofsted inspector. Carol Bode, the school's chair of governors, said that there are no concerns relating to the safeguarding of pupils at the school and confirmed that the board has accepted Mr Nicholson's resignation. 'In the time David was with us, he worked tirelessly for the school and always with our students best interests at heart providing the school with clear leadership and direction and maintaining a tireless focus on their educational progress. 'We wish him well for the future. The Governing Body's commitment remains to our students, staff and local communities.' She added: 'Please be assured that for the school it is 'business as usual' and that our total focus is on our students, their learning and progress. 'The School is in the capable hands of Mr Leigh Adams, Acting Head Teacher and his senior leadership team, and all staff and students have responded magnificently over recent weeks.'","David Nicholson, 48, has resigned as head of Basingstoke school .

"George Davon Kennedy of DeKalb, Georgia, a student at Middle Tennessee State University, was taken in Tuesday night as police believe he is one of the men caught on video assaulting a woman in Panama City . A third suspect has been arrested by police as a suspect in a brutal sexual assault that occurred on a Florida beach. George Davon Kennedy of DeKalb, Georgia, a student at Middle Tennessee State University, was taken in Tuesday night as police believe he is one of the men caught on video raping a woman in Panama City. He now joins two other men who were arrested late last week. The brief cellphone clip came to light earlier this week as deputies continued searching for two additional suspects in the March attack in Panama City Beach that was witnessed by hundreds of people who failed to intervene. Now, only one suspect remains at large. Authorities previously arrested a pair of students from Alabama's Troy University who were allegedly seen in the video, which was recorded last month. Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen described the graphic video as the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' he had ever seen likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. He said the sickening footage shows at least three men surrounding an incapacitated woman on a beach chair. Delonte Martistee, 22, of Bainbridge, Georgia, and Ryan Calhoun, 23, of Mobile, Alabama, were charged with sexual battery for the incident believed to have occurred between March 10 and 12. Calhoun was released on a $50,000 bond Tuesday, while Martistee remained in Bay County jail. Scroll down for videos . Impassive: The recording depicts a seemingly normal day at the beach for dozens of bikini-clad spring milling around and chatting about Instagram as a 19-year-old woman was allegedly being raped just steps away . Sheriff McKeithen said the video of the attack showed hundreds of spring break revelers impassively looking on as the unconscious teenage girl was being raped by a group of men, CBS News reported. ‘People standing, almost rubbing the incapacitated girl,’ the sheriff said. ‘Standing there, more concerned about spilling their beer than they did someone being raped. McKeithen revealed that so far, his deputies have recovered more than four recordings of the sexual assault, and he believes that are more videos out there. The sheriff’s office released a short clip showing the crowd they said was present at the time. The recording depicts a seemingly normal day at the beach for dozens of bikini-clad spring breakers goofing off and standing around talking about Instagram. At one point, a few people cheer, but it’s unclear why. It is unclear from the video released what bystanders could actually see. But Sheriff’s spokeswoman Ruth Corley said the video was released ‘to show the crowd that was surrounding the incident and to show people, not only was it a horrible event, but it was witnessed by so many people who did absolutely nothing to stop or call police.’ The alleged victim told deputies she thought she had been drugged before the incident and that she was afraid to report it because she could not remember many details, Panama City News Herald reported. 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' the Bay County sheriff said. Officials did not release any more information about the two other men wanted in connection with the gang rape, but they said additional arrests are expected. Caught: Last week, Delonte Martistee, 22 (left), and Ryan Calhoun, 23 (right), were arrested for sexual assault and officially suspended from Troy University . Last Friday's charges against college track star Martistee and his classmate Calhoun stem from a video footage that was found on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. 'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media. In one video, police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her. And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. The video allegedly shows hundreds of people gathered around the girl as the men violate her while she lays on a beach chair. The unidentified victim believes she was drugged before the incident. Above, the beach behind Spinnaker is seen on April 12, 2015 . Above, a view of the Spinnaker Beach Club during a spring break party . This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach... If you condone this behavior, you should be in jail, as far as I'm concerned.' Following their arrest, Martistee and Calhoun were suspended from Troy University. The 22-year-old student-athlete, who remained in jail Sunday, was also removed from the track and field team.","Middle Tennessee State University George Davon Kennedy was arrested and charged with sexual assault Tuesday night .

"Child Protection Services have again seized the two 'free range' children of a mother and father whose unusual approach to parenting has become a national debate. Danielle and Alexander Meitiv, both scientists in Maryland, made headlines just before Christmas when police found Rafi, 10 and Dvora, six, wandering the sidewalk on their own. On Sunday, a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home. The children were picked up by police, who say they followed protocol by turning them over to CPS. Meanwhile, Mrs Meitiv tells Fox 5 DC that CPS workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe. Picked up AGAIN: The Meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by CPS workers after their children--who they raise with a so-called 'free-range' approach--were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone . Taught a lesson? The Meitivs say their kids Dvora and Rafi went missing starting around 6pm. They were not reunited with them until 10:30 . What's more, the elder child, Rafi, insists the scariest part of the hours-long ordeal was being picked up by police. ‘They kept the kids for hours,’ a shaken Danielle Meitiv told Fox 5 after being reunited with them. ‘It’s 10:30 at night. They’ve been missing since 6 o’clock…Somebody called 911 and the police called CPS and they decided to bring the kids here and they didn’t call us.’ According to Mrs. Meitiv, the children were expected home no later than 6:30. When 6:30 came and went, they became frantic. They would not receive a call from CPS until 8pm. Even then, they say they weren't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours. in the interim, Rafi tells Fox 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift. Rafi said: . ‘The policeman said “We’ll give you a ride home” when we were like two blocks away. And two and a half hours later, after sitting in the car two and a half hours, he said “I’ll bring you home” and, instead, he brought us here.’ 'Besides the policeman pulling up...no': Asked if he was scared during the hours-long ordeal Sunday, 10-year-old Rafi admitted he was, but not because he'd been left alone with his sister . Seized: Officials seized six-year-old Dvora (left, far left) and 10-year-old Rafi (left, blue hat) on Sunday in a Maryland park. Their parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv are pictured, right, going to confront CPS officials . Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. 'Here' was Child Protective Services, Rafi said. And as he and his sister sat waiting to go home, their parents say 'upper management' at CPS was involved in keeping that from happening. Only at 10:30pm did Mrs. Meitiv say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash. ‘They made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up, . 'And I’m not gonna risk my kids being snatched again like this by CPS.' When questioned, the Meitivs say they believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, which encourages independence from infancy. In March, the CPS found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone. It meant the agency would start a file on the family's activities and whereabouts for at least five years. The Meitivs hit back at the ruling, insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences. Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to such charges. It usually comes when the CPS has deemed parents to have neglected their children, but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action. Parenting style: The Meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age . This seemingly arbitrary ability to place a family under investigation and rule against them has left the Meitivs, who both work as scientists, furious. In March, Danielle Meitiv told the Washington Post they were planning to appeal the decision. 'We don’t feel it was appropriate for an investigation to start, much less conclude that we are responsible for some form of child neglect,' she told the Post. 'What will happen next time?' she said. 'We don’t know if we will get caught in this Kafkaesque loop again.' On December 20, police in Silver Spring picked up Rafi and Dvora walking home on a Saturday afternoon from the park after a member of the public reported it. The Meitivs told police they often let their children walk on their own and that the kids knew the area well. The CPS sent the Meitivs a letter on February 20 informing them their investigation had been closed and told the Washington Post they would not be commenting on the process. Outraged, Danielle Meitiv said she does not see why it is wrong to give her children independence. 'We're just doing what our parents did. It was considered perfectly normal just one generation ago,' she said on Today in January. Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street . Defiant: Danielle and Alexander have said that they will continue to bring up their children as they see fit . Meitiv admits that the walk back from the park was longer than her two kids had taken before, but says she wasn't worried because they have been on several shorter walks together with no issues. 'Well I've walked home from school before. Not with my sister, but I've done it alone,' 10-year-old Rafi said. 'We walked around the block a lot and we walk home from another park which is just around the block. The Meitivs describe themselves as 'free-range parents' who encourage their two children to take journeys without supervision in order to build confidence and teach them about the outside world. Both parents are highly educated. Alexander Meitiv is a Research Fellow at National Institutes of Health and Danielle is an Oceanographer. Usually they have the kids carry around a card that reads 'I'm not lost. I'm a free range kid' but they left them behind that day when they went to the park that was a bit further away from their house. Asked what the CPS would do the next time they are called, they said they would simply follow procedure. What's wrong? Danielle Meitiv (right) appeared on the Today show in January with her 10-year-old son Rafi (center) and 6-year-old daughter Dvora about a month after Child Protective Services launched an investigation because she let the two walk home from a park alone . Parenting choice: Mrs Meitiv (pictured) says she and husband Alexander often let their children Rafi, 10, and Dvora, 6, walk alone to teach them about the world . 'If we get a call from law enforcement or from a citizen, we are required to investigate. Our goal is the safety of children, always,' said Paula Tolson, spokeswoman for the Maryland Department of Human Resources to the Washington Post. The free range parenting trend was first popularized in 2008 by New York journalist Lenore Skenazy, in a piece entitled Why I Let My 9-Year-Old Ride the Subway Alone. She was railing against helicopter parenting and speaking to the Washington Post said that she was appalled by the ruling against the Meitivs. 'The go-to narrative in the last 20 or 30 years for parents was, ""Take your eyes off your kid for even a second and he’ll be snatched."" What the Meitiv case did was pivot the story to: ""Give your kid one second of freedom and the government will arrest you.""’ Speaking about her horror at the decision, Danielle Meitiv said she turned to her husband and felt humiliated. 'I was kind of horrified,' she said. 'You try as a parent to do what’s right. Parents try so hard. Even though I know they are wrong, it’s a painful judgment.' Journey: On December 20, the brother and sister were walking about a mile home from this park when a citizen called 911 after seeing the two without their parents .","Police seized Rafi, 10, and Dvora, 6, in a Maryland park on Sunday and their parents say they weren't reunited by CPS for hours .

Fringing queen: Khloe Kardashian, 30, threw some shapes in a fringed coat and a dress with a dangerously high thigh-split . Katy Perry, 30, and posse opted for a mix of boho and pastel prints, but the real eye-catcher was Perry's alarmingly chunky tribal necklace . But while most of the famous festival-goers committed crimes to fashion, they looked positively demure compared with their fellow merrymakers. It seemed neon was very much the obsession of the weekend, with many people turning up in an array of bright tiny outfits and accessories, including flower-adorned swimming caps and tutus. One man, who looked slightly worse for wear, sported a thigh-skimming Peter Pan costume, no shoes and muddy feet, with a child's Wellington boot around his neck as a necklace. Others sported brash prints with clashing headgear, and women - and men - showed an abundance of skin in painfully-tight shorts. One woman paired a Vietnamese traditional hat, as well as an oriental fan with a body suit and a completely sheer maxi-skirt. A few attendees simply opted for strange headgear and accessories in order to up the ante, with a neon battery-powered fur hood, excessively-adorned veils and heavy-duty hair jewellery.

It also seemed that gold lamé was the choice fabric of the weekend, with a few revellers trussed up in it, whether it was a crimped cape or skin-tight hot pants. Clash-tastic!

"A two-year-old girl in southern California was found naked sitting by herself in a parking lot two hours after disappearing from her mother at a car wash. The Gardena toddler reportedly shouted 'mommy' before her mother turned around and could not find her daughter around 4.55 pm on Thursday.

"Dr Habeeb Latheef is accused of sexually assaulting three women patients during consultations . A married doctor sexually assaulted three female patients while pretending to carry out medical tests, a court heard yesterday. Habeeb Latheef, 48, told them he needed to place objects in their hands to gauge their level of feeling. Instead the family GP allegedly unzipped his trousers and placed his penis in their grip. The patients had booked appointments with the Indian-born doctor to deal with back pain and pins and needles. Latheef is said to have told the women to turn away from him with their hands behind their backs. He put items in their grip, such as a pen and a key, telling the women this would measure their levels of sensitivity. One of the women suspected he was also using his penis and turned to see him bent over and doing up his zip. The alleged offences came to light in December 2011 when a 37-year-old patient contacted police an hour after her appointment with Latheef. The two other allegations from women relate to that year and to 2008. William Hunter, prosecuting, said these two patients at the Hendford Medical Centre in Yeovil, Somerset, did not contact police because they feared they would not be believed. He told Taunton Crown Court the 37-year-old woman visited Latheef with a stiff neck and headache. After a number of tests, Latheef suggested he should measure her sensitivity. The married GP was working at the Hendford Medical Centre surgery in Yeovil, Somerset, pictured . Latheef is on trial at Taunton Crown Court, pictured above, accused of carrying out the assaults over a four year period . Mr Hunter said: ‘He put a pen in her hand. She felt that. He then put a small key in her hand, she felt that. He then put his finger in her hand. ‘She was able to easily recognise each item. Then he put his penis in her hand. He did this more than once. 'It felt different to all the other items. She knew it was a penis. She was shocked. She asked him what he was putting into her hand. 'As she turned around the defendant was bending over and zipping up his trousers. The defendant said it was his finger.’ Mr Hunter said the mother of two was a ‘mature woman’ and knew exactly what she had felt in her hand. Latheef, of Yeovil, denies three charges of sexual assault between February 2008 and December 2011. The trial continues.

"Jeremy Scott’s spring/summer 2015 collection for Moschino caused an Insta-stampede, nearly breaking the internet when he sent human Barbie dolls down the catwalk. The creative head, who is famed for making kitsch cool, sent his models down the runway in Milan in Barbie doll inspired dresses to the sound of Aqua's iconic 90s hit, I'm A Barbie Girl. As the ultimate dictator of trends, it seems that we may all be wearing bright pink leathers and super girly dresses this season. But does the look work in real life? And will you garner attention for the right reasons?  Weighed down by eyelashes, Olivia Phillips, 30, a journalist at Emirates Woman, decided to find out by taking to the streets of Dubai dressed like the iconic doll. Here's how she got on... Scroll down for video . If Moschino's latest collection is anything to go by, Barbie will be our style icon this season. Weighed down by eyelashes, Olivia Phillips took to the streets (and supermarkets) of Dubai dressed as the iconic doll . I’m like a vampire Barbie; I only come out at night. Daylight hours, on the other hand, are a very different story, with me championing a pretty consistent, low-fi uniform of skinny jeans, biker jackets and a scruffy bun. My nocturnal counterpart, however, stands in almost unrecognisable contrast; her heels are high and her hair even higher. So although donning Jeremy Scott’s Barbie-inspired Moschino collection wasn’t as much of an almighty leap for me as it would be for, say, the rest of the world, it still required a certain amount of chutzpah to take it to the streets. Still,  I located my audacity and got out there to see exactly how the looks would translate to real life. It only took one Google search to reveal exactly how popular Barbie still is - but a far more entertaining barometer was watching the office’s reaction when a giant box from Moschino arrived at my desk. With the same fervour usually reserved for a Magnolia delivery, I was suddenly surrounded by a cluster of excited, giggling women on the edge. Olivia explained that literally everyone smiled at her. Doors opened for her, small animals and children stared, she got a hand with her shopping and a wink with her Starbucks . Olivia wore the spray-on leather skirt suit to do the weekly shop. Navigating the supermarket aisles, she admits she felt like a saucy Stepford Wife . Everyone had a story to share – from the doll they had in the 1980s wearing the exact same dress, to the toy dreamhouse they used to play in with their sister. That powerful sense of nostalgia, and that unifying, almost categorical common ground, is something not many things could manage. Moschino seems to have achieved it to the next level, creating a collection overflowing with universal happy memories. Indeed, Jeremy Scott said of the collection: 'I approach everything with so much humour.' And as gimmicky as some naysayers may have accused it of being, I now have first-hand experience of its mood-enhancing capabilities – for me, and for literally everyone who had my very pink person cross their path. For a start, it turns previously mute colleagues into your new best friend in the office bathroom. People you have literally never laid eyes on before want to have a good old chinwag, all-pink leather acting as some kind of conversational lubricant. Everyone, and I mean everyone, smiles. Doors open. Small animals and children stare. You get a hand with your shopping and a wink with your Starbucks. And when you post a selfie onto Facebook you get 93 likes and 28 comments and it makes you feel a little bit important. At the end of the day, she changed into the piece de résistance; a very short, very wide and very sequinned mini dress and made her way to meet a blissfully unaware friend. 'What in the name of Joan Collins are you wearing? You look like a cake! Don’t stand so close to me,' he said . You also get people who you haven’t heard from in three years sending you dubious private messages, but that’s a small price to pay for becoming a social media sensation for three and a half minutes. Such is the power of pink, people. Practicality, then, becomes almost superfluous. It might be a glorious 30-degree desert day, but I’ll be damned if I’m not going to wear my spray-on leather skirt suit to do the weekly shop. Navigating the supermarket aisles, I felt like a saucy Stepford Wife. A cupcake tray ended up in my basket. And some oven gloves. It was weird. I did, on the other hand, get unwittingly, and worryingly, into character. I forgot a pair of my Louboutins in the toilets after changing outfits. Forgetful Barbie. I, when wearing an enormous puffball dress, tried to answer my office phone whilst standing and ricocheted off my desk. No Sense Of Spacial Awareness Barbie. And when being photographed having a meeting in Ladurée, I shoved a fake macaron in my mouth after being told in no uncertain terms that it was display only. Insanity Barbie. Walking through the streets, the looks were plentiful but surreptitious. Bar a few spectators who stopped to take pictures (thank-you for restoring my faith in shamelessness – I was briefly convinced that everyone had been castrated by manners), people would stare, but only when they thought I couldn’t see. Also: not one person sang Aqua’s Barbie Girl at me. NOT ONE. I mean, come on. Frankly, I was disappointed at the lack of clichés. 'It might be obvious, brash even - but it fits our current filtered, Insta-existence perfectly - there's no denying the collection looks great in a picture,' she said of the experience . It raised that age-old question of whether you dress for yourself or others, as however cheerful my ensemble made me, I still felt the small need for validation from others. It’s kind of the sartorial equivalent of if a tree falls in the forest and there’s no one around to hear it. If you’re outrageously attired and no one bats an eyelid, it kind of takes the fun out of it, no? 'Habibti, this is Dubai,' a straight-shooting friend told me after I had a little moan about it on the (vanity mirror) phone. 'OTT is expected, remember?' Satisfied with this, I changed into the piece de résistance; a very short, very wide and very sequinned mini dress straight outta 1983, and made my merry way to Art Dubai to meet a blissfully unaware friend. 'What in the name of Joan Collins are you wearing? You look like a cake! Don’t stand so close to me,' he said. I’m falling at the last hurdle so decide to rapidly explain myself. 'I’m doing a road test!' I shout over the music. 'A protest? What the hell are you protesting against?! Rational clothing?' Well, two out of three workable outfits ain’t bad. I drag my mortified friend to Q43 and then back to change into my civvies which, I won’t lie, now seem really sad in comparison. If Jeremy Scott has tapped into anything, it’s unadulterated whimsy. It might be obvious, brash even - but it fits our current filtered, Insta-existence perfectly - there’s no denying the collection looks great in a picture. A very wise person once told me life was too short to wear boring clothes. And as long as Scott’s around, there’s really not much danger of that. After completing the challenge, pictured, she changed back into her normal clothes, which she says felt 'sad in comparison'","Olivia Phillips, 30, rocked head-to-toe Moschino .

"A transgender woman who had her face horribly damaged after it was injected with cement and tire sealant stepped out on Sunday showing off a new look. Rajee Narinesingh was one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, who performed illegal plastic surgeries using substances such as Fix-a-Flat, Super Glue and mineral oil. Rajee had Morris inject her cheeks, lips and chin back in 2005, and ended up disfigured after she did not have the money to go to a proper cosmetic surgeon. Scroll down for videos . Rajee Narinesingh (above), one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend . Rajee was recently treated by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif in a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched . Left with a 'hard-as-rock' face, Rajee began seeing Dr John Martin of Coral Gables Cosmetic Reconstructive Surgery in 2012, who gave her softening injections and laser therapy to treat the botched surgery. In a 2014 interview she said that her new look was helping to boost her self-esteem, and that men were taking notice. 'Recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon,' she said at the time. 'I didn't know whether to slap him or kiss him.' Now, she has had her look improved once again by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif, a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched. Rajee, who was born in New York but grew up in Philadelphia, explained when she realized she was a woman in that 2014 interview. She explained; 'Up until I was in my mid-twenties I just thought I was a feminine gay male. I thought about all the things I did when I was growing up - like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing basketball with it I was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to give birth and be a mommy. 'When I used to fantasize about being with guys I used to always picture myself with breasts and a vagina. I didn't realize I was doing it, it was just so natural for me. One day I just connected all the dots and thought ""you're not gay, you're transgender.""' Rajee lived in solitude and was afraid to go out after her face was left disfigured (above) That all changed in 2012 when she began receiving free treatments from Dr John Martin . Rajee, who had been too 'embarrassed and ashamed' to go to the authorities, claims she paid just $100 per session to Morris for the life-changing injections back in 2005. 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' she said of her decision to get the injections. 'If you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction. 'So I made the choice to get injections done. In our community it is called pumping.' And while she knew she was not seeing a licensed surgeon, she was still excited the day she went to see Morris. 'When it finally came to the day, I was more excited than nervous because I was finally going to be the woman I had always wanted to be,' she said. 'There was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures.' The room looked sterile and clean she said, and sokn after she arrived they began the procedure. 'I got injections in my face and my hips and my buttocks and initially I was fine,' said Rajee. 'But then the nightmare started.' 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' Rajee (above) said of her decision to get the injections. Oneal Ron Morris (above, file photo) is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances, including super glue and Fix-A-Flat . She was left with a large boil on her face that kept growing bigger and bigger, and then 'green pus exploded out of my face and onto the mirror. It was green and yellow and mixed with blood.' She ended up spending years in solitude as a result of these botched procedures, until Dr Martin agreed to help her for free. Because of him, she says she has gone from 'victim to victorious.' She is also ready to start dating again, saying; 'I definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window.' As for Morris, she is now facing manslaughter charges after one of her patients died following a procedure.","Rajee Narinesingh, one of the victims of 'toxic tush doctor 'Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend .

"This is the photograph circulating on social media site SnapChat that is believed to show a principal watching pornography in the office of his elite private school. The picture, taken by a person who claims to be a student at Geelong College, south-west of Melbourne, is believed to show disgraced principal Andrew Barr surfing for pornography while on-the-clock. In the picture taken through a window, the man has his back to the camera and graphic images can be seen on his computer screen. Mr Barr resigned from his position at The Geelong College after an investigation, which included a search of his computer, after the photograph appeared on Snapchat. This is the photograph circulating on social media that is believed to show principal Andrew Barr watching pornography in his office at Geelong College . Daily Mail Australia contacted the school to verify the image is of Mr Barr but it was not willing to comment further. Chairman of the Geelong College council, Dr Hugh Seward, told the Geelong Advertiser last week the matter was a serious breach of the school's standards, even if the investigation found Mr Barr not to have broken any law. 'The matter was taken very seriously,' Dr Seward said. 'Just before Easter, The Geelong College council became aware of a matter of concern that might constitute a breach of our standards.' 'The council immediately looked into the matter and when our concerns were confirmed, Andrew Barr tendered his resignation.' Mr Barr resigned after a student at The Geelong College took the picture of him and shared it with other students using the photosharing app, Snapchat . In a statement, Dr Seward thanked Mr Barr for his contribution to the school since he joined the college in 2013. ‘In the two years since his appointment, Mr Barr has made an enduring contribution to the College’s educational vision and future planning. The Council is grateful for Mr Barr’s commitment and achievement,' he said. Mr Barr is a former chairman of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia and previously served 10 years as principal of Scotch Oakburn College in Melbourne. Dr Seward told the Geelong Advertiser the investigation confirmed Mr Barr had not broken any law and 'at no point' did his actions affect the care provided to students. The Geelong College Council has since announced it has begun searching for a new Principal.

"Celebrities wouldn't be anywhere without their fans, but for some unlucky stars adoration can tip over into something far more sinister. Californian Joshua Corbett faces charges of stalking and burglary this week after allegedly breaking into actress Sandra Bullock's home last summer. Terrified Sandra, 50, who was in her property at the time, was forced to make a desperate call to the police having locked herself in a cupboard. Scroll down for video . Sandra Bullock was horrified when she discovered that Joshua Corbett had broken into her house last summer . In the disturbing voice clip released byTMZ - which was played to the court as Corbett stands trail - the audibly panicked Oscar winner is heard telling the police that she is hiding in her closet. She is heard saying: 'I'm in my closet. I have a safe door. I'm locked in the closet right now.' Corbett has pleaded not guilty to the charges bought against him. Corbett broke into the house on 8 June last year brandishing a love letter for the actress. In the clip Sandra can be heard saying that she had seen him making his way up to her attic. The judge read out a section of the note which Corbett had been carrying in a black notepad which said: 'You are so hot and intelligent and lithesome and taut.' Corbett, who was found in Sandra's home clutching a love letter for the actress, has pleaded not guilty to the charges bought against him . Corbett's defense lawyer Paul Takakijan said: 'The love letter that Corbett carried with him professed nothing but love and admiration. 'There is nothing in there about harming her. The people are trying to make more of the case than there is.' Corbett also is charged with having an arsenal of illegal weapons, including assault weapons, tracer ammunition and machine guns, that were found when authorities searched his home in Montrose, California. Corbett was not armed when he was arrested at Bullock's residence, police have said. Unfortunately Sandra is not the first person to experience a celebrity stalker. A-listers such as Madonna, Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber have also been plagued by the experience. Here FEMAIL lists some of the worst offenders... Kim was stalked by a man named Dennis Shaun Bowman who would show up to events with a jokers mask painted on his face . Kim Kardashian: Dennis Shaun Bowman .

Kim wrote in court papers at the time: 'I am extremely frightened by Mr Bowman because he appears to be obsessed with me and is extremely delusional.' Kim took out a restraining order on Dennis Shaun Bowman who would use Twitter to find out which events Kim would be attending . Creepy Bowman came to Kim's attention after he started showing up at events or public appearances, often with the joker mask painted onto his face. It is thought that Dennis would discover Kim's whereabouts through her Twitter page and even though he was often asked to leave he was never put off. Kim was also said to be disturbed by ranting messages that Bowman would post on Twitter. He reportedly contacted Kim's then boyfriend Miles Austin and her sister Khloe on the social networking site. Madonna's stalker was shot after he scaled the fence of her property, he is now in a mental health institution . Madonna: Robert Dewey Hoskins . Madonna's stalker has to be one of the most terrifying of all time. Robert Dewey Hoskins was a 'psychotic' stalker who scaled the walls of her house and threatened to slit her throat. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1996 after he climbed the fence of Madonna's home and was shot twice by her personal security. After breaking into her house on several occasions Robert handed Madonna's staff a note which said he wanted to slit her throat . He had invaded Madonna's property on several occasions even giving her staff a note containing his threats. Robert, who was said to have 'violent tendencies' also stalked actress Halle Berry. In 2012 he escaped the mental health institution he had been committed to after his release from prison but was found and returning to the institution. Justin Bieber was the subject of a murder plot by two convicted criminals until one of them turned himself in . Justin Bieber: Dana Martin . Justin's terrifying stalker Dana Martin was already a convicted rapist and killer when he decided to target the pop star. Along with his fellow inmate at the Las Cruces state prison in New Mexico, Mark Staake, he plotted to kill Justin, enlisting the help of Staake's nephew to carry out the plot. Dana Martin - who was already a convicted rapist and murderer - planned to kill Justin Bieber but he turned himself in before going through with the plan . The plan was that he would travel to New York to murder Justin but Dana turned himself in before they went through with it. It is thought the inmate was fanatically obsessed with the young singer and even had a tattoo of him on his leg. Nicole Kidman's stalker Matthew Hooker claimed that she had previously flirted with him, and he then called her house repeatedly asking her to go to the ballet with him . Nicole Kidman: Matthew Hooker . In 2001 Nicole Kidman won a stalking case against Matthew Hooker who claimed that the actress had flirted with him when they met.

In 2009 Justin Timberlake won a restraining order against a woman named Karen McNeil after he reported that that her 'ever-increasing aggressive and harassing conduct' was causing him to fear for his personal safety. Karen had turned up at the singer's home on a number of occasions, trespassed on his property and claimed to be a friend of the singer. Justin told the court at the time: 'I do not personally know, nor have any relationship with a Karen McNeil, nor do I desire any interaction with her whatsoever. 'I have never invited her to my property, nor has she ever been given permission to enter my property or home.'

"Theresa May initially rejected an application for the 32-year-old Taliban henchman to stay in the UK, but her decision was overturned by immigration judges . A Taliban henchman suspected of murder in Afghanistan has won the right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds. The 32-year-old, known only by the initials SAKA, admitted that his father was in charge of 65 Taliban troops, but claimed he only agreed to join the terrorist group because he was worried about his safety. He also claimed he had been tortured during four years in jail in Kandahar after being accused of killing a provincial governor’s son. The bodyguard escaped from prison and went into hiding, but claimed that he fled to Britain after Taliban fighters tried to track him down. The Afghan, whose identity has been kept secret by the courts, had an initial claim for sanctuary rejected by Home Secretary Theresa May. But in a controversial move, immigration judges have now thrown out her decision and given SAKA permission to stay because he was entitled to asylum and protection under human rights laws. It was ruled that deporting him to Afghanistan would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. Experts said he would be ‘at risk of mistreatment and physical harm if he were arrested on account of being a suspected Taliban’. Court papers said: ‘During his time with the Taliban he saw a leader behead a man because he believed him to be a spy. After this incident his father decided to leave the Taliban. ‘Whilst crossing the desert the appellant and his father were arrested and placed in detention. The appellant was accused of killing MK, the son of the governor of Herat. ‘The appellant claims he then spent four years in Sarpoza prison in Kandahar and was never formally convicted or tried. ‘He claimed he was tortured and his head was covered and he was beaten.’ SAKA claimed he escaped from the prison and travelled with a Taliban member to his home in Kunduz. He said his father had been shot dead trying to flee the jail. At some point he arrived in the UK. The Home Office considered whether he had actually been convicted of murder and whether his presence in Britain ‘constituted a danger to the community’. Hearing the case in the Upper Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, Judge Helen Rimington ruled that if SAKA were sent home the Taliban 'might also be informed of his return’ Lawyers for the department accepted he was a ‘low level member of the Taliban’. Hearing the case in the Upper Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, Judge Helen Rimington ruled that if SAKA were sent home the Taliban 'might also be informed of his return’. He would also be at risk from the current Afghan government on the basis of his former membership of the Taliban, she said. Last night, a former British commander criticised the judgement and demanded a shake-up of human rights legislation so it could not be exploited by former insurgents. Colonel Richard Kemp, who led UK forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘Our blind adherence to European human rights legislation sees British soldiers who risk their lives to defend us hounded through the courts while this enemy fighter is allowed to stay here to threaten our country. ‘Our security at home already has enough challenges from experienced jihadists returning from Syria without our own courts wantonly adding to our problems in this way. ‘This case underlines the urgent need to change the law to prevent such dangerous absurdities.’","32-year-old, known as SAKA, claimed he fled to Britain to escape Taliban .

"A man killed more than 1,000 dogs in Russia  as revenge as he believed the strays were responsible for giving him tuberculosis, a trial heard. Danila Kislitsyn told police  it was his duty to eliminate dogs from the streets around Vladivostok as they posed a threat to people and needed to be wiped out. The 31-year-old would travel around the south-eastern Russian city using poisoned sausages and setting traps to kill  strays and occasionally even people's pets. Danila Kislitsyn (pictured at his trial) has been found guilty of killing 1,000 dogs by giving them poisoned sausages . Officials heard the attacks were revenge as he blamed the animals for him contracting tuberculosis several years previously which had left him in a weakened state. He was arrested as part of a campaign by animal-rights activists who had spent two years monitoring Kislitsyn who would sometimes kill as many as a dozen dogs a day. Kislitsyn had to be sent for psychiatric tests ahead of the trial but was found fit to stand. But animal charities were furious when Judge Olga Yerokhina handed Kislitsyn a fine of just £200. The trial heard that Kislitsyn, pictured with a police officer at his trial, claimed it was his duty to eliminate stray dogs from the streets saying they posed a threat to people and needed to be wiped out . Judge Olga Yerokhina sentenced the 31-year-old, who also believed dogs were to blame for him contracting tuberculosis, to pay just £200 for the canine genocide . Activist Sarah Pirogova from the charity Animal Defender said: 'He was responsible for a dog genocide in his neighbourhood, sometimes a dozen bodies of dead dogs could be spotted on the streets in single day. 'He says he only targeted strays but very often people's pets were also poisoned after eating a piece of sausage that he had laced with poison.' Activists tested the sausages and found that not only were they poisoned, they also contained tablets designed to stop the dogs vomiting so that they could not throw up the lethal food. She added: 'We tried to confront him about it but he was extremely violent and would use spray before running off, so we finally decided to hand a report to police. 'We are disappointed with the result but hope that he will not want to pay another fine and will now stop what he has been doing.'","Danila Kislitsyn killed more than 1,000 dogs in Russian city of Vladivostok .

"Police are investigating claims by a former royal footman that palace aides tried to force him into an orgy, it was revealed yesterday. Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House. The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day. He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s. Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s . But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified, he claims. Mr Lawler, now 64, said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother’s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27. He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift. Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them – one a senior member of staff, he said. He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself. ‘That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me,’ he told the Sunday People. ‘I was staggered. The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me, holding me in the chair. Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence . ‘They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room.’ Afterwards, Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet. A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House – so he packed his bags immediately. Mr Lawler, a former Port of Liverpool police officer, said he was ‘haunted’ by the incident for years. After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace, but was twice rebuffed. Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard. A retired royal aide, who is now in his 80s, was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time. Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work ‘exhaustively and co-operatively’ with any police probe. A police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment ‘as investigations continue’.","Christopher Lawler claims he was pinned to a chair and groped by staff .

"In an effort to counter rival Netflix's entry into the Australian market, cable TV's Foxtel will launch the third season of the critically acclaimed US women's prison drama Orange is the New Black by screening every episode in a full season marathon. A kink in the agreement with US studio Lionsgate - under which both Foxtel and rival Netflix share the rights - allows Foxtel to offer episodes of the series as an on-demand streaming title as well. Pedestrian.TV website reports that the one lingering issue that adversely affects Netflix's operations in Australia is pre-existing distribution deals cut for its original shows in markets where, previously, it didn't exist. Taylor Schilling (left) is the main character in Netflix series Orange is the New Black . In Australia, this applies to the way Orange is the New Black was shown 'legally' in the country, leaving the door open for Foxtel to screen the series. Foxtel's priority distribution is the traditional one episode at a time airing method. And all episodes must air in this manner before they can offer the program as an on demand option. However, when the third season of the prison drama premieres on Netflix on June 12, Foxtel will also begin showing the entire season in one continuous marathon, beginning at the same time. The established prison drama is currently one of Netflix's flagship TV shows . Doing this means that when the marathon is completed around 14 or so hours later, Foxtel can then upload the entire season and offer the episodes on an on-demand basis for customers. The popular TV series is based on the book of the same name, by Piper Kerman, about a woman who is sent to prison for a crime she committed in her youth. It's a cast that includes Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew, Natasha Lyonne and Australian actress Yael Stone. The TV series is about a woman who is sent to prison for a crime she committed in her youth . The Sydney Morning Herald reports that former MTV Australia and Foxtel presenter Ruby Rose appears in the show's third season, reportedly as a prisoner who becomes in involved with both Piper (Schilling) and Alex (Laura Prepon). In the US, the series is one of the major titles for Netflix there, though the organisation recently clashed with the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which controls the Emmy Awards, over whether the show is considered a comedy or a drama. The upshot is that Orange is the New Black must now compete as a drama at this year's Emmy Awards, a move which means the series will compete directly against Netflix's other flagship show House of Cards. In the US, the series is hugely popular and is one of the major titles for Netflix there .","Foxtel to screen critically acclaimed US women's prison drama .

"Passengers of an Icelandair flight to Denver on Tuesday were left in a bit of shock after their plane was struck by lightning shortly after takeoff. Though the Boeing 757 continued its 3,700-mile journey from Reykjavik, Iceland, to Denver, it wasn't until the plane landed that passengers and crew were aware of a gaping hole in the nose of the plane. The hole was at a point in the plane where weather radars are housed, but the plane landed safely in Denver and no one was injured. It is unknown how many people were on board. A plane was struck by lightning shortly after takeoff during a flight from Reykjavik, Iceland, to Denver, Colorado on Tuesday . It wasn't until after landing that the passengers and crew found out the lightning strike caused a gaping hole at the nose of the plane . Passenger Kyle Hernandez, a member of the band The Bunny Gang, said that the lightning 'shook the plane and it was bright'. 'Everybody kind of got tense and we all jumped and looked at each other,' Hernandez told FOX31. His bandmate Nathen Maxwell told the Denver Post that it sounded like a 'bang and a pop'. 'At some point pretty soon after we left, we got hit. It wasn't at the halfway point,' Maxwell said. 'I thought we'd probably have to go for an emergency landing or turn around, detour or something.' Passenger Amanda Boldenow said everyone from the plane immediately walked to the terminal's windows when they arrived in Denver. 'We walked over and everyone is staring at this hole in the nose,' she said. 'Lighting had struck the plane. I had never been in a plane that had been struck by lightning, so I was really startled.' The journey from Reykjavik to Denver is about 3,740 miles. Passengers on the plane said the lightning struck shortly after takeoff . Pilots reported the lighting but continued on with the eight-hour flight to Denver. The plane landed safely and no one was injured . Aviation experts said that lightning strikes to commercial planes happen one to five times per year, according to 9News, and modern aircraft are equipped to handle these strikes. Metropolitan State University of Denver aviation professor Jeff Price said that lightning strikes that damage a plane, however, are rare. 'It could be one of those weird ""acts of God"" where it hit at the right point. The important thing is the plane landed safely,' Price said. A spokesman from Icelandair said that though people were concerned there was no detour, the pilots followed protocol in the situation. The spokesman said: 'During departure from Keflavik International Airport the Boeing 757 aircraft used for Icelandair flight 671 was struck by lightning. 'The aircraft handling characteristics and notification systems were unaffected and the flight continued. 'Lightning strikes are common and protocol was followed. There was no cause for further concern and the flight landed without issue. This aircraft was replaced upon landing and is being evaluated.' The plane has been removed from service and will be inspected and repaired and Iceland's FAA equivalent will be responsible of the investigation.","Flight was traveling from Reykjavik, Iceland to Denver when it was struck .

"The twin 18-month-old boys who died after falling into an Arizona canal last week have been identified as bothers Eli and Silas Keslar of Yuma. While authorities in the southern Arizona town have not yet officially identified the victims, a Go Fund Me page set up this weekend named them and their parents, Mark and Alexis Keslar. Marlene Gleim, a friend of the boys' grandmother Marlena Martinez, set up the page after learning about their deaths on local media. The fund to cover memorial and medical costs for the boys has already raised over $10,000.

"Housing chiefs have been were accused of hypocrisy for opposing plans to revive Margaret Thatcher’s flagship right-to-buy policy. The pledge to extend the dream of home ownership to 1.3million social tenants was the centrepiece of Tuesday’s Tory manifesto launch. But housing associations responded furiously – with one board member lambasting the proposal as the ‘right to steal’. There were even threats of a legal challenge, potentially under European human rights laws. Jane Ashcroft (left) the Anchor housing association boss is reported to earn £332,000 a year while David Bennett (right) of the Sanctuary Group is said to earn £314,000 a year . Jane Ashcroft's modern detached home (left) in the Midlands was bought for £750,000 in 2005 while David Bennett's detached farmhouse (right) in rural Herefordshire was bought for £295,000 in 2003 . But the bosses of housing associations, which are not for profit, were themselves in the dock after details emerged of their lavish salaries. Eighty pocket more than Mr Cameron’s salary of £142,500. One – David Cowans of Places for People – takes home an astonishing £432,928, including bonuses. Five others are on £250,000-plus. Bob Neill, a Tory Party vice chairman, said: ‘It’s a bit rich coming from chief executives who are lining their pockets with six-figure salaries. ‘Everyone should have the opportunity to buy their own home. ‘Right to buy has already helped around two million families realise their dream of owning their own home – and by extending it, we’ll give even more hardworking people the chance to move on and up the housing ladder.’ The housing associations said it was wrong that they should be forced to sell their homes at a discount. The National Housing Federation, the trade body for the organisations, pledged to fight the proposals ‘every step of the way’. And Rev Richard Coles, a vicar and BBC broadcaster who sits on the board of Wellingborough Homes, a small housing association in Northamptonshire, launched a furious attack on Twitter. ‘So a housing association, like the one on whose board I sit, goes to the market, raises finance, does deals with contractors and builds urgently needed units for people to live in at social rents and then the government forces us to sell them off at a 35 per cent discount. That’s right to buy? Sounds like right to steal to me.’ Simon Dow (left) of the Guinness Partnership is said to earn £264,000 a year while Darrell Mercer (right) is reported to earn £247,000 a year . Simon Dow' townhouse (left) in trendy North London has an estimated value of £750,000 while Darrell Mercer's five bed-room semi-detached townhouse (right) in West London was bought for £732,500 in 2006 . The policy director of the National Housing Federation, Ruth Davison, a Labour party member in Islington, said it was wrong to hand money to ‘some of the most securely-housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents’. She told the BBC: ‘We are independent organisations and charities – you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they’re worth than you can force Tesco, or even Cancer Research. ‘So housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale. There will be a cost to the taxpayer.’ Council house tenants in England can already buy their home at a discount of up to £103,900. The Tories would extend this to 800,000 housing association tenants who now have limited purchase rights and to 500,000 who have no rights at all. Around 2.7million people live in these properties. The subsidies would be funded by making councils sell their more costly properties once they become vacant. Every house purchased would be replaced ‘on a one-for-one basis’. Unveiling the policy in Swindon, Mr Cameron said: ‘Part of having a good life is having a home of your own. It’s not about assets and appreciating values – it’s about someone standing there with their keys in their hand thinking “this place is mine”. ‘The next Conservative government will extend the right to buy to all housing association tenants in this country. That’s 1.3million extra families – a whole new generation given the security of a home. The pledge to extend the dream of home ownership to 1.3million social tenants was the centrepiece of Tuesday’s Tory manifesto launch . ‘So let the message ring out from this generation of Conservatives: you’ve worked hard, you’ve saved, the home you live in, it’s yours to buy, yours to own. ‘The dream of a property-owning democracy is alive – and we will fulfil it.’ The plan was welcomed by Paula Higgins, chief executive of the HomeOwners Alliance, who said: ‘The overwhelming majority of British people of all backgrounds want to own their own home, rather than rent them.’ Tony Stacey, of South Yorkshire Housing Association, said last month that he would definitely launch a challenge. ‘This is so fundamentally critical to us,’ he said. ‘It would shoot up to the top of our risk map if it was confirmed. We are duty bound morally to fight it in any way we possibly can.’ Industry sources believe the plans could fall foul of charity law, because housing associations are generally prohibited from selling off their assets at below market value. One lawyer said it might even breach article 1, protocol 1, of the European Convention on Human Rights, which grants the ‘right to the peaceful enjoyment of one’s possessions’. ‘I can’t see how this could get through the legal system. It’s completely reckless,’ said Richard Murphy, of Tax Research LLP. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said the right-to-buy pledge showed the Tories had ‘run out of ideas’, adding that it was just ‘a poor cover version of one of Margaret Thatcher’s 1980s hits’. Housing association chief executives whose salaries have been revealed by Inside Housing magazine include Jane Ashcroft of Anchor who was on a package of £332,316 in 2013/14. Four others were: David Bennett of Sanctuary Group, who was on £314,416; Keith Exford of Affinity Sutton (£289,088); Simon Dow of the Guinness Partnership (£264,000); and Darrell Mercer of the A2 Dominion Group (£247,000). A study by the GMB union found that two out of five council houses sold in Wandsworth, south-west London, in the 1980s, are now owned by private landlords, who rent them to tenants. It said reviving the policy would benefit private landlords.","Tories pledged to extend dream of home ownership to 1.3m social tenants .

It is based in the high-end Ennismore Gardens, London where Gardner, who famously starred in The Killers, The Barefoot Contessa, 55 Days at Peking and The Night of the Iguana, lived from 1968 - after her three failed marriages, to Mickey Rooney, Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra -  until her death in 1990. Homes along Ennismore Gardens have a long history, built in 1870 as part of the redevelopment of Kingston House, a Palladian mansion dating back to the 18th Century, belonging to Elizabeth Chudleigh, Duchess of Kingston. The mansion and its estate was later sold to William Hare, Baron of Ennismore, in 1837, but was sold off for development following his death, with the street and private gardens named to commemorate him. Once completed the five-storey homes along Ennismore Gardens, designed with Porticos and Corinthian Columns, commanded a premium of £17,000 per year. The pin-up girl of her era, Ava Gardner (right) was listed 25th among the American Film Institute's Greatest Female Stars in the 1950s with high-profile marriages to Mickey Rooney and Frank Sinatra (pictured with Ava, left) Gardner, pictured at her Knightsbridge flat in the same building was once quoted as saying 'I love the history and grandeur of my little London retreat, some say it is too big for me alone, but I love the space' Once described as 'the most irresistible woman in Hollywood', Ava Gardner became one of the pin-up girls in the 1950s. High-profile roles in in films such as the Hucksters (1947), Show Boat (1951) and The Night of the Iguana (1964) catapulted her into the limelight. But her off-screen life was often as dramatic as the roles she played, with marriages to Mickey Rooney, Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra. She was said to have been the only woman who could ever tame the notorious playboy Sinatra. After they met he told Ava: ‘All my life, being a singer was the most important thing in the world. Now you’re all I want.’ The pair married in 1951 but it was tumultuous. Ava was a diva with a soul whose turbulence equalled his own. Both ­harboured profound feelings of ­worthlessness, which expressed ­themselves in volcanic furies. ‘We were high-strung people,’ she said. ‘Possessive, jealous and liable to explode fast. When I lose my temper, you can’t find it any place. He’s the same.’ Like him, she was infinitely restless and easily bored. In both, this tendency could lead to casual cruelty to others —and to each other. They quarrelled ­constantly. Friends whose house the lovers met in recalled how Ava would scream at Frank and he would slam the door and storm downstairs. Eventually the couple split in 1957. She later moved to London where she was to pass away on January 25, 1990, at age 67. She is listed 25th among the American Film Institute's Greatest Female Stars. The property offers triple aspect views with private gardens at the front and rear of the building, and access to the large private garden square on Ennismore Gardens.

Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

"Red squirrels have returned to one of Britain's most stunning beauty spots after a 16-year absence . Red squirrels have returned to one of Britain's most stunning beauty spots after a 16-year absence. Native reds have been almost wiped out in the country, except for a few pockets in the north of England, the Isle of Wight and Scotland after rival grey squirrels arrived from America in the 19th century. Numbers of the reds, popularly illustrated in the Beatrix Potter Squirrel Nutkin books, have been rapidly dwindling thanks in large part to the squirrel pox virus carried by greys. But now, red squirrels have been spotted in Windermere, in the picturesque Lake District. Experts say a lack of habitats caused them to disappear from the area. Since 1952, 95% of red squirrels have been wiped out in England and Wales. But Bob Cartwright, of charity Westmorland Red Squirrels, said they are returning to woods in the area - and some have even been spotted in the town centre. He said: 'So far this year there have been seven sightings, including just a few weeks ago a red seen bouncing around in Ellerthwaite Square right in the centre of Windermere. 'It is pretty clear that they are here in good numbers.' Disease, habitat loss and competition for food from non-native grey squirrels have been blamed for the decline in reds. Recent UK studies of 300 woodlands have also shown red squirrels are battling against the greys with numbers rising steadily. Scroll down for video . Experts say there have been a number of sightings of red squirrels in Windermere, in the picturesque Lake District (pictured) Scientists think endangered red squirrels have finally achieved immunity to the killer pox carried by their grey rivals after 140 years. Meanwhile Anglesey, North Wales, is now a grey squirrel-free zone, wildlife experts claim after a controversial 20-year eradication programme on the island. Grey squirrels have been blamed for carrying diseases which have endangered the population of red squirrels. More than 700 red squirrels are now thought to live on Anglesey, with many crossing the Menai Strait to settle in Bangor. In 2013, academics found a red nicknamed 'Clark Kent', after Superman's alter ego, who was stricken with the deadly 'parapox virus' and managed to fight it off and live. The research, carried out by the University of Liverpool, was heralded as a major breakthrough as it proved that reds can build immunity. Rachel Miller, Red Squirrel field officer at the Wildlife Trust for Lancashire and North Merseyside, said: 'It could be a few years down the line until we know for sure if red squirrels have any long-term immunity or not, as there is much more research that needs to be done. Experts say a lack of habitats caused them to disappear from the area. Pictured: view of Lake WIndermere . 'But this squirrel survived the pox, which is great news. 'We named him Clark, after Superman's 'Clark Kent', because he's a super squirrel. We don't know why he survived, but something made him resistant to the pox. 'We radio-tracked him after his release so we could check on his progress back in the wild and he did well.' The species was almost wiped out at the Formby National Trust Reserve when there was a squirrel pox virus outbreak in 2008 and the population declined by over 80 per cent. Numbers are now increasing with red squirrel sightings reported across the region. Red squirrels have been almost wiped out, except for a few pockets in the north of England, the Isle of Wight and Scotland. File photo . The red squirrel has been a native of Britain for several thousand years, but the first grey squirrels were brought here from North America in 1876. Over the years, more were introduced, notably by the Duke of Bedford to the park at Woburn Abbey where they thrived. But contrary to popular belief that greys are 'driving out' the reds, experts believe it is because the greys being more adaptable to our ecosystem. A major factor is the ability to survive tough winters due to the fact that greys generally carry more body fat - and a full-grown grey can weigh almost twice as much as a red. Grey squirrels are also more adventurous and happier foraging on the ground, whereas red squirrels spend most of their lives high up in conifer trees and their diet is less varied. Greys became known as 'vermin' in the 1920s and 1930s when their large numbers started to cause significant damage to commercial forestry and beech trees. A law was passed in 1938 banning further importation of these creatures, and in following years various methods were tried without success to control grey squirrels. This coincided with low red squirrel numbers after the red population was decimated between 1900 and 1920 by the parapox virus, similar to myxomatosis in rabbits.","Numbers of native red squirrels have been rapidly dwindling in the country .

"Hillary Clinton ended her whirlwind New Hampshire campaign swing on Tuesday afternoon in another state entirely, taking taxpayers for an 80 miles-per-hour ride all the way to Boston – to catch a flight with first class seats. Her Secret Service-provided 'Scooby' van motored from Concord to Boston Logan International Airport, escorted by troopers from both New Hampshire and Massachusetts. She arrived in time to take a 7:00 p.m. US Airways shuttle to Washington, D.C. On the way, her motorcade passed exits to the Manchester, N.H. airport, which was 55 miles closer and offered a 5:16 p.m. flight to the same destination. The Boston flight, though, used a larger aircraft with 12 first class seats. The Manchester flight was scheduled to use a smaller plane with nothing but coach. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . First class: Hillary (seated at the front, right) traveled in luxury from Boston to Washington, seated next to chief of staff Huma Abedin, after a high-speed dash to Logan International Airport . Clinton and her entourage flew on a commercial US Airways Shuttle flight on Tuesday, and the Secret Service took care of the cars at curbside. 'Scooby' is seen next to the Terminal B sign with its side door open . ARRIVAL: Hillary was flanked by her security after she landed at Washington Reagan National Airport near DC, insisting that she hadn't booked the first class tickets herself – but staring ahead wordlessly when asked about the deadly Benghazi terror attack . NEW HAMPSHIRE? No, it's Massachusetts: Mrs. Clinton's motorcade, including her custom conversion van (center, in the distance), arrived just before 4:15 p.m. at Boston Logan International Airport . SLICK: Just a day earlier, Clinton's motorcade zipped along wet New Hampshire roads at 92 mph so she could make a dinner party on time . Clinton told Daily Mail Online when she reached Washington and was asked why her security detail drove the extra miles at taxpayer expense: 'You know, I don't make the travel arrangements. I don't.' She went silent, however, when asked if she would be ready soon to address public concerns about her performance as secretary of state before and after the 2012 terror attack that claimed four lives in Benghazi, Libya. Asked if she had made mistakes in the legacy-tarnishing episode, Clinton stared straight ahead, continued walking alongside her Secret Service escort, and said nothing. In New Hampshire, she had spent much of her time railing against America's richest '1 per cent,' but ultimately took the priciest seat to Washington that she could buy without chartering a private plane. During her trip she said of the wealthy: 'The deck is stacked in their favor. My job is to reshuffle the cards.' According to The New York Times, she spoke to a group of economists earlier this year about 'toppling' the country's financial elites if she were elected president. KISS THE RING: Hillary Clinton met Tuesday with  Mary Louise Hancock, the grand dame of New Hampshire liberal politics and a woman who wields enormous grassroots organizing power in the Granite State . After a carefully stage-managed morning event at a community college near the state capitol, Clinton held two private meetings, and then bolted to Boston at speeds 25 mph over the limit posted along portions of Interstate 93. At least the roads were dry. Less than 24 hours earlier, her Secret Service drivers led reporters on a 92-mph race through New Hampshire on a rain-slicked freeway so Mrs. Clinton could arrive at a dinner event by 7:00 p.m. The Airbus 319 series aircraft took Clinton and her closest aide Huma Abedin back to Washington in comfort. The two women had the very front seats on the flight. A Massachusetts state trooper and a Secret Service agent greeted passengers on the jetway, providing the first hint that there was a VIP on board. Clinton's choice to fly out of Boston instead of Manchester could anger southern New Hampshire voters who tire of being told they are little more than a Boston exurb. There is no meaningful Massachusetts presidential primary election. SCOOBY! Clinton's ubiquitous van left Hancock's home Tuesday afternoon en route to the New Hampshire Democratic Party headquarters . FAREWELL: Hillary Clinton waves at the end of her final campaign stop in New Hampshire, before hitting the road to Boston at speeds of up to 80mph . LAST STOP: Clinton's hopeful New Hampshire trip ended not with a nod to everyday Americans, but with a bow to Democratic Party insiders at the NHDP headquarters . Clinton's first afternoon meeting came at the home of Mary Louise Hancock, the 95-year-old grand dame of New Hampshire Democratic politics. The significance of the get-together is real: Democrats seeking any major office in the Granite State have sought her counsel and kissed her ring for decades. Her second meeting was an hours-long affair at the New Hampshire Democratic Party headquarters, which hosted her while a crowd of reporters and photographers waited in vain for her to answer questions. While still more journalists lay in wait under the shadow of the state Capitol dome, Clinton's entourage went the other way, southward, boxing out motorists who tried to share their chosen slice of the road. It's not clear who drove Scooby and its two companion SUVs away from the Boston airport. All three vehicles were still curbside 45 minutes after Clinton arrived.

"Joanna Goodall (pictured outside court) stole £19,000 from the Premier Inn hotel where she worked as a receptionist . A receptionist who stole £19,000 from the hotel she worked at has been told to pay back just £1. Joanna Goodall forged signatures of customers and colleagues for cash refunds at a Premier Inn in Newcastle and took the money for herself. Bosses noticed the high level of refunds and CCTV showed Goodall taking money from the till. The 30-year-old mother, who is pregnant, admitted the thefts between March 2013 and February 2014 at Newcastle Crown Court. Goodall, of Lemington in Newcastle, was given a nine-month suspended sentence but ordered to pay back just £1 under the Proceeds of Crime Act as she has no assets. Mr Recorder Wheeler told her: 'You have a number of personal issues, family issues and health issues. 'You were subject to a lot of stress as a result of other people leaning on you for support and trying to balance your life and keep everyone happy. The way you chose to do that ultimately was to steal from your employer.' Prosecutors had initially accused her of stealing £35,000, but accepted her guilty plea on the basis of the amount being around £19,000. Jonathan Devlin, prosecuting, said: 'This defendant was identified as creating false cash refunds. 'She had used cash refund receipts with forged signatures from customers and other members of staff involved in such refunds. 'She submitted them and took appropriate amounts of cash from the till. 'All available CCTV was viewed and she was seen on a number of occasions processing refunds with no customers present, taking money from the till and either putting it in her pocket or handbag.' Mr Devlin said: 'She was arrested by the police and accepted the theft of significant sums of money. 'She said no other employees were involved nor did they know what she was doing. 'The defendant said she knew there was no way it could have been repaid because of the way she disguised it.' Donald MacFaul, defending, said Goodall had worked for the company for seven years. He added: 'Things went awry in her life. In addition to emotional pressure, financial strain arose and she fell into temptation. 'She realised early on she would be found out but couldn't see a way to break the cycle. She still has outstanding debts.'

"The lingerie model whose sexy pregnancy selfies turned her into an overnight internet sensation has already snapped the first photo of her trimmed and toned post-baby physique in 'granny panties' - just four days after giving birth to her son. Sarah Stage, a 30-year-old from Los Angeles, came under fire during her pregnancy for posting a string of selfies showing off her seemingly rock-hard abs, with some critics claiming that maintaining such a tiny figure could be damaging to her unborn child. But her son James Hunter was born at a healthy eight pounds and seven ounces last Tuesday. And only days after welcoming her son into the world, Sarah donned black bikini briefs and a patterned bra for her latest snaphsot, which she shared on Sunday with her 1.6 million Instagram followers. Scroll down for video . Proud mama: Underwear model and animal rights activist Sarah Stage shared this picture of her post-baby body on her Instagram account on Sunday - just four days after giving birth to her son James Hunter . Ready to go: The 30-year-old revealed that she gained 28lbs during her pregnancy, before noting that she was looking forward to getting back to the gym . '[Four] days post baby. Total pregnancy weight gain was 28 pounds. I'm excited to resume my workouts in [five] weeks! #JamesHunter #HealthyBaby #GrannyPanties,' captioned the picture, highlighting her weight gain, which fell within the 25 to 35lbs range that doctors doctors recommend for average-weight women. The image has earned more than 40,000 likes since it was posted, with many commenting on her post-baby body and her healthy son. 'Proud of you hot momma. You put the critics to rest. You look fabulous and have a handsome baby,' one person wrote, while another added: 'Holy moly! What a legend! The baby's weight puts all the critics to rest.' Over the weekend, Sarah also posted a heartwarming photo of herself wearing a long-sleeve floral romper as she cradled her newborn in his nursery, writing: 'So happy #JamesHunter.' Look of love: Sarah gazed adoringly at her newborn son in this photo she posted on Saturday . So precious: Sarah shared this adorable picture of her newborn baby, James Hunter, on Instagram . Meanwhile, the first pictures of her baby boy were released last week. Sarah shared the adorable snapshots on her Instagram page. One, which shows a close-up of her son's face, said: 'Love at first sight #jameshunter.' The first ever picture of James featured the newborn in an adorable fox outfit. Sarah commented on the photo: 'James Hunter (4/14/15) 8.7lbs/22 inches of HEALTHY baby! 'Thank you for the positive support throughout my journey... It's just beginning!!! #JamesHunter #Healthy' During her pregnancy many people commented that they felt Sarah's unusually trim figure could be damaging to her unborn child, but it seems their fears were unfounded. Baby bump: Sarah took her last pregnancy selfie (pictured) at 39 weeks on April 13, writing: 'Still waiting'. The 30-year-old gave birth James the next day . Baby boy: Sarah posted this precious picture of James to her Instagram on Friday commenting that it was 'love at first sight' Sarah confirmed to E! that she welcomed her son last Tuesday, revealing that her baby boy was  22 inches long at the time of his birth, adding: 'He's a big healthy boy and he got an APGAR score of eight to nine.' An APGAR score, which stands for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration, is a quick method for assessing the health of a newborn, with scores of seven or above being considered normal. Sarah famously documented her changing figure via her Instagram page throughout her pregnancy, earning herself a huge number of fans - as well as a fair share of critics - in the process. Although the new mother came under fire last month as more and more critics spoke out against toned figure, their comments never stopped the model from sharing numerous photos of her toned abs. Nap time: In this gorgeous snap, James is seen sleeping in a giraffe costume . Last Tuesday Sarah shared a photo of two In-N-Out burgers, writing, 'Cravings,' although its not clear as to whether or not she enjoyed the meal before or after she gave birth. The lingerie-clad model snapped her last pregnancy selfie, which she captioned: 'Still waiting #9months [sic],' the day before she welcomed her son into the world. The snapshot of her in a black bra and thong underwear has been liked over 40,000 times since it was posted, and has earned nearly 4,000 comments. And Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent, took to Instagram earlier this month to share a photo of growing belly during the last weeks of her of pregnancy, writing: '10 days until we meet #BabyJames.' But while a large number of comments made about Sarah's figure were critical, many women noted that they found Sarah's pregnancy body to be motivation to work out and live a healthy lifestyle. Model off duty: Sarah took plenty of selfies in her underwear throughout her pregnancy; here she posed at 37 weeks on March 27 . Haters gonna hate: Sarah, who came under fire for her being tiny and toned throughout her pregnancy, told her critics to unfollow her if they have a problem with her pictures . Toned physique: Sarah snapped this photo of herself flaunting her barely-there baby bump at 38 weeks on April 6 - 10 days before she was supposed to give birth to her son . 'I'm completely inspired to go to the gym first thing in the morning. You look absolutely gorgeous @sarahstage #amazing [sic],' one fan wrote. 'You look absolutely lovely. Hats off to you for being fit and taking care of yourself!' another added. 'If I ever have children, I'm inspired by you to treat my pregnancy the very same way. I'm sure James will be amazing! Congratulations.' Others compared their figures to Sarah's pregnancy body, with one woman writing: '10 days before giving birth?! Lord Jesus help us all! I look like this after dinner [sic].' 'I look like that after a good meal or two,' someone else commented. Meanwhile, some people suggested that her son would be as tiny as she is - although it has since been proved that there was no need to worry. Pregnancy pals: Sarah, then at 36 weeks, and her friend, at 39 weeks, compared their growing bellies for this playful picture on March 22 . Baby style: Sarah shared this cute photo of matching father and son Timberland boots before the birth of her son . 'Baby James will come out the size of her phone case,' one person commented, referencing the model's bear-shaped cell phone cover. When she's not sharing lingerie selfies, the new mother regularly shared pictures of her son's nursery and his future wardrobe. Last week, Sarah shared an adorable photo of matching father and baby sized Timberland boots, writing: 'Daddy & baby shoe game [sic].' And despite her critics, Sarah refused to hide her then-eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes. Flaunt it: Sarah refused to wear baggy clothes during her pregnancy and instead opts for figure-hugging dresses like the one she wore in this picture on March 28 . Looking good: Sarah wore this sexy black dress on a 'date night' when she was 37 weeks pregnant on March 31, just two weeks before James was born . She shunned baggy dresses and instead dressed her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and often captures photos of herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa, spinach and chicken. Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah continued to proudly model whilst carrying. Two weeks ago, she shared a sexy snapshot of herself in black underwear and responded to her haters. 'BTW If you don't like my pics then unfollow me,' she wrote. 'I'm excited, happy and enjoying every second of my pregnancy. Can't wait to meet James! #NFG #37weeks [sic].'","Sarah Stage, 30, welcomed son James Hunter into the world last Tuesday .

"An investigator has blamed sexism, including pornography sold at base stores, for the attitudes that led to Army members joining  British bikini models for a photo shoot. One Utah National Guard officer was sacked and three other soldiers have been disciplined for their involvement with Hot Shots 2015, where military vehicles became props for the group's risque calendar and 'behind-the-scenes' video. 'Too many Soldiers don't see a calendar shoot of this nature as something that isn't in harmony with our values,' the investigator wrote of the event at Camp Williams, outside of Salt Lake City. Scroll down for video . Risque: A investigator blamed a sexist culture and pornography for the mindset that led a Utah National Guard officer to allow British bikini models to use a military base and equipment . Cover up: The Army Times saw emails where members of the 19th Special Forces talked about removing references to their involvement and blamed 'uptight Mormons' for outrage of their time with the models . 'I don't believe this simply [was] a matter of a bunch of 'uptight Mormons' being upset over a video,' the official said, according to the Army Times. The unnamed investigator said he hoped the Utah National Guard recommended the removal of pornography and other media 'that promote sexist behavior and objectify women or men' from military stores. The Army Times also uncovered attempts by the Special Forces unit involved in the shoot to remove names and reference to their unit from Hot Shot material. I didn't think it was that bad, not bad enough to hunt for blood,' one email in the group read. 'What can I say. On a personal level … awesome! Professionally… Hmmm.,' another said. Three soldiers were disciplined with reprimands last year and forced to pay back the $200 in military fuel that was used for the shoot, which included the British models riding in tanks and firing a range of weapons. The officer who lost his position and was forced into early retirement was a 19th Special Forces non-commissioned officer, typically a colonel or a sergeant. Though not authorized to do so, he  approved soldier's participation in the four-day shoot last May, where models used the space where special forces do drills to set up their makeup and hair stations. Equipment:Two police officers (left) were also disciplined after participating in a day of the calendar video. Military equipment include a tank, an armored truck and a helicopter were all used during the five day shoot . On the third day of the shoot a soldier brought the models a tank to pose with despite not having orders to do so, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. One soldier was blamed for letting an untrained model drive an ATV while he rode as a passenger . National Guard members also helped the scantily-clad women gain access to a Cobra helicopter and a mine-resistant armored truck. After the video surfaced in October, the soldiers face charges of discrediting the Guard, dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming an officer, and the sale, waste or destruction of military property. The three soldiers who sought permission from their senior officers were given disciplines ranging from reprimands to counseling. The National Guardsmen did not drink and did not get any compensation for participating, the investigator found. In addition to the time spent at the Tickville Training Area Compound, the models also spent a day at a private shooting range. Two Utah police officers who helped out at the range were also suspended without pay. Repercussions: One non-commissioned National Guard officer lost his position and three others were reprimanded for their involvement. Models used drill space to set up hair and makeup stations . Apology: The Utah National guard said in a statement that it regretted its involvement in the shoot and would not tolerate the unauthorized use of federal and state funds. Soldiers were made to pay back $200 in fuel . The Utah Department of Public Safety imposed the discipline in December on Rob Wilkinson, a Utah Highway Patrol sergeant, and Justin Hansen, a State Bureau of Investigation agent. The department released its discipline records last week after receiving a request to obtain them. Wilkinson, who received a three-day suspension, and Hansen, who received a one-day suspension, were at the Big Shot Ranch near Grantsville in June. The two men were seen wearing camouflage uniforms identifying them as police in the video, posted on YouTube in October. Neither Wilkinson nor Hansen sought their superiors' permission to participate, and superiors learned of the activity only when they saw video clips played by the news media in Utah, according to the records. An acquaintance asked the two to help supervise the firing line where the models shot at targets, according to an internal affairs report. The report also notes Hot Shots purports to donate a portion of its proceeds to charities for wounded soldiers in the US and UK.","Investigator recommends removing pornography from Army base stores .

The specialised 77 Brigade, launched with great fanfare in January in response to the jihadis’ mastery of online propaganda, is in disarray after failing to enlist the right personnel. Earlier this year, it was widely reported that the brigade would be made up of 2,000 social media and psychological warfare exponents who would enable UK forces to fight wars ‘in the information age’. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that even when fully operational, the brigade will number just 454 regular and reservist troops. And in a letter to his troops, the brigade’s commander says he has failed to recruit enough ‘talent’ to challenge IS’s ascendency online. The British Army is struggling to recruit enough technical experts for a secretive psychological warfare unit intended to combat Islamic State’s domination of the internet and social media (stock image above) Brigadier Alastair Aitken says he needs computer whizzkids skilled in ‘social media, financial operations and counter-criminality’ but admits that civilians with the relevant experience are not natural recruits for the Army. The role of these keyboard warriors was expected to include covertly leaking messages about British successes to the enemy, via platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and contacting jihadis directly to spread false information. Brigadier Aitken’s letter adds: ‘We are potentially not attracting the broadest range of talent from across the nation. ‘Capacities such as social media, financial operations and counter-criminality will need an increased diversity of talent, opinions, skills and viewpoints. Members of ISIS regularly post on social media and just two days ago French television network TV5Monde was hacked by individuals claiming to belong to the  group . ‘We may need to redesign our terms and conditions of service to attract those that have these skills.’ The letter suggests some reservist troops will lose their posts in 77 Brigade, while many soldiers do not know what roles they will be assigned. Sources say this has led to a ‘mutinous atmosphere’ at the brigade’s HQ – Denison Barracks in Hermitage, Berkshire. Last night, the Ministry of Defence said reservists who lost their posts in 77 Brigade will be offered alternative roles.","Team needed to help decrease Islamic State's domination of the internet .

Just friends: The newlyweds enjoy a romantic dinner in Puerto Rico during their honeymoon, but things soon get awkward when they run out of things to talk about . And while Ryan enjoys taking in his pretty wife's bikini body, he admits he is growing increasingly irritated with her insistence on calling him 'dude' and 'bro' when they are supposed to be acting like a married couple. Jaclyn, who was single for seven years before saying 'I do', is struggling with how she should treat her husband, who she feels is a total stranger to her. 'We've only know each other for four days. This is uncomfortable,' Jaclyn says in a preview of Tuesday night’s episode.

"Some breakfast cereals contain as many as three teaspoons of sugar, dentist Dr Sameer Patel warns . A busy working week can take its toll on our lives, leaving little time to plan our meals. From breakfast at the desk to the mid-afternoon slump, the temptation to take short cuts and grab the nearest pick me up is too much to resist. With so many products claiming to be 'healthy', it can be a real struggle to know what to pick from the shelves of your nearest high street shop. And lurking inside many seemingly 'healthy' foods, are hidden ingredients that may be wreaking havoc with your teeth. Now, Dr Sameer Patel, clinical director at the Elleven practice in London's Harley Street, has highlighted the dentistry dangers of the 'desk diet'. Here, he reveals the biggest offenders, and offers advice on how to safeguard your oral health during the working day. BREAKFAST . Dental Danger . Some breakfast cereals can contain as much as three teaspoons of sugar per serving – this is around two and a half chocolate biscuits. Inconsistent labelling means that even the 'healthier' brands can also be culprits and choices such as muesli can be surprisingly high in sugars. Solution . There is a way around this. Opt for low sugar options such as wheat biscuits or unsweetened porridge oats and if you need something to sweeten the taste go for honey or crunchy fruit. Eating your cereal with dairy products can also counteract the damage caused by sugar and have added benefits for your oral health. The calcium, phosphates and vitamin D in milk provides important minerals which can help improve the health of your teeth by strengthening and de-mineralising their structure. Probiotic yoghurt can also help decrease bad bacteria in the mouth which in turn limits tooth decay and helps to promote a healthy mouth environment. HOT DRINKS . Dental Danger . Coffee and tea are notorious for staining in between teeth and if drunk regularly, the staining, tannin compounds can build up and cause teeth to turn yellow. Regular consumption can also lead to bad breath, which is down to mouth dehydration. Caffeine is a diuretic and therefore dries out the mouth, counteracting the internal rinsing that normally occurs and causing bacteria to multiply. Solution . 'The best way to avoid this is to rinse the mouth with water after consumption, to wash away the tannins and rehydrate the mouth. A good alternative to your morning tea or coffee, is caffeine-free green tea. Tea and coffee are notorious for staining the teeth, and if drunk regularly, can cause a person's teeth to turn yellow . 'Water also contains the mineral fluoride which makes teeth more resilient to acid erosion and decay. 'Alternatively you could swap your tea or coffee for caffeine-free herbal tea or green tea – which contains polyphenols, that research has found can slow the growth of bacteria associated with cavities and gum disease and has the potential to clean plaque from the teeth.' SANDWICHES . Dental Danger . A lot of supermarket sandwiches have added sugar to enhance flavour, and refined carbohydrates such as white bread can contribute to dental decay, because they contain simple sugars that dissolve quickly. When consumed, a surge of acid takes place inside the mouth and over long periods this acid can erode tooth enamel. These foods also take on a gummy consistency when chewed that can allow small particles to get trapped between teeth and make them extremely tough to budge. Solution . Wholewheat bread is a healthier choice for your teeth and some studies have shown that people who consume high amounts of whole grain have a lower instance of gum disease. White bread can contribute to dental decay, because it contains simple sugars that dissolve quickly. Dr Patel said wholewheat bread is a healthier choice for your teeth, with studies suggesting those who eat a large number of whole grains have a lower instance of gum disease . Whole grains are also rich in vitamins and minerals which serve to strengthen our teeth and keep our oral health in check. Adding a cheese or chicken filling is recommended as these calcium and phosphorus rich foods are thought to protect and strengthen teeth. COLD DRINKS . Dental Danger . For those who enjoy making breakfast smoothies and juices – beware. Although fruit is considered to contain healthy acids, this is only the case when they are consumed as a whole, rather than as a concentrated juice. When fruit is juiced or blended, the sugars are released from the structure of the fruit and if drunk frequently can lead to decay. Juices also tend to have a high acid content which can severely damage the enamel of your teeth in a similar way to fizzy drinks. Solution . Ultimately, the best drink for your teeth is fluoride water. Calcium-rich dairy and soya milk which can strengthen our teeth and counteract the damage caused by acidic juices, are also an advisable choice. Good saliva flow is important in creating an alkaline environment in the mouth, thereby protecting teeth from exposure to acid - chewing gum regularly can aid this process. However, if you really can't bear to give up fruit juice, drink it through a straw to limit the damage to your teeth. Beware the breakfast smoothie, warns Dr Patel. He said when fruit is juiced or blended, sugars are released from the structure of the fruit, causing decay. And he added, popcorn is one desk snack that is particularly bad for your teeth, often containing high sugar levels and unpopped kernels  are notorious for cracking teeth . DESK SNACKS . Dental Danger . Low calorie snacks such as dried fruit and popcorn are growing increasingly popular, but neither are good for your oral health. Despite the sugars in fruit being natural, when they make their way into your mouth, there is no difference between the sugars from fruit and the sugars from chocolate or sweets. Sugars found in raisins and dried apricots are highly concentrated by the drying and their chewy texture means they linger in the mouth, causing prolonged damage to teeth. Similarly popcorn creates lactic acid in your mouth, an offender when it comes to eroding tooth enamel, and the unpopped kernels are notorious for cracking teeth and damaging fillings. Solution . Firm/crunchy fruits (for example, apples and pears) are a sensible alternative as these foods have a high water content, which dilutes the effects of the sugars they contain. Regular flossing as part of your daily routine is also an integral way to remove trapped food and prevent a build-up of plaque, whilst keeping mouthwash and chewing gum to hand can help fight dental decay.","Dentist Dr Sameer Patel highlights the dental dangers of your desk diet .

"The head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Michele Leonhart, is expected to resign soon, an Obama administration official said Tuesday. Leonhart is a career drug agent who has led the agency since 2007 and is the second woman to hold the job. She has faced mounting pressure from Congress, where some questioned her competence in the wake of a scathing government watchdog report detailing allegations that agents attended sex parties with prostitutes. DEA head Michele Leonhart, is expected to resign soon, an Obama administration official said Tuesday, as she faces mounting criticism from Congress that she's been unable to change the agency's culture . Leonhart was widely criticized for her response to the report and a group of lawmakers said in a statement that she was 'woefully unable to change' the agency's culture. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because a formal announcement had not yet been made. Lawmakers have been pushing for Leonhart's ouster since her disastrous appearance before the House Oversight Committee last week. A majority of the committee said they had lost confidence in her and said she 'lacks the authority and will to make the tough decisions required to hold those accountable who compromise national security and bring disgrace to their positions.' The Justice Department report that jeopardized Leonhart's job recounted allegations that drug agents attended sex parties with prostitutes, some funded by local drug cartels, in a foreign country. The DEA said the incidents happened in Colombia. Several Congressional members have criticized Leonhart's competence in the wake of a government watchdog report detailing allegations that agents attended sex parties with prostitutes . The no-confidence statement was signed by 13 House Democrats and nine Republicans, including Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah and the committee's top Democrat. Chaffetz went a step further, calling for Leonhart to resign or be fired. Last week, the White House voiced concerns about the Justice Department report. In a daily press briefing Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest wouldn't comment on reports that Leonhart was set to leave the agency and instead reiterated that the Obama administration had 'concerns about the material that was presented in the (inspector general) report that raised legitimate and serious questions about the conduct of some DEA officers. 'The president, as you know, maintains a very high standard for anybody who serves in his administration, particularly when it comes to law enforcement officials. And the I.G. report raised serious concerns about that conduct,' Earnest said. Leonhart has previously been the target of online petitions calling for her ouster after she distanced herself from the administration's stance on legalized marijuana, seen as a hands-off approach that lets states legalize marijuana so long as it is state regulated. In an email sent to employees last Friday, Leonhart lamented agent's 'disgraceful conduct' Marijuana remains illegal under federal law and is classified by the DEA as a Schedule 1 drug, along with drugs such as heroin and peyote. Leonhart also declined to fully endorse sentencing reform efforts supported by the Justice Department. CNN reports that Leonart sent an email to employees last Friday lamenting the recent scandals. 'This has been a very difficult week for DEA, with members of Congress and the media asking tough questions and sharing our outrage about the disgraceful conduct of a few individuals several years ago.' she wrote. 'This employee misconduct has upset me for many reasons, but especially because it calls into question the incredible reputation DEA has built over more than 40 years.' She ended the email thanking employees 'for your continued expressions of trust and confidence as we navigate through these rough waters. I know you will remain focused on our mission and the commitment to excellence that is the hallmark of who we are, and what we will always be at DEA.'","DEA head Michele Leonhart is expected to resign soon, an Obama administration official said Tuesday .

"A New York detective has been suspended after being accused of robbing a store while colleagues were arresting workers for selling illegal cigarettes. The manager of the deli in Brooklyn said Detective Ian Cyrus, who has been suspended without pay, was caught on camera stealing cash. His supervisor has been placed on desk duty. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: On viewing the CCTV security cameras, the store manager said he saw one of the detectives finding the rent money box under the counter, and Detective Ian Cyrus grabbing a handful of it . Mr Abdullah said Detective Ian Cyrus then bends down and when he stands up, he appears to put the money in his coat pocket . Five New York Police Department (NYPD) detectives went to the Brooklyn store on Friday April 3 and arrested two employees accused of selling untaxed cigarettes, according to ABC7 Eyewitness News. Officers reportedly took money from the cash register and packs of cigarettes as evidence. Manager Ali Abdullah, who was not in the shop at the time, was given a receipt from the police the following day saying $593 had been seized, but he realised $2,650 in store rent money was missing. On viewing the CCTV security cameras, he said Detective Cyrus grabbed a handful of cash from the rent money box under the counter. Mr Abdullah said the detective then bends down and when he stands up, he appears to put the money in his coat pocket. 'I look at my system, I see the officer took the money,' Mr Abdullah told the news channel. 'It's crazy.' He said he called a nearby police department, who sent a supervisor to look at the video. Mr Abdullah claims the supervisor said: 'He's going to lose his pension, lose his life, for $2,600?' NYPD Deputy Commissioner Stephen Davis told MailOnline: 'Based on the nature of the allegations in this incident, in addition to the video provided to us, the NYPD has placed one detective on suspension and one supervisor on modified assignment status pending further investigation into the matter.

"An Iowa lottery worker is accused of manipulating the system to try and collect a $14.3million payday. Eddie Raymond Tipton, 51, of Norwalk, Iowa, was originally charged with two felony counts of fraud when he was arrested in January for illegally playing the lottery and having a friend collect his prize, but now prosecutors say he used an intricate system to make sure he would win. They argue he installed a self-destructing hack program to make sure the Random Number Generator selected his number in December 2010, and that he tampered with security cameras in the building so he would not be caught installing the program. Scroll down for video . Eddie Raymond Tipton (above) of Norwalk, Iowa was charged with two felony counts of fraud for illegally playing the lottery . Now prosecutors believe the Iowa lottery worker used an intricate hack to ensure his numbers were drawn by the system . 'There is sufficient evidence for a jury to reasonably conclude from the evidence that Defendant tampered with lottery equipment,' prosecutors wrote in their filing according to Lottery Post. His trial had been due to start Monday but defense lawyers asked for it to be delayed to they could examine the new evidence. Authorities had been trying to identify the winner of the $14.3 million Hot Lotto ticket since a New York lawyer tried to claim the prize shortly before the one-year deadline in 2011. When attorney Crawford Shaw tried to claim the jackpot with the winning ticket in his hands, lottery officials confirmed the ticket was valid, but they refused to pay because Shaw wouldn't name anyone involved with the purchase and handling of the ticket. He later withdrew the claim and said he didn't know the winner's identity. Then, authorities released a convenience store video in October which purported to show the mystery winner, in an attempt to help identify him, at which point a former co-worker of Tipton's subsequently contacted authorities and tipped them off. Detectives then analyzed the ticket purchaser's voice in the video and matched a license plate in the parking lot of the convenience store to Tipton. Authorities say Tipton contacted two men in Texas asking for help to claim the jackpot anonymously. It was only after he was arrested that police began to look  into whether or not he had tampered with any equipment, at which point they claim it became clear he had used his computer skills to make certain he won. Tipton reportedly told a coworker he had created a root kit shortly before he won the lottery, a self-destructing program that can do anything and then disappear without a trace. As for why he is never seen on the security camera installing this kit, prosecutors claim the cameras were programmed to change the way they record that day, and that Tipton was one of five people that could do this. Furthermore, the four other individuals will testify they did not manipulate the security cameras. Tipton's lawyer has said all these claims are impossible, and that his client did not hack the system. Robert Clark Rhodes, who tried to claim the ticket, was arrested in March and also charged with two counts of fraud.","Eddie Raymond Tipton of Norwalk, Iowa was charged with two felony counts of fraud for illegally playing the lottery .
